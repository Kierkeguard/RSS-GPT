<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li>The index will consist of 111 stocks following the additions of Cox, Inmocemento, Inmobiliaria del Sur and Lingotes Especiales, and the exits of Arima Real Estate, Prisa and Soltec</li>
<li>The Management Committee creates a new sub-sector index called IGBM Water &amp; Other, under the Oil &amp; Energy sector, which will include Cox</li>
</ul>
<p>The Management Committee of the Madrid Stock Exchange General Index (IGBM) has decided at the ordinary review meeting of the Index that both the IGBM and the Total Index will consist of 111 listed companies in the first half of 2025, following the additions of&nbsp;<span>Cox, Inmocemento&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;Inmobiliaria del Sur</span>&nbsp;and the exits of&nbsp;<span>Arima Real Estate, Prisa&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;Soltec</span>.</p>
<p>Cox, which went public on November 15, and Inmocemento, which did the same on November 12, meet the requirements to belong to the index, as do Inmobiliaria del Sur and Lingotes Especiales. Arima Real Estate was removed from the index due to the takeover bid made by JSS Real Estate SOCIMI and the positive outcome of the takeover bid, while Prisa does not meet the requirements for index membership and Soltec has been suspended from trading by the CNMV since September 26.</p>
<p>In addition, the Management Committee has approved the creation of a new sub-sector index called IGBM Water and Others, under the Oil and Energy sector, which will include Cox.</p>
<p>The final weightings of sectors, sub-sectors and securities will be published in the Madrid Stock Exchange&rsquo;s Official Daily Bulletin on June 28th &nbsp;2024, which can be accessed via&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bolsasymercados.es/bme-exchange/en/Prices-and-Markets/Statistics/Trading-Bulletin-Madrid">this link</a>.</p>

<p>After a subdued previous year, equity turnover on the Vienna Stock Exchange rose noticeably in 2024. The Austrian benchmark index including dividends reached a new all-time high. Measured by the number of new debt listings, the record year 2023 was once again clearly surpassed. With&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wienerborse.at/en/news/vienna-stock-exchange-news/mwb-new-in-direct-market-plus/" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">MWB AG</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wienerborse.at/en/news/vienna-stock-exchange-news/reguest-new-in-direct-market-plus/" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">ReGuest S.p.A.</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wienerborse.at/en/news/vienna-stock-exchange-news/uko-microshops-new-in-direct-market-plus/" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">UKO Microshops AG</a>, the Vienna Stock Exchange recorded three new additions to the SME segment direct market plus. The Vienna Stock Exchange recently expanded the functionality of its trading system with the introduction of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wienerborse.at/en/news/vienna-stock-exchange-news/midpoint-trading-live/" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">midpoint trading</a>.</p>
<p><a class="has-image" href="https://www.wienerborse.at/uploads/u/cms/images/fotos/presse/infografiken/vienna-stock-exchange-2024.jpg" target="_blank" title="Opens new window"><img alt="Trading on the Vienna Stock Exchange 2024" height="322" src="https://www.wienerborse.at/uploads/u/cms/_processed_/4/8/csm_vienna-stock-exchange-2024_e86d1e2a68.jpg" title="Trading on the Vienna Stock Exchange 2024" width="514" /></a></p>
<p>"With the implementation of midpoint trading and the all-day tradability of Austrian government bonds &ndash; to name just two topics &ndash; we as an infrastructure company have realised important strategic initiatives in the interests of the market participants. The state-of-the-art infrastructure is constantly being adapted to current needs. However, the extent to which it is utilised, in other words how many trains and what loads run on the tracks, depends largely on the political framework conditions," says Christoph Boschan, CEO of the Vienna Stock Exchange, emphasising the need to strengthen the domestic capital market.</p>
<h2>Equity turnover back at a high level after a breather</h2>
<p>For 2024, equity turnover will amount to EUR 64 billion, which means an increase of over 17 % compared to 2023 (EUR 54.48 billion). This development was primarily driven by exceptionally high turnover in the real estate sector in the months from June to September. At EUR 8.1 billion, September was one of the four months with the highest turnover in the last ten years. The three strongest trading days in 2024 were 20 September (EUR 891.5 million), 15 March (EUR 812.8 million) and 21 June (EUR 802.0 million). As of 20 December, the shares with the highest turnover were Erste Group Bank AG (EUR 11.03 billion), OMV AG (EUR 7.66 billion) and CA Immobilien AG (EUR 6.85 billion). Trading in Austrian equities was recently enhanced by a new functionality: The Xetra&reg; T7 trading system now enables midpoint trading. This allows domestic shares to be traded in a separate midpoint order book at a mid-price between the best buy and sell limit.</p>
<h2>Debt listings: Record year 2023 clearly exceeded once again</h2>
<p>The Vienna Stock Exchange remains one of the most active listing venues in Europe in terms of new debt listings. In 2024, a total of over 13,400 bonds were listed in Vienna, more than 4,000 more than in the previous record year of 2023 (8,311). Prominent listings included the first green bond from a European steel company, issued by voestalpine AG (issue volume EUR 500 million). However, a number of international issuers also rely on the Vienna Stock Exchange as a debt listing venue. The Mongolian capital Ulaanbaatar, for example, placed a state-guaranteed bond (USD 500 million) on the market in Vienna. In total, the Vienna Stock Exchange serves 1,100 active bond issuers from 39 countries. There was an innovation for Austrian government bonds in 2024: since March, they have been tradable in continuous auctions, allowing private investors in particular to benefit from increased price quality and transparency.</p>
<h2>ATX Total Return records all-time high</h2>
<p>By 20 December, the ATX Total Return had increased by 9.84% to 8,365.71 points (ATX without dividends: 3,589.54 points; 4.50 %), BAWAG Group AG (65.69%), Erste Group Bank AG (60.31%) and Addiko Bank AG (41.57%) were the top performers in the ATX Prime. The market capitalisation of all companies listed in Vienna was around EUR 124 billion at that time.</p>
<p>"Austrians are still being penalised when it comes to private pension provision. The reintroduction of the retention period for securities and the introduction of a retirement savings account were already on the agenda of the last government. Austria was actually further ahead in this respect years ago than Germany, for example, where a subsidised and tax-privileged retirement savings account is now to be introduced. The capital market offers many solutions to the challenges of our time. Now is the time to act boldly and create the basis for a competitive, innovative and prosperous future," says Boschan. In a recently published open letter, the CEO of the stock exchange and Chairman of the Supervisory Board Heimo Scheuch outline blueprints for strengthening the capital market.</p>
<p>The last trading day of the Vienna Stock Exchange will take place on Monday, 30 December 2024, and will end with an early closing auction at 2:15 pm. The stock exchange year 2024 comprised 254 trading days, in the coming year trading will take place in Vienna on 253 days. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wienerborse.at/en/trading/trading-information/trading-calendar/">trading calendar is available online</a>.</p>

<title>Press Conference By KATO Katsunobu, Japan Minister Of Finance And Minister Of State For Financial Services - Theft From Safe-Deposit Boxes By Former Employee Of Mitsubishi UFJ Bank</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>(Excerpt)</p>
<p>(Tuesday, December 17, 2024, 8:32&nbsp;am to 8:35&nbsp;am)</p>
<dl><dt>Q.</dt><dd>
<p>My question is about the cases of theft from safe-deposit boxes by a former employee of Mitsubishi UFJ Bank, Ltd. Yesterday, the bank held a press conference and apologized for the cases. The bank's president announced that the bank will consider dispositions for relevant executives. What response measures does the Financial Services Agency (FSA) expect the bank to take? Could you explain what the FSA will request from the bank?</p>
</dd><dt class="ans">A.</dt><dd>
<p>As I have mentioned earlier, customers' trust is very important for banks in taking custody of their deposits and property. In that sense, the recent theft cases that occurred at Mitsubishi UFJ Bank are very regrettable.<br />It is important for the bank to take the cases seriously and sincerely respond to victimized customers, and at the same time, to clarify the whole picture of the cases, investigate the causes, and consider recurrence prevention measures based on the found facts. Therefore, yesterday, the FSA requested the bank to report the status of measures taken for victimized customers, analysis of the cause of this incident, and measures to prevent recurrence in the future based on the Banking Act. The FSA will closely watch whether the bank endeavors to consider and take even better measures.</p>
</dd><dt>Q.</dt><dd>
<p>Regarding the same issue, there is a possibility that safe-deposit boxes are used wrongfully, such as for money laundering or tax evasion. Could you explain your view on how to improve the safe-deposit box business itself?</p>
</dd><dt class="ans">A.</dt><dd>
<p>I think that the recent theft cases were caused by inappropriate management of safe-deposit boxes, and I would like banks to strengthen and ensure proper management.<br />Concerning the issue of money laundering or the like, I do not know exactly how such misconduct could be committed by the use of safe-deposit box services. Therefore, I will refrain from making any comments here.</p>

<title>Federal Reserve Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey On Dealer Financing Terms</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms (SCOOS) is a quarterly survey providing information about the availability and terms of credit in securities financing and over-the counter (OTC) derivatives markets. The SCOOS is modeled after the long-established Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, which provides qualitative information about changes in supply and demand for loans to households and businesses at commercial banks. The SCOOS collects qualitative information on credit terms and conditions in securities financing and OTC derivatives markets, which are important conduits for leverage in the financial system. The survey panel for the SCOOS began by including 20 dealers and over time has been expanded. These firms account for almost all of the dealer activity in dollar-denominated securities financing and OTC derivatives markets. The survey is directed to senior credit officers responsible for maintaining a consolidated perspective on the management of credit risks. The HTML links below include the full report; the PDF links include the summary only.</p>

<p>Bursa Malaysia Berhad (&ldquo;Bursa Malaysia&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Exchange&rdquo;) today issued a consultation paper seeking public feedback on the proposed amendments to the Rules of Bursa Malaysia Depository Sdn Bhd (&ldquo;Depository&rdquo;). These amendments aim to facilitate Bursa Malaysia&rsquo;s move towards embracing further digitisation in the issuance of securities account statements to depositors (&ldquo;CDS statements&rdquo;), as part of the Exchange&rsquo;s broader commitment toward environmental sustainability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The amendments propose making CDS statements available through the MyBURSA portal for greater accessibility and convenience for all depositors. Hard copy CDS statements will still be made available, at a fee, or under exceptional circumstances to specified depositors<span>0</span><span style="vertical-align: sub; font-size: 1.5pt; line-height: 109%; font-family: Cambria, serif;">F</span><span style="line-height: 109%; font-size: 13.3333px;"><span color="#000000" face="Calibri, sans-serif" style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><sup>1</sup></span></span>&nbsp;who demonstrate a clear need for such arrangement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, the proposed amendments require all issuers whose securities remain deposited with the Depository to keep their information up to date, and all parties subject to the Depository Rules to provide accurate and complete information to the Depository. These requirements are crucial to ensure the highest standard of data integrity and transparency.</p>
<p>The proposed amendments above are part of the Exchange&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to enhance operational efficiencies and sustainable practices, while ensuring that the Depository Rules remain fit for purpose in serving the needs of investors and stakeholders. </p>

<div>
<p class="component-text">Japan Exchange Group, Inc. and JPX Market Innovation &amp; Research, Inc. have today launched the "JPX Sustainability Information Search Tool (Beta Version)" for Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) listed companies, with the aim of enhancing disclosure of sustainability-related information.<br /><br />This tool enables companies to view, on a single screen, links to information included in publications by Prime Market-listed companies (annual securities reports, integrated reports, websites, etc.) relating to a choice of 38 environmental, social, and governance (ESG) topics. It is intended to make it easier for listed companies to gather relevant information in the process of deciding the content and other aspects of their own sustainability disclosure. Please note that this tool is free to use, but usage is restricted to TSE listed companies. To enable us to gather opinions from users and verify the usefulness of the tool, it will be provided as a beta version for the time being.<br /><br />This tool has been created with the technological assistance of Cierpa &amp; Company, Inc. (Chief Executive Officer: Sugimoto Jun), which provides cloud services to companies to support sustainability information disclosure.

<title>Japan Financial Services Agency: Results Of The Cybersecurity Self-Assessment For Financial Institutions (FY2023)</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/japan-financial-services-agency-results-of-the-cybersecurity-self-assessment-fo-1/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="indent mb0">With cyberattacks increasing, it has become more important to develop cybersecurity management posture and ensure its effectiveness. Given this background, the Financial Services Agency (FSA) and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) developed a tool for conducting a self-assessment of cybersecurity management posture, with which individual financial institutions are to identify their own positions in comparison with other financial institutions and also identify areas of their own challenges. The FSA and the BOJ have been requesting financial institutions to conduct cybersecurity self-assessment (CSSA) using the tool and then providing them with overall results since FY2022. In FY 2022, this initiative was implemented for regional financial institutions. In FY 2023, it was expanded to include insurance companies and securities companies.</p>
<p class="indent mt0">Based on the results of the CSSA conducted in FY2023, the FSA publishes the overview of cybersecurity management posture of regional financial institutions, insurance companies and securities companies, as well as key points for further strengthening cybersecurity management posture.</p>
<p class="indent">For the results of regional financial institutions, please refer to "Bank of Japan's Financial System Report Annex : Results of the Cybersecurity Self-Assessment for Regional Financial Institutions (FY2023)" (Financial System and Bank Examination Department, BOJ; Strategy Development and Management Bureau, FSA), as indicated below.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Due To Evolving Legal Landscape &amp; Changes In The Framework Of Administrative Law, Federal Reserve Board Will Soon Seek Public Comment On Significant Changes To Improve Transparency Of Bank Stress Tests &amp; Reduce Volatility Of Resulting Capital Requirements</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In view of the evolving legal landscape, the Federal Reserve Board will soon seek public comment on significant changes to improve the transparency of its bank stress tests and to reduce the volatility of resulting capital buffer requirements.</p>
<p>The Board's stress test evaluates the resilience of large banks by estimating their losses, revenue, and capital levels under a hypothetical recession scenario that changes each year. Capital acts as a cushion to absorb losses and allows banks to continue lending to households and businesses even during a recession. Since its inception over 15 years ago, large banks in the stress test have more than doubled their capital levels, an increase of more than $1 trillion.</p>
<p>The Board intends to propose changes that include, but are not limited to: disclosing and seeking public comment on all of the models that determine the hypothetical losses and revenue of banks under stress; averaging results over two years to reduce the year-over-year changes in the capital requirements that result from the stress test; and ensuring that the public can comment on the hypothetical scenarios used annually for the test, before the scenarios are finalized. These proposed changes are not designed to materially affect overall capital requirements.</p>
<p>The framework of administrative law has changed significantly in recent years. The Board analyzed the current stress test in view of the evolving legal landscape and determined to modify the test in important respects to improve its resiliency.</p>
<p>The Board will continue its exploratory analysis, which assesses additional risks to the banking system in ways that are separate from the stress test. The analysis would be used to inform bank supervision and financial stability assessments. It will continue to be disclosed in aggregate and not affect bank capital requirements.</p>
<p>For the 2025 stress test, the Board plans to take immediate steps to reduce the volatility of the results and begin to improve model transparency. The Board intends to begin the public comment process on its comprehensive changes to the stress test during the early part of 2025.</p>

<title>US Office Of The Comptroller Of The Currency Issues Cease And Desist Order Against Bank Of America For Bank Secrecy Act Deficiencies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today issued a cease-and-desist order (order) against Bank of America, N.A. (bank) for deficiencies related to its Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and sanctions compliance programs.</p>
<p>The OCC took this action based on violations and unsafe or unsound practices relating to these programs, including a failure to timely file suspicious activity reports and failure to correct a previously identified deficiency related to its Customer Due Diligence processes. The order also identifies deficiencies in the internal controls, governance, independent testing, and training components of the bank&rsquo;s BSA compliance program.</p>
<p>The order requires the bank to take comprehensive corrective actions to enhance its BSA/anti&mdash;money laundering (AML) and sanctions compliance programs, including the hiring of an independent consultant to assess the bank&rsquo;s BSA/AML and sanctions compliance programs and conduct lookback reviews to ensure all suspicious activity was appropriately reported.</p>

<title>I Trust US Crypto More Than European Equity Consolidated Tape - By Kelvin To, Founder And President Of Data Boiler Technologies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I cannot comprehend how the Europe Economics (EE) can <a href="https://www.bayes.city.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/366599/sale-price-information-cass-knowledge.pdf">omit Giovanni Cespa and Thierry Foucault&rsquo;s empirical study</a> in their Pre-trade equities consolidated tape (CT) <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/external-research/europe-economics-pre-trade-equities-final-report.pdf">final report</a> that commissioned by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Stock exchanges optimally restricting access to price information exacerbated the latency gap between Proprietary Products (PPs) and SIP that caused data fragmentation. That final report does not even mention that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has mandated the <i>&ldquo;same manner same methods&rdquo; </i>provision under <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/final/2020/34-90610.pdf">Market Data Infrastructure Rule</a> that recognizes the US Securities Information Processors (SIPs) were not modernized alongside markets evolution and technologies development. Instead, the final report undermines the issue and mis-paints the picture that its statement sounded almost like the Exchanges <i>&ldquo;The SIP has significantly improved its performance over the last 15 years&hellip;&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Experience from the US suggested that Investment Firms, including Self-Aggregators (SAs) and Alternative Trading Systems (ATSs), the equivalent of Multilateral Trading Facilities (MTFs) in Europe, use a mix of the US SIP / CT with selected [7.5 out of 11 most active] proprietary feeds to save cost, rather than connecting to every trading venue. The EE&rsquo;s final report shied away from telling the audience. How an Economist have authority to say <i>&ldquo;never&rdquo;</i> in an engineering topic?! Do they understand that by having a synchronized start-line using <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/time-lock-crypto-puzzle-and-time-capsule-innovations">time-lock cryptography</a> and CTP streaming a lighter feed (i.e. top-of-book or maybe top 5) can overcome the &ldquo;hops&rdquo; in data aggregation to match up with the direct feed that carry full-load of level 3 data with comparable speed? EE said, <i>&ldquo;The consolidated tape can never be fast enough for such use cases&rdquo;</i> is NOT objective. Low-latency CT is totally practical as proven by the High Frequency Trading firms, SAs, ATSs / MTFs.</p>
<p>Economists supposed to understand that CT has to be a reasonable compromise, if not a close substitute, to PPs. It is the ONLY effective way to affect competitive pressures for existing sellers of market data to achieve one of the key regulatory goals. Statements from the EE&rsquo;s final report, such as <i>&ldquo;Concerns remain about the commercial viability and quality of the consolidated tape, particularly whether it can serve as a substitute for current data. There are also technical issues&hellip;&rdquo;</i> sounded like people do not want to step out of their comfort zone to do any hard work or go with LSEG&rsquo;s view that we <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kelvin-to-9125955_agree-to-disagree-on-lsegs-view-on-uk-consolidated-activity-7193989297392214017-T5ls">strongly disagree</a>.&nbsp; The premises or remarks in <a href="https://www.adamantia.paris/post/a-group-of-financial-institutions-assesses-the-viability-of-a-european-consolidated-tape-on-equity">this Adamantia Research post</a> that said <i>"the CT is intended to support use cases that do not require low latency: thus, the CT will not replace existing direct feeds from the trading venues used by professionals for trading applications, or by other venues"</i> is flawed. By fulfilling different needs, CTP business model can be viable, as well as being a non-profit to return any excess profits back to the investment communities.</p>
<p>On a separate note, we are glad that ESMA removes references to the CT Provider (CTP) from the table in Amendments to Table 4 of Annex I of RTS 1 and keeping the &ldquo;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-12/ESMA74-2134169708-7636_MiFIR_Review_Final_Report_on_Equity_transparency.pdf">flags</a>&rdquo; applicable to trading venues and Approved Publication Arrangements (APAs). Good that policy makers recognize the different roles play by CTP vs APAs, and <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/correspondence/portfolio-letter-data-reporting-service-provider.pdf">reminded APAs</a> their operational resiliency, data quality and other compliance requirements. We believe &ldquo;non-core&rdquo; data, taxonomy flags, and other unnecessary nuances to drag the speed would make the equity CT unusable. Also, we welcome the other <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-12/ESMA74-2134169708-7775_MiFIR_Review_Final_Report_on_amendment_of_RTS_2_and_RTS_on_RCB.pdf">non-equity</a> <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-12/ESMA74-2134169708-7577_Final_Report_on_the_amendments_to_certain_technical_standards_for_commodity_derivatives.pdf">reports</a> recently published by ESMA. They are largely in line with their original proposals. Simplifying and streamlining some the nuances with trading venues perimeters and transparency regime should be welcoming by the industry. That being said, the UK FCA is working towards updating their <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/correspondence/portfolio-letter-our-supervisory-strategy-trading-venues-2024.pdf">strategy for trading venues</a> in favor of <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/corporate/sicgo-report-2023-24.pdf">international competitiveness and growth</a>.</p>
<p>Market participants should also keep in mind the following:</p>
<p>(1) values of time sensitive data deteriorate substantially overtime thus requires proper security protection and in synch.</p>
<p>(2) contents (quotes and trades contributions) belong to the content creators (broker-dealers), <a href="https://www.databoiler.com/index_htm_files/DataBoiler%20Copyright%20Licensing.pdf">see</a> <a href="https://www.databoiler.com/index_htm_files/DataBoiler%20Noumenon%20Equity%20Market%20Structure.pdf">our</a> <a href="https://www.databoiler.com/index_htm_files/DataBoiler%20Europe%202024.pdf">whitepapers</a>.</p>
<p>(3) the FCA&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/handbook/handbook-notice-117.pdf">Handbook Notice 117</a> in April 2024 stated that UK would not require that the bond CTP make payments to data providers. The EU is favoring Reasonable Commercial Basis (RCB) to address cost, fairness and other concerns, such as <i>&rdquo;(i) onerous administrative obligations on data users, for example through frequent and detailed requests on the use of data; (ii) ambiguous language in the agreement; (iii) frequent unilateral amendments to the agreement; (iv) general lack of transparency on terms and conditions; (iv) excessive fees; (v) increase of fees through penalties; and (iv) overly burdensome audits.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>(4) The EU decided to ban payment for order flow (PFOF) from 2026 onward, and experience from Singapore and Australia on their ban of PFOF resulted in substantial markets shrink. The EU and UK lacks <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/final/34-51808.pdf">order protection rule</a>, anonymity to NOT report which venues are setting or displaying the EBBO is perturbing. Opening and closing price of the Primary Listing Market versus Most Relevant Market is a controversy. We are reminding the smaller exchanges to fight for their own rights, while we will respect the ESMA, FCA, and NCAs requirements to serve their respective region or countries.</p>
<p>(5) be mindful of lip service where governance control may merely be an advisory committee like the US <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/11/29/2024-27644/joint-industry-plan-order-approving-as-modified-a-national-market-system-plan-regarding-consolidated">CT Plan version two</a> that the SEC recently approved amid everybody knows it is a &ldquo;Toothless Tiger&rdquo;. 2/3 trading venues and 1/3 industry representation in the proposed operating committee of the US <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/market-data-reform-without-ct-plan-kelvin-to/">CT Plan version one</a> is worse than the 50/50 split in the music industry in the 1970S. Does investment firms in the EU and the UK want 100/0 and settle with an advisory committee that trading venues lead CT contenders may offer?!</p>
<p>(6) We believe crypto assets would attract money flow away from traditional asset classes globally under the new US Administration. The UK and the EU have opportunity to use time-lock cryptography to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/improving-trust-amid-race-technologies-kelvin-to-8vxrc/">improve trust</a>, differentiate from the US and grow their markets. It eliminates the problem of where the CT data center is located. In turn, CTP and market participants no longer need to be stuck at pricey overcrowded data centers, but move to cheaper cost locations.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, top data centers in Europe are mostly controlled by the US Elites, there are only a few options remain. Not willing to put up the money and reluctant to do the hard works make the European markets look grim.</p>

<title>Trading Technologies Achieves High Spot In Chartis Buyside Platforms 2024 Rankings - Firm Also Earns “Strong Category Leader” Status For Energy And Equity Trade Surveillance Solutions In New Chartis Market Quadrants Report</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Trading Technologies International, Inc. (TT), a global capital markets technology platform services provider, has earned the number 12 spot in the Chartis Buyside Platforms 2024 ranking of the top 50 providers of buy-side platforms and technology. The report released this month showcases the leading players in financial infrastructure and highlights providers delivering essential services and tools &ndash; including trading networks, market data, prime brokerage services and more &ndash; to buy-side market participants. The ranking, which Chartis called a testament of the &ldquo;commitment to delivering exceptional value and innovation&rdquo; to that community, provides insights into how the companies are shaping the industry with advanced solutions in asset management, risk assessment and operational efficiency.</p>
<p>Separately, in Chartis&rsquo; just-released Market Quadrants report, which provides a detailed evaluation of key providers offering advanced surveillance solutions tailored to the unique needs of the energy and equity markets, TT achieved &ldquo;strong category leader&rdquo; status for both energy and equity trade surveillance solutions. In both categories, TT received a four-star rank for &ldquo;Industry Leading Platform Capabilities.&rdquo; Of particular note, TT earned &ldquo;industry-leading&rdquo; four-star rankings across all measures in the equity surveillance category, including analytics and modeling, pre-trade reporting, post-trade reporting, data infrastructure and database management, and data visualization and ease/speed of access capabilities.</p>
<p>TT CEO Keith Todd said: &ldquo;With a long history of service to the sell side, we have been working diligently to grow our appeal to buy-side market participants, and we&rsquo;re incredibly honored to have earned in short order a number 12 ranking on a cultivated list of the top 50 service providers in the buy-side sector. It&rsquo;s a great accomplishment that our broadening of products, asset classes and services available on the TT&reg; platform &ndash; including our expansion from futures trade surveillance to a powerful multi-asset offering &ndash; are already achieving industry-leading recognition across important measures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Handling over 2.5 billion transactions this year, the TT platform connects to more than 100 global exchanges and liquidity venues across a growing number of asset classes. The platform delivers advanced tools for trade execution and order management, market data solutions, analytics, trade surveillance, risk management and infrastructure services to the world&rsquo;s leading sell-side institutions, buy-side firms and exchanges.</p>
<p>Buy-side participants leverage a wide range of TT tools to meet their trading needs, including a comprehensive suite of advanced execution algorithms, algo design and deployment tools, Autospreader and APIs. Through Abel Noser Solutions, a TT company, market participants employ a wide range of sophisticated transaction cost analysis (TCA) products and services across global equities, foreign exchange, futures, fixed income and options.</p>
<p>In June, the firm launched TT Trade Surveillance, a multi-asset trade surveillance solution combining new multi-asset coverage and dozens of new configurable models to supplement the machine learning-driven models from TT Score, the company&rsquo;s first-generation trade surveillance platform. TT Trade Surveillance provides enhanced trade surveillance capabilities to a wide range of asset classes, including futures, equities, equity options, fixed income and foreign exchange (FX). The system has also recently added a new, innovative way to identify cross-product manipulation, where users can input correlated instruments directly into the user interface to create a single synthetic instrument, and utilize the machine-learning spoofing models to identify patterns of spoofing activity across multiple order books.</p>
<p>With this recognition, TT has now been honored globally and regionally 14&nbsp;times this year for the TT platform, trade surveillance capabilities, algorithmic trading solution, TCA tool, execution management system (EMS), order management system (OMS) and market data services.</p>

<li>The national delinquency rate jumped 29 basis points (bps) in November to 3.74%, its highest level in almost three years, marking six consecutive months of year-over-year increases</li>
<li>While much of November&rsquo;s spike was driven by seasonality, post-hurricane distress, and a late-in-the-month Thanksgiving, delinquencies more broadly continue to rise from recent year lows</li>
<li>Early-, mid- and late-stage defaults all rose in November, with seriously delinquent loans &ndash; 90 or more days past due but not in active foreclosure &ndash; now at the highest level since February 2023</li>
<li>Both foreclosure starts and completions dropped in November and remain well below pre-pandemic levels, leaving 31K fewer loans in active foreclosure than at the same time last year</li>
<li>Prepayment activity fell -25.0% month over month on October&rsquo;s higher interest rates, and remains nearly 30% off last year&rsquo;s levels</li>

<title>Bursa Malaysia Requires Sustainability Reporting Using The IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards - Enhancements Reflect The National Sustainability Reporting Framework</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bursa-malaysia-requires-sustainability-reporting-using-the-ifrs-sustainability-d/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bursa-malaysia-requires-sustainability-reporting-using-the-ifrs-sustainability-d/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad (&ldquo;Bursa Malaysia&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Exchange&rdquo;) today announced enhancements to the sustainability reporting requirements in the MAIN Market and ACE Market Listing Requirements (collectively, &ldquo;Listing Requirements&rdquo;) to align with the National Sustainability Reporting Framework(&ldquo;NSRF&rdquo;)<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>The enhancements to the Listing Requirements seek to foster the use of the IFRS S1 <i>General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information</i> and IFRS S2 <i>Climate-related Disclosures</i> (collectively, the &ldquo;IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards&rdquo;) as the baseline standards for sustainability reporting in Malaysia. These enhancements are designed to improve the transparency and accountability of how listed issuers manage their sustainability-related risks and opportunities (&ldquo;SROs&rdquo;) using a globally recognised standard, ultimately strengthening business resilience and easing the reference and comparability by investors.</p>
<p>Under the enhanced requirements, a listed issuer must prepare its sustainability statement in the annual report (&ldquo;Sustainability Statement&rdquo;) in accordance with the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards. Additionally, the listed issuer must continue to include the following information in its Sustainability Statement:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; metrics and targets that demonstrate the listed issuer&rsquo;s performance and progress of its SROs for the last 3 financial years on a rolling basis, together with a summary of such data in a prescribed format; and</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a statement whether the listed issuer has subjected the Sustainability Statement to internal review by its internal auditor or independent assurance performed in accordance with recognised assurance standards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recognising the varying levels of maturity and readiness among listed issuers, the enhanced requirements will be implemented in stages. Large MAIN Market listed issuers (i.e., those with a market capitalisation of RM2 billion and above) will commence using the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards for annual reporting period on 1 January 2025 onwards, followed by the remaining MAIN&nbsp; Market listed issuers on 1 January 2026 and ACE Market listed corporations on 1 January 2027. Pending full adoption, listed issuers may use the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards with transition reliefs<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;focusing on a climate-first approach for 2 full financial years for the MAIN Market listed issuers and 3 full financial years for the ACE Market listed corporations.</p>
<p>In line with Bursa Malaysia&rsquo;s focus on customer-centricity, an explainer video will be made available by the end of 2024 on MyBURSA at&nbsp; <a href="https://my.bursamalaysia.com/learn/bursa-sustain/explorer/sustainability-reporting-framework-resources">https://my.bursamalaysia.com/learn/</a><a href="https://my.bursamalaysia.com/learn/bursa-sustain/explorer/sustainability-reporting-framework-resources"> </a><a href="https://my.bursamalaysia.com/learn/bursa-sustain/explorer/sustainability-reporting-framework-resources">bursa-sustain/explorer/sustainability-reporting-framework-resources.</a><a href="https://my.bursamalaysia.com/learn/bursa-sustain/explorer/sustainability-reporting-framework-resources"> </a></p>
<p>In addition to these enhancements, the Exchange also introduced amendments that promote shareholder participation in general meetings of listed issuers by requiring inperson or hybrid meetings from 1 March 2025, and strengthen the accountability of listing advisers by requiring them to be named in public documents of listed issuers for a specified period from 2 January 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information on the amended Listing Requirements, please refer to the following webpages:</p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority Seeks Clarity From High Court On Use Of Eligible Investor Certificates In Wholesale Investment Sector</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-seeks-clarity-from-high-court-on-use-of/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-seeks-clarity-from-high-court-on-use-of/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tatai Hokohoko &ndash; has filed a case stated proceeding to seek the Court&rsquo;s determination on legal issues about the use, confirmation, and acceptance, of eligible investor certificates in the wholesale investment sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proceeding follows investigations into the use of eligible investor certificates by various wholesale property developers. These investigations followed the FMA&rsquo;s thematic review of wholesale offers of financial products.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A case stated proceeding is a process by which the FMA can ask the Court for its opinion on a question of law. It is not an action taken against any specific party. The FMA has previously used a case stated proceeding to seek clarity from the Court in relation to CBL. This is the second time the FMA has brought a case stated proceeding.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose of the proceeding is to provide clarity to the market on clause 41 of Schedule 1 of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 and to ensure confident participation in wholesale markets by offerors and eligible investors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The answers from the Court will help to ensure those investors who require the protections provided by the Financial Markets Conduct Act receive those.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Annex</span></p>
<p>The FMA is asking the court&rsquo;s opinion on clause 41 of Schedule 1 of the Financial Markets Conduct Act and the following questions of law:</p>
<ol>
<li>To be valid, does an eligible investor certificate in relation to an offer of financial products need to expressly describe:&nbsp;<ol type="a">
<li>the previous experience that A has in acquiring or disposing of financial products; and</li>
<li>the aspects of A&rsquo;s experience in acquiring or disposing of financial products which they consider would enable them to assess the matters required by cl 41(2)(a)&ndash;(c) for the transaction to which it relates?&nbsp;</li>
</ol></li>
<li>For an offeror to rely on an eligible investor certificate, or otherwise treat an investor as an eligible investor, in respect of the transaction to which it relates, does the offeror need to be satisfied that:&nbsp;<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>the eligible investor certificate is valid; and/or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in the context of an offer of financial products, based on the grounds stated in the certificate, A could make the assessments requirement by cl 41(2)(a)&ndash;(c) in respect of:&nbsp;</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>a financial product of any kind; and</li>
<li>the financial products involved in the transaction to which the certificate relates.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li>If the answer is yes to either (2)(a) or (b), is an offeror permitted to rely on information which is not contained in the eligible investor certificate to undertake either assessment?</li>
<li>If an offeror makes an offer of financial products to A in circumstances where it is not permitted to rely on A&rsquo;s eligible investor certificate, is disclosure required to be given to A under Part 3 of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013?</li>
</ol>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority: Westpac Admits To Misleading Representations That Resulted In $6.35m In Overcharges</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-westpac-admits-to-misleading-representa/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Westpac New Zealand Limited has admitted to misleading customers entitled to advertised discounts as well as overcharging some of its business customers.</p>
<p>Westpac made the admissions in civil proceedings brought by the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; at the High Court in Auckland. Westpac&rsquo;s breaches of the fair dealing provisions under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (FMCA) affected a total of 24,621 customers and resulted in $6.35m in overcharges.</p>
<p>Westpac admitted having made misrepresentations in respect of the following historic issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customers entitled to various benefits under Westpac&rsquo;s Employee, Gold and Platinum (EGP) packages failed to receive the advertised discounts</li>
<li>Personal and business banking customers failed to receive benefits under one of Westpac&rsquo;s other advertised packaged arrangements</li>
<li>Westpac failed to honour agreed pricing for business customers who held a &ldquo;Business Transact Account&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>EGP packages issue&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Each of the packages offered a range of discounts and preferential rates across Westpac&rsquo;s banking services. When a customer entered into a package agreement, Westpac staff had to manually record a note in the customer&rsquo;s file to confirm their eligibility for the package benefits.</p>
<p>When eligible customers subsequently acquired other products or services from the bank, Westpac had no process for staff to check whether the customer was eligible for package benefits on the subsequent products and services. There was no guidance for employees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the event, Westpac frequently overlooked the point; in turn up to 31% of eligible customers were overcharged. The overcharges were recorded in customers&rsquo; account statements (for account and card benefits) and/or their policy schedules and annual renewal letters (for insurance benefits).</p>
<p>In each case misleading pricing information was displayed to customers, implying that the benefits had been applied in circumstances that they had not.</p>
<p><span>Other packages</span></p>
<p>This concerned packages Westpac offered to its personal and business customers who entered into a package agreement. Westpac&rsquo;s delivery of the packages was marred by the same issues as those that affected its delivery of the EGP Packages.</p>
<p>The result was that customers were overcharged and misled. As with the EGP Packages issue, this was recorded by Westpac in misleading account statements. The issue affected up to 43% of eligible consumer customers and up to 32% of eligible business customers.</p>
<p><span>BTA issue</span></p>
<p>Westpac offered agreed pricing to small business customers who held a &ldquo;Business Transact Account&rdquo; (BTA) with it. Westpac applied incorrect charge codes (used for pricing on the BTA accounts for many customers).</p>
<p>This occurred because of internal systems errors, which relied principally on manual processes. In the result, customers were overcharged because they did not receive the lower account maintenance fees that they were due and/or because fee waivers were not applied on certain transactions when they should have been.</p>
<p>In each case, customers received an itemised statement recording the amounts Westpac had charged them during the statement periods. These statements represented that the customers were being charged the correct rates &ndash; when they were in fact being charged at higher rates.</p>
<p>Westpac has provided remediation to impacted customers.</p>
<p>FMA Head of Enforcement, Margot Gatland, said: &ldquo;Westpac&rsquo;s issues stemmed from deficiencies in its systems that meant the bank failed to deliver to them contractually agreed discounts. Westpac used preferential pricing to attract and retain customers, without having systems that could reliably deliver on those promises.&rdquo; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The FMA acknowledges Westpac&rsquo;s full cooperation throughout the FMA&rsquo;s investigation, and the work it undertook to remedy the issues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The FMA and Westpac have agreed to resolve the proceedings on terms acceptable to all parties. &nbsp;A penalty hearing before the High Court will take place in due course.</p>

<title>Tai Mo Shan To Pay $123 Million For Negligently Misleading Investors About Stability Of Terra USD - Order Also Finds Tai Mo Shan Acted As A Statutory Underwriter In Distributing LUNA Crypto Assets, Which Were Offered And Sold As Securities</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Tai Mo Shan Limited with misleading investors about the stability of Terra USD (UST), a purported &ldquo;algorithmic stablecoin&rdquo; issued by Terraform Labs PTE Ltd. (Terraform), when UST dropped from its purportedly fixed exchange rate of 1 UST to $1, known as a peg. The Commission further charged Tai Mo Shan with offering and selling securities in unregistered transactions by acting as a statutory underwriter with respect to certain of its offers and sales of LUNA, a crypto asset issued by Terraform and offered and sold as a security. Tai Mo Shan is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Jump Crypto Holdings LLC.</p>
<p>Terraform and its founder, Do Kwon, were found liable for fraud and unregistered securities offerings by a federal district court in April 2024 and agreed to pay $4.5 billion to harmed investors. The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that, when UST devalued from its $1 peg in May 2021, Tai Mo Shan and Terraform entered into an agreement that incentivized Tai Mo Shan to purchase UST in exchange for Terraform &ldquo;vesting&rdquo; Tai Mo Shan&rsquo;s existing option to purchase LUNA at a discount to its then-prevailing market price. On that day and subsequent days, Tai Mo Shan tried to restore UST toward its $1 peg, including by purchasing more than $20 million UST. In light of prior statements by Terraform that its algorithmic mechanism would maintain UST&rsquo;s $1 peg, Tai Mo Shan acted negligently by trading UST in a manner that deceived the market into believing that Terraform&rsquo;s algorithmic mechanism was working to stabilize UST, when in reality the price was being stabilized, at least in part, by Tai Mo Shan&rsquo;s large purchases of UST, which were incentivized by Terraform.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s Order also finds that, from at least January 2021 to May 2022, Tai Mo Shan acted as a statutory underwriter with respect to LUNA, a crypto asset offered and sold as a security. Tai Mo Shan acquired certain LUNA crypto assets from Terraform with a view toward distribution after it offered and resold LUNA as securities into the market on U.S.-based crypto asset trading platforms shortly after acquiring it from Terraform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This case reminds us that, too many times in the crypto markets, we&rsquo;ve seen significant investor losses due to fraud,&rdquo; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. &ldquo;Here, the impact reverberated throughout the crypto markets, eventually costing the savings of countless investors. Regardless of the labels, crypto market participants should comply with the securities laws where applicable and not deceive the public. Otherwise, investors get hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As part of the settlement, Tai Mo Shan agreed to pay $73,452,756 in disgorgement, $12,916,153 in prejudgment interest, and a $36,726,378 civil penalty. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, Tai Mo Shan agreed to cease and desist from violations of the registration and fraud provisions it violated.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Liz Canizares, Derek Kleinmann, and Daniel Sinnreich, with assistance from analyst Bryan Hsueh and trial attorneys Carina Cuellar and Laura Meehan. The investigation was supervised by Don Battle, Michael Brennan, James Connor, Kristin Pauley, and Jorge Tenreiro.</p>

<title>Statement On Customer Protection Rule, SEC Chair Gary Gensler</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-on-customer-protection-rule-sec-chair-gary-gensler/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-on-customer-protection-rule-sec-chair-gary-gensler/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, the Commission adopted amendments on the requirements for large broker-dealers to calculate and segregate their customer balances daily rather than weekly. I am pleased to support this adoption because it helps better protect customers in the event a large broker-dealer fails.</p>
<p>Our markets have dramatically evolved since the 1972 adoption of Rule 15c3-3, otherwise known as the Customer Protection Rule.</p>
<p>Back in 1972, life was quite different. The public didn&rsquo;t have access to the internet, smartphones, or social media. In the capital markets, we didn&rsquo;t have anything that resembles modern electronic trading, and it took a full week to settle our securities transactions. Indeed, in 1972 we were just emerging from the paperwork crisis on Wall Street&mdash;in which stock exchanges literally closed from time to time because the back offices couldn&rsquo;t keep up with the crush of paper.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-15c3-122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Today, a full half century later, is a very different time. The overwhelming majority of our markets trade electronically, and few Americans have even seen a physical stock certificate. Indeed, more than 95 percent of trades cleared through the Depository Trust Clearing Corporation are affirmed, confirmed, and allocated by 9:00 PM on the same day they&rsquo;re traded.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say, it&rsquo;s time to update these rules.</p>
<p>The Customer Protection Rule requires broker-dealers that custody customers&rsquo; cash and securities to maintain a special reserve bank account that contains the net cash a broker-dealer owes to its customers. The rule, which we&rsquo;re updating, currently requires broker-dealers to calculate and deposit the appropriate balance for that account on a weekly basis.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s amendments would change this requirement for the largest broker-dealers to daily computation rather than weekly.</p>
<p>As discussed in the adopting release, nine of the largest broker-dealers already make these calculations on a daily basis. Today&rsquo;s adoption would standardize this practice for an estimated 49 broker-dealers whose total credit balances averaged at least $500 million in 2023. As mentioned in the release, these 49 carrying broker-dealers held more than 99 percent of aggregate total credits of all carrying broker-dealers in 2023.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-15c3-122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s amendments are intended to reduce the likelihood of any mismatch between the amount of segregated funds and the net cash owed to customers and other broker-dealers. Further, lowering the likelihood of mismatches will help to protect the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) Fund.</p>
<p>In response to commenters, the adopting release also adjusts the amount of the required buffer that broker-dealers must maintain with regard to their customer reserve deposits. Under the current rule, as amended in 1975, certain broker-dealers must maintain an additional three percent in segregated funds. Under today&rsquo;s final rule, those firms calculating their customer reserve formula daily will be able to reduce this buffer from three percent to two percent. As discussed in the adopting release, with regard to the large broker-dealers covered by the rule, the difference of one percent would have freed up a monthly average of $7.4 billion of liquidity in 2023 to use elsewhere in their business.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-15c3-122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to support this adoption because it helps protect customers and the SIPC Fund, while promoting greater trust in the markets.</p>
<p>For their input on these matters, I&rsquo;d like to thank Chair Claudia Slacik, and other members of the SIPC Board of Directors, and SIPC staff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also like to thank the members of the SEC staff who worked on this rulemaking, including:</p>

<title>FINRA Orders Three Firms To Pay Over $8.2 Million In Restitution To Customers - Firms Did Not Provide Fee Waivers In Connection With Mutual Fund Purchases</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/finra-orders-three-firms-to-pay-over-82-million-in-restitution-to-customers/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/finra-orders-three-firms-to-pay-over-82-million-in-restitution-to-customers/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>FINRA has ordered three firms&mdash;<a href="https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/2024-12/edward-jones-2021069467101-122024.pdf" target="_blank">Edward Jones</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/2024-12/osaic-wealth-awc-122024.pdf" target="_blank">Osaic Wealth, Inc.</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/2024-12/cambridge-investments-awc-122024.pdf" target="_blank">Cambridge Investment Research, Inc.</a>&mdash;to pay more than $8.2 million in restitution to customers who were harmed by the firms&rsquo; failures to provide available mutual fund sales charge waivers and fee rebates on mutual fund purchases. FINRA did not impose any fines in connection with these matters in recognition of each firm&rsquo;s extraordinary cooperation with FINRA&rsquo;s investigations.</p>
<p>The three settled matters are each the result of a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/guidance/targeted-examination-letters/rights-of-reinstatement">targeted examination</a>&nbsp;initiated in 2020 and executed by Member Supervision&rsquo;s Examinations and National Cause and Financial Crimes Detection programs. Including today&rsquo;s settlements, FINRA has secured over $9.5 million in restitution for affected mutual fund customers across five firms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obtaining restitution for harmed customers is a top priority for FINRA. It is essential that firms ensure their customers receive all fee waivers and rebates owed,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/about/bill-st-louis">Bill St. Louis, Executive Vice President and Head of Enforcement at FINRA</a>. &ldquo;At the same time, FINRA recognizes firms that proactively correct errors, identify and repay harmed investors and provide substantial assistance to FINRA during its investigations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many mutual fund issuers offer a right of reinstatement, which allows investors to reinvest in shares of a fund or fund family after previously selling shares without incurring a front-end sales charge, or to recoup all or part of a contingent deferred sales charge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of the three firms failed to establish and maintain a supervisory system reasonably designed to supervise whether eligible customers received available mutual fund sales charge waivers and fee rebates through rights of reinstatement. As a result, customers did not receive the rights of reinstatement benefits to which they were entitled, totaling over $8.2 million.</p>
<p>Edward Jones customers paid $4,440,979 in excess sales charges and fees; Osaic Wealth customers (and those of its affiliated broker-dealers) paid $3,096,490 in excess sales charges and fees; and Cambridge Investment Research customers paid $699,217 in excess sales charges and fees. Each of the firms agreed to repay affected customers, including interest.</p>
<p>Each firm demonstrated extraordinary cooperation by voluntarily initiating an extensive review of their relevant systems, practices and procedures; engaging an outside consultant to identify disadvantaged customers and calculate restitution; and establishing a plan to efficiently identify, notify and repay customers eligible for restitution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In settling these matters, the three firms consented to the entry of FINRA&rsquo;s findings, without admitting or denying the charges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FINRA makes available disciplinary actions and other information on its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/oversight-enforcement/finra-disciplinary-actions-online">Disciplinary Actions Online</a>&nbsp;database. In addition, FINRA publishes on its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/oversight-enforcement/disciplinary-actions">Monthly Disciplinary Actions</a>&nbsp;page a summary of disciplinary actions against firms and individuals for violations of FINRA rules; federal securities laws, rules and regulations; and the rules of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board.</p>

<p>Since 2019, derivatives clearing organizations (DCOs) and futures commission merchants (FCMs) faithfully relied on guidance and a no-action position issued through CFTC Staff Letter 19-17&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/behnamstatement122024?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt1" id="fntref1" name="fntref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;to comply with DCO rules. In the several years during which the original letter was issued, DCOs and FCMs invested accordingly in anticipation that the Commission would act diligently and engage the Commission in the process to implement appropriate relief on a permanent basis. I am pleased today that, consistent with my commitment to improving rules and codifying longstanding staff positions through rulemakings that benefit from the engagement and expertise of our entire Commission, the CFTC is issuing a final rule that allocates greater protections and more importantly, provides long awaited certainty.</p>
<p>I fully support the final rule which protects customer funds, promotes effective DCO and FCM risk management, and balances risk management with practicability. To ensure that the final rule was workable, there were numerous discussions and extensive engagement between staff and industry, in addition to two notices of proposed rulemaking&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/behnamstatement122024?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt2" id="fntref2" name="fntref2">[2]</a>. This final rule is the culmination of these efforts and serves as an example of effective collaboration with industry yielding positive results.</p>
<p>I thank Alicia Lewis in my office, and staff in the Division of Clearing and Risk, Market Participants Division, Office of the General Counsel, and the Office of the Chief Economist for their work on the final rule.</p>

<title>It’s Been A Week: Statement On Amendments To Exchange Act Rule 15c3-3, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/its-been-a-week-statement-on-amendments-to-exchange-act-rule-15c3-3-sec-commi/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/its-been-a-week-statement-on-amendments-to-exchange-act-rule-15c3-3-sec-commi/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Rule 15c3-3 plays a key role in advancing the Commission&rsquo;s investor protection mandate. It requires broker-dealers to safeguard customer assets, which helps to ensure that, should a broker-dealer fail, it can self-liquidate in an orderly manner that protects its customers&rsquo; ability to access her assets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-15c3-122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;A successful self-liquidation permits customers to gain access to their funds much more quickly than possible if they are required to pursue their claims in a liquidation administered by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation.</p>
<p>The rule the Commission is adopting today increases, for the largest broker-dealers, the frequency at which they must perform the reserve calculations to determine how much cash and qualified securities they must deposit into their special reserve bank accounts. These calculations are used to ensure that a broker-dealer has set aside the net cash that it owes its customers and other broker-dealers, which could be used to facilitate an orderly self-liquidation. Instead of performing these calculations weekly, the amended rule will require that broker-dealers with average total credits over the past twelve months of $500 million or more perform these calculations daily. The increased frequency should reduce potential mismatches that could increase the risk that investors will experience a delay in recovering their assets&mdash;or suffer loss&mdash;in the event of a broker-dealer failure.</p>
<p>The final amendments to Rule 15c3-3 are not perfect. It will increase costs and operational challenges for 40 of the estimated 49 carrying broker-dealers that will be subject to this daily computation requirement, and the rule could have done more to address the treatment of funds that will be placed in sweep accounts on the next business day. On the other hand, the final amendments do incorporate an increased threshold for triggering the requirement that mitigates some of the costs. In addition, it allows carrying broker-dealers that use the alternative method for net capital and perform a daily customer reserve computation to reduce their aggregate debit items by 2% (instead of the 3% that is currently required). On balance, I believe the amendments are net beneficial to investors.</p>
<p>I hope that broker-dealers will take the Commission up on its invitation to engage with the staff on potential issues in dealing with what one commenter called &ldquo;cash in motion.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-15c3-122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;I also look forward to receiving feedback on any operational challenges that arise as broker-dealers implement these requirements, particularly with respect to exigent circumstances and potential challenges with resources around holidays and days when the markets close early.</p>
<p>I would like to thank the staff in the Division of Trading and Markets, the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, and in the Office of General Counsel for their hard work on this rule. I hope that you all are able to get some rest over the holidays.</p>

<p>Under the Broker-Dealer Customer Protection Rule, carrying broker-dealers&mdash;i.e., those broker-dealers that maintain custody of customer securities and cash&mdash;must have a special reserve bank account that holds &ldquo;qualified securities&rdquo; and/or cash in an amount determined by a weekly computation.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-15c3-122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp; The idea is that if the broker-dealer fails, the securities and cash it holds for customers can be promptly returned.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-15c3-122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp; A firm must hold an amount of cash or U.S. Treasury securities in the reserve account equal in value to the&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">net</span>&nbsp;amount of cash owed to customers, which is the amount by which total cash owed to customers (e.g., cash balances in securities accounts) exceeds total amount of cash customers owed to the broker-dealer (such as through margin loans to customers).<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-15c3-122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp; On July 12, 2023, the Commission proposed to amend this rule to require certain broker-dealers to compute their customer and reserve deposit requirements, and make any required deposits into their reserve accounts on a daily basis rather than a weekly basis.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-15c3-122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>There were some modifications to the final amendments in response to public comments, such as increasing the threshold for application of the daily calculation requirement from an average&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">total</span>&nbsp;credits of $250 million to $500 million and reducing the 3% aggregate debit items charge that certain carrying broker-dealers must take in performing a customer reserve computation to 2% when they perform a daily customer reserve computation.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-15c3-122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp; However, the final amendments do not adequately address a number of thoughtful public comments on the proposal and appropriately consider the trade-offs between costs and benefits. &nbsp;In my view, the Commission has not yet fully explored potentially more cost-effective means of achieving the sought-after risk amelioration.&nbsp; Indeed, many sensible suggestions in the public comment file appear to have been brushed aside in an attempt to rush it across the finish line.&nbsp; By failing to address these concerns, these final amendments may do more harm than good. &nbsp;As one commenter opined, &ldquo;the Commission has gravely underestimated the staffing and time that will be needed in order to transition to daily calculations and deposits&rdquo;.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-15c3-122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Our markets are characterized by different types of broker-dealer business models, some of which present greater risk than others in terms of customer protection concerns. &nbsp;The amended rule could have been more narrowly targeted to those riskier business models.&nbsp; For example, the final amendments could have utilized a hybrid calculation that included both average&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">total</span>&nbsp;credits and the broker-dealer&rsquo;s overall&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">net</span>&nbsp;credit position as thresholds.&nbsp; One comment letter suggested, in addition to the total credit threshold, that an &ldquo;average excess of credits over debits of at least $10 million or more&rdquo; across the previous year would be also required as a threshold.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-15c3-122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp; Such ideas are worthy of further consideration before proceeding with the final amendments as is.</p>
<p>In the adopting release, the Commission appears to have looked past many suggestions from commentators that might potentially lower cost while still reducing risk.&nbsp; These suggestions include: (1) permitting the calculation and adjustments to be omitted on days in which markets close early;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-15c3-122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;(2) permitting a broker-dealer to not conduct the calculation on given days if there are disruptions beyond the control of the broker-dealer that affect the execution of the calculation so long as the broker-dealer informs and works with their designated regulatory authority,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-15c3-122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;and (3) codifying and simplifying &ldquo;previous guidance making clear that firms need not deposit or maintain in special reserve bank accounts customer inflows that firms deposit into sweep programs or special reserve bank accounts on a same or next day basis.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-15c3-122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp; There may be unintended negative consequences to the market as a result of ignoring the opportunity to further explore these alternatives.&nbsp; For example, in the third suggestion above&mdash;what might be labelled the &ldquo;cash in motion issue&rdquo;&mdash;the danger is that, as one commenter described it, &ldquo;firms might limit business with clients whose transactions involve large transitory credits, leading to a situation where only the largest firms (with substantial liquidity) can handle ultra-high net worth clients with large transitory credits &hellip; creat[ing] an anti-competitive landscape.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-15c3-122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp; The Commission has a statutory obligation to take a close look at such possible anti-competitive effects.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-15c3-122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>
<p>The adoption of the final amendments has been rushed in an apparent attempt to be promulgated prior to the end of the Biden Administration.&nbsp; A rushed rulemaking process can be particularly troubling when the proposed rules, like those being considered today, involve a more nuanced and less obvious balance of costs against speculative benefits.&nbsp; The Commission should have taken the additional time to consider comments, gather evidence and data, and interact with the public. &nbsp;However, the Commission is not proceeding in that fashion and may end up leaving yet another mess for its successors to clean up.&nbsp; Therefore, I dissent.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<title>SEC Adopts Rule Amendments To The Broker-Dealer Customer Protection Rule</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-adopts-rule-amendments-to-the-broker-dealer-customer-protection-rule/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-adopts-rule-amendments-to-the-broker-dealer-customer-protection-rule/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="PR-Body">The Securities and Exchange Commission today adopted amendments to Rule 15c3-3 (the customer protection rule) to require certain broker-dealers to increase the frequency with which they perform computations of the net cash they owe to customers and other broker-dealers (known as PAB account holders) from weekly to daily. The Commission also adopted amendments to Rule 15c3-3 and Rule 15c3-1 (the broker-dealer net capital rule) to permit certain broker-dealers that perform a daily customer reserve computation to decrease the required 3 percent &ldquo;buffer&rdquo; in the customer reserve bank account by reducing the customer-related receivables, or &ldquo;aggregate debit items,&rdquo; charge from 3 percent to 2 percent in the computation.</p>
<p>"Our markets have dramatically evolved since the 1972 adoption of Rule 15c3-3, otherwise known as the Customer Protection Rule," said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. "I&rsquo;m pleased to support this adoption because it helps protect customers and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation Fund, while promoting greater trust in the markets."</p>
<p>Broker-dealers may have large deposit requirements that indicate that there may be times when the net amount of cash owed to customers and PAB account holders is substantially greater than the amounts on deposit in the special reserve bank accounts. The amendments will require broker-dealers with average total credits (the amount of cash they owe customers and PAB account holders) equal to or greater than $500 million to make the computations necessary to determine the amounts required to be deposited in the customer and PAB reserve bank accounts daily, as of the close of the previous business day. By reducing the timeframe between computations, the amendments will assist broker-dealers in more dynamically matching the net amount of cash owed to customers and PAB account holders with the amount on deposit in the broker-dealer&rsquo;s customer and PAB reserve bank accounts. The amendments will also more quickly apply the protective measures of the Rule 15c3-3 reserve requirements to cash of customers and PAB account holders that is newly deposited into the broker-dealer. This will reduce the risk that, if the broker-dealer fails financially, it may be unable to promptly return cash and securities to customers and PAB account holders through an orderly self-liquidation.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s amendments also recognize that the enhancements to the customer protection measures of Rule 15c3-3 through a daily reserve computation warrant a corresponding reduction of the 3 percent &ldquo;buffer&rdquo; that certain broker-dealers must include as part of their customer reserve computation to 2 percent.</p>
<p>The amendments will become effective 60 days after the date of publication of the adopting release in the Federal Register. Broker-dealers that exceed the $500 million threshold using each of the 12 filed month-end FOCUS Reports from July 31, 2024, through June 30, 2025, must perform the customer and PAB reserve computations daily beginning no later than December 31, 2025 (i.e., six months after June 30, 2025). When the amendments are effective, a carrying broker-dealer may voluntarily perform a daily customer reserve computation and apply the 2 percent aggregate debit items reduction, provided it notifies its designated examining authority in writing at least 30 calendar days prior.</p>

<title>Concurring Statement Of CFTC Commissioner Caroline D. Pham On The Separate Accounts Final Rule</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I respectfully concur on the Final Rule on the Regulations to Address Margin Adequacy and to Account for the Treatment of Separate Accounts by Futures Commission Merchants (FCMs) (Separate Accounts Final Rule). I am pleased that the Separate Accounts Final Rule has resolved two critical issues with the proposed rule that were unworkable because of 1) conflicts of law under U.S. banking and securities regulation and foreign banking law, and operational realities regarding the cross-border movement of funds, and 2) lack of regulatory clarity for the handling of administrative errors and operational constraints. In particular, the significant changes in the proposed rule from existing regulatory requirements under CFTC Letter No. 19-17, which FCMs have implemented and complied with for the past 5 years, were not supported by robust cost-benefit analysis to justify imposing overly burdensome new rules. I greatly appreciate the support of Chairman Behnam and the efforts by CFTC staff to address my concerns, and the engagement with my fellow Commissioners.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Daniel O&rsquo;Connell, Bob Wasserman, and Clark Hutchison in the Division of Clearing and Risk for their work on the Separate Accounts Final Rule and the significant time and effort spent working with my office, especially to reconsider the requirements for a one business day margin call and circumstances involving banking holidays in the eurozone, and &ldquo;unusual&rdquo; administrative errors and operational constraints.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement122024?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt1" id="fntref1" name="fntref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;I applaud their dedication to strengthening our markets and addressing the public comments.</p>

<title>CFTC Approves Final Rule On Margin Adequacy, Treatment Of Separate Accounts Of A Customer By Futures Commission Merchants</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-approves-final-rule-on-margin-adequacy-treatment-of-separate-accounts-of-a/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item">
<p><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced a final rule to implement requirements for futures commission merchants related to margin adequacy and the treatment of separate accounts of a customer. The rule finalizes the Commission&rsquo;s proposal, published in the Federal Register in March, to codify the no-action position in CFTC staff letter 19-17 regarding separate account treatment.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>That staff letter, which was supplemented and extended by CFTC Staff Letters&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/csl/20-28/download">20-28</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/csl/21-29/download">21-29</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/csl/22-11/download">22-11</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/csl/23-13/download">23-13</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/csl/24-07/download">24-07</a>, was jointly issued by the Division of Clearing and Risk and the Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight (now Market Participants Division) on July 10, 2019. Letter 19-17 included a DCR staff no-action position stating DCR would not recommend an enforcement action if a derivatives clearing organization permits an FCM clearing member to treat the separate accounts of a customer as accounts of separate entities for purposes of CFTC Regulation 39.13(g)(8)(iii), so long as the clearing member&rsquo;s internal controls and procedures require it to, and it in fact does comply with certain conditions.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In April 2023, the Commission published in the Federal Register its first proposal to codify the no-action position of Letter 19-17. In this first proposal, the Commission proposed to codify the no-action position of Letter 19-17 under its Part 39 DCO regulations, applicable to DCOs, and to their clearing FCMs through the operation of DCO rules. In light of comments received, the Commission withdrew the first proposal, and instead proposed requirements for separate account treatment in Part 1, directly applicable to FCMs.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The final rule adopted Regulation 1.44, which will apply to all FCMs, with respect to their customers, a margin adequacy requirement like the one applicable to DCOs in Regulation 39.13(g)(8)(iii). Regulation 1.44 will also permit FCMs, whether clearing or non-clearing, to treat the separate accounts of a single customer as accounts of separate entities for purposes of the new margin adequacy requirement, and will set forth risk-mitigating requirements, based on the no-action conditions in Letter 19-17 and similar proposed requirements in the Commission&rsquo;s proposals, with which such FCMs must comply in applying separate account treatment.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The final rule also amends Regulations 1.3, 1.17, 1.20, 1.32, 1.58, 1.73, 22.2, 30.2, 30.7, and 39.13 to facilitate implementation of Regulation 1.44 and to correct certain inconsistencies identified in the Commission&rsquo;s existing regulations.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The final rule makes modifications in light of comments received, including with respect to:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span>Proposed requirements related to the treatment of separate accounts of an FCM customer for purposes of certain capital treatment requirements under Regulation 1.17.</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>Proposed definitions of certain terms in Regulation 1.44.</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>Proposed requirements related to a separate account meeting the &ldquo;one business day margin call&rdquo; standard, concerning meeting margin calls during foreign banking holidays and untimely payment of margin due to certain administrative errors or operational constraints.</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>A proposed requirement related to the consistent application of separate account treatment.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span><span>The compliance date for FCMs that are members of a DCO as of the date of publication of the final rule in the Federal Register is 180 days after such date of publication, while the compliance date for all other FCMs is 365 days after such date of publication.</span></span></p>

<title>ESMA Publishes Feedback Received To Proposed Review Of Securitisation Disclosure Templates</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/esma-publishes-feedback-received-to-proposed-review-of-securitisation-disclosure/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA),&nbsp;the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, today published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-12/ESMA12-2121844265-3972_-_Feedback_statement_Securitisation_disclosure_templates.pdf">Feedback Statement</a>&nbsp;summarising the responses it received to its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-12/ESMA12-2121844265-3053_-_Consultation_Paper_on_the_Securitisation_Disclosure_Templates.pdf">Consultation Paper</a>&nbsp;(CP) on the securitisation disclosure templates under the Securitisation Regulation (SECR).</p>
<p>The Feedback Statement provides a detailed analysis of stakeholder feedback on the costs and benefits of revising the existing disclosure framework, in line with the four potential implementation options proposed in the CP. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, respondents acknowledge the need for further improvements to the securitisation transparency regime but recommend postponing the template review due to concerns about its timeline in relation to a broader SECR review.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In their responses stakeholders asked ESMA to prioritise short-term solutions that address the most pressing industry challenges, such as regulatory compliance costs, and the need for a simplified template for private securitisations.</p>
<p>ESMA received a total of 35 responses from a diverse range of stakeholders, including buy-side and sell-side participants, securitisation repositories, credit rating agencies and other service providers.&nbsp;<a>The&nbsp;</a><a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/consultations/consultation-securitisation-disclosure-templates#responses">list of respondents</a>&nbsp;who agreed to make their response public can be found in the Annex.</p>
<h4><span>Next Steps</span></h4>
<p>ESMA will work closely with the European Commission (EC) to explore whether interim adjustments to the technical standards, particularly regarding disclosures for private securitisations, can be implemented before the review of the L1 text.&nbsp;</p>

<title>SEC Files Settled Charges Against Multiple Entities For Failing To Timely File Forms D In Connection With Securities Offerings</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-files-settled-charges-against-multiple-entities-for-failing-to-timely-file-f/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-files-settled-charges-against-multiple-entities-for-failing-to-timely-file-f/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against two private companies and one registered investment adviser for failing to timely file Forms D for several unregistered securities offerings in violation of Rule 503 of Regulation D. The parties charged are:</p>
<ul>
<li>GRID 202 LLC, a registered investment adviser which does business as Re-Envision Wealth;</li>
<li>Pipe Technologies Inc., a privately held financial technology company; and</li>
<li>Underdog Sports Holdings, Inc., a privately held corporation that operates an online fantasy sports website and mobile app.</li>
</ul>
<p>All offers and sales of securities must either be registered under the Securities Act or fall within an exemption from registration. Regulation D contains certain offering exemptions and a safe harbor from the Securities Act&rsquo;s registration requirements. To protect investors and safeguard markets, an issuer offering or selling securities in reliance on one of those exemptions or the safe harbor is required to file a Form D within 15 days after the first sale of securities in the offering.</p>
<p>An issuer&rsquo;s failure to follow the requirements to file a Form D (or amend its existing Form D filing) impedes the Commission&rsquo;s ability to fully assess the scope of the Regulation D market, which is key to the Commission&rsquo;s understanding of whether Regulation D is appropriately balancing the need for investor protection on one hand and the furtherance of capital formation on the other, particularly as it relates to small businesses. It also harms the Commission&rsquo;s ability to monitor and enforce compliance with the requirements of Regulation D and the ability of state securities regulators and self-regulatory organizations to monitor and enforce other securities laws and rules. In addition, it hampers the ability of investors and other market participants to understand whether companies are complying with federal securities laws in their offerings, to research and analyze the Regulation D market, and to report on capital-raising in industries that use Regulation D.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Form D filings are crucial sources of information on private capital formation, and compliance with the requirement to make such filings in a timely manner is vital to the Commission&rsquo;s efforts to promote investor protection while also facilitating capital formation, especially with respect to small businesses,&rdquo; said Sanjay Wadhwa, Acting Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s orders find that the charged entities deprived the Commission and the marketplace of timely information concerning nearly $300 million of unregistered securities offerings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without admitting or denying the findings, Re-Envision Wealth, Pipe Technologies, and Underdog Sports Holdings agreed to cease and desist from violating the charged provisions and to pay the respective civil penalties of $60,000; $195,000; and $175,000.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Alicia Guo, Karen M. Lee, and Adam S. Grace of the Enforcement Division&rsquo;s New York Regional Office and Claire M. Tafelski and Lee A. Greenwood of the Enforcement Division&rsquo;s Asset Management Unit, with assistance from Beth Groves and Howard Kaplan in the Enforcement Division&rsquo;s Office of Investigative &amp; Market Analytics, Rachita Gullapalli and Daniel Bresler in the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis and Gerard Sansobrino, Barry Simmons, Christopher Ruvolo, and David S. Eidelman of the Division of Examinations. The investigation was supervised by Sheldon L. Pollock of the New York Regional Office.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Silver Point Capital With Policy Failures Regarding Receipt Of Material Nonpublic Information About Bonds Issued By Puerto Rico</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-charges-silver-point-capital-with-policy-failures-regarding-receipt-of-mater/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-charges-silver-point-capital-with-policy-failures-regarding-receipt-of-mater/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged registered investment adviser Silver Point Capital L.P. with failing to establish, implement, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent the misuse of material nonpublic information (MNPI) relating to its participation on creditors&rsquo; committees.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, one of Silver Point&rsquo;s core strategies was to invest in distressed companies. As part of this strategy, and because of the nature of its business, a long-time Silver Point consultant, a now-deceased lawyer, participated on creditors' committees of those distressed companies on Silver Point&rsquo;s behalf. However, the SEC alleges, the firm failed to enforce policies and procedures that were reasonably designed to address the specific risks associated with the consultant&rsquo;s receipt of MNPI as a result of his participation on creditors&rsquo; committees.</p>
<p>Specifically, the SEC alleges that, from September 2019 through February 2020, the consultant sat on an ad hoc creditors&rsquo; committee in connection with the restructuring of Puerto Rico&rsquo;s defaulted municipal bonds and received MNPI from a related confidential mediation. According to the complaint, the consultant had extensive communications with Silver Point&rsquo;s public trading desk, without involving the firm&rsquo;s compliance department, at times when he had MNPI from the mediation and while Silver Point continued to buy Puerto Rico bonds. According to the SEC, this created a substantial risk that Silver Point may have misused information from the mediation in connection with its trading of Puerto Rico bonds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silver Point is alleged to have purchased over $260 million of Puerto Rico bonds during the same period that a Silver Point consultant, who possessed MNPI about the&nbsp;<em>same</em>&nbsp;Puerto Rico bonds, had more than five hundred calls with firm employees, including those who actively traded such debt, without involving the firm&rsquo;s compliance department,&rdquo; said Sanjay Wadhwa, Acting Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;Allowing individuals who possess MNPI to have unfettered access to those making trading decisions presents an enhanced risk of misuse of MNPI, and the resulting risks to market integrity and investors are compounded when investment advisers fail to enforce their compliance policies and procedures to prevent the misuse of MNPI.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut, charges Silver Point with violating provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 related to establishing and enforcing reasonably designed compliance policies and procedures.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Sally Hewitt, Heidi M. Mitza, and Jonathan Wilcox of the Public Finance Abuse Unit and Annie Hancock of the Asset Management Unit and supervised by Kevin B. Currid. The SEC&rsquo;s litigation will be led by Susan Cooke and Michael Moran of the Boston Regional Office.</p>

<title>SEC: Deutsche Bank Subsidiary To Pay $4 Million For Untimely Filing Certain Suspicious Activity Reports</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-deutsche-bank-subsidiary-to-pay-4-million-for-untimely-filing-certain-susp/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged registered broker-dealer Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank AG, for failing to file certain Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) in a timely manner. Deutsche Bank Securities has agreed to pay a $4 million civil penalty to settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges.</p>
<p>Broker-dealers are required by the Bank Secrecy Act and regulations promulgated by the U.S Department of the Treasury&rsquo;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network to file SARs for transactions they have reason to suspect involve funds derived from illegal activity, lack a business or apparent lawful purpose, or are intended to facilitate criminal activity.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, Deutsche Bank Securities received requests in connection with law enforcement or regulatory investigations or litigation that prompted it to conduct SARs investigations.&nbsp; However, the SEC&rsquo;s order finds that, in certain instances from April 2019 to March 2024, Deutsche Bank Securities failed to conduct or complete the investigations within a reasonable period of time, including at least two instances where Deutsche Bank Securities took more than two years to file the SARs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even the best information collected from SARs is of limited use if its stale by the time it&rsquo;s provided to law enforcement,&rdquo; said Sheldon L. Pollock, Associate Director of the SEC&rsquo;s New York Regional Office. &ldquo;Through this enforcement action, we are not only holding Deutsche Bank Securities accountable, we are also sending a clear message to other market registrants that timeliness in filing SARs is of paramount importance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that Deutsche Bank Securities violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 17a-8 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, Deutsche Bank Securities agreed to a censure, a cease-and-desist order, and the civil penalty referenced above.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Alicia Guo, Joshua Tannen, and Steven G. Rawlings of the SEC&rsquo;s New York Regional Office, and Joy Guo of the Boston Regional Office, with assistance from Daniel Goldberg, Andrae Eccles, Damon Reed, David Cohen, Susan Schneider, and Naomi Sevilla of the Office of Market Intelligence&rsquo;s Bank Secrecy Act Review Group. The investigation was supervised by Mr. Pollock. The examination that led to the investigation of Deutsche Bank Securities was conducted by Dwight Fu and Lisa Jordan of the Division of Examinations.</p>

<title>Energy Revolution Ventures Closes Fund I Targeting Electrification - Fund Targets Early-Stage Deep Tech To Rewire Our Economy</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/energy-revolution-ventures-closes-fund-i-targeting-electrification-fund-targ/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Energy Revolution Ventures, an energy tech venture capital firm targeting the multi-trillion dollar opportunity in electrification, has closed an $18 million USD seed and series A fund focused on breakthrough deeptech. The fund invests in highly scalable technologies with outsized financial prospects, solving the hardest problems in energy across energy storage, carbon capture, utilisation and storage, and the renewable fuels and hydrogen value chain. The goal is to back category-defining innovators which will completely transform the way we produce, distribute and consume power.</span><span><br /></span></p>
<p><span>The fund is a 2023 vintage and is supported by a variety of Limited Partners, including a network of family offices from the metals and energy sector, high-net-worth individuals, and Bidra Innovation Ventures, the corporate venture capital arm of Morocco&rsquo;s OCP Group. ERV has already invested in nine companies, including Green Li-ion (lithium-ion battery recycling), Anthro (structural, safe batteries), and Oort Energy (low-cost renewable H₂).</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Plummeting renewable energy costs are driving one of the most profound economic transformations of the last 200 years,&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><strong><span>said Marcus Clover, Co-Founder and Partner at ERV.</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Energy has always been at the core of human prosperity, and the path to an energy-abundant future lies in electrification. We are energy tech specialists and aim to be the technical investor of choice for innovators. With ERV Fund I, the companies we&rsquo;ve already backed are commercialising innovations critical to this transition, and we are grateful for the trust and partnership of the founders and our investors.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>ERV&rsquo;s venture fund, together with its sister company Prosemino, a venture builder, is dedicated to identifying and supporting deeptech innovations and founders. Together, ERV and Prosemino offer unparalleled in-house technical expertise, including some of the most published professors in Europe from the University of Oxford and University College London, expert engineers, and seven PhDs, alongside 4,000 sq ft of specialist laboratories (the only ones of their kind in Europe). This integrated model delivers deal flow&mdash;the fund has already backed two Prosemino graduates&mdash;and enables ERV to leverage its global network and technical expertise to identify and back the best innovators worldwide, bridging the gap from groundbreaking science to commercialisation.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Charlotta Holmquist, President and Co-Founder of Blixt, said:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>&ldquo;There is no other VC firm like ERV - uniquely blending a wealth of experience in investment and capital markets, with a deep, technical understanding of science and engineering. This gives them the ability to very quickly assess technologies as well as business models, and identify those breakthrough technologies which can really make a difference to our planet&rsquo;s future. Their decades of experience and strong global connections have opened doors to valuable commercial partnerships and investment opportunities. This involvement has been key to our growth, and we highly recommend ERV to any company looking for an investor who adds genuine value at every stage.&rdquo;</span></p>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/acer-proposes-electricity-grid-connection-network-code-amendments-to-the-europea/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, ACER has submitted to the European Commission its&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsCUw8BVwIBUExaBQIGHVYMUAEdUFgIVhpUBAEAVwUHDw5UBlIdUAVbAwoPAAcdUw8BAR0GXwdXGlcGVg4ZAwYFBgACBFNTUVcARQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Recommendation</a>&nbsp;to amend the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsGBw4BVVFVV0wIDwFUHVYIAQEdUAFSVBoNV1EHDAEHAQQHDlAdUAVbAwoPAAcdUw8BAR0GXwdXGlcGVg4ZAwYFBgACBFNTUVcARQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">HVDC Network Code</a>, which sets binding rules for connecting high-voltage direct current (HVDC) systems and direct current (DC) connected &lsquo;power park modules&rsquo; to the grid.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why amend the rules?</span></p>
<p>These amendments aim to safeguard future energy system needs in the EU. Substantial growth in generation capacity of isolated offshore Alternating Current (AC) networks (or AC hubs) is expected.</p>
<p>This ACER Recommendation aims to address the changes in the electricity sector, focusing on the growing role of offshore power park modules, demand facilities, power-to-gas units (e.g., electrolysers for renewable hydrogen), electricity storage, and HVDC systems connecting isolated (AC) networks.</p>
<p>Key terms explained:</p>
<ul>
<li>Power park modules refer to offshore generators, comprising a single or a set of generating units connected to the offshore AC network (e.g., wind, solar, wave, etc.).</li>
<li>AC hubs will connect large-scale (tens of GW) offshore power generation and large-scale industrial demand (electrolysers) along with storage and other demand.</li>
<li>Demand refers to system users that are consuming electricity from the network (e.g., power-to-gas units, industrial consumers, etc).</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is this ACER Recommendation about?</span></p>
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsCVVcGUVkHW0xaBgcCHVZaA1UdCgAGBRoHVQpSUgMAUlVTUAQdUAVbAwoPAAcdUw8BAR0GXwdXGlcGVg4ZAwYFBgACBFNTUVcARQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">In December 2023</a>, ACER recommended amending the Network Codes on requirements for grid connection of generators and demand connection. To ensure consistency in grid connection rules and address new system needs (e.g., offshore networks and new system users like storage and demand facilities), ACER initiated the amendment process of the HVDC Regulation.</p>
<p>ACER proposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expanding the Network Code&rsquo;s scope to include new offshore demand facilities, power-to-gas facilities (mainly electrolysers), offshore electricity storage, and HVDC systems connecting isolated AC networks.</li>
<li>Introducing technical requirements for new offshore demand facilities, power-to-gas facilities (mainly electrolysers), and offshore electricity storage to support both interconnected and offshore systems.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Process and next steps</span></p>
<p>This ACER Recommendation is the result of extensive engagement including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtSAQ9VB1BdUUwLBwRRHVZbDFIdUw9UUxoMVwIPA1IAU1IJAVAdUAVbAwoPAAcdUw8BAR0GXwdXGlcGVg4ZAwYFBgACBFNTUVcARQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Public consultation</a>&nbsp;(June-September 2024) &nbsp;</li>

</ul>
<p>ACER reviewed the stakeholders&rsquo; feedback and consulted the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) and other stakeholders to finalise the Recommendation.</p>
<p>The next step is for the European Commission to adopt the Network Code in line with the&nbsp;Electricity Regulation.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Utility Company Entergy Corp. With Internal Accounting Controls Violations - Company Agrees To Pay $12 Million In Penalties And Adopted Independent Consultant’s Recommended Improvements</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-charges-utility-company-entergy-corp-with-internal-accounting-controls-viol/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Entergy Corporation, a Louisiana-based utility company, agreed to pay a $12 million civil penalty to settle charges that it failed to maintain internal accounting controls to ensure that its surplus materials and supplies were accurately recorded in its books and financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, from at least mid-2018 to the present, Entergy included materials and supplies at their average cost as an asset on its balance sheets. However, during this time, Entergy had allegedly been informed by its employees and management consultants that this asset included a substantial amount of potential surplus, including aged materials and supplies in excess of Entergy&rsquo;s anticipated future use or exceeding the maximum stocking levels deemed necessary by its business units. According to the complaint, Entergy failed to establish a comprehensive process to review these materials and supplies to identify surplus, remeasure it, and record any differences between its average cost and remeasured cost as an expense, in accordance with GAAP.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Internal accounting controls serve as a front-line defense in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of financial statements,&rdquo; said Sanjay Wadhwa, Acting Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;Investors rely on public companies, such as Entergy, to ensure that adequate internal accounting controls are in place. We allege that Entergy failed to fulfill its obligation in this regard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Entergy consented to the entry of a final judgment, subject to court approval, which includes being permanently enjoined from violating Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, paying the $12 million civil penalty referenced above, and adopting an independent consultant&rsquo;s recommended improvements to its internal accounting controls.</p>
<p>The SEC's investigation was conducted by Ada Fernandez Johnson, Katherine H. Stella, and Brian Palechek under the supervision of Lisa Deitch, Peter Rosario, Ryan Wolfe, and Stacy Bogert, with the assistance of Carina Cuellar and Christopher Bruckmann.</p>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/wells-fargo-and-lpl-financial-charged-for-submitting-deficient-trading-data-to-s/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against Wells Fargo Clearing Services LLC and LPL Financial LLC for failing to provide complete and accurate securities trading information, known as blue sheet data, to the SEC. Wells Fargo and LPL each agreed to pay a $900,000 civil penalty to resolve the SEC's charges.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s orders, over a period of several years, Wells Fargo and LPL each made numerous blue sheet submissions to the SEC that contained inaccurate or missing information about securities transactions and the firms or customers involved in the transactions, as well as other deficiencies. The SEC&rsquo;s order against Wells Fargo finds that, as a result of approximately 15 types of errors, Wells Fargo made approximately 11,195 blue sheet submissions to the SEC that contained missing or inaccurate data for at least 10.6 million total transactions. The SEC&rsquo;s order against LPL finds that, as a result of 10 types of errors, LPL made at least 3,679 blue sheet submissions that contained misreported or missing data for at least 399,000 total transactions.</p>
<p>The SEC's orders find that Wells Fargo and LPL both engaged in remedial efforts to correct and improve their blue sheet reporting systems and controls, including retaining outside consultants to conduct reviews of their respective blue sheet reporting programs, as well as improving their respective governance frameworks and validation procedures for blue sheet submissions. The orders note that Wells Fargo self-identified and self-reported all but one of the errors affecting its blue sheet submissions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We use blue sheet data to detect wrongdoing and to protect investors through our enforcement efforts,&rdquo; said Thomas P. Smith, Jr., Associate Regional Director in the New York Regional Office. &ldquo;These orders underscore the importance of the obligation to provide accurate and complete blue sheet data to the SEC. Additionally, these resolutions highlight the benefits of self-reporting, remediation, and cooperation when firms detect violations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC orders find that Wells Fargo and LPL violated the broker-dealer recordkeeping and reporting provisions of the federal securities laws. Wells Fargo and LPL each admitted the findings in the respective orders and agreed to be censured and to each pay a $900,000 penalty.</p>
<p>Separately, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) reached settlements with Wells Fargo and LPL for related conduct.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation of Wells Fargo was conducted by Eric Taffet and Lindsay S. Moilanen of the New York Regional Office. The SEC&rsquo;s investigation of LPL was conducted by Zheng (Jane) He, Suzanne M. Bettis, and Ms. Moilanen of the New York Regional Office. Both investigations were supervised by Mr. Smith. The SEC appreciates the assistance of FINRA.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Comisi&oacute;n Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia (CNMC) has imposed a &euro;6 million fine on GESTERNOVA S.A. and a &euro;1.5 million fine on AXPO IBERIA for manipulating the Spanish electricity market between 30 September and 30 December 2022.</p>
<p>These penalties come under the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsDUAcDAlQGUkwABAVTHVYBVAMdUFhXAxoGUQoGVwJTAVNUAQcdUlNQUAECUgcdAwsEBR0GDlUDGgxXAgcZVQEHDlJVAVJTXAIHRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">REMIT Regulation (EU) No 1227/2011</a>, which prohibits market manipulation and seeks to protect the integrity and transparency of the EU&rsquo;s wholesale energy markets.</p>
<p>In its decisions, CNMC found that GESTERNOVA S.A. and AXPO IBERIA had breached Article 5 of REMIT by manipulating the continuous intraday market by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Giving false or misleading signals regarding the supply of wholesale energy products, through behaviour known as &lsquo;<em>quote stuffing</em>&rsquo;.</li>
<li>Issuing (and also withdrawing in AXPO IBERIA&rsquo;s case) non-genuine orders to be in an advantageous position to execute cross-border sales with France.</li>
</ul>
<p>CNMC&rsquo;s investigation revealed that GESTERNOVA S.A. and AXPO IBERIA, in multiple sessions of this period, issued (or also withdrew in AXPO IBERIA&rsquo;s case) non-genuine sell orders by using algorithmic trading with the goal of monopolising the order book queue for the D+1 product. Their behaviour blocked other market participants&rsquo; orders from being accepted in the order queue. Consequently, at the start of the trading session, one or more of GESTERNOVA S.A.&rsquo;s and AXPO IBERIA's sell orders were prioritised at the top of the order book, ready to be the first matched once additional capacity would become available at the interconnection with France.</p>
<p>CNMC consider the behaviour as &ldquo;quote stuffing&rdquo; (defined in&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsBAVAFV1NWVExcDlJQHVZaAQ4dCgpQVhoGXFIDAgYNAAYBBwkdUlNQUAECUgcdAwsEBR0GDlUDGgxXAgcZVQEHDlJVAVJTXAIHRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">6.1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;edition of ACER REMIT Guidance</a>&nbsp;as entering a large number of orders to trade and/or cancellations and/or updates to orders to trade so as to create uncertainty for other participants, slowing down their process, and/or to camouflage one&rsquo;s own strategy).</p>

<title>NGX Group CEO Advocates For Authenticity And People-Centric Leadership At Taj Leadership Summit</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In an era where the demands on leaders are growing increasingly complex, Temi Popoola, the Group Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX Group), called for a renewed focus on authenticity and people-centric leadership as a way to navigate the multifaceted challenges of a globalized world. He spoke on this during his though-provoking keynote address at the Taj Lands End Leadership Summit in Mumbai, India. His address which centered on the theme Authenticity, Leadership, and Hope for the Future, provided a platform for the Nigerian business leader to share a narrative that was equal parts personal and strategic.</p>
<p>Popoola&rsquo;s reflections were grounded in his diverse life journey, which spans an upbringing in the United Kingdom and Nigeria, a robust academic foundation in chemical engineering and finance, and a career marked by leadership excellence across continents and sectors. He highlighted how these experiences shaped his global perspective and ability to drive innovation within complex organizational structures.</p>
<p>At the core of Popoola&rsquo;s message was the importance of authenticity in leadership. He stressed that leaders must embrace self-awareness and empathy to build cohesive teams capable of delivering exceptional outcomes. As the leader of one of Africa&rsquo;s most prominent stock exchanges, he underscored that the strategic act of hiring and retaining the right talent, and fostering a culture of collaboration is pivotal for long-term success. Drawing from his experiences, he shared how challenges in leadership have been mitigated through lessons learned from mentors and the wisdom found in books, both of which continue to shape his decision-making process.</p>
<p>On the personal front, he candidly discussed the challenges of balancing professional success with personal commitments, "Leadership is not just about the boardroom; it is about showing up authentically in every aspect of life," he remarked. He further reflected on the vital role of spirituality and lifelong learning, crediting these pillars for providing strength and resilience during periods of uncertainty.</p>
<p>In a world marked by rapid change and emerging challenges, Popoola expressed optimism for the future, particularly in developing nations like India and Nigeria. He described the youth in these regions as untapped reservoirs of innovation and growth, urging leaders to strategically invest in their development to unlock transformative potential.<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>He further articulated a clear vision for leadership that resonates across industries and geographies. He called on leaders to prioritize authenticity, champion continuous learning, and harness the power of human capital to address both immediate challenges and future opportunities. His address was not only a call to action but also a strategic framework for navigating the evolving dynamics of global leadership.</p>
<p>Popoola&rsquo;s thought leadership at the Taj Lands End Leadership Summit reaffirmed his position as a leading voice in the global discourse on leadership, authenticity, and sustainable development.</p>

<title>HKEX In 2024: Year In Review</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/hkex-in-2024-year-in-review/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/hkex-in-2024-year-in-review/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="spanHeading"><span>Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) had a fruitful 2024, marked by new leadership, greater connectivity and engagement with international markets, the launch of multi-year infrastructure enhancement programmes, and fresh trading records that underscore the market&rsquo;s vibrancy and resilience.</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading">HKEX introduced a host of initiatives during the year, further enhancing the Group&rsquo;s offerings and strengthening Hong Kong's role as a leading international financial centre. These included plans to open an office in Riyadh, as well as adding Abu Dhabi and Dubai to the list of recognised stock exchanges, bolstering capital market connectivity between Asia and the Middle East. The Group also saw the successful implementation of Severe Weather Trading arrangements, reflecting HKEX&rsquo;s commitment to continuously elevating its market competitiveness.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">HKEX Chairman Carlson Tong and Chief Executive Officer Bonnie Y Chan assumed their roles in April and March, respectively. This coincided with a period of improved macro conditions that fuelled market enthusiasm, as highlighted by the new daily trading records across all of HKEX&rsquo;s markets in the third and fourth quarters, with the cash equities market hitting a record $620 billion in turnover on 8 October 2024.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">For 2024, Hong Kong ranked as one of the world&rsquo;s top four IPO venues, with activity and fundraising volumes rising sharply from a year earlier. As at 20 December, HKEX IPOs raised a total of $83 billion from 66 new listings*, including the city&rsquo;s biggest IPO since 2021. HKEX&rsquo;s new listing chapters supported evolving market needs with two listings under the specialist technology Chapter 18C, three GEM listings following its reforms, and the first De-SPAC transaction.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">In October, HKEX announced an enhanced timeframe for the new listing application process, together with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC). This initiative, which also features an accelerated processing timeframe for eligible companies listed in Mainland China, will provide greater certainty and transparency for potential applicants and their advisers in formulating their listing plans. This announcement followed another important Listing enhancement, with the implementation of a new treasury share regime in June that provides issuers with greater flexibility in capital management through share buy-backs and resales of treasury shares. HKEX also issued a consultation paper in December on optimising the IPO price discovery process and open market requirements.</p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>In November, HKEX celebrated the 10<span>th</span>&nbsp;anniversary of the Connect programme, which has expanded beyond its initial focus on equities to include bonds, Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), and interest rate swaps. This year, more enhancements were implemented, including the relaxation of ETF eligibility requirements under Stock Connect, as well as new trade types and services for Swap Connect. The upcoming inclusion of&nbsp;</span><span>real estate investment trust</span><span>s under Stock Connect &mdash; and the introduction of RMB counters for Southbound trading &mdash; will further solidify Hong Kong&rsquo;s role as a superconnector between Mainland China and global capital markets.</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading">HKEX's derivatives market also had a very solid year, with average daily volumes (ADV) of futures and options reaching 1.57 million contracts as at 30 November, up 16 per cent from a year earlier. Among new derivatives products launched during the period, HKEX introduced weekly Hang Seng TECH Index Options and weekly options for 10 single stocks, enhancing its dynamic options ecosystem and catering to the growing demand for shorter-dated options.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">The Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) market, including ETFs and leveraged and inverse products, has gone from strength to strength, with average daily turnover reaching $18.7 billion as at the end of November, an increase of around 34 per cent from a year earlier. During the year, HKEX welcomed Hong Kong's first-ever listings of Covered Call ETFs and Asia&rsquo;s first Spot Virtual Asset ETFs, further enhancing product diversity and liquidity, contributing to the 36 new ETFs launched during the period. Furthermore, HKEX unveiled plans to digitise and automate the in-kind creation and redemption process for ETPs, a move that will increase market efficiency and support the continued growth of secondary market activity for ETPs.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">To further enhance the liquidity and vibrancy of Hong Kong&rsquo;s markets, HKEX will proceed with a proposal to reduce minimum spreads of eligible securities, following strong support after a market consultation, with the first phase set for implementation in mid-2025.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">Beyond new products and microstructure enhancements, HKEX is developing future-ready capabilities that will enable real-time trade processing and round-the-clock derivatives trading, ensuring that HKEX&rsquo;s market infrastructure can meet the needs of the next generation of investors.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">To this end, HKEX announced plans to introduce new post trade services and features on its integrated cash market platform, the Orion Cash Platform (OCP), as well as plans to develop the Orion Derivatives Platform (ODP), an in-house platform that will differentiate the Group&rsquo;s derivatives offerings. Also, HKEX will ensure its systems are technically ready for a T+1 stock settlement cycle by the end of 2025 and facilitate discussion in 2025 on a suitable settlement cycle for Hong Kong&rsquo;s markets, with plans to publish a white paper in the first half. The progressive rollout of these platforms and features will help bolster HKEX&rsquo;s ability to support global investors and solidify Hong Kong&rsquo;s standing as Asia&rsquo;s premier risk management centre.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">HKEX also continued its push to explore adjacencies in 2024, with the introduction of the HKEX Virtual Asset Index Series and the Hang Seng HKEX Stock Connect China Enterprises Index marking the Group&rsquo;s foray into indexes. The launch of a Fund Repository on the Integrated Fund Platform also represents a significant step forward in enhancing Hong Kong&rsquo;s fund industry value chain and ecosystem. In addition, HKEX launched a new web-based data platform, the HKEX Data Marketplace, to distribute its historical data products and support the needs of HKEX&rsquo;s global investors.</p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>The London Metal Exchange (LME) also had a strong year, with ADV for the year to 30 November registering a 22 per cent increase from a year earlier. In July, the LME added Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, as a copper and zinc warehouse delivery point, and it continues to make progress in adding Hong Kong as a new warehouse location. As well, following the successful roll-out of an enhanced electronic closing pricing methodology, the LME published a white paper on further evolving its market structure to enhance liquidity, and announced that it will launch its new trading platform, LMEselect v10, on 24 March 2025.</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading">As a purpose-driven company, HKEX has an important and unique role as a corporate, regulator and market operator in fostering positive change in society. It launched a new Sustainability function this year that reflects a more structured and collaborative approach in how the Group considers its responsibility to the environment, its employees, its communities, and its markets.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">HKEX continues to promote robust ESG standards to further elevate the quality of its issuers and market ecosystem. It will be implementing new enhancements to the Corporate Governance Code and related rules, whilst new climate-related disclosure rules will come into effect from 2025. The Exchange is also moving firmly towards ending single-gender boards among all its listed issuers, with related requirements taking effect on 1 January 2025.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">HKEX Chief Executive Officer, Bonnie Y Chan, said: "2024 has been a year of significant progress and delivery as we position HKEX and our markets for a sustainable and vibrant future. During the year, we have completed or announced various important strategic initiatives that will bring long-term positive impact to our markets, including reforms, new products, strategic partnerships, and programmes to advance our future-ready capabilities. The improved macro backdrop also supported renewed vibrancy and robustness of our markets, positioning our listing franchise very positively into 2025 and beyond. But we can&rsquo;t stop here. There is much ahead for us to pursue, and whilst I am very proud of the team&rsquo;s achievements this year, I look forward to working together with my fantastic colleagues to delivering on our strategic imperatives, supporting our global investors and elevating Hong Kong's financial landscape."</p>
<p class="spanHeading">&ldquo;On behalf of HKEX, I would like to thank our customers, business partners, regulators and our communities in Hong Kong, Mainland China and around the world, for their unwavering support and engagement over the past year. Their ongoing feedback is crucial in helping us formulate the appropriate initiatives with which to further elevate our market attractiveness. We are enthusiastic about the future and are confident that 2025 will present another year of great opportunity and deeper connectivity for our markets.&rdquo;</p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority: Individual Pleads Guilty To Insider Trading Charges</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-individual-pleads-guilty-to-insider-tra/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-individual-pleads-guilty-to-insider-tra/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Kevin Young, a former accountant with Heartland Bank Limited, has pleaded guilty to insider trading charges brought against him by the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko.</p>
<p>In July 2024, the FMA filed criminal proceedings against Mr Young for alleged insider trading relating to the buying and selling of shares in Heartland Group Holdings Limited (HGH). &nbsp;The FMA brought four charges against Mr Young. He has today pleaded guilty to three charges, with the FMA agreeing to withdraw one charge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr Young traded, and encouraged another to hold, HGH shares between July 2020 and February 2021, while holding material information that was not generally available to the public. He also disclosed material information in relation to HGH that was not generally available to the public to a former colleague, Pritesh Patel, who subsequently purchased HGH shares.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr Young will be sentenced on 17 April 2025.</p>
<p>The FMA has also entered into an enforceable undertaking with Mr Patel, where he has agreed to pay the Crown a total of $30,000 in lieu of a pecuniary penalty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FMA Head of Enforcement, Margot Gatland, said: &ldquo;Insider trading is a serious offence that undermines investor confidence in the New Zealand markets and gives individuals an unfair advantage. The FMA takes all insider conduct cases seriously and will take enforcement action where it considers misconduct has occurred. Taking such cases assists in the promotion of confident and informed participation of the financial markets and promotes fairness, efficiency, and transparency in those markets.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>Mr Young was a treasury accountant and a member of the finance team at Heartland. &nbsp;His role meant he had available to him, and was required to access, financial records which showed Heartland&rsquo;s financial results before they were announced to the market.</p>
<p>The first two charges relate to the information Mr Young accessed in July and August 2020 which showed the level of Heartland&rsquo;s full-year net profit after tax (NPAT) before it was announced to the market. &nbsp;The information indicated Heartland had increased its underlying NPAT from the previous year despite the negative impacts of Covid-19.</p>
<p>On 31 July 2020, Mr Young disclosed to a former colleague, Pritesh Patel, that Heartland had &ldquo;increase [sic] profit this year&rdquo;. &nbsp;That day Mr Patel placed an order for 4,000 HGH shares.</p>
<p>On 21 August 2020, Mr Young instructed his sister to purchase HGH shares on his behalf and gave her the money to do so. &nbsp;She purchased 241,238 HGH shares for a total of $284,661.</p>
<p>On 17 September 2020 at 9:50am, Heartland released its full-year 2020 financial results to the market. &nbsp;The announcement contained the fact HGH had achieved a NPAT of $72 million, which contained a before-tax provision of $9.6 million as an economic overlay in response to the ongoing uncertainties relating to Covid-19, and an adjusted NPAT of $78.9 million.</p>
<p>Between 10:12am and 10:25am, Mr Young&rsquo;s sister sold all 241,238 HGH shares for a total of $297,808. &nbsp;Mr Young made a gain of $11,241 on the trading (excluding costs and commissions).</p>
<p>The third charge relates to information Mr Young accessed in January and February 2021 which showed the level of Heartland&rsquo;s half-year NPAT and level of dividend payment before they were announced to the market. &nbsp;On 4 February 2021, Mr Young encouraged another individual to hold HGH shares disclosing &ldquo;good half year profit and 4c dividend half year &hellip; don&rsquo;t tell anyone&rdquo;. &nbsp;On 22 February 2021, Heartland released its half-year financial results announcing a NPAT of $44.1m and an interim dividend of 4 cents per share.</p>
<p>About insider trading&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sections 240 - 243 of the Financial Markets Conduct (FMC) Act prohibit people who hold material information about an issuer that is not generally available to the market (inside information) from trading with that information, disclosing it in certain circumstances, and advising or encouraging other individuals to trade the issuer&rsquo;s shares.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unethical trading activity can undermine market integrity and erode investor confidence at a fundamental level. Participants in financial markets must operate on the basis that all trades are legitimate and based on equally available information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA considers it critical to uphold the law in this area to maintain investor confidence, but also to maintain credibility for those market participants who are willing compliers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Criminal insider trading can be punishable with up to a term of imprisonment not exceeding five years, a fine not exceeding $500,000, or both for individuals.</p>
<p>Civil penalties can include a pecuniary penalty not exceeding the greatest of the consideration for the relevant transaction, three times the amount of the gain made or the loss avoided, and $1 million in the case of an individual or $5 million in any other case. &nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="navihidden">[Opening remarks:]</h2>
<dl class="qanda2"><dt class="ans char2">Minister)</dt><dd>
<p>Let me first introduce to you the industry-wide PR activities regarding countermeasures against financial crime.<br />The amount of damage due to investment fraud using SNS has increased by four times from the previous year, and countermeasures are urgently required. In order to prevent damage, it is vital to stop the misuse of deposit and savings accounts. For that purpose, it is important to constantly check whether accounts are properly used by account holders.<br />Therefore, financial institutions have asked users to update their personal information, such as address and occupation, by sending them post cards and letters. However, in reality, many users do not respond.<br />Accordingly, in order to make users understand the procedures for confirming personal information and ask for their cooperation, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), the National Police Agency, and financial associations will launch the first public-private joint PR activities involving the industry as a whole and will strengthen efforts to raise people's awareness using diverse media, including the internet.<br />Individual people's understanding and cooperation will lead to the prevention of fraud damage and eventually to the protection of the safety and security of the whole nation. We would like to also ask the media for cooperation in disseminating this initiative and raising people's awareness.</p>

<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">KEY POINTS</span></b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Federation of Thai Capital Market Organizations (FETCO), Thai Institute of Directors Association (Thai IOD), and The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) announce joint commitment to enhance corporate governance among Thai listed companies. </b></li>
<li><b>The capital market organizations pledge to closely monitor relevant developments, implement appropriate actions within their authority, and proactively prevent and address any issues that may undermine investor confidence.</b><b></b></li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The capital market organizations announced to reaffirm their collective commitments to safeguarding the interests of investors and stakeholders and preserving the good corporate governance standards among listed companies for the sustainable advancement of the Thai capital market on December 20, 2024 as detailed below:</p>
<ol>
<li>To closely monitor relevant developments and implement appropriate actions within their authority.</li>
<li>To collaboratively strengthen good corporate governance standards across listed companies, with specific focus on transactions involving potential conflicts of interest. </li>
<li>To remain committed to fostering good corporate governance among listed companies while proactively preventing and addressing any issues that may undermine investor confidence.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>FETCO Chairman and Thai Listed Companies Association (TLCA) Vice Chairman Kobsak Pootrakool </b>highlighted that FETCO remains unwavering in its efforts to promote business transparency and strengthen good governance standards among listed firms. This is crucial for building investor trust since good governance is the foundation that propels the sustainability of businesses and the competitiveness of the Thai capital market internationally.</p>
<p><b>Thai IOD Chief Executive Officer Kulvech Janvatanavit</b> stated that organizational sustainability stems from public trust, emphasizing Thai IOD&rsquo;s strong support for the role of boards of directors as the moral compass of their organizations. By collaborating with management teams, they cultivate good corporate governance from the top down, fostering organization-wide integrity awareness to build a strong culture of corporate governance and compliance. Thai IOD expects board chairpersons to take the lead in fostering an effective board culture that encourages active participation and meaningful dialogues among directors. Independent directors are expected to act as steadfast stakeholder advocates, representing their expectations and safeguarding their interests while steering companies toward the achievement of actual goals and expectations.</p>
<p><strong>Investment Analysts Association (IAA) Chairperson Paiboon Nalinthrangkurn </strong>mentioned investment analysts intensifying focus on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations which reflects investors' growing pursuit of investments that generate both satisfactory financial returns and meaningful social impact. ESG factors significantly influence the landscape of business risks and opportunities in today's market environment while market transparency is indispensable for capital markets. He also remarked that listed companies prioritizing short-term profitability over long-term implications risk facing heightened scrutiny or resistance, ultimately jeopardizing their reputation and performance.</p>
<p><strong>Association of Investment Management Companies (AIMC) Chair</strong><strong>man</strong><strong> and ESG Collective Action Committee</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Chairperson Chavinda Hanratanakool</strong> highlighted that executives and fund managers of asset management companies, as institutional investors dedicated to integrity and unitholder protection, maintain heightened vigilance over ESG risks. She noted that governance issues among Thai listed companies, which have surfaced repeatedly this year, remain a top priority alongside financial performance metrics. In response, asset management companies have collectively strengthened their ESG Collective Action framework to enhance fact-finding,&nbsp; problem identification, impact assessment, and investment guidelines for companies facing ESG issues. Through this coordinated effort, the industry seeks to be a driving force in elevating the standards and quality of Thailand's capital market.</p>
<p><strong>SET President Asadej Kongsiri</strong> underscored the importance of timely and comprehensive market communication in today's environment. Listed companies must disclose information with consideration of impacts on all stakeholders, particularly investors, ensuring they receive the necessary information for investment decisions. While regulatory disclosure requirements form the baseline obligation, listed companies should embrace transparent and public communication of material information that may affect investors who are considered key stakeholders. He reiterated SET's dedication to cultivating a market ecosystem where listed companies provide equal, comprehensive, and timely disclosures that enable informed investment decisions.</p>

<p>(Excerpt)</p>
<p>(Friday, December 13, 2024, 8:33&nbsp;am to 8:39&nbsp;am)</p>
<dl><dt>Q.</dt><dd>
<p>There were cases of theft of a large amount of money and goods from safe-deposit boxes at Mitsubishi UFJ Bank, Ltd. This may not be necessarily considered merely as the bank's problem, but the damage is considerably large, so how do you view this? Furthermore, is the Financial Services Agency (FSA) considering issuing an order to request reporting or the like to the bank regarding this issue?</p>
</dd><dt class="ans">A.</dt><dd>
<p>First of all, regarding individual cases, I have never mentioned any specific measures to be taken by the FSA.<br />However, banks take custody of customers' deposits and property based on their trust. It is very regrettable that the relevant theft cases occurred at Mitsubishi UFJ Bank.<br />As a matter of course, the bank will endeavor to appropriately ensure customer protection, clarify the whole picture of the cases, investigate the causes and consider recurrence prevention measures based on the found facts. The FSA will closely follow up the progress of the bank's efforts to ensure its appropriate responses.</p>

<title>ASIC: Federal Court Finds CFD Issuers Engaged In Systemic Unconscionable Conduct With Customer Losses Totalling Over $83 Million</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-federal-court-finds-cfd-issuers-engaged-in-systemic-unconscionable-conduct/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-federal-court-finds-cfd-issuers-engaged-in-systemic-unconscionable-conduct/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Federal Court today found that collapsed contracts for difference (CFD) issuer, Union Standard International Group Pty Ltd (USG) and two of its former corporate authorised representatives, BrightAU Capital Pty Ltd (trading as TradeFred) and Maxi EFX Global AU Pty Ltd (trading as EuropeFX), engaged in systemic unconscionable conduct as well as a raft of other contraventions of the law between 2018 and 2020.</p>
<p>The Court heard customers of EuropeFX and TradeFred lost over $83 million during the period of the extensive breaches of the law by these CFD issuers, including systemic unconscionable conduct, misleading and deceptive conduct and the provision of unlicensed personal advice. These companies directly profited from their customers' losses and incentivised their account managers to pressure investors to deposit more funds. The onboarding processes of these companies actively sought to attract customers who were inexperienced or vulnerable. Many of these customers were &lsquo;flying blind&rsquo; and did not understand the risks involved in these highly complex financial products.</p>
<p>In an Australian first, the Court also found that USG breached its general obligation to ensure that the financial services covered by its Australian financial services (AFS) licence were provided &lsquo;efficiently, honestly and fairly&rsquo;, where it offered those services to customers in China, and it knew, or ought reasonably to have known, that those customers were likely be contravening Chinese law and it failed to take any reasonable steps to warn its customers that it was exposing them to potential civil and criminal liability in China. This judgment has important implications for entities providing financial services under an AFS licence to customers outside of Australia. Justice Wigney held that the general obligations of AFS licensees are not limited to financial services provided to customers in Australia.</p>
<p>ASIC had warned CFD issuers in 2019 that ASIC would consider whether breaching overseas law is consistent with obligations under Australian law to provide services &lsquo;efficiently, honestly and fairly&rsquo;.</p>
<p>ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said, &lsquo;This outcome sets an important precedent for Australian based financial services licensees providing services such as margin forex trading to overseas customers under their AFS licence where such offerings are prohibited.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The conduct of licensees providing services to overseas customers under their AFS licences has attracted considerable attention from regulators globally and this judgment is important in protecting the reputation of Australia&rsquo;s financial services licencing regime.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Court found that EuropeFX and TradeFred employed a system of conduct and engaged in patterns of behaviour that were unconscionable as they:</p>
<ul>
<li>derived the bulk of their revenue from customers&rsquo; trading losses;</li>
<li>provided a remuneration incentive to account managers to encourage and pressure customers to deposit more funds into their trading accounts;</li>
<li>failed to address known misconduct by account managers;</li>
<li>failed to give vulnerable customers any adequate explanations about the relevant financial products and the risks involved in trading in them;</li>
<li>made misleading or deceptive representations, including about profits that could be generated;</li>
<li>employed inappropriate, unfair or sharp practices;</li>
<li>pressured vulnerable customers to trade and deposit more funds into their trading accounts, including encouraging customers to fund their trading through superannuation accounts or credit cards; and</li>
<li>provided personal advice to their customers when they were not licensed to do so.</li>
</ul>
<p>USG was held liable for this conduct as the AFS licensee holder who authorised them to operate.</p>
<p>Ms Court said, &lsquo;ASIC took this case to stand up for vulnerable consumers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Over a two-year period, USG and its authorised representatives downplayed the risk and overpromised profits of the high-risk CFD products.</p>
<p>&lsquo;These entities profited from trades when their customers lost and EuropeFX attempted to argue this was not the case, which the Court firmly rejected.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Account managers at EuropeFX and TradeFred reassured customers that its interests were aligned with that of its customers. However, the Court found that most customers lost money, and in up to 95% to 99% of cases. EuropeFX and TradeFred took the opposite position to customer trades, meaning that they profited when customers lost money on trades.</p>
<p>Justice Wigney stated, &lsquo;I have no hesitation in concluding that EuropeFX&rsquo;s conduct was so far outside societal norms of acceptable behaviour in respect of the provision of financial services as to warrant condemnation as conduct that is offensive to conscience.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The matter has been listed for a case management hearing on 19 February 2025.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Regulators in many jurisdictions have restricted or prohibited the provision to retail investors of certain OTC derivatives, such as binary options, margin foreign exchange and other contracts for difference (CFDs).</p>
<p>In April 2019, ASIC put AFS licensees on notice that in addition to overseas consequences of potential breaches of overseas law, ASIC will consider whether breaching overseas law is consistent with obligations under Australian law to provide services &lsquo;efficiently, honestly and fairly&rsquo; (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2019-releases/19-088mr-some-afs-licensees-may-be-breaking-overseas-laws/" title="19-088MR Some AFS licensees may be breaking overseas laws">19-088MR</a>).</p>
<p>ASIC has made a product intervention order imposing conditions on the issue and distribution of contracts for difference (CFDs) to retail customers (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2020-releases/20-254mr-asic-product-intervention-order-strengthens-cfd-protections/" title="20-254MR ASIC product intervention order strengthens CFD protections">20-254MR</a>).</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s order strengthens consumer protections by reducing CFD leverage available to retail customers and by targeting CFD product features and sales practices that amplify retail customers&rsquo; CFD losses. It also brings Australian practice into line with protections in force in comparable markets elsewhere (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2021-releases/21-060mr-asic-s-cfd-product-intervention-order-takes-effect/" title="21-060MR ASIC&rsquo;s CFD product intervention order takes effect">21-060MR</a>).</p>
<p>USG and its former corporate authorised representatives, EuropeFX and TradeFred operated under USG&rsquo;s AFS licence 302792.</p>
<p>In December 2019, ASIC obtained asset restraint orders in the Federal Court against EuropeFX and TradeFred to protect customers&rsquo; funds while an investigation was underway. USG gave an undertaking to the Court to keep specified monetary amounts in a separate bank account (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2019-releases/19-373mr-interim-asset-restraint-orders-made-against-corporate-authorised-representatives-of-otc-derivatives-provider/" title="19-373MR Interim asset restraint orders made against Corporate Authorised Representatives of OTC derivatives provider">19-373MR</a>). On 8 July 2020, USG entered into voluntary administration; liquidators were appointed on 3 September 2020. On 10 March 2020, TradeFred went into liquidation.</p>
<p>In July 2020, ASIC suspended the AFS licence of USG and in September 2020, ASIC cancelled its AFS licence (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2020-releases/20-216mr-asic-cancels-afs-licence-of-union-standard-international-group/" title="20-216MR ASIC cancels AFS licence of Union Standard International Group">20-216MR</a>).</p>
<p>ASIC commenced these proceedings against USG, TradeFred and EuropeFX in December 2020 (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2020-releases/20-319mr-asic-takes-action-against-union-standard-international-group-and-its-former-corporate-authorised-representatives/" title="20-319MR ASIC takes action against Union Standard International Group and its former corporate authorised representatives">20-319MR</a>).</p>

<title>SEC: Global Aerospace Company AAR And Former Executive Of Its Subsidiary Settle Charges For Bribing Nepalese And South African Officials</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/global-aerospace-company-aar-and-former-executive-of-its-subsidiary-settle-charg/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/global-aerospace-company-aar-and-former-executive-of-its-subsidiary-settle-charg/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Illinois-based AAR CORP., a global provider of aviation services and products, agreed to resolve Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) charges in connection with two bribery schemes. AAR agreed to pay approximately $30 million to settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges. Deepak Sharma, a former executive of a wholly owned AAR subsidiary, also settled SEC charges related to the same bribery schemes.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, from 2015 through 2018, Deepak Sharma, who at the time was President of International Supply Chain of an AAR subsidiary, orchestrated and implemented a bribery scheme to win a contract for the sale of two Airbus A330 aircraft, valued at approximately $210 million, to Nepal Airlines, a government-owned airline. The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that, as part of the scheme, AAR retained a third-party agent to pay bribes to officials who had control over the contract. According to the order, Sharma was also involved in a bribery scheme involving a contract for AAR to provide aviation services to a subsidiary of government-owned South African Airways. The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that AAR paid millions of dollars in bribes to Nepalese and South African officials as part of the two schemes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, the bribes schemes took place in both Nepal and South Africa, reflecting that a deficient control environment creates fertile ground for mischief that can cross borders,&rdquo; said Charles Cain, Chief of the SEC&rsquo;s FCPA Unit. &ldquo;This matter serves as another reminder that companies must have robust compliance and accounting controls that are commensurate with the FCPA risks they face, including with respect to their work with third parties across their business operations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>AAR consented to the SEC&rsquo;s order finding that it violated the anti-bribery, recordkeeping, and internal accounting controls provisions of the FCPA, and ordering it to pay $29,236,624 in disgorgement and in prejudgment interest. In a parallel action, the U.S. Department of Justice announced today that it has entered into a non-prosecution agreement with AAR in which AAR agreed to pay a $26,363,029 criminal penalty.</p>
<p>Sharma consented to an SEC order finding that he violated the anti-bribery, recordkeeping, and internal accounting controls provisions of the FCPA and ordering him to pay $184,597 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, $130,835 of which is deemed satisfied by a forfeiture order in a prior agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Michelle I. Bougdanos, Jon B. Jordan, Shahriar Masud, and Sonali Singh, and supervised by David Frohlich and Thierry Olivier Desmet. The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission and the Financial Sector Conduct Authority of South Africa.</p>

<title>Treasury International Capital Data For October</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/treasury-international-capital-data-for-october-8/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/treasury-international-capital-data-for-october-8/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury today released Treasury International Capital (TIC) data for October 2024.&nbsp; The next release, which will report on data for November 2024, is scheduled for January 17, 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sum total in October of all net foreign acquisitions of long-term securities, short-term U.S. securities, and banking flows was a net TIC inflow of $203.6 billion. &nbsp;Of this, net foreign private inflows were $220.0 billion, and net foreign official outflows were $16.4 billion.</p>
<p>Foreign residents increased their holdings of long-term U.S. securities in October; their net purchases were $136.3 billion.&nbsp; Net purchases by private foreign investors were $126.6 billion, while net purchases by foreign official institutions were $9.7 billion.</p>
<p>U.S. residents decreased their holdings of long-term foreign securities, with net sales of $15.9 billion.</p>
<p>After including adjustments, such as estimated foreign portfolio acquisitions of U.S. stocks through stock swaps, overall net foreign purchases of long-term securities are estimated to have been $152.3 billion in October.</p>
<p>Foreign residents increased their holdings of U.S. Treasury bills by $13.2 billion.&nbsp; Foreign resident holdings of all dollar-denominated short-term U.S. securities and other custody liabilities increased by $8.5 billion.</p>
<p>Banks&rsquo; own net dollar-denominated liabilities to foreign residents increased&nbsp;by $42.8 billion.</p>
<p>Complete data are available on the Treasury website at:</p>
<p><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/data/treasury-international-capital-tic-system">https://home.treasury.gov/data/treasury-international-capital-tic-system</a></p>
<p>About TIC Data</p>
<p>The monthly data on holdings of long-term securities, as well as the monthly table on Major Foreign Holders of Treasury Securities, reflect foreign holdings of U.S. securities collected primarily on the basis of custodial data.&nbsp; These data help provide a window into foreign ownership of U.S. securities, but they cannot attribute holdings of U.S. securities with complete accuracy.&nbsp; For example, if a U.S. Treasury security purchased by a foreign resident is held in a custodial account in a third country, the true ownership of the security will not be reflected in the data.&nbsp; The custodial data will also not properly attribute U.S. Treasury securities managed by foreign private portfolio managers who invest on behalf of residents of other countries.&nbsp; In addition, foreign countries may hold dollars and other U.S. assets that are not captured in the TIC data.&nbsp; For these reasons, it is difficult to draw precise conclusions from TIC data about changes in the foreign holdings of U.S. financial assets by individual countries.</p>

<title>US Federal Agencies Release Annual Asset-Size Thresholds Under Community Reinvestment Act Regulations</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-federal-agencies-release-annual-asset-size-thresholds-under-community-reinves-3/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation today announced the 2025 updated Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) "small bank" and "intermediate small bank" asset-size thresholds.</p>
<p>The CRA regulations establish the framework and criteria by which the relevant agencies assess a financial institution's record of meeting the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound operations. Financial institutions are evaluated under different CRA examination procedures based upon their asset-size classification. The asset-size thresholds are adjusted annually based on the average change in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), which is a measure of inflation.</p>
<p>As a result of the 2.91 percent increase in the CPI-W for the period ending in November 2024, the CRA asset-size thresholds for small banks and intermediate small banks are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A small bank is an institution that, as of December 31 of either of the prior two calendar years, had assets of less than $1.609 billion.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>An intermediate small bank is a small institution with assets of at least $402 million as of December 31 of both of the prior two calendar years and less than $1.609 billion as of December 31 of either of the prior two calendar years.</li>
</ul>
<p>These thresholds are in effect from January 1, 2025, through December 31, 2025. A list of the current and historical asset-size thresholds is available&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ffiec.gov/cra/">here</a>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published the final technical package for version 4.0 of its reporting framework, which will apply as of the first half of 2025. The package marks the transition to the new Data Point Model (DPM) semantic glossary and introduces the enhanced capabilities of the DPM 2.0 model.</span></p>
<p>The technical package provides the standard specifications that include the validation rules, the data point model (DPM) and the XBRL taxonomies to support the following reporting obligations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reporting of information by issuers of asset-referenced tokens (ARTs) and electronic money tokens (EMTs).</li>
<li>New Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) amending the supervisory reporting framework (COREP templates) to implement the most immediate changes driven by the EU Banking Package (Capital Requirements Regulation - CRR3 and Capital Requirements Directive -CRDVI) published on 19 June in the Official Journal.</li>
<li><a name="_Hlk180088506">Minor amendments to reporting obligations by class 2 investment firms (COREP templates), in alignment with the CRR3/CRDVI changes.</a></li>
<li>Updated requirements for the registers of information under the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) following the adoption by the EU Commission of the&nbsp;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32024R2956">Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/2956</a>&nbsp;with regard to standard templates for the register of information.</li>
</ul>
<p>This draft technical package includes a version of the data dictionary contents in both formats the DPM 1.0 and the new format DPM 2.0.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://eba.europa.eu/risk-analysis-and-data/dpm-data-dictionary">DPM Query Tool</a>&nbsp;has also been updated to reflect the current release.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Background and next steps</h4>
<p>Last year, the EBA announced the migration to DPM 2.0 methodology and published the related documentation. In June this year, the EBA published the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-publishes-its-plan-implementation-data-point-model-20">plans for the migration to DPM 2.0</a>&nbsp;and to the new glossary.</p>
<p>Together with the draft technical package, the EBA published in October a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-10/58b1f18c-5ada-4464-a7fd-04fec2d81230/faq_for_reporting_innovations_and_upcoming_releases.pdf" title="faq_for_reporting_innovations_and_upcoming_releases_Oct 2024.pdf">set of FAQs</a>&nbsp;providing additional explanations.</p>

<title>US Treasury Releases Report On The Uses, Opportunities, And Risks Of Artificial Intelligence In Financial Services</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-treasury-releases-report-on-the-uses-opportunities-and-risks-of-artificial/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-treasury-releases-report-on-the-uses-opportunities-and-risks-of-artificial/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) released a&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Artificial-Intelligence-in-Financial-Services.pdf">report</a>&nbsp;following the issuance of its 2024 Request for Information (RFI) on the Uses, Opportunities, and Risks of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Financial Services, which summarizes key themes from respondent feedback and recommends several next steps. The report highlights increasing AI use throughout the financial sector and underscores the potential for AI &ndash; including Generative AI &ndash; to broaden opportunities while amplifying certain risks, such as risks related to data privacy, bias, and third-party providers. The report builds on Treasury&rsquo;s work on AI-related cybersecurity risks in the financial sector, including its&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Managing-Artificial-Intelligence-Specific-Cybersecurity-Risks-In-The-Financial-Services-Sector.pdf">March 2024 report</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through this AI RFI, Treasury continues to engage with stakeholders to deepen its understanding of current uses, opportunities, and associated risks of AI in the financial sector,&rdquo; said Under Secretary for Domestic Finance Nellie Liang. &ldquo;The Biden Administration believes that continued stakeholder engagement like this is important to fostering innovation in financial services while mitigating potential risks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The report issued today outlines potential next steps to be considered by Treasury, government agencies, and the financial services sector. Specifically, the report recommends:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continuing international and domestic collaboration among governments, regulators, and the financial services sector to promote consistent and robust standards for uses of AI in the financial services sector;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Further analysis and stakeholder engagement to explore solutions for any gaps in the existing regulatory frameworks, and to address the potential risk of AI causing consumer harm;</li>
<li>Financial regulators continue coordinating to identify potential enhancements to existing risk management frameworks and working with other government agencies to clarify supervisory expectations on the application of frameworks and standards, where appropriate;</li>
<li>The financial services sector and government agencies further facilitate financial services-specific AI information sharing, alongside the AI cybersecurity forum recommended in Treasury&rsquo;s AI Cybersecurity report, to develop data standards, share risk management best practices, and enhance understanding of emerging AI technologies in financial services; and</li>
<li>Financial firms prioritize their review of AI use cases for compliance with existing laws and regulations before deployment and that they periodically reevaluate compliance as needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Treasury published the&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Treasury-AI-RFI-financial-sector-2024.pdf">AI RFI</a>&nbsp;on June 12, 2024, and received 103 comment letters in response from a variety of stakeholders, including financial firms, consumer advocacy groups, technology providers, financial technology companies, trade associations, and consulting firms.&nbsp;</p>

<title>The Bank Of England Welcomes API Panel Of Expert Recommendations To Enhance Cross-Border Payments</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-bank-of-england-welcomes-api-panel-of-expert-recommendations-to-enhance-cros/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Bank of England welcomes the October 2024 publication of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d224.htm"><strong>Promoting the harmonisation of application programming interfaces to enhance cross-border payments: recommendations and toolkit</strong></a>. This report to the G20 by the Bank for International Settlements&rsquo; Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) presents recommendations for the development of payment APIs and proposes actions for their implementation. The recommendations have been developed by the CPMI-commissioned &lsquo;<a href="https://www.bis.org/press/p230530.htm"><strong>API Panel of Experts</strong></a>&rsquo; (APEX), a public-private sector collaboration of influential representatives of the payment API ecosystem. APEX is chaired by Will Lovell, Senior Technical Advisor - CBDC, Data &amp; Payments at the Bank of England.</p>
<p>The recommendations in the report and their associated action items are a timely and practical push for increased harmonisation of APIs in cross-border payments. This has the potential to enhance the speed, transparency, and accessibility of cross-border payments in line with the objectives of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/cpmi/cross_border.htm?m=122"><strong>G20&rsquo;s cross-border payments programme</strong></a>.</p>
<p>As an active contributor to APEX, the Bank of England looks forward to continued collaboration with the CPMI and other stakeholders in encouraging greater harmonisation of APIs in cross-border payments. This includes lending support to implementing the report&rsquo;s recommendations to the greatest extent possible and encouraging other stakeholders to do the same. The Bank of England is also ensuring that the development of its own payment APIs, as part of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/payment-and-settlement/rtgs-future-roadmap"><strong>future roadmap for RTGS</strong></a>, reflect the recommendations of the report.</p>

<p>In 2022, Moreld participated in&nbsp;<em>IPOready</em>, Euronext&rsquo;s pan-European educational programme designed to support companies preparing for a listing. Euronext&rsquo;s pre-IPO programmes have a strong track record, with over 920 alumni trained since 2015. To date, 32 participants have successfully listed their companies on Euronext markets, with Moreld becoming the second Norwegian alumnus to do so.</p>
<p>Geir Austigard, CEO of Moreld, said:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;With almost NOK 9 billion in revenue and a customer base of highly respected and ambitious energy companies, Moreld has reached a stage and scale where listing is a logical next step. On Euronext Growth and with a subsequent potential uplisting to a fully regulated marketplace, the Company will benefit from access to capital and market visibility. We will provide investors exposure to our attractive business model and high growth markets. Our asset-light business model results in strong cash flow generation, which means we will be well positioned to pay dividends, providing an attractive balance of growth and direct return for investors.&rdquo;</em></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Capital Market Authority (CMA) announces the launch of the fourth batch of the Research Agenda Program for 2025, in its new and comprehensive form, with the establishment of the scientific committee formed by the CMA's Board last July, and the amendment of the mechanism for receiving research proposals to be in 3 periods during the year, in addition to identifying a number of proposed research areas for the fourth edition.</p>
<p>Through the Research Agenda Program, CMA aims to enhance the presence of the Saudi capital market in scientific literature, promote knowledge exchange between researchers and academics on one hand and practitioners in the capital market sector on the other, improve the quality of research and studies, and support policy-making and decision-making based on scientific research. Additionally, the program contributes to raising financial literacy and awareness among participants in the capital market.</p>
<p>Starting with the current batch of the Research Agenda Program, researchers will have the opportunity not only to submit proposals within the approved research areas but also to propose topics and areas outside of the predefined categories that they believe are important to the capital market and the CMA's core functions.</p>
<p>The proposed research areas for the current batch, as approved by the Scientific Committee, include: Capital Market and Market Microstructure, Derivatives Securities and Other Investment Products, Policy Impact Assessment, Behavioral Finance, Capital Market Institutions, Institutional and Foreign Investment, in addition to other topics and research areas suggested by applicants.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that, as part of the CMA's continuous efforts to develop the research agenda program and starting from the current batch 2025, the opportunity will be available to receive research proposals all year round, provided that the CMA shall review the said proposals within three periods; mid of January 2025, mid of March 2025 and mid of June 2025.</p>
<p>The 2025 Research Agenda Program reflects the CMA's commitment to its societal responsibility towards the research community, participants in the capital market, and other stakeholders. The program is part of the CMA's ongoing efforts to achieve the desired level of high-quality research outputs related to the capital market at the national level. Through the program, the CMA provides both technical and financial support for the completion of selected research projects and works to offer the necessary information and data to facilitate scientific research.&nbsp;​</p>
<p>Since its launch in 2021, the program has achieved a number of successes, most notably expanding the scope of research cooperation with a large number of researchers affiliated with local and international academic institutions and research centers, in addition to increasing the number of research and studies published on the CMA's official website as well as publishing in scientific journals, which was positively reflected in achieving the objectives of the Research Agenda Program.</p>
<p>During the previous three editions of the program, the CMA received approximately 130 research proposals involving about 132 researchers from Saudi universities, compared to 50 international researchers affiliated with foreign academic institutions. Additionally, 20 researchers from other entities, including research centers and specialized institutes, participated. Several accepted studies were published on the CMA's website, and some were used to support policy-making and decision-making within the CMA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding the academic qualifications of applicants in previous editions, 170 researchers held doctoral degrees. The experience levels of the applicants varied, with most having between 10&ndash;20 years of experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CMA invites researchers locally and internationally to submit their research proposals in the suggested areas through the designated electronic form by:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Visiting the official CMA website.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Downloading, completing, and submitting the research proposal form via email: Research.agenda@cma.org.sa</p>

This collaboration reinforces our shared commitment to leveraging innovative solutions that streamline communication processes in a secure and trusted manner supporting the UAE&rsquo;s vision for a digitally interconnected ecosystem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wayn&rsquo; was accredited as a &lsquo;Secure Digital Communication Channel&rsquo; by the UAE Cybersecurity Council and is part of a series of strategic partnerships to support the UAE's digital transformation agenda and enhance digital security. By simplifying document handling through the unified digital mailbox and automated archiving system, ADX will strengthen its security through advanced encryption and identity verification.</p>

<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/interactive-brokers-enhances-web-based-trading-experience-for-financial-advisors/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/interactive-brokers-enhances-web-based-trading-experience-for-financial-advisors/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/home.php" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Interactive Brokers</a>&nbsp;(Nasdaq: IBKR), an automated global electronic broker, has introduced significant enhancements to its web-based&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/general/flexible-client-management.php" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Advisor Portal</a>, bringing advanced trading and portfolio management tools to financial advisors worldwide. These updates streamline client account management and trading by integrating powerful features from the company&rsquo;s flagship desktop platform into its web-based offering.</p>
<p>The latest enhancements include tools like Portfolio View, Allocation, Rebalance, and Tax Loss Harvesting, all designed to help advisors optimize client portfolios efficiently. Additionally, US-based advisors can now access the AI Commentary Generator, a cutting-edge generative AI tool that simplifies the creation of custom portfolio performance reports and market commentary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our web-based Advisor Portal is now more powerful than ever, offering advisors the same robust trading and portfolio management experience they&rsquo;ve come to expect from our desktop platform,&rdquo; said Steve Sanders, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Product Development. &ldquo;With tools like the AI-powered Commentary Generator, we&rsquo;re empowering advisors to save time, deliver value, and focus on what matters most: their clients.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Advisor Portal gives financial advisors web-based access to Interactive Brokers&rsquo; technology and other resources at no charge, including:&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/portfolioanalyst/overview.php" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">PortfolioAnalyst&reg;</a>,&nbsp;a client relationship management (CRM) dashboard, activity statements, QuickTrade, Investors&rsquo; Marketplace and more. The latest enhancements bring industry-leading trading tools from its&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/tws.php" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Trader Workstation</a>&nbsp;desktop platform to the web-based portal:<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Portfolio View</b>&nbsp;provides an overview of&nbsp;client account performance, giving advisors the ability to drill down by individual positions or accounts. Advisors can choose to view values in the native currency of the security or account, or in their own master base currency.</li>
<li><b>Allocation Order</b>&nbsp;allows a single stock order to be distributed across multiple accounts. Advisors can choose to customize the allocation themselves or can use one of 14 allocation algorithms.</li>
<li>With&nbsp;<b>Rebalance</b>, advisors can adjust multiple positions across multiple accounts using target allocation percentages.</li>
<li><b>Models</b>&nbsp;enable advisors to manage different portfolio strategies and invest accounts in them in a scalable way. Advisors create their investment models, define their target positions and the tool generates orders to align selected client accounts to the target positions.&nbsp; Positions can be adjusted at any time and the model rebalance tool can realign client allocations as needed.</li>
<li><b>Tax Loss Harvesting</b>&nbsp;scans advisors&rsquo; client accounts for harvesting opportunities, in accordance with US tax laws. Advisors can search for losses at the entire position level, lot level, and within short- or long-term capital losses.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Introducing the AI Commentary Generator</b></p>
<p>US-based financial advisors can easily create custom portfolio performance reports and market commentary using the AI Commentary Generator, a new generative AI-enabled tool available through the Advisor Portal. The AI Commentary Generator is integrated with PortfolioAnalyst reporting and is designed to help &ndash; not replace &ndash; advisors with client portfolio performance reporting, market updates and ticker-specific news.</p>
<p>By combing through dozens of sources and citing them for the advisor&rsquo;s convenience, the AI Commentary Generator conducts research in seconds that would otherwise take hours to complete.</p>
<p>The AI Commentary Generator provides four sections of content:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Portfolio Summary</b>&nbsp;identifies and describes the performance of the five best performing holdings, five worst performing holdings, and five highest concentrated holdings in the selected account.</li>
<li><b>Portfolio News and Trends</b>&nbsp;searches for, and summarizes, publicly available information for news relating to the holdings identified in Portfolio Summary.</li>
<li><b>Macro Update</b>&nbsp;summarizes content from the Federal Reserve's Beige Book as well as Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)&nbsp;meeting notes.</li>
<li><b>Economic and Market Outlook&nbsp;</b>searches publicly available information for all market news and provides a summary.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interactive Brokers&rsquo; free portfolio management offering, PortfolioAnalyst, offers a unified and holistic view of client accounts plus an extensive selection of reporting and analytics content. It enables advisors to consolidate their clients&rsquo; finances from over 15,000 financial institutions, assess client portfolios and simplify investment decision-making.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited about our clients&rsquo; early response to the AI Commentary Generator in the US and look forward to rolling it out to advisors worldwide,&rdquo; said Sanders. &ldquo;Interactive Brokers is always looking for new ways to apply innovation and automation to help advisors everywhere be more efficient and more engaged with their clients.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The AI Commentary Generator is only available to US-based financial advisors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today, ACER issues its&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtTUAdUUVQHW0xaBFZWHVYLAwUdUF8BVxoDAABSBAcFBFQJVAYdAlEGUglXA1IdAA4EVR0GDAADGldTAgAZBQBTAgcABVhRAFBRRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Opinion</a>&nbsp;on the draft statutory documents proposed by future hydrogen transmission network operators to formally establish the European Network of Network Operators for Hydrogen (ENNOH) as an association under the Belgian law.</p>
<p>As an independent body, ENNOH will be responsible for fostering collaboration among hydrogen transmission network operators across the EU.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What&rsquo;s the role of ACER?</span></p>
<p>ACER is mandated to provide an Opinion on ENNOH&rsquo;s draft statutory documents, which&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtUVVNUAgJdVUxcAAZSHVZaUwUdUA8HVRoABwsPAlUMAAECBFIdAlEGUglXA1IdAA4EVR0GDAADGldTAgAZBQBTAgcABVhRAFBRRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">were submitted at the end of August</a>.</p>
<p>ACER conducted a public consultation from 23 September to 21 October 2024, seeking views from organisations representing all stakeholders, in particular hydrogen system users, including customers. All responses received are available on the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsCBQ4DAFYCUkwOUgYHHVZbDVAdC19VXhpQVVIPUgcEDgYAAAMdAlEGUglXA1IdAA4EVR0GDAADGldTAgAZBQBTAgcABVhRAFBRRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">consultation page</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is the main conclusion?</span></p>
<p>ACER welcomes the draft statutory documents received, and suggests how to enhance them to further support the establishment of ENNOH. ACER highlights, however, that a crucial factor for success lies in the timely and committed transposition of certification provisions from the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsFBFUCUQRdAkwKVQxWHVZbBgMdClsHXhoMBAtUAQUEAlIDBVIdAlEGUglXA1IdAA4EVR0GDAADGldTAgAZBQBTAgcABVhRAFBRRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Hydrogen and Decarbonised Gas Market Directive</a>&nbsp;by the Member States. This responsibility, ACER notes, rests with the relevant ministries, not ENNOH or its members.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the next steps?</span></p>
<p>This ACER&rsquo;s Opinion is addressed to the European Commission, which now has three months to provide its opinion. Should the Commission&rsquo;s opinion be favourable, future hydrogen transmission network operators will have three months to adopt and publish the statutory documents.</p>

<h2>Monetary Policy Summary, December 2024</h2>
<p>The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. The MPC adopts a medium-term and forward-looking approach to determine the monetary stance required to achieve the inflation target sustainably.</p>
<p>At its meeting ending on 18 December 2024, the MPC voted by a majority of 6&ndash;3 to maintain Bank Rate at 4.75%. Three members preferred to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 4.5%.</p>
<p>Since the MPC&rsquo;s previous meeting,&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk185083294"></a>twelve-month CPI inflation has increased to 2.6% in November from 1.7% in September. This was slightly higher than previous expectations, owing in large part to stronger inflation in core goods and food. Services consumer price inflation has remained elevated. Headline CPI inflation is expected to continue to rise slightly in the near term. Although household inflation expectations have largely normalised, some indicators have increased recently.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk185083218"></a>Most indicators of UK near-term activity have declined. Bank staff expect GDP growth to have been weaker at the end of the year than projected in the November Monetary Policy Report. The Committee now judges that the labour market is broadly in balance.&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk185319871"></a>Annual private sector regular average weekly earnings growth picked up quite sharply in the three months to October, but has tended to be more volatile than other wage indicators. The latest Agents&rsquo; intelligence suggests that average pay settlements in 2025 will be within a range of 3 to 4%. There remains significant uncertainty around developments in the labour market.</p>
<p>Monetary policy has been guided by the need to squeeze remaining inflationary pressures out of the economy to achieve the 2% target both in a timely manner and on a lasting basis. Over recent quarters there has been progress in disinflation, particularly as previous external shocks have abated, although remaining domestic inflationary pressures are resolving more slowly.</p>
<p>The Committee continues to consider a range of cases for how the past global shocks that drove up inflation may unwind, and therefore how persistent domestic inflationary pressures may be.&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk181735075"></a>The MPC is also monitoring the impact on growth and inflationary pressures from the measures announced in the Autumn Budget, and from geopolitical tensions and trade policy uncertainty. These developments have generated additional uncertainties around the economic outlook.</p>
<p>At this meeting, the Committee voted to maintain Bank Rate at 4.75%.</p>
<p>The Committee continues to monitor closely the risks of inflation persistence and will assess the extent to which the evolving evidence is consistent with more constrained supply, which could sustain inflationary pressures, or with weaker demand, which could lead to the emergence of spare capacity in the economy and push down inflation. A gradual approach to removing monetary policy restraint remains appropriate. Monetary policy will need to continue to remain restrictive for sufficiently long until the risks to inflation returning sustainably to the 2% target in the medium term have dissipated further. The Committee will decide the appropriate degree of monetary policy restrictiveness at each meeting.</p>
</section><section class="page-section">
<h2>Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 18 December 2024</h2>
<p>1: Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices.</p>
<h3>The international economy</h3>
<p>2: UK-weighted global GDP was estimated to have grown by 0.5% in 2024 Q3, marginally higher than the projection in the November Monetary Policy Report. On balance, the risks around the near-term outlook for activity in a number of advanced economies remained to the downside. Euro-area GDP had grown by 0.4% in the third quarter, higher than the November Report projections and supported by household consumption. Growth was expected to slow in Q4, however, in line with weakness in the output PMIs, particularly in France and Germany. US GDP had increased by 0.7% in Q3, in line with the November Report projections, and was expected to cool slightly in Q4. In China, GDP had grown by 0.9% in Q3, a rebound from Q2, owing to stronger exports. Growth was expected to recover further, partly supported by additional policy stimulus.</p>
<p>3: The euro-area labour market had remained tight but had continued to normalise, while the labour market in the United States had remained close to balance. Unemployment in these regions remained at or near historical lows. Indicators of pay growth had generally cooled in the euro area, albeit with an increase in negotiated wage growth in 2024 Q3 that was attributable largely to one-off payments in Germany. Recent indicators of wage growth in the United States had been mixed.</p>
<p>4: Headline consumer price inflation in advanced economies had increased slightly, close to market expectations. In the euro area, twelve-month HICP inflation had increased to 2.2% in November, accounted for largely by an energy-related base effect, while core inflation had remained unchanged at 2.7%. In the United States, PCE inflation had risen slightly to 2.3% in October, while core PCE inflation had also increased slightly to 2.8%. These increases had been accounted for partly by core services excluding housing.</p>
<p>5: Since the MPC&rsquo;s November meeting, European wholesale gas prices had initially increased sharply, owing to colder weather, strong demand from Asia and disruption in the provision of Russian-owned gas supplies. These price increases had largely reversed by the time of the MPC&rsquo;s December decision.</p>
<p>6: The Committee discussed risks to global growth and inflation stemming from geopolitical tensions and trade policy uncertainty, with indicators of the latter having increased materially. The incoming US administration had proposed to increase tariffs in a manner that could influence future global trade if applied and, as a result, have some direct and indirect impacts on the UK economy. The magnitude and direction of any such impacts would depend on a range of factors that were at present unknown, including the total package of economic policies to be delivered in the United States, their timing and any subsequent policy responses from other countries.</p>
<h3>Monetary and financial conditions</h3>
<p><a id="_Hlk184899046"></a>7: Market-implied paths for policy rates in the United States and euro area had ended the period since the MPC&rsquo;s previous meeting a little lower. That reflected, in particular, weaker-than-expected global activity data. Corporate bond spreads were little changed across these economies, while equity prices had increased slightly. At its meeting on 12 December, the ECB Governing Council had reduced its key policy rate by 25 basis points, in line with market expectations. At its meeting ending on 18 December, the FOMC was expected to reduce the federal funds rate by 25 basis points.</p>
<p>8: In the United Kingdom, near-term market expectations for Bank Rate had increased since the MPC&rsquo;s previous meeting, predominantly reflecting stronger-than-expected wage data. The sterling effective exchange rate was little changed. Within that, sterling had depreciated by 2% against the dollar, offsetting an appreciation against the euro of around 1%.</p>
<p>9: More generally, market expectations for policy rates in the United Kingdom and United States had increasingly diverged from the euro area since September. The euro-area path had shifted down and had become more steeply downward sloping, while the UK and US paths had shifted up and had become shallower. In the United Kingdom and United States, rates were expected to be around 3.75 to 4% in three years&rsquo; time, compared with 2% in the euro area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>10: The August and November Bank Rate reductions, and associated changes in other risk-free reference rates, had continued to pass through to the relevant saving and borrowing rates facing households and corporates, broadly in line with historical experience. The main exception had been household sight deposit rates, which had fallen by less and more slowly than Bank Rate since August. Historically, such reductions in Bank Rate had been associated with full and fairly rapid pass-through to sight deposit rates, although these rates had not risen by as much as Bank Rate during the most recent tightening cycle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11: Housing market activity had continued to pick up, with mortgage approvals for house purchase having risen back to their pre-pandemic average in October. That reflected, in part, declines in the average rate paid on new mortgages since quoted rates had peaked in mid-2023. Over the same period, however, the average rate paid on all outstanding mortgages had continued to increase as the majority of fixed-term mortgages were refinanced on to higher rates. As noted in the November Financial Stability Report, 37% of fixed rate mortgage accounts had not yet re-fixed since rates had started to rise in 2021 H2, so the full impact of higher interest rates had not yet passed through to all mortgagors.</p>
<p>12: Household broad money balances had grown unusually strongly in October. There had been evidence of deposits flowing to households from Non-Intermediary Other Financial Companies, which included asset managers, insurance companies and pension funds. Recent overall trends in broad money had been little changed, however, with annual growth in M4ex increasing only slightly to 3.4%. The ratio of household money to gross domestic income remained close to its pre-pandemic trend.</p>
<h3>Demand and output</h3>
<p>13: UK GDP had risen by 0.1% in 2024 Q3, slightly weaker than the 0.2% that had been expected in the November Monetary Policy Report. Within the expenditure components, household consumption had been estimated to have grown by &frac12;%, and government spending and business investment had each risen by around 1%.</p>
<p>14: GDP had declined by 0.1% in October after a similar-sized fall in September. Manufacturing output had contracted by 0.6% in October, while services output had been flat on the month. Market sector output had now fallen back to around a level that had last been observed in April.</p>
<p>15: Most indicators of near-term activity had weakened since the previous MPC meeting. For example, the S&amp;P Global/CIPS UK composite output PMI had fallen back to just over 50 in November and had remained at that level in the December flash release, and there had also been declines in the future output and new orders indices. Both the services and manufacturing PMIs had fallen in recent months, suggesting that a mixture of domestic and global factors was at play. The Bank&rsquo;s Agents had reported that there had been some further deterioration in business sentiment since the previous MPC meeting and that activity was subdued currently, although it was still expected to pick up across the economy next year. In this context, it was notable that sales outcomes reported in the DMP Survey had consistently come in lower than companies&rsquo; expectations of their sales one-year ahead. In contrast to most other indicators, consumer confidence had increased slightly over recent months, though remained below its historical average, and most housing market indicators had been fairly robust.</p>
<p>16: Bank staff now expected zero GDP growth in 2024 Q4, weaker than the 0.3% that had been incorporated in the November Report.&nbsp;That was broadly consistent with the latest combined steer from business surveys and the available official data.</p>
<p>17: The Committee discussed the extent to which recent developments in output could reflect the weakness of both demand and supply, such that there might be fewer implications for the margin of spare capacity in the economy and thus domestic inflationary pressures. There was also uncertainty around how the measures that had been announced in the Autumn Budget were affecting growth. This included the extent to which companies would, over time, take account of the indirect spillovers to private demand from higher public spending, as well as the direct consequences of the increase in employer National Insurance contributions (NICs) that would take effect from April.</p>
<h3>Supply, costs and prices</h3>
<p>18: Low response rates had continued to impart considerable uncertainty to Labour Force Survey (LFS)-based estimates of labour market quantities. In its latest reweighting of key LFS variables, the ONS had incorporated upward revisions to the estimated population of around half a million people. Separately, the ONS had revised up its estimates of net inward migration by over 400,000 people, although that would not be reflected in the LFS for some time. Taken together, these revisions could close around half of the gap between the level of employment implied by pre-revision LFS data and that implied by alternative measures such as workforce jobs. The corollary of these upward revisions to employment would be more pronounced weakness in labour productivity. However, the LFS revisions had had only minimal implications for the historical profile of the underlying rate of unemployment.</p>
<p>19: At a higher frequency, other indicators of unemployment had exhibited some dispersion, but there had been little evidence of a significant increase during the period since the November Monetary Policy Report. Household surveys of job security and advanced notifications of potential redundancies had remained consistent with little net change in the underlying unemployment rate.</p>
<p>20: Vacancies had continued to fall, albeit at a slower pace than in 2023. Bank staff analysis of the difference between the observed ratio of vacancies to unemployment and the ratio of vacancies to unemployment that might be consistent with equilibrium in the labour market, after taking account of, for example, changes in the cost of posting vacancies over time, suggested that the labour market was now broadly in balance. This analysis, which was corroborated by other indicators from the Agents and in the REC survey, signalled less tightness in the current labour market than a simple historical view of the vacancies-to-unemployment ratio would imply.</p>
<p>21: The uncertainty surrounding developments in key labour market quantities and measured labour productivity would limit the extent to which the Committee would be able to draw firm conclusions in its next regular stocktake of the short to medium-term supply capacity of the economy. This was being undertaken ahead of the February Monetary Policy Report.</p>
<p>22: Annual growth in private sector regular average weekly earnings (AWE) had risen from 4.8% in the three months to August to 5.4% in the three months to October. This upside surprise had reflected a combination of greater-than-expected strength on the month and revisions to prior months. Base effects from the previous year would push annual rates of private sector regular AWE growth closer to 6% in 2024 Q4, but this measure of pay growth had often exhibited more volatility than comparable survey-based measures.</p>
<p>23: The signal from most indicators following the announced increases in the National Living Wage (NLW) and employer National Insurance contributions tended to corroborate the view that, supported by diminishing churn, easing recruitment difficulties and an ongoing loosening of the labour market, annual private sector wage growth would slow over the policy-relevant horizon. The Agents&rsquo; intelligence available since the Autumn Budget, for example, suggested that firms in aggregate expected pay settlements in 2025 to sit within a range of 3 to 4%. This was slightly higher than the 2 to 4% range reported before the Budget, but lower than the 5&frac12;% average reported in 2024. The latest evidence from the DMP Survey was also consistent with a softening in wage growth across all sectors, albeit to a plateau of around 4% in aggregate over the year ahead. Expected wage growth in consumer services companies, in particular, had remained elevated at around 5%.</p>
<p>24: Across surveys, firms had reported that their response to higher employer NICs would involve multiple types of adjustment, of which pay growth was but one. In the DMP Survey, for example, higher prices and lower employment were both cited more frequently than lower wages. Moreover, a more granular disaggregation of the results of the DMP Survey suggested that firms with greater exposure to the NLW would be less likely to respond to higher NICs by paying lower wages. These firms would be more likely to respond to higher NICs by raising prices, accepting lower profit margins and/or laying off existing workers.</p>
<p>25: Twelve-month CPI inflation had increased to 2.6% in November from 1.7% in September. This was slightly higher than previous expectations, owing in large part to stronger inflation in core goods and food. Core CPI inflation had increased to 3.5%.</p>
<p>26: Annual services price inflation had been 5.0% in November, little changed from its rate in October and September. The three-month moving averages of annualised monthly increases in a range of underlying services prices had edged higher in November, but had remained lower than their corresponding annual rates. The extent of domestically generated disinflation to date, however, had remained relatively modest.</p>
<p>27: In the near term, headline CPI inflation was expected to continue to rise slightly.</p>
<p>28: Although indicators of households&rsquo; inflation expectations had largely normalised through the first half of this year, short-term expectations had begun to increase again in the latest data. The Bank of England/Ipsos Inflation Attitudes Survey&rsquo;s measure of median one-year ahead inflation expectations had risen to 3.0% in November. The measure of medium-term expectations in the same survey had now edged above its historical average. The Citi/YouGov indicator of households&rsquo; short-term inflation expectations had risen over several months to 3.5%, even while realised CPI inflation had eased. Businesses&rsquo; own price expectations, as reported in the DMP Survey, had remained consistent with only a modest decline in inflation over the coming year, particularly in consumer-facing services sectors.</p>
<p>29: The latest increases in inflation expectations might reflect greater attentiveness among households to cost-of-living increases, such as the reduction in winter fuel payments, higher bus fares and vehicle excise duty, successive increases in the Ofgem price cap in October and January, and higher food prices. These increases might interact with already-elevated inflation perceptions, and thus could add to the persistence of domestic inflationary pressures.</p>
<h3>The immediate policy decision</h3>
<p>30: The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. The MPC adopts a medium-term and forward-looking approach to determine the monetary stance required to achieve the inflation target sustainably.</p>
<p>31: Monetary policy had been guided by the need to squeeze remaining inflationary pressures out of the economy to achieve the 2% target both in a timely manner and on a lasting basis. Over recent quarters there had been progress in disinflation, particularly as previous external shocks had abated, although remaining domestic inflationary pressures were resolving more slowly.</p>
<p>32: As set out in the November Monetary Policy Report, the Committee&rsquo;s deliberations had been supported by the consideration of a range of cases that could impact the evolution of inflation persistence. In the first case, most of the remaining persistence in inflation might dissipate quickly as pay and price-setting dynamics continued to normalise following the unwinding of the global shocks that had driven up inflation. In the second case, a period of economic slack might be required to normalise these dynamics fully. In the third case, some inflationary persistence might also reflect structural shifts in wage and price-setting behaviour. Each case would have different implications for how quickly the restrictiveness of monetary policy could be withdrawn.</p>
<p>33: The MPC was also considering the impact on growth and inflationary pressures from the measures announced in the Autumn Budget, and from geopolitical tensions and trade policy uncertainty. These domestic and global developments had generated additional uncertainties around the economic outlook.</p>
<p>34: As set out in the November Report, the combined effects of the measures announced in the Budget were provisionally expected to boost the level of GDP by around &frac34;%, and CPI inflation by just under &frac12; of a percentage point, at their peaks relative to the August projections. However, there remained significant uncertainty around how the economy might respond to higher overall costs of employment, including from the increase in employer National Insurance contributions and the National Living Wage.</p>
<p>35: The Committee noted that indicators of trade policy uncertainty had increased materially, but that the magnitude and the direction of the impact of any such policies on UK inflation was at present unclear. These effects might not be apparent for some time.</p>
<p>36: Since the MPC&rsquo;s previous meeting, most indicators of UK near-term activity had declined. Bank staff were expecting zero GDP growth in 2024 Q4, weaker than had been projected in the November Monetary Policy Report. Several components of the December S&amp;P Global/CIPS UK flash PMI had fallen, including the new orders and employment indices. Other indicators of employment growth had been more mixed.</p>
<p>37: Although there remained significant uncertainty around developments in labour market quantities derived from the Labour Force Survey, the Committee now judged that the labour market was broadly in balance based on a wider range of evidence. The number of job vacancies had continued to fall, albeit at a slower pace than in 2023. There had also been a decline in indicators of labour market tightness from the Agents and in the REC survey.</p>
<p>38: Annual private sector regular AWE growth had picked up quite sharply in the three months to October, to 5.4%, which was &frac12; of a percentage point stronger than had been expected in the November Report. AWE growth had tended to be more volatile than other wage indicators, however. The latest Agents&rsquo; intelligence suggested that average pay settlements in 2025 would be within a range of 3 to 4%.</p>
<p>39: Twelve-month CPI inflation had increased to 2.6% in November from 1.7% in September, slightly higher than previous expectations. Services consumer price inflation had remained elevated, at 5.0%, while core goods price inflation had risen to 1.1%. Food consumer price inflation had picked up slightly over recent months, to 2%. Some other indicators of goods price inflation had increased, including in the December S&amp;P Global/CIPS UK flash PMI. Headline CPI inflation was expected to continue to rise slightly in the near term.</p>
<p>40: Although household inflation expectations had largely normalised, some indicators had increased recently, in part reflecting developments in energy and food prices as well as other more idiosyncratic factors. Businesses&rsquo; own price expectations had remained consistent with only a modest decline in inflation over the coming year, particularly in consumer-facing services sectors. Monetary policy was acting to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations were anchored at the 2% target.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk185248208"></a>41: At this meeting, six members preferred to maintain Bank Rate at 4.75%. Most indicators of UK near-term activity had weakened, but CPI inflation, wage growth and some indicators of inflation expectations had risen, adding to the risk of inflation persistence. The macroeconomic implications of the higher costs of employment facing companies remained particularly uncertain. Against a backdrop over recent years of a repeated sequence of negative supply shocks, incoming data would help to clarify the potential trade-off between more persistent inflationary pressures and greater weakness in output and employment. For five of these members, recent developments added to the argument for a gradual approach to the withdrawal of policy restrictiveness, while eschewing any commitment to changing policy at a specific meeting. For the other member, the evolution of and prospects for disaggregated measures of activity and inflation could warrant an activist strategy.</p>
<p>42: Three members preferred a 0.25 percentage point reduction in Bank Rate at this meeting. The most recent data developments pointed to sluggish demand and a weakening labour market, now and in the year ahead, both of which would see further downward pressure on demand, wages, and prices. In the short run, these factors, alongside higher uncertainty and weak global conditions, paired with the temporary uptick in headline inflation entailed a policy trade-off. In the medium term, a continued stance that was very restrictive risked deviating unsustainably from the 2% inflation target and opening an unduly large output gap. Given the evolving balance of risks, a less restrictive policy rate was warranted.</p>
<p>43: The Committee continued to monitor closely the risks of inflation persistence and would assess the extent to which the evolving evidence was consistent with more constrained supply, which could sustain inflationary pressures, or with weaker demand, which could lead to the emergence of spare capacity in the economy and push down inflation. A gradual approach to removing monetary policy restraint remained appropriate. Monetary policy would need to continue to remain restrictive for sufficiently long until the risks to inflation returning sustainably to the 2% target in the medium term had dissipated further. The Committee would decide the appropriate degree of monetary policy restrictiveness at each meeting.</p>
<p>44: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bank Rate should be maintained at 4.75%.</li>
</ul>
<p>45: Six members (Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Megan Greene, Clare Lombardelli, Catherine L Mann and Huw Pill) voted in favour of the proposition. Three members (Swati Dhingra, Dave Ramsden and Alan Taylor) voted against the proposition, preferring to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 4.5%.</p>
<h3>Operational considerations</h3>
<p>46: On 18 December 2024, the stock of UK government bonds held for monetary policy purposes was &pound;655 billion.</p>
<p>47: The following members of the Committee were present:</p>

The Outlook focuses also on Europe&rsquo;s preparedness for winter 2024/2025 and summer 2025.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is in ACER&rsquo;s Opinion?</span></p>
<ul>
<li>ACER acknowledges that ENTSOG enlarged the scope of its methodology to include gas supply and storage developments (i.e. strategic reserves based on each Member States&rsquo; regulations, Ukrainian storage as a last resort) and to reconsider the role of LNG regasification terminal tanks for short-term storage flexibility. ACER also supports ENTSOG's efforts to model a &lsquo;low LNG supply scenario&rsquo; that excludes Russian LNG supplies.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>ACER recommends ENTSOG to consider the following methodological improvements: 
<ul>
<li>The inclusion of a qualitative analysis of gas futures prices and summer-winter spreads for better forecasting of potential challenges for market-based filling of gas storages.</li>
<li>Clarify the assumptions and methodology used to build the &lsquo;low LNG supply scenario&rsquo;.</li>
<li>Specify capacities added by newly commissioned projects.</li>
<li>Compare seasonal demand projections with forecasts from other institutions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>ACER highlights the importance of a close cooperation between ENTSOG and ENTSO-E to ensure consistent results in their respective seasonal outlooks. In addition, ACER identified several risk factors for the upcoming year, including: 
<ul>
<li>likely stop of Russian gas transit through Ukraine after 2024;</li>
<li>unusually cold winter;</li>
<li>failure to reduce gas demand.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Apologises To Collateral Investors</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-apologises-to-collateral-investors/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has called for people who may have invested in fraudulent peer-to-peer firm Collateral to come forward to the regulator so they can receive an apology.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<div class="copy-block__call-out">
<p><span>If you invested in Collateral and haven&rsquo;t complained yet, fill out our&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/collateral-complaint" title="Collateral (UK) Ltd: Register a complaint"><span>complaint form</span></a><span>&nbsp;by 31 March 2025.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Collateral offered peer-to-peer style investments. Its directors were able to fraudulently change details about the firms&rsquo; public entry on the FCA&rsquo;s interim permission register. This change made it look like the firm held interim permission from the FCA to undertake consumer credit activities, which were granted to firms who transferred from the OFT to the FCA in 2014, when it did not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The firm applied for full authorisation in March 2016. Opportunities were missed, during this process, to identify that the firm did not hold a valid interim permission and that the interim permission register was incorrect. Once the FCA had knowledge of the issues, it did not act promptly enough to tell the firm to stop regulated business and to correct the register.</p>
<p>Following an investigation, the FCA prosecuted the directors, who were&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/andrew-and-peter-currie-sentenced-combined-8-years-fleecing-consumers-through-collateral-p2p">sentenced to a total of 8 years imprisonment</a>&nbsp;for their role in the fraud in July 2023.</p>
<p>The FCA has received over 300 complaints from investors about failures when dealing with the firm. These include a failure to maintain the correct information on the register and a failure to alert investors when the regulator became aware of the incorrect information.</p>
<p>The FCA has upheld these complaints, has apologised to complainants, and will make payments of &pound;500 to those who invested in Collateral in recognition of the contribution to the distress and inconvenience caused by FCA&rsquo;s errors. Further payments of &pound;150 will be made for delays in complaints handling. The payments are in line with the FCA&rsquo;s complaints scheme and reflect the nature of the failures by the FCA.</p>
<p>The FCA is aware that there may be other Collateral investors who have not complained. The regulator has set up a dedicated complaint form for these people to provide their details, and has called on them to do so before 31 March 2025.</p>
<p>Stephen Braviner Roman, general counsel and executive director of legal, risk, compliance and corporate governance said:</p>
<p>'While the fraudulent actions of Mr and Mr Currie were the cause of Collateral investors' losses, we recognise we could have acted faster. For that we apologise.'&nbsp;</p>

<title>The World Federation Of Exchanges Warns The European Commission Of Discriminatory Impact Of EU Digital Operational Resilience Act</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-world-federation-of-exchanges-warns-the-european-commission-of-discriminator/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-world-federation-of-exchanges-warns-the-european-commission-of-discriminator/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The World Federation of Exchanges (WFE), the global trade association for exchanges and clearing houses, has published a letter to the European Commission on behalf of the Chief Risk and Chief Information Security Officers within its membership. The letter regards the interpretation of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Service providers under the EU&rsquo;s Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), which governs ICT service&nbsp;providers for companies within the EU.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>Whilst the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) have made EU regulated services exempt from being classified as ICT services under DORA, they have indicated that the exemption will not extend to third country regulated financial services.</span><br /><br /><span>The WFE is urging the European Commission to address this discrepancy and adopt a consistent and coherent interpretation of the definition of ICT services under DORA to ensure an effective implementation. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>Without doing this, the Act could have substantial implications and create severe disruption for all types of EU market participants, including asset managers and dealers, receiving financial services from outside the EU. It would also increase the cost of business for EU market participants, reducing access by EU financial entities to non-EU markets, possibly leading to a loss of competitiveness for EU financial entities.</span><br /><br /><strong>Nandini Sukumar, CEO of the World Federation of Exchanges commented,&nbsp;</strong><span>&ldquo;We urge the European Commission to urgently clarify that the same distinction applies to non-EU regulated financial services. Any other outcome would undermine principles of international comity and deference to home country regulation, and recent history has shown that such standoffs are counterproductive. The Commission must take fast action to avoid disruption for consumers, increased costs, and to avoid reducing the competitiveness of the EU compared to other jurisdictions.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>The letter was sent by the WFE on behalf of our Enterprise Risk Working Group (ERWG) and represents the views of the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) and Operational Risk Management (ORM) leadership we convene from the global financial exchanges and clearing houses within our membership. The Working Group develops an industry consensus on ERM/ORM issues to support regulatory responses, stakeholder advocacy, and thought leadership. The ERWG fosters best practices, codes of conduct, and guidelines, while promoting information sharing, education, and benchmarking among members. It works to align global risk management standards and strategies to address common challenges and collaborates closely with the WFE&rsquo;s Cybersecurity Working Group (GLEX), which pursues similar objectives from a cyber-risk perspective.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>Read the full letter&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://world-exchanges.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=48ddcbc11eb58f141a51219ea&amp;id=8d1aa9e861&amp;e=979576350c" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

<title>CLS Welcomes NYK Line To CLSSettlement As A Third-Party Participant</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cls-welcomes-nyk-line-to-clssettlement-as-a-third-party-participant/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cls-welcomes-nyk-line-to-clssettlement-as-a-third-party-participant/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>CLS, a financial market infrastructure group delivering settlement, processing, and data solutions, announced today that NYK Line, a global shipping and logistics company in Japan, has gained access to CLSSettlement as a third-party participant. By participating in CLSSettlement, NYK Line can access the highest standards of FX settlement risk mitigation while also benefiting from improved funding and operational efficiencies through CLS&rsquo;s unique PvP system.</p>
<p>The company is settling its FX transactions in CLSSettlement via its third-party service provider, MUFG Bank (TKY), supported by Bloomberg FXGO&reg; Confirmation and Settlement Services (&ldquo;FXGO-CMS&rdquo;). CMS is part of an electronic functionality provided by Bloomberg&rsquo;s FXGO that enables online reconciliation of foreign exchange transactions between dealers and their clients. NYK Line will now benefit from the enhanced liquidity and flexibility in FX execution provided by CLS&rsquo;s settlement service.</p>
<p>The collaboration with MUFG and Bloomberg will also help streamline their FX matching and execution needs, allowing NYK Line to further optimize and safeguard its treasury and currency management functions. NYK Line&rsquo;s participation highlights the growing adoption of CLSSettlement by corporates in Japan and demonstrates the commitment to improving the overall efficiency and safety of the FX market in the Asia Pacific region.</p>
<p><b>Lisa Danino-Lewis, Chief Growth Officer at CLS</b>, commented: &ldquo;By using CLSSettlement, NYK Line and other large multinational corporates can enhance their risk management, FX operations, cash management and settlement processes. This latest development is seen as a progressive approach for Japanese companies, as it allows them to effectively manage their treasury functions and align with market best practices.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Takashi Kurokawa, General Manager of Finance Group at NYK Line commented:&nbsp;</b>&ldquo;By accessing CLSSettlement through MUFG and utilizing Bloomberg&rsquo;s matching service, we expect to further reform our operations and strengthen our cost competitiveness. We also feel that there is great potential, and we look forward to future results.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is critical that all market participants strive to adopt global best practices that mitigate risks and establish stronger controls. Industry initiatives such as the FX Global Code have motivated FX market participants, including those in Asia and across the globe, to adopt a best practice approach to settlement and post-trade processing.</p>

<title>Rule Changes Proposed By UK Financial Conduct Authority To Boost Investment</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/rule-changes-proposed-by-uk-financial-conduct-authority-to-boost-investment/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/rule-changes-proposed-by-uk-financial-conduct-authority-to-boost-investment/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has set out plans to simplify the information supplied to investors to boost confidence and drive investment.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>Under the current rules, introduced across Europe when the UK was in the EU, people buying investments like investment funds are supplied with standardised documents covering prescribed information.</p>
<p>In practice these documents were often complex, unclear, and could miss important points. This could put people off investing or lead them to make less informed decisions.</p>
<p>The FCA has proposed replacing this with a simpler and flexible system which is tailored to the UK. Firms will be given more choice about how, what and when they communicate.</p>
<p>The FCA has also set out some detailed requirements where it is really necessary to ensure consistency and comparability across the market to help consumers.</p>
<p>Under the proposals, new product information requirements would help consumers understand the products they are buying while giving firms flexibility to innovate.</p>
<p>Simon Walls, interim executive director of markets at the FCA, said: &nbsp;</p>
<p>'The way people invest has changed. We want to ensure that firms can communicate with their customers in a way that gets them the information they need when they need it.</p>
<p>'High quality product information will give consumers the confidence to invest; increased participation in this market will not only benefit consumers but will also provide capital to drive the economy and boost growth.'</p>
<p>The proposals set out the FCA&rsquo;s ambition of building a new, bolder regime, and it is open-minded about how it can be designed.</p>
<p>It welcomes views through the consultation about how best to design an outcomes-focused regulation that is fit for many years to come.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ol>
<li>Read&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/consultation-papers/cp24-30-new-product-information-framework-consumer-composite-investments" title="CP24/30: A new product information framework for Consumer Composite Investments">CP24/30: A new product information framework for Consumer Composite Investments</a>.</li>
<li>Stakeholders are invited to respond to this paper by 20 March 2025.</li>
<li>More than 12.6 million UK investors (23% of all adults) hold an investment falling within what we call a Consumer Composite Investment (CCI), (FCA&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/data/financial-lives-survey" title="Financial Lives survey">Financial Lives survey</a>, 2024).</li>
<li>The Government and FCA are committed to replacing the EU-inherited regulation with a new flexible and proportionate product information framework tailored to UK markets and firms.</li>
<li>The consultation follows the Treasury&rsquo;s action to replace the Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products (PRIIPs) Regulation and the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) disclosure requirements with a more flexible, outcome-focused approach governed by the FCA.</li>
<li>The Treasury laid the final Statutory Instrument (SI) to give this effect on November 22, 2024. Products formerly under the PRIIPs regime and UCITS disclosure requirements, including funds in the Overseas Funds Regime (OFR), will now fall under the umbrella of CCIs. All CCI product information rules will be in the FCA Handbook.</li>
<li>The CCI regime includes products such as closed and open-ended investment funds, structured products, contracts for difference (CfDs), derivatives, and insurance-based investment products (IBIPs).</li>

<title>HKEX: Exchange Publishes Consultation Paper On Proposals To Optimise IPO Price Discovery And Open Market Requirements</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li class="spanHeading"><span>The Exchange publishes proposals to review the regulatory framework relating to&nbsp;</span><span>IPO price discovery and open market requirements</span></li>
<li class="spanHeading"><span>Proposals aim to enhance</span><span>&nbsp;current requirements and mechanisms to&nbsp;</span><span>boost</span><span>&nbsp;the competitiveness of the Hong Kong listed securities market</span></li>
<li class="spanHeading"><span>Consultation period lasts for three months until 19 March 2025</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the Exchange), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX), today (Thursday) published a&nbsp;<span><span><a href="https://www.hkex.com.hk/-/media/HKEX-Market/News/Market-Consultations/2016-Present/December-2024-Optimise-IPO-Price/Consultation-Paper/cp202412.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">consultation paper</a></span></span>&nbsp;seeking market feedback on&nbsp;</span><span>proposals to optimise IPO price discovery and open market</span><span>&nbsp;requirements (the Consultation Paper). The consultation window is open for a three-month period, concluding on Wednesday, 19 March 2025.</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>The Exchange&rsquo;s proposals represent a holistic reform of its regulatory framework relating to the IPO price discovery process&nbsp;</span><span>and open market requirements, ensuring its listing mechanism remains attractive and competitive for existing and prospective issuers</span><span>. In particular</span><span>, the Exchange proposes to</span><span>:</span></p>
<ol>
<li class="spanHeading"><span>Optimise the price discovery</span><span>&nbsp;process for IPOs&nbsp;</span><span>to increase the participation of &ldquo;price setting&rdquo; investors, thereby reducing the likelihood of the final offer price being set at a large disparity to the actual trading price when dealings in those shares commence.</span></li>
<li class="spanHeading"><span>Review open market requirements</span><span>,</span>&nbsp;<span>ensur</span><span>ing</span><span>&nbsp;issuers will have sufficient shares in public hands that are available for trading</span>&nbsp;<span>at listing, whilst relaxing certain percentage thresholds which would imply a bar that may be too high in absolute dollar value.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>HKEX Head of Listing, Katherine Ng, said: &ldquo;At HKEX, we are committed to maintaining a robust and competitive new listing and ongoing listing framework, underpinning Hong Kong as a global leading capital raising centre. We are delighted to be proposing new requirements to enhance the IPO pricing and offering mechanism, supporting high quality companies from around the world to list and thrive in Hong Kong&rsquo;s vibrant capital market.&nbsp;</span><span>As p</span><span>art of our ongoing efforts to ensure that our listing regime is fit for purpose and meets the needs of a constantly evolving market, we are also proposing changes to the open market requirements that will solidify our reputation as an open, transparent and attractive market to issuers and investors around the world.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><strong>About the Market Cap Segments</strong></p>
<p>Companies belong to a market cap segment (Small-, Mid- and Large Cap) based on their average market value during the given review month.&nbsp;Each segment is reviewed annually based on the average market cap in November&nbsp;with adjustments taking effect in January the following year. The market cap calculations are based on the total number of shares, i.e., both listed and non-listed shares, of a company. Companies with a market value exceeding EUR 1 billion are in the group of &ldquo;Large Cap&rdquo;, while companies with a market value between EUR 150 million and EUR 1 billion belong to the &ldquo;Mid Cap&rdquo; segment. Companies with a market value smaller than EUR 150 million belong to &ldquo;Small Cap&rdquo;.</p>
<p>12-month transitional period</p>
<p>Companies whose market cap has moved outside the reference values for their current classification are moved between segments according to the following rule: If their market cap is less than 50 percent of the minimum or more than 150 percent of the maximum threshold of their current segments they are transferred into a new segment with immediate effect. On the other hand, if their market cap is greater than 50 percent of the minimum or less than 150 percent of the maximum threshold of their current segment, they are subject to a transitional period and thus one more review before transferring into a new segment. Hence, based on the EUR 1 billion Large Cap and EUR 150 million Mid Cap thresholds, a Large Cap company whose market cap value has not fallen below EUR 500 million, and a Mid-cap company whose market cap value has not fallen below EUR 75 million, are subject to a second review before moving down to the new segment. Similarly, a Mid Cap company whose market cap value has not exceeded EUR 1.5 billion and a Small-cap company whose market cap value has not exceeded EUR 225 million, are subject to a second review before moving up to the new segment.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority: Firms Given Until December 2025 To Respond To Motor Finance Commission Complaints</title>

<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The extension will help prevent disorderly, inconsistent and inefficient outcomes for consumers and firms.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/ps24-18-further-temporary-changes-handling-rules-motor-finance-complaints" title="PS24/18: Further temporary changes to handling rules for motor finance complaints">extended the time firms have to respond to complaints</a>&nbsp;about motor finance agreements not involving a discretionary commission arrangement (DCA). Firms now have until after 4 December 2025 to provide a final response to non-DCAs, in line with the extension we have already provided for complaints involving DCAs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The extension follows the&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://assets.caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2024/1282/ewca_civ_2024_1282.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">judgment of the Court of Appeal<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;on 25 October 2024 in 3 motor finance cases. In that case, the Court decided it was unlawful for the car dealers to receive a commission from lenders providing motor finance without first telling the customer about the commission and getting their informed consent to the payment. The focus of the Court of Appeal decision was common law, equitable principles and the Consumer Credit Act, rather than FCA rules.</p>
<p>Firms who provide motor finance are likely to receive a high volume of complaints in response to the judgment. We have extended the time firms have to handle complaints to help prevent disorderly, inconsistent and inefficient outcomes for consumers and firms.</p>
<p>On 11 December 2024, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/supreme-court-motor-finance-announcement" title="FCA statement on Supreme Court motor finance announcement">Supreme Court confirmed it would hear an appeal</a>&nbsp;against the Court of Appeal&rsquo;s judgment. We previously&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/correspondence/fca-letter-supreme-court-december-2024.pdf" title="fca-letter-supreme-court-december-2024.pdf">wrote to the Court</a>&nbsp;asking it to decide quickly whether it will give permission to appeal and, if it does, to determine the substantive appeal as soon as possible. We plan to apply to formally intervene in the case to share our expertise to assist the Court.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the Supreme Court will hear an appeal, firms must still comply with the law as it stands when arranging new motor finance agreements. To assist firms, we have set out a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/information-firms-motor-finance-complaints/communicating-customers-commission" title="Communicating with motor finance customers about commission ">summary</a>&nbsp;of the Court of Appeal decision, our expectations and some good and poor practice examples.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Making a complaint</h2>
<p>Any consumers concerned that they weren&rsquo;t told about commission and may have paid too much for their car finance, should&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/car-finance-complaints" title="Car finance complaints">complain</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have also confirmed that consumers will have until the later of 29 July 2026 or 15 months from the date of their final response letter from the firm, to refer a non-DCA complaint to the Financial Ombudsman (instead of the usual 6 months).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following feedback received during our consultation, we have confirmed the complaint handling extension will cover motor leasing, as well as motor finance credit agreements. The Court of Appeal&rsquo;s judgment did not involve motor leasing agreements. However, consumers also use leasing to access motor vehicles, and it is important that consumers using similar products for similar purposes are treated in the same way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>FCA review into historical DCAs in motor finance</h2>
<p>In January this year,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/fca-undertake-work-motor-finance-market" title="FCA to undertake work in the motor finance market">we launched a review</a>&nbsp;of historical motor finance DCAs.</p>
<p>The review seeks to understand if there was widespread misconduct related to DCAs before the 2021 ban, if consumers have lost out and, if so, the best way to make sure appropriate compensation is paid in an orderly, consistent and efficient way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alongside the review, motor finance firms were given more time to provide final responses to complaints about motor finance where a DCA was involved, and consumers more time to refer their complaints to the Financial Ombudsman. This was to prevent disorderly, inconsistent and inefficient outcomes for consumers and knock-on effects on firms and the market while we reviewed the issue and determined the best way forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In September, we&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/extension-motor-finance-complaint-handling-pause-confirmed" title="Extension to motor finance complaint handling pause confirmed">further extended this</a>&nbsp;until 4 December 2025. This was because it had taken longer than expected to get the data needed for the review. Before deciding our next steps, we also wanted to take account of relevant court decisions. These included the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/fca-responds-high-court-motor-finance-judicial-review-decision" title="FCA responds to High Court motor finance judicial review decision">judicial review</a>&nbsp;by Barclays Partner Finance of a Financial Ombudsman decision relating to a DCA in a motor finance agreement and the recent Court of Appeal judgment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We plan to set out next steps in our review of DCAs in May 2025. We hope to also provide an update on motor finance non-DCA commission complaints at the same time. However, given the Court of Appeal&rsquo;s judgment affects both types of complaint, what we can say in May will depend on the progress of the appeal to the Supreme Court and the timing and nature of any decision. If we can end the complaint handling extension sooner than December 2025, we will.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Motor finance is an important market, serving over 2 million consumers a year. In deciding next steps, we&rsquo;ll consider how to make sure affected consumers are appropriately compensated and the market continues to work well, with effective competition.</p>

<p>Technological innovations such as blockchain have the potential to not only digitize financial services but also to implement financial systems with a certain degree of programmability through the tokenization of payment methods and financial products (e.g., stable coins, tokenized deposits, security tokens). It is imperative to identify and analyze key issues for the development of a robust financial system, while considering both the opportunities and risks associated with these advancements, including crypto-assets, which represent the initial application of blockchain technology.</p>

<title>Statement In Support Of The PCAOB’s 2025 Budget, SEC Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-in-support-of-the-pcaobs-2025-budget-sec-commissioner-caroline-a-cr/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-in-support-of-the-pcaobs-2025-budget-sec-commissioner-caroline-a-cr/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I&rsquo;m happy today to support the PCAOB&rsquo;s budget.&nbsp; The budget is reasonably calibrated to help the PCAOB effect its mission of protecting investors and furthering the public interest in its regulation of public company and broker dealer audit reports.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="x">That oversight creates market stability.&nbsp; First, it promotes transparency.&nbsp; Investors need this transparency to, among other things, evaluate companies&rsquo; financial health and performance.&nbsp; Transparency alone, however, is not enough.&nbsp; The PCAOB&rsquo;s oversight function also creates reliability.&nbsp; Investors must be able to rely on financial information provided &ndash; to trust that it&rsquo;s fair and accurate.&nbsp; Together, this transparency and reliability create investor confidence. When investors have that confidence, investment decisions are made and capital flows to and among market participants.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="x">Today we help ensure that the PCAOB can continue, at least for the next year, to guide, oversee, and help maintain the integrity of companies&rsquo; financial disclosures.&nbsp; For example, the PCAOB oversees accounting firms that prepare audit reports for public companies; establishes audit standards for those firms; and, when appropriate, investigates and disciplines those who fall short of those standards.&nbsp; The PCAOB helps prevent fraud.</p>
<p class="x">This is an enormous task.&nbsp; The PCAOB oversees the process by which thousands of audits are performed every year.&nbsp; There are over 6,500 actively reporting public companies and over 3,300 broker-dealers that must be audited by a public accounting firm every year.&nbsp; And that just scratches the surface of what they do.</p>
<p class="x">It takes a dedicated, highly specialized, and experienced workforce to carry out their mission.&nbsp;&nbsp; It naturally follows that the biggest expenditure in the PCAOB's budget is its workforce, like so many other organizations.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-support-pcaob-2025-budget?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="x"><a name="_Hlk185410196">But the benefit here far exceeds that cost.&nbsp; The U.S. capital markets represent approximately $120 trillion in value, and the PCAOB&rsquo;s budget is roughly $399 million.&nbsp;</a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-support-pcaob-2025-budget?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp; In other words, the cost of that investor faith and confidence is less than a penny on the dollar to issuers and the investing public.&nbsp; Moreover, one can fixate on a micro scale on inspection findings or the number of rulemakings or enforcement actions, but on the macro scale the capital markets are flourishing.&nbsp; The stock market is near record levels, the number of registration applications to the PCAOB has increased, and assets under management are near record levels, including for small asset managers.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-support-pcaob-2025-budget?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp; So to suggest that the PCAOB&rsquo;s work has hindered capital markets just isn&rsquo;t consistent with the facts on the ground.</p>
<p class="x">Rather, today&rsquo;s PCAOB is living up to its mission. They have engaged in rule and standard setting so that the audit profession is held to meaningful and modernized standards. The PCAOB has run a thorough process subject to public engagement, consensus building, and transparency. They have worked through arguments raised by litigious interest groups and lobbying organizations. In other words, they have represented the interests of the investing public and have deployed their budget effectively. The results are clear on their face. I am proud to support their work, and I have been for the past several years.</p>
<p class="x">Thank you to the PCAOB staff, the Board, and the Office of the Chief Accountant here at the SEC.</p>
<p class="x">Happy holidays.</p>

<p>The Sarbanes-Oxley Act states that PCAOB staff salary is fixed to &ldquo;private sector self-regulatory, accounting, technical, supervisory, or other staff or management positions.&rdquo;&nbsp;<i>See&nbsp;</i>SOX s. 101(f)(4). The statute does not direct a comparison to government agency trends.</p>

<title>Integrity And Transparency In Financial Reporting: The PCAOB’s FY 2025 Budget, SEC Commissioner Jaime Lizárraga</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/integrity-and-transparency-in-financial-reporting-the-pcaobs-fy-2025-budget-s/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In 2002, Congress enacted the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in response to the accounting scandals of that time. The law targeted the glaring deficiencies of a self-policing system of financial reporting rife with conflicts of interest. The large-scale accounting frauds this system produced inflicted substantial harm to investors and to our capital markets.</p>
<p>Congress established the PCAOB (the &ldquo;Board&rdquo;) &ldquo;to protect the interests of investors and further the public interest in the preparation of informative, accurate, and independent audit reports.&rdquo; During my time in Congress, I, too, had a front row seat to the crafting and enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The final version of the law passed the House of Representative nearly unanimously and the U.S. Senate unanimously.</p>
<p>The Board&rsquo;s budget is the vehicle for faithfully executing the law as intended by Congress.</p>
<p>Investor confidence that all issuers are abiding by the highest standards of financial reporting depends on auditors fulfilling their duty as gatekeepers and being held accountable when they fall short of meeting their obligations.</p>
<p>In carrying out its core mission as directed by Congress, and in light of recent progress in improving audit quality, the Board has convincingly demonstrated that it is up to the task. With a robust inspections record, both at home and abroad, and its successful efforts to speed up publication of its inspection reports, the Board has leveraged its resources effectively.</p>
<p>It has made strides in other areas, too &ndash; inspection reports that are more accessible to investors and issuers, and additional guidance to auditors, particularly those auditing small public companies.</p>
<p>The Board has taken on core challenges that any financial regulator worth its salt must always take on: modernizing outdated standards that have outlived their usefulness and holding wrongdoers accountable.</p>
<p>The FY25 budget is a credible approach to honor the Board&rsquo;s responsibility to protect investors and advance the public interest. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Board made changes to the budget in response to Commission recommendations, including reductions in compensation costs and in travel expenses.</p>
<p>I commend the Board for carrying out its mission-critical functions with its limited resources, while remaining efficient and nimble.</p>
<p>To Board Chair Erica Williams, thank you for your leadership and for your strategic approach to fulfilling the Board&rsquo;s mission. And thank you for your kind words. It&rsquo;s been a pleasure to work with you and with all of the Board&rsquo;s members in advancing a number of priorities that will protect investors and strengthen our capital markets.</p>
<p>I am pleased to support the final budget. Best wishes to everyone for a happy and restful holiday season.</p>

<title>US Office Of The Comptroller Of The Currency Issues Comprehensive Cease And Desist Order Against USAA Federal Savings Bank</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-office-of-the-comptroller-of-the-currency-issues-comprehensive-cease-and-desi/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-office-of-the-comptroller-of-the-currency-issues-comprehensive-cease-and-desi/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today issued a comprehensive cease-and-desist order (order) against USAA Federal Savings Bank (bank) to require the bank to correct a range of deficiencies. This order replaces prior cease-and-desist orders issued against the bank in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/ea2019-001.pdf" target="_blank">2019</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/ea2022-008.pdf" target="_blank">2022</a>.</p>
<p>The OCC took this action based on unsafe or unsound practices relating to management, earnings, information technology, consumer compliance, and internal audit and suspicious activity reporting violations. The bank also was not in compliance with OCC&rsquo;s Heightened Standards requirements for large banks detailed at 12 CFR Part 30, Appendix D.</p>
<p>The order incorporates articles from the 2019 and 2022 orders that remain in noncompliance and requires the bank to take comprehensive corrective actions to enhance its risk governance, compliance risk management, information technology management, fraud risk management, and third-party, affiliate, and shared services risk management. The order also imposes limitations on the bank&rsquo;s ability to add certain new products and services, as well as expanding its membership criteria.</p>

<title>Part I.A. Like It’s 1999: Statement At The Open Meeting To Consider The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board’s 2025 Final Budget And Accounting Support Fee, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Mr. Chair. Welcome, Chair Williams. The PCAOB has a vital, though deliberately limited, core mission: to &ldquo;protect the interests of investors and further the public interest in the preparation of informative, accurate, and independent audit reports.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-pcaob-budget-121824#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;The Commission has oversight authority over the Board, which includes reviewing the budget and annual accounting support fee. Commission oversight is important. Issuers and broker-dealers bear the direct costs of funding the Board, some of which get passed on to investors. If the PCAOB fails to use its budgeted resources wisely, investors, the economy, and the audit profession pay indirectly in the form of impaired functioning of the capital markets.</p>
<p>The PCAOB is asking for nearly $400 million for 2025.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-pcaob-budget-121824#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;While only a 4% increase from 2024, it is 40% higher than 2020&rsquo;s $285 million request.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-pcaob-budget-121824#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;At this rate, the budget five years from now will be $560 million. The increase is striking, but even more important is whether the PCAOB is having a net positive effect on audit quality. Are the dollars the PCAOB is spending working? The PCAOB paints a picture that does not look a lot better than pre-PCAOB days. PCAOB staff reports that &ldquo;aggregate deficiency rates have continued to increase across all inspection programs, and 46% of the engagements reviewed in 2023 had at least one Part I.A deficiency, excluding broker-dealer audit inspections.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-pcaob-budget-121824#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;At the firms that &ldquo;collectively audit approximately 80% of the market capitalization . . . aggregate Part I.A deficiencies held steady at 26% in 2023 after previously jumping from 12% in 2020 to 16% in 2021 and 26% in 2022.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-pcaob-budget-121824#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;Chair Williams noted recently that restatements by public companies are at a nine-year high: 140 public companies issued restatements for the first ten months of 2024, &ldquo;up from 122 in the same period last year and more than double the figure four years ago.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-pcaob-budget-121824#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><span><span>[6]</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;</span>The PCAOB&rsquo;s $35 million in fines this year<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-pcaob-budget-121824#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;reflect a 75% increase from last year, which was itself 80% higher than 2022&rsquo;s levels.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-pcaob-budget-121824#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;The standard-setting pace has also climbed : &ldquo;the Board has taken more formal actions on standard setting and rulemaking this year than any year since 2003 when the PCAOB was established.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-pcaob-budget-121824#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;It is hard to know what to make of these numbers. Are the audit deficiencies uniformly serious, or is the PCAOB fixating on foot-faults? Do they really compromise audit integrity? Is the increase in fines attributable entirely to real problems, or are some cases punishing imperfect form filing?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-pcaob-budget-121824#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;Is overhauling the rulebook all at once necessary to address current problems, or would a slower pace of change be better for audit quality? The PCAOB&rsquo;s heavy-handed approach might look good at first glance, but a more nuanced approach is needed.</p>
<p>Whatever one makes of those numbers, the PCAOB&rsquo;s trumpeting of them as evidence of the importance of its work is misguided and its approach to audit oversight is destined to drive inspection deficiencies and enforcement fines even higher. A preferable approach relies on carefully implemented principles-based standards designed to afford room for auditors&rsquo; professional judgment, the deployment of inspection staff to assist firms proactively in improving audit quality, and the use of enforcement only when serious violations have occurred. Audit oversight is difficult work. Getting it wrong risks transforming the audit profession from one where accounting professionals exercise informed, independent judgment to interpret and apply principles-based standards into a mechanical exercise where risk-averse, robotic auditors engage in a box-checking exercise focused on insulating themselves and their clients from liability based on the hindsight of regulators. Such a fundamental change would undermine audit quality to the detriment of investors and the capital markets. A moderated course, as Board Member Ho has suggested,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-pcaob-budget-121824#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;would achieve the PCAOB&rsquo;s goals more effectively than the path this budget sets.</p>
<p>Despite my concerns, I commend the PCAOB for some of its initiatives, including its outreach events for auditors of small firms and broker-dealers, the shorter timeline on getting inspection reports published, its continuing work on China-based audits, and its Spotlight guidance series. Chair Williams, I have a number of questions for you:</p>
<ol>
<li>Since 2020, the SEC&rsquo;s budget&mdash;which is subject to the congressional appropriations process&mdash;has increased by around 21%,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-pcaob-budget-121824#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;compared to the PCAOB&rsquo;s 40% increase. How do you justify this disparity?</li>
<li>The 2025 budget requests around $34 million for consulting and professional fees.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-pcaob-budget-121824#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;This is $3 million less than last year<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-pcaob-budget-121824#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;but almost $18 million more than 2020.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-pcaob-budget-121824#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;Last year, you explained that this expenditure was a &ldquo;one-time investment&rdquo; that was necessary for improving the PCAOB&rsquo;s registration and inspection systems. Why have consulting and professional fees persisted at relatively high levels? Should we expect them to drop significantly next year?</li>
<li>As Board Member Ho has suggested, the PCAOB &ldquo;should be held accountable for good stewardship and outcome-based performance.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-pcaob-budget-121824#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16"><span><span>[16]</span></span></a>&nbsp;By what performance metrics should the PCAOB be judged? Should the PCAOB be judged by deficiency and restatement rates? Should the PCAOB be judged by enforcement statistics or number of standards promulgated? Does some other metric better capture the PCAOB&rsquo;s contributions to audit quality?</li>
<li>Prescriptive standards and an enforcement agenda that punishes foot faults could force audit firms to direct their resources toward check-the-box compliance efforts that are disconnected from audit quality. Do you share my concern? If so, what are you doing about it?</li>
<li>You noted recently that &ldquo;PCAOB inspectors are seeing significant improvements in the aggregate Part I.A deficiency rate from the largest firms&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-pcaob-budget-121824#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17"><span><span>[17]</span></span></a>&nbsp;Why are smaller firms not also seeing deficiency rates drop? Research suggests that there is room for improvement in the PCAOB&rsquo;s work with smaller firms.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-pcaob-budget-121824#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18"><span><span>[18]</span></span></a>&nbsp;What have you done to work with these firms on remediating deficiencies identified in audits?</li>
<li>In a recent Spotlight on Staff Priorities for 2025 Inspections and Interactions With Audit Committees, the PCAOB staff singled out crypto assets and explained that it plans to &ldquo;continue to focus on identifying public companies and broker-dealers that have material crypto asset holdings and significant transactions related to crypto assets.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-pcaob-budget-121824#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>&nbsp;In recent weeks, regulatory efforts to dissuade regulated entities from serving the crypto industry and its participants or otherwise engaging in crypto have come to light.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-pcaob-budget-121824#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a>&nbsp;How do you ensure that the PCAOB appropriately considers risk in selecting audits for inspection without dissuading auditors, issuers, and broker-dealers from engaging with crypto?</li>
<li>The PCAOB frequently cites enforcement statistics such as the number of cases and the size of penalties to tout the effectiveness of its enforcement agenda. Do these metrics accurately capture the effectiveness of the enforcement program, or do they risk encouraging a quantity over quality mindset? What tools does the PCAOB employ before escalating to an enforcement action?</li>
<li>The ongoing shortage of qualified auditors<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-pcaob-budget-121824#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21"><span><span>[21]</span></span></a>&nbsp;coupled with industry consolidation<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-pcaob-budget-121824#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22"><span><span>[22]</span></span></a>&nbsp;presents a troubling dynamic. Board Member Ho expressed &ldquo;profound[] worry&rdquo; about the PCAOB&rsquo;s adverse effect on competition.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-pcaob-budget-121824#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a>&nbsp;Smaller public companies are finding it particularly difficult to secure reliable, high-quality audit services. Larger firms may find the lower fees from smaller engagements less appealing, and fewer individuals are entering the auditing profession overall.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-pcaob-budget-121824#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24"><span><span>[24]</span></span></a>&nbsp;What are you doing to mitigate the problems faced by the smaller public companies that are least able to find qualified auditors?</li>
<li>How much of the budget is being spent on implementation assistance for recently adopted standards?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you for that discussion. Thank you for your work, Chair Williams. Thank you also to your team, the other Board Members, the PCAOB staff, and the SEC&rsquo;s staff in the Offices of Chief Accountant, Financial Management, General Counsel, and Information Technology. Although I cannot support the PCAOB&rsquo;s current approach as reflected in the budget and accounting support fee before us, I look forward to continued work with the PCAOB in the pursuit of improved audit quality.</p>

There has been a chronic decline in accounting graduates and CPA candidates since 2016. Most recently, we heard reports that just over 67,000 individuals took the CPA exams in 2022, a historic low over the past 17 years. To put this number into perspective, the number of individuals sitting for the CPA exams has declined by 34% since 2016 when a little over 100,000 individuals sat for the CPA exams. The Wall Street Journal reported in December 2022 that over 300,000 U.S. accountants and auditors have left their jobs in the past couple of years, a 17% decline in industry employment. To top it off, the U.S. Department of Labor&rsquo;s Bureau of Labor Statistics projected approximately 126,500 openings for accountants and auditors each year, on average. If this alarming trend continues, the U.S. labor market will soon have 50% or more of the accountant openings unfilled each year.&rdquo;)(citations omitted).

<title>Resolve To Spot Scams In 2025 Says A New CFTC Customer Advisory</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/resolve-to-spot-scams-in-2025-says-a-new-cftc-customer-advisory/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A new CFTC customer advisory suggests adding &ldquo;spotting scams&rdquo; to your list of New Year&rsquo;s resolutions.</p>
<p>The Office of Customer Education and Outreach&rsquo;s&nbsp;<i>Avoiding Fraud May be Your Best Resolution</i>&nbsp;says that with scammers robbing billions of dollars from Americans through relationship investment scams, resolving to be careful about who you trust online, staying informed, and learning all you can about trading risks are admirable 2025 resolutions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a good idea to start thinking about your resolutions now, especially when it comes to your finances. If one of your goals is to grow your wealth, arming yourself with tools to prevent losing money to fraud will help. This advisory provides resolutions to help avoid falling for widespread scams,&rdquo; said Melanie Devoe, director of the CFTC&rsquo;s Office of Customer Education and Outreach. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The advisory provides information on how to resolve to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be more cautious about who you trust online</li>
<li>Invest in learning from reliable sources</li>
<li>Protect yourself and others</li>
</ul>
<p>If you think you have been defrauded, despite your best efforts, the advisory provides resources to help you report the fraud.</p>
<p>About the Office of Customer Education and Outreach</p>
<p>OCEO is dedicated to helping customers protect themselves from fraud or violations of the Commodity Exchange Act through the research and development of effective financial education materials and initiatives. OCEO engages in outreach and education to retail investors. The office also frequently partners with federal and state regulators as well as consumer protection groups.

<p><i>Customer Advisory: Avoiding Fraud May be Your Best Resolution</i>,&nbsp;<i>available in full below and&nbsp;</i><i><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/NewYear.html">HERE</a></i></p>
<p align="center"><i>###</i></p>
<p align="center" class="BulletedHyperlink">Customer Advisory: Avoiding Fraud May be Your Best Resolution</p>
<p class="BulletedHyperlink">Avoiding fraud in the New Year is one of the best trading moves you can make in 2025. Resolve to be more careful about who you trust online, stay informed, and learn all you can about trading risks.</p>
<p class="BulletedHyperlink">Lately, online investment scams have largely targeted three types of people: Those who want to learn to trade, those looking to earn more, and those looking for love or friendship.&nbsp;Fraudsters look for these needs and swoop in to fill them. They may contact targets directly or bait traps and wait to see who they attract.</p>
<p class="BulletedHyperlink">Anyone can be vulnerable to fraud. Fraudsters rely on trust or fear to motivate their victims into sending money. Fraudsters build trust by posing as experts, &ldquo;winning&rdquo; traders, or by engaging in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/romancefrauds">relationships</a>. So, the best way to avoid fraud is to limit your exposure and not engage with online requests for money or information. Here are three New Year&rsquo;s resolutions to help you avoid scams in 2025:</p>
<ol>
<li class="BulletedHyperlink">Be more cautious about who you trust online.</li>
</ol>
<p class="BulletedHyperlink">Knowing who to trust is more difficult than ever. Anything online can be faked. Fraudsters use fake social media profiles, videos, group chats, testimonials, and fake trading websites that manipulate market data and display growing balances. The fake platforms may even pay small-dollar withdrawals to build trust. Most investment fraud begins on social media, and those who are more willing to trust social media sources are more vulnerable to fraud.&nbsp;If something doesn&rsquo;t feel right, trust your instincts.</p>
<p class="BulletedHyperlink">Limit your exposure to fraud by limiting who can see your information on social media. Also, be careful how much you share. Report suspicious people and activity to social media platforms. And don&rsquo;t join random group chats or respond to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/MessagingApps.html">random messages</a>&nbsp;on your mobile device.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li class="BulletedHyperlink">Invest in learning first &mdash; especially about markets and risks.</li>
</ol>
<p class="BulletedHyperlink">All trading involves risk. Offers that promise easy, no-risk returns are scams. No one, not even&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/AITradingBots.html">AI</a>, can predict the future. Only trade with&nbsp;<i>risk capital</i>&nbsp;(money you can afford to lose after living expenses and other savings needs are covered). Study the markets, risks specific to different products, and start your learning with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/learn_to_trade_without_scam.htm">well-known public and industry sources</a>. Being a successful trader is hard enough even without the threat of fraud. After fees and taxes, most individual traders lose money trading futures<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/9025-24?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;and foreign currency.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/9025-24?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Some common reasons traders are unprofitable are they trade as they learn and are overconfident in their abilities.&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li class="BulletedHyperlink">Protect yourself and others.</li>
</ol>
<p class="BulletedHyperlink">Check the registration status of companies or financial professionals offering investment advice before you trade. Visit&nbsp;<a href="https://cftc-stg.ctacdev.com/check">cftc.gov/check</a>&nbsp;to learn more about registration, where to look, and whether registration requires validation by a government entity. Awareness about scams also can reduce vulnerability.&nbsp;<a href="https://service.govdelivery.com/accounts/USCFTC/subscriber/new">Subscribe</a>&nbsp;to CFTC.gov customer education emails or follow us on social media and share what you learn with people you know. If you spot a fraud, report it&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/complaint">at cftc.gov/complaint</a>&nbsp;or to the FBI at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ic3.gov/">ic3.gov</a>.</p>

<title>Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/federal-reserve-issues-fomc-statement-49/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/federal-reserve-issues-fomc-statement-49/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Since earlier in the year, labor market conditions have generally eased, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low. Inflation has made progress toward the Committee's 2 percent objective but remains somewhat elevated.</p>
<p>The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.</p>
<p>In support of its goals, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.</p>
<p>In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.</p>
<p>Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Thomas I. Barkin; Michael S. Barr; Raphael W. Bostic; Michelle W. Bowman; Lisa D. Cook; Mary C. Daly; Philip N. Jefferson; Adriana D. Kugler; and Christopher J. Waller. Voting against the action was Beth M. Hammack, who preferred to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent.</p>

<title>Canadian Securities Administrators Issues Market Update On Climate-Related Disclosure Project</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/canadian-securities-administrators-issues-market-update-on-climate-related-discl/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/canadian-securities-administrators-issues-market-update-on-climate-related-discl/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) is providing an update on the climate-related disclosure project following the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.frascanada.ca/en/cssb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Canadian Sustainability Standards Board&rsquo;s</a>&nbsp;(CSSB) publication of its final Canadian Sustainability Disclosure Standard (CSDS) 1&nbsp;<em>General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information</em>&nbsp;(CSDS 1) and CSDS 2&nbsp;<em>Climate-related Disclosures</em>&nbsp;(CSDS 2 and, together with CSDS 1, the CSSB Standards).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CSSB Standards are voluntary until mandated by provincial and territorial regulators. In order to become mandatory disclosures under securities legislation in Canada, the CSSB Standards would need to be incorporated into a CSA rule. As noted in previous market updates, the CSA continues to work towards a revised climate-related disclosure rule that will consider the CSSB Standards and may include modifications considered appropriate for the Canadian capital markets. The CSA is taking a climate-first approach and therefore is focusing on those requirements necessary to support a climate-related disclosure rule.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The CSSB Standards provide a voluntary disclosure framework for sustainability and climate-related disclosure,&rdquo; said Stan Magidson, CSA Chair and Chair and CEO of the Alberta Securities Commission. &ldquo;As the CSA develops a revised climate-related disclosure rule, we will also consider the feedback received by the CSSB during its consultation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The CSA will continue to work towards a balanced approach that supports the assessment of material climate-related risks, responds to requests for consistent, comparable and decision-useful climate-related disclosures, and contributes to efficient capital markets, including considering the needs and capabilities of issuers of different sizes. We will continue to monitor international developments related to climate-related disclosure. Given the interconnectedness of our markets, we will be carefully considering developments in the United States.</p>
<p>The CSA will publish a revised rule for public comment and will encourage interested and affected parties to provide feedback. We anticipate seeking comment on specific issues, including the scope of application and the need for additional time or guidance for reporting issuers to comply with certain disclosure requirements. We also anticipate consulting on concerns regarding liability with respect to new requirements for climate-related disclosure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CSA, the council of the securities regulators of Canada&rsquo;s provinces and territories, coordinates and harmonizes regulation for the Canadian capital markets.</p>

<title>SEC Approves 2025 PCAOB Budget And Accounting Support Fee</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-approves-2025-pcaob-budget-and-accounting-support-fee/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-approves-2025-pcaob-budget-and-accounting-support-fee/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission voted today to approve the 2025 budget of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and the related annual accounting support fee.</p>
<p>The 2025 PCAOB budget totals $399.7 million. The accounting support fee totals $374.9 million, of which $346.1 million will be assessed on public company issuers and $28.8 million will be assessed on registered broker-dealers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well-functioning financial markets are built on trust,&rdquo; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. &ldquo;Critical to such trust are disclosures &ndash; including financial statement disclosures made by issuers and broker-dealers to the investing public. I have seen since the passage of Sarbanes-Oxley 22 years ago the importance of that law in promoting trust in public company figures. This trust, though, can easily be taken for granted. The PCAOB &ndash; an important reform of the George W. Bush Administration &ndash; writes the standards for auditors and audits the auditors. That&rsquo;s the core of what it does, and it&rsquo;s every bit as important now and into the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am confident in the Board&rsquo;s ability to continue to act as a diligent and responsible steward of publicly sourced accounting support fees, as evidenced by their accomplishments this past year,&rdquo; said SEC Chief Accountant Paul Munter.</p>
<p>The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which established the PCAOB, provides the Commission with oversight responsibility over the PCAOB. This includes reviewing and approving the PCAOB&rsquo;s budget and accounting support fee annually.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Finds Two-Thirds Of Young Investors Take Less Than 24 Hours To Make Investment Decisions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>Latest research reveals that young investors are making important investment decisions in a matter of hours, rather than taking the time to check out whether the product is right for them in the long-term.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<ul>
<li>A quarter of young investors admit they make investment decisions impulsively to keep up with current trends.</li>
<li>&pound;550 is average spend on hyped investment products.</li>
<li>66% of 18-40 year-old investors spend less than 24 hours deciding on an investment, and 14% finalise their decision in under an hour.</li>
<li>Two in five investors regret purchasing a hyped investment product.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Latest research from the FCA reveals that young investors are making important investment decisions in a matter of hours, rather than taking the time to check out whether the product is right for them in the long-term.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The survey, which polled 2,000 UK investors aged 18 to 40, found that two-thirds (66%) make investment decisions in less than a day, with one-in-seven (14%) deciding to purchase in under 60 minutes. Only 11% take more than a week to decide if an investment is right for them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investing for the long-term can be rewarding, and not just financially. However, while buying into the buzz can sometimes deliver short-term satisfaction, it can also lead to regret. Despite 63% of people believing that hype meant it was a good investment opportunity, 40% regretted investing in hyped investment products. Avoiding hype and knowing what you are getting into can help you decide if an investment opportunity is right for you.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Investment thinking versus everyday purchases</h2>
<p>The research reveals strong parallels between impulse-driven investment decisions and purchases of everyday viral products. When asked more generally about any viral items they had purchased within the last year, crypto was fourth in the list (27%), just behind air fryers (42%), which topped the list, followed by smart watches (32%) and energy drinks (32%).</p>
<p>Over three quarters (76%) admitted they would likely buy an everyday viral consumer product based on online hype, and nearly two-thirds (65%) acknowledged they had the same attitude to investment decisions.</p>
<p>Reasons for investing in hyped products are similar to those for consumer purchases: missing out on a good opportunity (32%), driven by the desire to feel good in the moment (26%), and wanting to keep up with trends (23%).</p>
<p>The FCA has created an&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://uks-most-hyped-2024.vercel.app/?region=nationwide&amp;category=all&amp;price=none%E2%80%AF" rel="noopener" target="_blank">interactive table<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;which allows viewers to see a breakdown of the most popular products, broken down by category, region or age group &ndash; to see what products may be particularly hyped in your area, and to create your own over-hyped table.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The influence of FOMO and social media</h2>
<p>'Fear of Missing Out' (FOMO) also plays a major role. Over half (51%) of young investors (18-40) put in more money than they originally intended due to FOMO and this behaviour often results in riskier financial decisions being made.</p>
<p>Social media platforms are influential: 85% of young investors acknowledged platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube are highly influential in their investment decisions, with 43% using these platforms as their primary research tool.</p>
<h2>Looking beyond the hype</h2>
<p>The FCA is calling on investors to think more carefully before investing in high risk or hyped products, by thinking about their long-term financial goals.</p>
<p>Lucy Castledine, director of consumer investments at the FCA, commented:</p>
<p>'If you&rsquo;re considering investing, the very first investment you should make is some of your own time. It's important to look beyond the hype, especially on social media, and do your research to make sure what you're investing in fits with your financial goals. Check out our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/investsmart/5-questions-ask-you-invest" title="5 questions to ask before you invest">5 tips to InvestSmart</a>.'</p>
<p>Steve Martin, a behavioural scientist at Columbia Business School and the CEO, Influence At Work commented: &nbsp;</p>
<p>'This important and timely research illustrates the worrying influence that hype and online trends are having on people&rsquo;s decision making. Playing to people&rsquo;s fear of missing out (FOMO) is a deliberate ploy designed to increase the attractiveness of a product. Less of an issue if the item is a low-cost consumer product. But spontaneous and hasty decisions about financial investments are concerning due to the risk of potentially regrettable and long-term implications. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s smart to invest for the future. It&rsquo;s also smart to avoid being swept along by hype. Sound investing requires sound judgement. When it comes to your money, heat-of-the-moment decisions are best avoided.'</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>All data, unless otherwise specified, is taken from 2,000 UK respondents aged 18-40 years old who have purchased a viral trend and products they&rsquo;ve seen online, as well as those who currently hold, have held in the past, or are considering investing in a range of investment products including high-risk. The research was conducted by Censuswide and gathered in August 2024. Censuswide abides by and employ members of the Market Research Society which is based on the ESOMAR principles.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, has today launched a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/consultations/consultation-draft-rts-establishment-eu-code-conduct-issuer-sponsored">consultation</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;draft Technical Standards (RTS) to establish an EU code of conduct (EU CoC) for issuer-sponsored research.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify">The EU CoC sets out standards of&nbsp;<a>independence and objectivity for research providers</a>&nbsp;and specifies procedures and measures for the effective identification, prevention, and disclosure of conflicts of interest (COI), with a view to enhance the trust in and use of issuer-sponsored research.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">In its proposals ESMA indicates that:</p>
<ul>
<li>issuers and research providers should only enter into an agreement where the minimal initial term of the contract is two years and where, at minimum, 50% of the annual remuneration is paid upfront;&nbsp;</li>
<li>research providers should establish, implement and maintain an effective COI policy; and</li>
<li>research that is fully paid for by the issuer should be made public immediately.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text-align-justify">Investment firms will also be expected to ensure that all issuer-sponsored research that they produce or intend to distribute to (potential) clients complies with the EU CoC.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">The consultation is primarily aimed at research providers, issuers, investment firms, and investors.&nbsp;</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Charges John Dance With Offences Related To WealthTek</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has charged John Dance with 9 criminal offences, including multiple counts of fraud and money laundering.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>John Dance was principal partner at WealthTek LLP (formerly known as Vertus Asset Management LLP (Vertus)), a wealth management firm.</p>
<p>Prior to WealthTek obtaining direct authorisation from the FCA in 2020, Vertus operated first as a trading name and then as an appointed representative of Sapia Partners LLP (Sapia), meaning they could carry out certain regulated activities under Sapia&rsquo;s supervision.</p>
<p>Mr Dance is accused of fraudulently abusing his position of trust at Vertus and WealthTek for his own personal gain. Between 2014 and 2023, Mr Dance transferred over &pound;64m from client accounts of Vertus and WealthTek to accounts he controlled, which the FCA alleges he used to fund a lavish lifestyle and other business interests including horseracing and a nightclub.</p>
<p>The FCA alleges Mr Dance laundered the proceeds of his criminality through his personal and business bank accounts, including the transfer of &pound;723,000 to purchase 6 racehorses, including Bravemansgame in 2019, and &pound;806,500 in 2014 and &pound;3.9m in 2020 to purchase residential and commercial property.</p>
<p>Mr Dance is also charged with 3 further offences of dishonestly making false representations about WealthTek&rsquo;s regulatory permissions to continue his alleged fraud.</p>
<p>Mr Dance has been released on bail and will appear at North Tyneside Magistrates' Court at 2pm on 3 January 2025. The Restraint Order obtained by the FCA against Mr Dance remains in place.</p>
<p>The special administration of WealthTek is continuing and its clients have begun to receive their assets and compensation. Approximately 84% of people affected will be compensated in full. The FCA will continue to work with all parties as both the WealthTek special administration and the criminal proceedings continue.</p>
<p>Therese Chambers, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight, said:</p>
<p>'This is one of the most serious and largest frauds we have ever investigated. We allege that over a period of many years Mr Dance diverted millions of client funds for his own benefit, telling lies and forging documents to cover his tracks. We know this has been a worrying time for people who had their investments caught up in WealthTek and we have tried to keep everyone updated as best we can, given the criminal nature of the offences under investigation.</p>
<p>'We&rsquo;re pleased that clients are now seeing their assets returned.'</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ol>
<li>John Dance was born on 5 November 1974.</li>
<li>This case took 21 months from opening in March 2023 to bringing criminal charges &ndash; compared to an average of 42 months for cases closed in 2023/24. This is an example of how the FCA is improving the pace of its enforcement investigations.</li>
<li>Fraud by abuse of position is an offence under sections 1 and 4 of the Fraud Act 2006 (3 offences).</li>
<li>Fraud by false representation is an offence under sections 1 and 2 of the Fraud Act 2006 (3 offences).</li>
<li>Converting or transferring criminal property is an offence under section 327(1) of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (3 offences).</li>
<li>WealthTek LLP was regulated by the FCA from 27 January 2020 until 4 April 2023 when the FCA took&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/fca-orders-wealthtek-cease-operations-high-court-appoints-interim-managers" title="FCA orders WealthTek Limited Liability Partnership to cease operations as High Court appoints Joint Special Administrators and arrest made">action to order the firm to cease operations</a>&nbsp;and to appoint Special Administrators.</li>
<li>The FCA has previously obtained a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/fca-regulatory-and-criminal-investigation-wealthtek-limited-liability-partnership" title="Statement on the FCA&rsquo;s regulatory and criminal investigation into WealthTek Limited Liability Partnership">restraint order</a>&nbsp;against John Dance which remains in place. The purpose of a restraint order is to preserve assets to make them available for a future confiscation order, an order which can only be made following a conviction in criminal proceedings.</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li><span>BME, which brought together part of the Spanish financial community, contributed its solution for the issuance and settlement of bonds with blockchain technology to the proposal</span></li>
<li><span>The initiative sought to study the capacity of digital tokens to increase the efficiency, agility and security of financial market infrastructures, settling in Central Bank money issued under DLT technology</span></li>
<li><span>Iberpay and Deloitte are collaborating with BME in the program</span></li>
</ul>
<p>BME has successfully completed the initiative it is leading in relation to t<a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/intro/news/html/ecb.mipnews241204.en.html">he Eurosystem's experimentation program</a>&nbsp;for the settlement of payment transactions using digital tokens issued by the European Central Bank (ECB). BME's proposal&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bolsasymercados.es/ing/Media/Press-Release/20240627/nota_20240627_2/BME_participates_as_a_DLT_market_operator_in_the_Eurosystem_s_experimentation_program">was admitted last June 21</a>&nbsp;within the set of additional initiatives that the ECB's Governing Council added in a second wave, for the settlement of transactions in central bank money, as part of the experimentation program that it maintains during 2024.</p>
<p>The proposal made by BME made it possible to evaluate the integration of digital tokens (wholesale central bank digital currencies or wCDBC) during the different phases of the life cycle of a digital bond. This initiative was supported by 10 large custodians, including CaixaBank, Cecabank, CACEIS Bank Spain, Kutxabank Investment, Banco Sabadell, Renta 4 Banco, BNP Paribas, Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale, Unicaja and Banco Cooperativo Espa&ntilde;ol.</p>
<p>It also collaborated in the Iberpay initiative, given its position and sectorial experience as a European payment system, contributing its experience, both in the financial sector and in DLT network projects, facilitating the activities of the custodians in the experimentation, in order to increase the knowledge and experience that this initiative offers and its future opportunities. Deloitte, with its experience in Digital Assets and post-trading, will collaborate with BME and Iberpay to analyze the implications, advantages and challenges of using a wCBDC for the Spanish market.</p>
<p>Jes&uacute;s Benito, CEO of Iberclear, explains that &ldquo;participation in this experimentation program has given us the exceptional opportunity to experiment together with large Spanish custodians in the issuance and use of digital tokens in the Eurosystem, consolidating as a unique opportunity to help our clients understand what these new technologies can bring to financial environments. At BME we are always working on the constant search for improvements with technologies such as blockchain, in order to continue to play a leading role in the digitization and modernization of the financial market&rdquo;.</p>

The report, which tracks the issuance of new security identifiers as an early indicator of debt and capital markets activity over the next quarter, found a monthly increase in request volume for new corporate identifiers, and a decrease in request volume for new municipal identifiers.</p>
<p>North American corporate CUSIP requests totaled 7,954 in November, which is up 4.7% on a monthly basis. On a year-over-year basis, North American corporate requests closed the month up 14.7%. The monthly increase in volume was driven by an 18.3% increase in request volume for medium term notes (MTNs), a 1.2% increase in request volume for U.S. corporate debt identifiers and a 1.2% increase in request volume for U.S. corporate equity identifiers. Request volumes for short-term certificates of deposit (-2.2%) and longer-term certificates of deposit (-8.6%) fell in in November.</p>
<p>The aggregate total of identifier requests for new municipal securities &ndash; including municipal bonds, long-term and short-term notes, and commercial paper &ndash; fell 30.4% versus October totals. On a year-over-year basis, overall municipal volumes are up 10.0%. Texas led state-level municipal request volume with a total of 177 new CUSIP requests in November, followed by New York (75) and Indiana (63).</p>
<p>&ldquo;The noteworthy trend in this month&rsquo;s data is the slow-but-steady increase in request volume for new corporate debt identifiers for the second consecutive month,&rdquo; said Gerard Faulkner, Director of Operations for CGS. &ldquo;As we look ahead to a changing rate environment and a new administration in the year ahead, U.S. corporate issuers are putting the wheels in motion for new capital creation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Requests for international equity CUSIPs rose 97.0% in November and international debt CUSIP requests declined 10.0%. On an annualized basis, international equity CUSIP requests are up 10.8% and international debt CUSIP requests are up 108.9%.</p>

<p><span><span>A key element of this investment is Europe&rsquo;s first Lilly Gateway Labs, an innovation accelerator supporting early-stage life science ventures. The facility will provide advanced lab space, mentorship, and financial support to help startups develop transformative medicines, bolstering a sector that already supports over 300,000 UK jobs.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Obesity, costing the NHS over GBP11 billion ($14.4 billion) annually and the second leading preventable cause of cancer, is a key focus of the collaboration.

<p><span><span>Ophelia Chan, Business Fundamentals Senior Analyst at GlobalData, comments: &ldquo;By combining life sciences expertise with healthcare innovation, the effort seeks to deliver lasting health benefits for those affected by obesity.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The UK has made life sciences a cornerstone of its economic growth strategy, and this initiative strengthens that commitment. At the Summit, Science and Technology Secretary Peter Kyle highlighted the collaboration&rsquo;s role in driving the economy and contributing to &ldquo;creating the jobs, opportunity, and growth we need to invest further in health and to push up living standards.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The announcement aligns with the UK government&rsquo;s Autumn Budget 2024 strategy to strengthen the NHS, featuring a GBP25.7 billion ($33.6 billion) funding boost&mdash;the largest since 2010, excluding COVID-19 periods. Key measures include 40,000 extra weekly elective appointments, 18-week treatment targets, GBP1.5 billion ($1.9 billion) for surgical hubs enabling 30,000 additional procedures annually, and over 1.25 million advanced diagnostic tests.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>These investments aim to address the urgent challenges while enhancing the NHS&rsquo;s long-term resilience.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Chan concludes: &ldquo;Lilly&rsquo;s investment, coupled with the UK government&rsquo;s support for life sciences and healthcare, marks a pivotal moment for the industry. By fostering innovation, tackling health challenges like obesity, and driving economic growth, this collaboration highlights the impact of public-private partnerships on national health and economic advancement.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX Group), in collaboration with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Nigeria, has taken a significant step toward enhancing global partnerships within the Nigerian capital market. This was achieved through high-level engagements with the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India and key players in India&rsquo;s financial ecosystem.</p>
<p>The two-day visit, held on Monday, 16th, and Tuesday, 17th December 2024, at the NSE headquarters in Mumbai, India, brought together the leadership of SEC, NGX Group, and NSE to explore shared opportunities and strategies for driving innovation, market expansion, and sustainable growth.</p>
<p>In his opening remarks, Alhaji (Dr.) Umaru Kwairanga, Chairman of NGX Group, lauded India&rsquo;s achievements as a global economic powerhouse, drawing parallels between the two nations. He stated, &ldquo;We congratulate you on your success as a nation and an exchange, but, more importantly, we are here to learn from your experiences as a vibrant, innovative, technology-driven exchange in a bustling economy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The delegation&rsquo;s visit provided a comprehensive view of India&rsquo;s financial ecosystem, showcasing how regulation and technology catalyze market growth.

<title>IOSCO’s Growth And Emerging Markets Committee Launches A Dedicated Network To Support Its Members In The Adoption Or Other Use Of ISSB Standards In Their Local Jurisdictions</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ioscos-growth-and-emerging-markets-committee-launches-a-dedicated-network-to-su/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ioscos-growth-and-emerging-markets-committee-launches-a-dedicated-network-to-su/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>IOSCO announced today the launch of a dedicated network to support the adoption and other use of IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards (ISSB Standards), with the support of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB). The Network will start with a group of 32 IOSCO members of its Growth and Emerging Markets Committee (GEMC), representing 31 jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The 31 jurisdictions who are initially joining the <strong>GEMC Network for Adoption or Other Use of ISSB Standards</strong> are a diverse group representing: Abu Dhabi, Argentina, the Bahamas, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belize, Brazil, Brunei, Chile, China, Egypt, Georgia, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Jordan, Kenya, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Panama, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Thailand, T&uuml;rkiye, Uruguay, Zambia and Zimbabwe. More jurisdictions have expressed interest in joining in the months ahead.</p>
<p>Most IOSCO members joining the GEMC Network are playing or will be playing a leading role in the adoption of sustainability-related corporate reporting requirements. At the date of joining the network, members are either already executing a roadmap for ISSB Standards implementation, developing a roadmap, building awareness and understanding, or becoming familiar with the ISSB Standards.</p>
<p>GEM Committee members joining the network expressed strong appetite for the Network, including to (i) build capacity on supervisory and enforcement aspects of ISSB Standards, (ii) set up deep dives to discuss and understand how the Jurisdictional Guide and other educational materials can support adoption, and (iii) help them assess market readiness.</p>
<p>Through the Network, GEMC members will benefit from assistance in building local capacity to implement the requirements of the Standards. The Network will also provide a platform for advancing information sharing at a regional level.</p>
<p>Together, the IOSCO GEMC members joining the Network represent:</p>
<ul>
<li>4.3 billion people in      Emerging Markets and Developing Economies, more than half of the world&rsquo;s      population</li>
<li>more than 90% of BRICS      economies GDP and their market capitalisation</li>
<li>nearly half of Africa      and the Middle East&rsquo;s GDP and 60% of their market capitalisation; and</li>
<li>more than two thirds of      Latin America and the Caribbean&rsquo;s GDP and more than 85% of its market      capitalisation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ISSB issued the ISSB Standards in June 2023 in response to investor demand for decision-useful, comparable information and the need for a more efficient global reporting landscape. The ISSB Standards support globally consistent, comparable and reliable sustainability-related disclosures to meet the information needs of investors and other participants in the world&rsquo;s capital markets. After an independent and comprehensive review, in July 2023, IOSCO endorsed the ISSB Standards for capital market use and called on its members to consider ways in which they might adopt, apply or otherwise be informed by the ISSB Standards in their jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Since IOSCO&rsquo;s endorsement, a total of 56* jurisdictions, both from developed and emerging markets, have already taken action to adopt or otherwise use ISSB Standards (half of these jurisdictions have already finalized their adoption of the ISSB Standards). Together, these jurisdictions represent nearly 60% of global GDP, more than 40% of global market capitalization, and more than half of global GHG emissions. The Network is intended to support jurisdictions mostly from emerging markets in their adoption journeys and will comprise both jurisdictions already in the process of adoption or other use and jurisdictions considering adoption or other use.</p>
<p><strong>Jean-Paul Servais, Chairman of the IOSCO Board, said:</strong> &lsquo;We have seen a strong interest from our Growth and Emerging Markets members wanting to introduce the ISSB Standards into their respective regulatory frameworks. These members are willing to implement international standards that enhance international consistency and comparability of climate-related and other sustainability-related disclosures for investors. We are also acutely aware that Growth and Emerging Markets members have signaled a strong desire for support to help them progress their adoption or other use of the ISSB Standards. This dedicated Network will offer them expert support with the help of the ISSB and other partners.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>Emmanuel Faber, ISSB Chair, said:</strong> &lsquo;We are delighted to see considerable interest from emerging markets jurisdictions towards adopting the ISSB&rsquo;s global baseline of sustainability disclosures for capital markets. We are also pleased to continue and further enhance our collaboration with IOSCO by supporting Network members on their jurisdictional adoption journeys. Doing so will help them align their sustainability-related disclosure requirements with the global baseline, connecting them to global capital pools and investors seeking new investment opportunities. This progress is also important to all other jurisdictions because multinational companies with global supply chains will stand to benefit from the availability of comparable data and disclosures from across the value chain and such disclosures will facilitate trade.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mohamed Farid Saleh, Chairman of the GEM Committee and Vice-Chair of the IOSCO Board, said:</strong> &lsquo;I am delighted to see a number of emerging markets taking clear steps towards adoption or other use of the ISSB Standards and I urge them to complete the efforts to avail the Standards in different languages for speed of adoption or other use. I commend the IFRS Foundation&rsquo;s engagement with the IOSCO Growth and Emerging Markets Committee and the establishment of a new Network to facilitate enhanced capacity building to assist securities regulators in this journey.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Earlier this year, IOSCO strengthened its collaboration with the ISSB and enhanced its partnership with the World Bank to assist jurisdictions as they consider their pathways to adopt ISSB Standards.</p>
<p>In May 2024, the IFRS Foundation published the <a href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifrs.org%2Fcontent%2Fdam%2Fifrs%2Fsupporting-implementation%2Fadoption-guide%2Finaugural-jurisdictional-guide.pdf&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cmailing-lists%40iosco.org%7C619e4cab47484972ca6208dd1f52a9a7%7Cbcc6c66cdb3b48328af2cc363a097444%7C0%7C0%7C638701162088413133%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=BCNvzlbZeL7BjtrXzrOPNIeP9mBNloSbc%2Bj5Pzwnduw%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank">Inaugural Jurisdictional Guide for the adoption or other use of ISSB Standards</a> and a <a href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifrs.org%2Fcontent%2Fdam%2Fifrs%2Fsupporting-implementation%2Fadoption-guide%2Fregulatory-implementation-programme-outline.pdf&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cmailing-lists%40iosco.org%7C619e4cab47484972ca6208dd1f52a9a7%7Cbcc6c66cdb3b48328af2cc363a097444%7C0%7C0%7C638701162088437487%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=g%2FKCUzQmb8Z%2FyVvwQOKscciXn8%2BwViPIoNlwB0UXz00%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank">Regulatory Implementation Programme</a> Outline. These documents are already proving to be important additions to the toolkit available to jurisdictions as they navigate their approaches towards the adoption or other use of ISSB Standards. IOSCO has since been actively supporting these jurisdictions through an enhanced capacity-building program, designed to help them build the expertise necessary to adopt the ISSB Standards.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Liquidnet, a leading technology-driven agency execution specialist, today announced&nbsp;a record-breaking year for its VWAP Cross solution, achieving a 75% year-over-year increase in daily principal traded, and strategic expansion into the Philippines, reinforcing its commitment to innovation and market leadership across Asia Pacific.</p>
<p>Launched in 2022 in Hong Kong, Japan, and Australia, and in Indonesia in 2023, VWAP Cross is designed to facilitate block size orders at the full day VWAP price prior to market open, allowing traders to reduce market impact and improve VWAP performance. Since its introduction, the solution has steadily gained traction with year-over-year growth, underscoring its robust performance and strong market adoption.</p>
<p>In 2024, Liquidnet extended its VWAP Cross capabilities to two new markets&mdash;Singapore and the Philippines. This brought the total to six active markets in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2025, the firm plans to expand its footprint further. This momentum, driven by Member feedback, aligns with the firm&rsquo;s strategy to further strengthen its presence in the region and offer its Members new trading opportunities in key markets.</p>
<p><b>Tristan Baldwin, Head of Equities, APAC at Liquidnet,</b>&nbsp;said: "Our record growth and strategic expansions are a testament to our commitment to client-led innovation and letting communication with our network drive our solutions. We are excited to continue supporting our Members with solutions to their pain points and expanding our footprint in key markets."</p>
<p>In September 2024, Liquidnet achieved the largest block trade in Hong Kong of $40 million (single-sided), demonstrating the platform&rsquo;s ability to handle substantial trades and address the evolving needs of its Members.</p>

<title>FSB Consults On Recommendations To Address Financial Stability Risks Arising From Leverage In Non-Bank Financial Intermediation</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fsb-consults-on-recommendations-to-address-financial-stability-risks-arising-fro/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fsb-consults-on-recommendations-to-address-financial-stability-risks-arising-fro/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><span>Proposed policy recommendations aim to enhance the ability of authorities and market participants to identify, monitor and contain financial stability risks associated with leverage in non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI).</span></li>
<li><span>Proposed recommendations call for authorities to address financial stability risks from NBFI leverage in core financial markets; ensure sufficient counterparty credit risk management by leverage providers; and determine whether and how to address any inconsistencies in regulatory treatment.</span></li>
<li><span>The FSB and standard-setting bodies (SSBs) will undertake further work to support and assist authorities in applying the recommendations, including developing guidance where appropriate.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) today published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/12/leverage-in-non-bank-financial-intermediation-consultation-report/">consultation report on leverage in non-bank financial intermediation</a>&nbsp;(NBFI). The proposed policy recommendations are addressed to FSB member authorities and SSBs. They aim to enhance the ability of authorities and market participants to monitor vulnerabilities from NBFI leverage, contain NBFI leverage where it may create risks to financial stability, and mitigate the impact of these risks. The recommendations build on the 2023 FSB report on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/09/the-financial-stability-implications-of-leverage-in-non-bank-financial-intermediation/">The Financial Stability Implications of Leverage in Non-Bank Financial Intermediation</a>, which found that NBFI leverage played a significant role in recent episodes of market stress.</p>
<p>The nine policy recommendations cover:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>risk identification and monitoring, supported by a suite of risk metrics, and work to assess and address data challenges;</li>
<li>measures to address financial stability risks related to NBFI leverage in core financial markets, including measures that affect specific activities, types of entities, and concentration-related risks;</li>
<li>counterparty credit risk management and private disclosure;</li>
<li>addressing inconsistencies by adopting the principle of &ldquo;same risk, same regulatory treatment&rdquo;; and</li>
<li>enhancing cross-border cooperation and collaboration.</li>
</ul>
<p>Entities in scope are non-bank financial firms that use leverage, either financial or synthetic, including hedge funds, other leveraged investment funds, pension funds, and insurance companies. Where relevant, banks and broker-dealers are also in scope in their role as leverage providers.</p>
<p><a>The FSB notes that market structures, legal frameworks, and financial stability risks related to leverage vary across jurisdictions.&nbsp;</a>The report outlines general principles for the selection, design, and calibration of policy measures, noting that, in many cases, combinations of the policy measures outlined may be most effective in addressing financial stability risks arising from NBFI leverage.</p>
<p>The FSB is inviting comments on this consultation report and the questions set out within it. Responses should be submitted via this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/survey/369268?newtest=Y&amp;lang=en" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">secure&nbsp;online form</a>&nbsp;by 28 February 2025. All responses will be published on the FSB website unless respondents request otherwise. The final report will be published in mid-2025.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h2>
<p>The proposed policy recommendations complement the FSB&rsquo;s recommendations to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/12/liquidity-preparedness-for-margin-and-collateral-calls-final-report/">enhance the liquidity preparedness of non-bank market participants for margin and collateral calls</a>&nbsp;during times of market-wide stress, as well as the work of the SSBs, such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) work on counterparty credit risk management and the joint work by the BCBS, the Bank for International Settlements&rsquo; Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) on margining practices.</p>
<p>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. The FSB also conducts outreach with approximately 70 other jurisdictions through its six Regional Consultative Groups.</p>
<p>The FSB is chaired by Klaas Knot, President of De Nederlandsche Bank. The FSB Secretariat is located in Basel, Switzerland and hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>

<title>Broadridge Collaboration With CCRI Expands ClearFi Platform, Adding Crypto Sustainability Data - Comprehensive Solution For Clients Required To Disclose Sustainability Metrics And Generate Whitepapers As Per EU MiCA Regulation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A new, pioneering collaboration between the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://carbon-ratings.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute</a>&nbsp;(CCRI), a leader in sustainability data on digital assets, and&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3790970-1&amp;h=3944124396&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.broadridge.com%2F&amp;a=Broadridge+Financial+Solutions%2C%C2%A0Inc" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Broadridge Financial Solutions,&nbsp;Inc</a>. (NYSE:&nbsp;BR) a global Fintech leader, will deliver an integrated communications, data, and disclosure generation platform to help companies operating in Europe, including exchanges, brokers and asset managers to meet new sustainability reporting requirements. This integration combines CCRI&rsquo;s trusted sustainability data with Broadridge&rsquo;s ClearFI digital asset information and disclosure platform, enabling financial services firms to demonstrate compliance with the European Union&rsquo;s (EU) Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;As global regulators define new rules and standards to mature the Digital asset and Crypto Industry the ClearFi solution continues to expand to assist clients compliance needs,&rdquo;&nbsp;</i><b>said Rob Krugman, Chief Digital Officer at Broadridge.</b>&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;Working with CCRI, we are helping the financial services industry meet critical regulatory requirement and drive more informed investment decisions for all market participants.&rdquo;&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EU&rsquo;s MiCA framework represents a groundbreaking regulatory approach, designed to stabilize financial markets, protect investors, and usher in a new era of transparency in the crypto sector. MiCA requires Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs), including exchanges, brokers and custody providers operating in the EU to present their customers with sustainability metrics in addition to generating and filing whitepapers with Member States for each of the assets enabled on their platforms.&nbsp; The combined dataset enabled through this partnership will enable Broadridge to assist CASPs in satisfying these regulations immediately. The new MiCA rules begin to go into effect on December 30, 2024.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;This collaboration is a significant milestone, providing companies with the data and tools to comply with regulatory frameworks including the requirements for sustainability disclosures,&rdquo;</i>&nbsp;said&nbsp;<b>Christian Stoll, Chief Executive Officer at CCRI.</b>&nbsp;This partnership will also extend to asset managers and corporations that will need to comply with upcoming changes to accounting rules that require the consideration of GHG emissions related to digital assets that asset managers or corporations hold or trade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As regulatory efforts expand, for instance, California is introducing corporate climate disclosure requirements that extend to value chain (scope 3) emissions, including crypto-related activities, reflecting a broader global emphasis on sustainability in digital markets. The Broadridge-CCRI partnership positions clients to navigate these developments as well. The platform anticipates California&rsquo;s upcoming corporate carbon reporting requirements, offering a forward-looking solution for asset managers and corporations operating in global markets.</p>

<title>ASIC Sues Crypto Company Binance Australia Derivatives For Consumer Protection Failures</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-sues-crypto-company-binance-australia-derivatives-for-consumer-protection-f/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-sues-crypto-company-binance-australia-derivatives-for-consumer-protection-f/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>More than 500 retail clients of Oztures Trading Pty Ltd, trading as Binance Australia Derivatives (Binance), were denied important consumer protections after being misclassified as wholesale clients, ASIC alleges in documents filed in the Federal Court.</p>
<p>ASIC alleges from 7 July 2022 to 21 April 2023, Binance offered crypto derivative products to 505 Australian retail investors who were misclassified as wholesale clients, representing 83% of its Australian client base.</p>
<p>Retail clients trading financial products, in this case, crypto derivative products, have important rights and consumer protections under Australian financial services laws. These include the requirement to be provided with a product disclosure statement and access to a compliant dispute resolution scheme. In addition, Binance was required to make a target market determination under design and distribution obligations.</p>
<p>ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said Binance allegedly failed to ensure that the services it provided under its Australian financial services licence were provided efficiently, honestly and fairly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Our case alleges Binance&rsquo;s compliance systems were woefully inadequate and exposed more than 500 clients to high-risk, speculative products without the right consumer protections in place. Many of these clients suffered significant financial losses. In 2023, we oversaw compensation payments by Binance of approximately $13 million to affected clients.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Crypto derivative products are inherently risky and complex, so it is critical that retail clients are classified correctly. Those classifications ensure they receive the required consumer protections, and the information required to make an informed investment decision.&rsquo;</p>
<p>ASIC alleges Binance, in the period July 2022 to April 2023, failed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>give a Product Disclosure Statement to retail clients</li>
<li>make a Target Market Determination</li>
<li>have a compliant internal dispute resolution system</li>
<li>do all things necessary to ensure that its financial services were provided efficiently, honestly and fairly&nbsp;</li>
<li>comply with the conditions of its licence, and&nbsp;</li>
<li>ensure that its employees were adequately trained and competent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Earlier this month, ASIC released Consultation paper 381&nbsp;<em>Updates to INFO 225: Digital Assets: Financial Products and Services</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/consultations/cp-381-updates-to-info-225-digital-assets-financial-products-and-services/" title="CP 381 Updates to INFO 225: Digital assets: Financial products and services">CP 381</a>) outlining proposals to update&nbsp;<em>Information Sheet 225 Crypto Assets&nbsp;</em>(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-266mr-asic-invites-feedback-on-proposed-updates-to-digital-asset-guidance/?altTemplate=betanewsroom" title="24-266MR ASIC invites feedback on proposed updates to digital asset guidance">24-266MR</a>) to provide greater clarity about how the current financial product definitions apply to digital assets and related products.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Many digital assets and related products are financial products under the current law. We are consulting with the sector to improve regulatory clarity, and ASIC will continue to use the full range of regulatory and enforcement tools to safeguard consumers and uphold market integrity in the digital asset sector,&rsquo; Ms Court said.</p>
<p>ASIC will be seeking penalties, declarations and adverse publicity orders.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Binance Australia Derivatives is part of the global Binance group, one of the world&rsquo;s largest digital cryptocurrency exchanges by trading volume with registered users across the globe.</p>
<p>In December 2022, ASIC began a targeted review of Binance&rsquo;s financial services business, including its classification of wholesale clients. This resulted in ASIC issuing a notice of hearing under s915C of the Corporations Act 2001 to consider whether the Australian financial services (AFS) licence held by Binance Australia Derivatives should be cancelled or suspended. On 6 April 2023, ASIC cancelled the AFS licence in response to a request to cancel from the entity (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2023-releases/23-091mr-binance-australia-derivatives-afs-licence-cancelled/" title="23-091MR Binance Australia Derivatives &ndash; AFS licence cancelled">23-091MR</a>).</p>
<p>In 2023, ASIC oversaw the compensation payments of approximately $13.1 million to reported misclassified Binance clients (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2023-releases/23-298mr-asic-oversees-more-than-17-4-million-in-compensation-to-retail-investors-by-otc-derivative-issuers/" title="23-298MR ASIC oversees more than $17.4 million in compensation to retail investors by OTC derivative issuers">23-298MR</a>).</p>
<p>Under the&nbsp;<em>Corporations Act 2001</em>, AFS licensees are required to provide retail clients with important consumer rights and protections, including but not limited to, a Product Disclosure Statement (PDS), and a Target Market Determination (TMD).</p>
<p>The design and distribution obligations require issuers and distributors to have a consumer-centric approach to designing, marketing and distributing financial products. In particular, firms must design financial products that meet the likely objectives, financial situation and needs of the target consumer for whom they are intended. Firms must also take reasonable steps that are reasonably likely to result in the distribution of their financial products to be directed and limited to the defined target market.</p>
<p>ASIC has previously taken civil penalty proceedings against global digital asset exchange operator Bit Trade Pty Ltd (the operator of the Kraken crypto exchange in Australia) for design and distribution obligation failures, with the Federal Court ruling in favour of ASIC&rsquo;s case (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-186mr-asic-wins-case-against-kraken-crypto-exchange-operator-for-design-and-distribution-failure/?altTemplate=betanewsroom" title="24-186MR ASIC wins case against Kraken crypto exchange operator for design and distribution failure">24-186MR</a>).</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s Moneysmart website has information for consumers about the risks of investing in&nbsp;<a href="https://moneysmart.gov.au/investment-warnings/cryptocurrencies">crypto assets</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">Even after the publication of the &ldquo;<span class="icon-pdf"><img alt="PDF" src="https://www.fsa.go.jp/images/common/icon_pdf.gif" /></span><a href="https://www.fsa.go.jp/en/news/2024/20240220/01.pdf">Current Situation and Issues for Improving Internal Audits of Financial Institutions</a>&rdquo; (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;Current Situation and Issues&rdquo;) in June 2019, the Financial Services Agency (FSA) has continued to monitor financial institutions to improve their internal audits. In October last year, the FSA organized status of initiative and recognition of issues of internal audits in large banking groups, and published it as a&nbsp;<span class="icon-pdf"><img alt="PDF" src="https://www.fsa.go.jp/images/common/icon_pdf.gif" /></span><a href="https://www.fsa.go.jp/en/news/2024/20240220/03.pdf">progress report</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition, the FSA has continued to monitor not only large banking groups but also regional financial institutions, large securities companies, and large insurance companies, and has now summarized the monitoring results and compiled them into the &ldquo;Monitoring Report for Improving Internal Audits of Financial Institutions (2024)&rdquo; together with the FSA&rsquo;s recognition of issues and expectation level.</p>
<p class="indent">The FSA expects that this document will help financial institutions to improve their internal audits in accordance with their size and characteristics.</p>
<p class="indent">The FSA will continue to promote the improvement of internal audits by proceeding with in-depth monitoring of financial institutions. In addition, the FSA will consider the necessity of updating the &ldquo;Current Situation and Issues&rdquo; based on the results of monitoring and international trends regarding internal audit (including reconsideration of each phase).</p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority Censures Pathfinder For Misleading Representations</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-censures-pathfinder-for-misleading-repre/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-censures-pathfinder-for-misleading-repre/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana&nbsp;Tātai&nbsp;Hokohoko &ndash; has censured Pathfinder Asset Management (Pathfinder) under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (FMCA).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA is satisfied that between October 2021 and May 2024, Pathfinder made misleading statements about the nature of its KiwiSaver Funds&rsquo; ethical investments in two advertisements on social media and its website relating to animal testing and fossil fuels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FMA Executive Director, Response and Enforcement, Louise Unger said: &ldquo;KiwiSaver is vitally important to the wellbeing of New Zealanders. Misleading statements about a fund&rsquo;s ethical investment policy have the potential to result in consumers investing in a fund that is inconsistent with their values, and to cause damage to investor confidence in KiwiSaver.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an advertisement on social media, &ldquo;Tara&rsquo;s story&rdquo;, Pathfinder represented that its funds did not invest in companies involved in animal testing. In a second advertisement on its website, &ldquo;Estefania&rsquo;s story&rdquo;, Pathfinder represented that its funds did not invest in companies involved in fossil fuels or animal testing. Tara&rsquo;s story ran for approximately 23 months, and Estefania&rsquo;s story was available on Pathfinder&rsquo;s website for approximately 13 months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA&rsquo;s view is that both advertisements were misleading because there was no information or qualifications included which informed investors that Pathfinder&rsquo;s funds held investments in five companies involved in animal testing for pharmaceutical purposes and one company that uses fossil fuels to generate electricity. While Pathfinder&rsquo;s Ethical Investment Policy generally excludes investments in companies deriving greater than 5% of revenues from fossil fuel activities and animal testing, these companies had been granted&nbsp;exceptions&nbsp;in accordance with the Policy&rsquo;s criteria.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a material disparity between representations in the advertisements and the actual position,&rdquo; Ms Unger said. &ldquo;In this case Pathfinder should have qualified the advertisements by including prominent information about the&nbsp;exceptions&nbsp;it had granted as permitted by its Ethical Investment Policy. The FMA&rsquo;s primary concern is the harm caused by investors being misled about the investments made by Pathfinder&rsquo;s KiwiSaver Funds; the actual benefit Pathfinder may have obtained from the advertisements does not detract from this harm. The FMA is satisfied that Pathfinder&rsquo;s conduct was a material departure from the fair dealing requirements of the FMCA and did not reflect the FMA&rsquo;s guide on advertising offers of financial products. For these reasons, we believe a censure is the proportionate response to Pathfinder&rsquo;s conduct.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pathfinder, which had been improving the clarity of its Ethical Investment Policy, made a list of&nbsp;exceptions&nbsp;it has granted available on its website after being contacted by the FMA, and promptly took down the two advertisements when the FMA brought the contraventions to its attention.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA acknowledges Pathfinder&rsquo;s cooperation during its investigation and its decision to remove the advertisements when the FMA began making inquiries.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fma.govt.nz/assets/Guidance/Advertising-offers-of-financial-products-guidance-note.pdf" title="This guidance focuses on the application of the fair dealing provisions in Part 2 of the FMC Act to communications made for the purposes of advertising or promoting offers of financial products (advertising).  This guidance also covers the application of the specific advertising provisions in Part 3 of the FMC Act for regulated offers of financial products.">Download FMA advertising offers of financial products guidance note</a></p>

<title>NZX - Director Independence Review: Notice Of Rule And Code Amendments</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/nzx-director-independence-review-notice-of-rule-and-code-amendments/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/nzx-director-independence-review-notice-of-rule-and-code-amendments/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In 2023, NZX commenced the review of its regulatory requirements for issuers of equity securities in relation to director independence, with the support of the NZX Corporate Governance Institute.&nbsp; This review was recently completed following a detailed two-stage consultation process, the commissioning of academic research and international benchmarking of practices of comparable exchanges. The review was completed in October this year, and an application was made to the FMA for certain amendments to NZX&rsquo;s regulatory settings.</p>
<p>NZX has now received the necessary approval from the FMA, and wishes to notify the market of changes to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>NZX Listing Rules </li>
<li>NZX Corporate Governance Code </li>
<li>Governance Guidance Note </li>
</ul>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td height="0" width="3"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><br clear="ALL" /> The updated Rules, Code and Guidance Note referred to above will become effective on 31 January 2025.</p>
<p>NZX also notes that a consequential amendment to Code recommendation 2.4 will become effective on 1 April 2025, when new rule 3.8.1(f) becomes effective. This rule contains a new requirement for issuers of equity securities to include certain disclosures relating to the board&rsquo;s assessment of a director&rsquo;s independence in an annual report (consistent with current Code recommendation 2.4 (c)) for balance dates ending on or after 31 March 2026.</p>
<p>We are also taking the opportunity to make minor updates to Appendix 4 of the Rules which relates to the disclosure requirements for mining issuers. &nbsp;</p>

<title>US Office Of The Comptroller Of The Currency Reports Mortgage Performance For Third Quarter Of 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) reported on the performance of first-lien mortgages in the federal banking system during the third quarter of 2024.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>OCC Mortgage Metrics Report, Third Quarter 2024</em>&nbsp;showed that 97.4 percent of mortgages included in the report were current and performing at the end of the quarter, a slight increase from 97.3 percent one year earlier.</p>
<p>The percentage of seriously delinquent mortgages &ndash; mortgages that are 60 or more days past due and all mortgages held by bankrupt borrowers whose payments are 30 or more days past due &ndash; increased from the prior quarter; however, it has decreased from the third quarter of 2023.</p>
<p>Servicers initiated 6,693 new foreclosures in the third quarter of 2024 showing an increase from the previous quarter and a decrease from the third quarter 2023.</p>
<p>Servicers completed 7,450 modifications during the third quarter of 2024, a 0.5 percent decrease from the previous quarter&rsquo;s 7,488 modifications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The latest data from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives statistics shows a modest increase in notional outstanding of OTC derivatives during the first half of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. While interest rate derivatives (IRD) notional outstanding remained relatively flat year-over-year, foreign exchange (FX), equity and commodity derivatives notional outstanding rose.</p>
<p>The gross market value of IRD derivatives declined amid a shift in central bank interest rate policy. Gross credit exposure also fell during the period.</p>
<p>By mid-year 2024, the notional outstanding of global OTC derivatives rose by 2.4% compared to mid-year 2023. In contrast, OTC derivatives gross market value fell by 14.0% and gross credit exposure, representing gross market value after netting, declined by 20.2%.</p>
<p>Total mark-to-market exposure dropped by 83.5% due to close-out netting. Credit exposure was further reduced by the collateral market participants posted for cleared and non-cleared derivatives.</p>
<p>Market participants posted $364.4 billion of required initial margin (IM) for cleared IRD and credit default swap (CDS) transactions at all major central counterparties (CCPs) at mid-year 2024 compared to $389.0 billion at mid-year 2023.</p>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/canadian-securities-regulators-extend-comment-periods-for-the-investment-fund-co/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) have extended the comment periods for the investment fund continuous disclosure modernization and principal distributor model proposals.</p>
<p>The CSA is mindful there are a large number of significant proposed rule changes open for stakeholder feedback. To give all stakeholders sufficient time to thoroughly review these proposals and provide meaningful input on them, the CSA is extending the comment period deadlines for the continuous disclosure modernization and principal distributor model proposals. The new dates were selected to ensure that the CSA will still be able to make timely progress on these initiatives.</p>
<p>The CSA published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asc.ca/-/media/ASC-Documents-part-1/Regulatory-Instruments/2024/09/6179412-CSA-Notice-Proposed-Amendments-re-Cont-Discl-81-106.ashx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">proposed amendments aimed at modernizing the continuous disclosure regime</a>&nbsp;for investment funds on September 19, 2024. The deadline to submit comments on the proposed amendments has been extended to January 31, 2025. The British Columbia Securities Commission (BCSC) did not publish the proposed amendments for comment at the time due to the British Columbia provincial general election taking place at that time. The BCSC published the proposed amendments on November 19, 2024. The deadline for comments with respect to the BCSC publication has also been extended to January 31, 2025.</p>
<p>The CSA published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asc.ca/-/media/ASC-Documents-part-1/Regulatory-Instruments/2024/11/6192081-CSA-Notice-Proposed-Amendments-NI-81-105-and-others.ashx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">proposed amendments to the principal distributor model</a>&nbsp;in the distribution of mutual funds on November 28, 2024. The deadline to submit comments on those proposals has been extended to April 28, 2025.</p>
<p>The CSA, the council of the securities regulators of Canada&rsquo;s provinces and territories, co-ordinates and harmonizes regulation for the Canadian capital markets.</p>

<title>ESMA Releases Last Policy Documents To Get Ready For MiCA</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/esma-releases-last-policy-documents-to-get-ready-for-mica/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/esma-releases-last-policy-documents-to-get-ready-for-mica/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, is publishing the last package of final reports containing regulatory technical standards and guidelines ahead of the full entry into application of the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA).&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>ESMA has delivered extensive regulatory work over the past 18 months, comprising more than 30 Technical Standards and Guidelines, many of them developed in cooperation with the European Banking Authority (EBA).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verena Ross, ESMA Chair, said:&nbsp;</p>
<h6><em>&ldquo;The entry into force of the MiCA regime from 30 December 2024 marks a significant step towards having a regulatory framework for the crypto market in place. &nbsp;Nevertheless, it is crucial to recognise that the new regime would not suffice to eliminate the inherent uncertainty and volatility in the crypto-assets market, and investors should fully understand the risks before engaging in this space.</em></h6>
<h6><em>Looking ahead, as the transitional period progresses, we will continue to provide guidance and work with all NCAs to ensure the smooth implementation of MiCA and to support a level playing field through supervisory convergence actions.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></h6>
<p>Today's package contains:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Regulatory Technical Standards on market abuse</span>&nbsp;that&nbsp;specify systems and procedures to prevent and detect market abuse in crypto-assets, the template for reporting suspected market abuse in crypto-assets as well as coordination procedures between competent authorities for the detection and sanctioning of cross-border market abuse situations.&nbsp;These rules will enable supervisors to address suspicions of market abuse and follow up with enforcement actions where necessary.</li>
<li><span>Guidelines on reverse solicitation</span>&nbsp;that&nbsp;confirm ESMA&rsquo;s previous message that the reverse solicitation exemption should be understood as very narrowly framed and&nbsp;should be regarded as the exception and&nbsp;not be used to circumvent MiCA requirements. This exemption only&nbsp;applies to cases where the client is the exclusive initiator of the service. Guidance is provided on the limited circumstances where this may be the case.</li>
<li><span>Guidelines on suitability&nbsp;</span>that specify how&nbsp;crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) providing advice on crypto-assets&nbsp;or portfolio management of crypto-assets&nbsp;have to give suitable recommendations to their clients or make suitable investment decisions on their behalf. These rules are aligned with the MiFID II requirements so that CASPs providing advice both under MiFID II and MiCA would be subject to similar requirements.</li>
<li><span>Guidelines on crypto-asset&nbsp;transfer services</span>&nbsp;that&nbsp;aim at ensuring investor protection for clients transferring crypto-assets, by specifying the policies and procedures&nbsp;that CASPs should have in place.</li>
<li><span>Guidelines on&nbsp;qualification of crypto-assets as financial instruments&nbsp;</span>who&nbsp;provide conditions and criteria for the qualification of crypto-assets as financial instruments. The guidelines aim to provide&nbsp;more clarity about the&nbsp;delineation between the respective scopes of application of MiCA and other sectoral regulatory frameworks (notably MiFID II).</li>
<li><span>Guidelines on the maintenance of systems and security access protocols</span>&nbsp;that apply to offerors and persons seeking admission to trading who are not subject to the same operational resilience standards under MiCA and DORA as their CASP and issuer counterparts. Therefore, the guidelines provide for a streamlined set of principles for entities in scope to manage their ICT risks.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span>Next Steps</span></h4>
<p>The priority for ESMA will be to continue the collaboration with national competent authorities during the transitional period and to ensure that MiCA&rsquo;s provisions are fully implemented and evolve in line with the changing landscape of the crypto-asset market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The guidelines will be translated into the official EU languages and published on the ESMA website. They will apply from three months after the publication of the translations. The final reports with the draft RTS have been submitted to the European Commission for adoption.&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li><span>The IBEX 35&reg; advanced by 15.2% up to the end of November and is one of the best indices of the year in Europe, after five consecutive semesters of growth</span></li>
<li><span>Spanish listed companies increased shareholder remuneration by 25% to 34,655 million euros, reaching an all-time high if share redemptions are added</span></li>
<li><span>The Spanish stock market ranks tenth in the world in new financing flows, with 9.3 billion euros, 97% more than last year</span></li>
<li><span>There are 222 live issues of green, social and sustainable bonds in BME's markets</span></li>
</ul>
<p>BME today presented the 2024 market report, a year of growth, as highlighted by Juan Flames, CEO of BME, and Javier Hernani, Executive Board Member of BME and SIX. With data up to the end of November, the year was marked by the addition of 24 companies to the markets managed by BME (21 in BME Growth and BME Scaleup and three in Bolsa). The year also saw growth in shareholder remuneration for listed companies, corporate financing channeled through the financial markets, equity trading volumes and the main activities in the post-trading area.</p>
<p>In the first eleven months of the year, Spanish listed companies increased shareholder remuneration by 25% to 34.6 billion euros. Share redemptions also increased, to 13.5 billion euros, so that if both shareholder remuneration formulas (dividends and share redemptions) are taken into account, shareholder remuneration exceeds 48.2 billion euros, an increase of 11%, reaching a new all-time high.</p>
<p>The Spanish stock market ranked tenth in the world in new financing flows in 2024, with 9,854 million dollars (9.3 billion euros), according to data from the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE). This represents a growth of 97% compared to last year, driven mainly by IPOs. These included Puig, which was the world's largest in the first half of the year, followed by Inmocemento and Cox. In addition, BME Growth and BME Scaleup have attracted 21 small and medium-sized companies from different sectors, 23 if we add the two that have joined so far in December and which are not yet included in the report, prepared with data at the end of November.</p>
<p>In the first eleven months of the year, 294.2 billion euros worth of shares were traded on BME's platforms, 6% more than in the same period of the previous year. This is the first rise in the annual amount traded in shares since 2015. The Ibex 35&reg; was once again one of the best performers in Europe, with an increase of 15.2% through November, and now has five consecutive semesters of growth.</p>
<p>2024 was also a good year for the Spanish stock market in terms of capital increases. 6,062 million euros were raised, up 32%.</p>
<p>In fixed income, there was a 5.3% increase in the volume of issues and admissions to the MARF, reaching 14.4 billion euros. In addition, 60 new green, social and sustainable issues were admitted for trading on the fixed-income markets and platforms managed by BME up to November, for an amount of close to 86.2 billion euros, bringing the total number of issues of this type in BME's markets to 222 at the end of November.</p>
<p>In financial derivatives, the volume of derivatives on dividend payments increased fivefold. Also noteworthy was the 50% growth in IBEX 35&reg; options and the 46% increase in the volume traded in Electricity Futures contracts.</p>
<p>The various post-trading areas also recorded increases, such as the 4% growth in average daily cash cleared in equities, the 32% rise in trading in xRolling FX contracts and the 3% increase in instructions from stock market operations settled in Iberclear.</p>
<p>One of the biggest debates this year has been the move to the D+1 settlement cycle, which has taken place this year in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Argentina, and will be implemented in Europe in 2027. Ahead of this milestone, BME has launched a new process that allows transactions such as IPOs or accelerated capital increases to be settled on D+1, thereby reducing risks and costs. The first to follow this procedure was the Cox IPO.</p>
<p>Juan Flames, CEO of BME, explains that &ldquo;despite the difficulties and uncertainties, 2024 has been a year of growth for the Spanish financial markets, with the arrival of new companies, an increase in corporate financing and a rise in shareholder remuneration, among other factors. We are working to ensure that 2025 is once again a good year in which more companies of all sectors and sizes make the leap to the capital markets, which are the ones that offer them more visibility, reputation and recurring access to financing.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<title>The EBA Publishes Final Draft Technical Standards On The Conditions For Determining Whether An Instrument Attracting Residual Risk Acts As A Hedge</title>

<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published its final draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on the conditions for determining whether an instrument attracting residual risk acts as a hedge. These RTS are part of the Phase 1 deliverables of the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-publishes-roadmap-implementation-eu-banking-package" title="The EBA publishes roadmap on the implementation of the EU Banking Package"><span>EBA roadmap on the implementation of the EU banking package in the area of market risk</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p>One of the pillars of the standardised approach/ sensitivity-based method (SA/SbM) under the new fundamental review of the trading book (FRTB) framework is the residual risk add-on (RRAO). The EU Banking Package introduces a provision in the RRAO framework allowing the exemption from the RRAO charge for those instruments bearing residual risks that are, in turn, used to hedge instruments bearing residual risks.</p>
<p>These RTS specify when an instrument qualifies as a hedge for the purpose of the exemption and when not.&nbsp;In particular, the RTS require institutions to identify whether the RRAO charge for which the institution seeks the exemption relates to a risk factor that is not shocked in the SbM (i.e. a non-SbM risk factor), or if it is down to other reasons.&nbsp;When the RRAO relates exclusively to a non-SbM risk factor, the RTS envisage conditions aiming at assessing whether, as a result of the hedge, the sensitivity towards the non-SbM risk factor is reduced. Under this circumstance, constant-maturity spread plain vanilla options are&nbsp; should fall.</p>
<p>A similar framework is applied to instruments referencing an exotic underlying in the form of dividend, future realised volatility or variance. On the other hand, where the RRAO charge is due to other reasons than the presence of a non-SbM risk factor, or an exotic underlying in the form of dividend, future realised volatility or variance, the RTS allow the hedging instrument to be recognised as hedge, and as such exempted from the RRAO charge, only if it completely offsets the RRAO risk stemming from the hedged instruments.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<p>The draft RTS on the FRTB have been developed according to Article 325(u)(6) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR), as amended by the CRR3, which mandates the EBA to specify criteria to identify positions attracting residual risk that act as a hedge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In light of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-responds-european-commissions-delegated-act-postponing-application-market-risk-framework-eu">postponement of the FRTB</a>&nbsp;(), it is worth noting that these RTS are still needed for the implementation of the CRR as of 1 January, given that the&nbsp; FRTB-SA will apply for the purposes of the output floor calculation. The delivery of the RTS will, therefore, provide clarity on this aspect for the implementation of the EU Banking Package.</p>

<title>The ESAs’ Dry Run Exercise Shows The Goal Of Reporting Of Registers Of Information Under Digital Operational Resilience Act In 2025 Within Reach</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Supervisory Authorities (EBA, EIOPA and ESMA &ndash; the ESAs) published today a summary report with the key findings from the 2024 Dry Run exercise on reporting the registers of information under the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA). The conclusions and lessons learnt as well as individual data quality feedback provided to financial entities during the exercise will aid preparations for the official reporting starting in 2025.</span></p>
<p>The quality of data observed in the registers submitted by almost 1,000 financial entities across the EU was in line with the ESAs' expectations, considering the 'best effort' nature of the exercise. Of the registers analysed, 6.5% successfully passed all data quality checks, while 50% of the remaining registers failed less than 5 out of 116 data quality checks.</p>
<p>The ESAs are confident that the objective of having registers of sufficient quality in 2025 that would allow for the designation of critical third-party service providers (CTPPs) is not out of reach, subject to some additional efforts from the industry.</p>
<p>The key findings presented in the summary report and all supporting materials provided by the ESAs should be carefully considered by all industry stakeholders, including those financial entities that did not participate in the Dry Run exercise, as they will help them to be better prepared to report the registers in 2025.</p>
<h4><a name="_Hlk179796751">Support to the industry</a></h4>
<p>To support the Dry Run exercise and wider industry preparation, the ESAs provided numerous tools such as templates for the registers, a draft data point model, a draft reporting taxonomy, examples and instructions for filling data fields, and a tool for converting submissions into the required reporting format. Furthermore, the ESAs supported financial entities through a series of workshops, maintained and updated a &lsquo;frequently asked questions&rsquo; document and responded to the individual queries through an email-based &lsquo;hotline&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The ESAs have applied data quality checks to all the registers that have been received and have shared individual feedback on the data quality issues with the competent authorities, which were in turn shared with the participating financial entities.</p>
<p><a name="_Hlk181778447">In November 2024, the ESAs also published a list of validation rules that will be used when analysing the registers of information in the official reporting in 2025 as well as the visual representation of the data model. These rules will be included in the updated technical reporting package (including updated data point model, taxonomy and validation rules), which will be published in the coming weeks. All preparatory materials are collated on the&nbsp;</a><a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/activities/direct-supervision-and-oversight/digital-operational-resilience-act/preparation-dora-application">dedicated EBA webpage</a>.</p>
<p>The ESAs are also continuing with the Dry Run workshops for the industry. The last workshop in the series will be held on 18 December, and will focus on the Dry Run summary report and the changes to the&nbsp;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32024R2956">final ITS on the Registers of information</a>.</p>
<p>The preparatory efforts should not stop with the completion of the Dry Run exercise. The individual data quality feedback provided to the financial entities should help them continue improving the quality of their data and ensure that the registers to be submitted in 2025 meet the regulatory requirements, are complete and provide all the necessary information for the designation of critical ICT third-party providers (CTPPs) by the ESAs.</p>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>Since April 2024, the ESAs have been supporting the financial entities in their preparations for setting up and reporting the registers of information in relation to all contractual arrangements on the use of ICT services provided by the ICT third-party service providers (ICT TPPs). This mainly took the form of a dedicated Dry Run exercise that allowed for the testing of the reporting processes in an environment as close as possible to the upcoming first iteration of the official reporting in 2025, when the registers will be used by the ESAs for the purposes of designation of CTPPs to be under their oversight.&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The FCA welcomes the Court of Appeal&rsquo;s judgment which found that our decision to ban Mr Markou from financial services was the correct one. The Court of Appeal also determined that it was appropriate to fine Mr Markou &pound;10,000.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ul>
<li>In 2021 the FCA published this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/decision-notices/markos-theodosi-markou-2021.pdf" title="markos-theodosi-markou-2021.pdf">Decision Notice</a>&nbsp;in respect of Markos Markou, director and chief executive of a mortgage broker firm, Financial Solutions (Euro) Limited (FSE) seeking to impose a fine of &pound;25,000 and ban him from working in financial services.</li>
<li>Mr Markou referred this matter to the Upper Tribunal who asked for the FCA to reconsider the proposed ban and directed that a fine should not be imposed. We believed the decision to be incorrect and irrational and referred the matter to the Court of Appeal.</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The European Energy Exchange (EEX) is set to introduce &ldquo;Mon-Sun Peak Power Futures&rdquo;, a unique suite of contracts for the Spanish market, in addition to short-term futures for the Greek power market. Both new sets of contracts will be available from 24 February 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Developed in close coordination with the power trading community, the new &ldquo;Mon-Sun Peak Futures&rdquo; address the shift in power spot prices influenced by photovoltaic generation during daytime, regardless of the day of the week. These new contracts cover peak hours from 8:00am to 8:00pm CET, Monday to Sunday, matching the hedging needs over a full week, in line with solar power production. A full range of expiries from Day to Year will be available for these contracts, which will be initially launched for the Spanish market, with the potential to expand to other European markets in due course.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Leipzig, 17 December 2024</span>&nbsp;- The European Energy Exchange (EEX) is set to introduce &ldquo;Mon-Sun Peak Power Futures&rdquo;, a unique suite of contracts for the Spanish market, in addition to short-term futures for the Greek power market. Both new sets of contracts will be available from 24 February 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Developed in close coordination with the power trading community, the new &ldquo;Mon-Sun Peak Futures&rdquo; address the shift in power spot prices influenced by photovoltaic generation during daytime, regardless of the day of the week. These new contracts cover peak hours from 8:00am to 8:00pm CET, Monday to Sunday, matching the hedging needs over a full week, in line with solar power production. A full range of expiries from Day to Year will be available for these contracts, which will be initially launched for the Spanish market, with the potential to expand to other European markets in due course.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new Greek daily and weekly futures with a baseload profile have been designed for hedging volatile short-term positions. They will complement EEX&rsquo;s offering for the Greek market, which has seen substantial year-on-year monthly growth in volumes over 2024, latest in November (+425%).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Peter Reitz, CEO of EEX, commented: &ldquo;<em>EEX is committed to facilitating the energy transition by offering market-based tools that support this shift. The new &ldquo;Mon-Sun Peak Futures&rdquo; reflect the changing patterns in power spot markets, where solar generation increasingly impacts prices. These contracts provide a hedging opportunity aligned with the continuous nature of solar power generation.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p><br />To further support renewables integration and provide PPA hedging opportunities, EEX recently extended expiries to ten calendar years for the French and Dutch power markets, in addition to the existing offerings in the German, Spanish, and Italian markets. Long-term deals in the Spanish, Italian, and German power markets have seen significant growth, surpassing 10.5 TWh in traded volume in 2024.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<span>European Energy Exchange (EEX)</span>&nbsp;is a leading energy exchange which builds secure, successful and sustainable commodity markets worldwide &ndash; together with its customers. As part of EEX Group, a group of companies serving international commodity markets, it offers contracts on power, natural gas and emission allowances as well as freight and agricultural products. EEX also provides registry services as well as auctions for guarantees of origin, on behalf of the French State.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ACER is forming a new Expert Group to provide advice on peak-shaving products. We are looking for experts with relevant experience in electricity markets.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are peak-shaving products?</span></p>
<p>Peak-shaving products are market-based tools that enable market participants to reduce their electricity consumption during peak demand periods in exchange for compensation.</p>
<p>Under the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsEB1ADWVVRBkxYBwEBHVZaAA4dUFxVURoEUAtWUAQNUw8IUFAdAAZXVQ4PAVQdV10CBB0GCAgEGlQEUQ8ZAgZTAQNVB1cFVwACRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Electricity Market Design (EMD) Regulation</a>, the Council can declare a regional or EU-wide electricity crisis if wholesale prices become excessively high. In such cases, Member States can direct system operators to use peak-shaving products to reduce power demand, helping to stabilise the grid and lower prices.</p>
<p>The EMD Regulation also mandates ACER to assess the potential impact of developing peak-shaving products on Europe&rsquo;s electricity market under normal market conditions. To this end,&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtVA1UCVFcGB0wPUAIFHVYOAA4dU10AVhpWVQtWBwEFVFMCDgEdAAZXVQ4PAVQdV10CBB0GCAgEGlQEUQ8ZAgZTAQNVB1cFVwACRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ACER will launch a public consultation in spring 2025</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What will the Expert Group do?</span></p>
<p>The Expert Group will advise ACER on how developing peak-shaving products might affect the EU electricity market. Experts will explore the products&rsquo; feasibility, main benefits, and potential drawbacks. They will also advise ACER in assessing whether these products can be introduced without disrupting the functioning of electricity markets or redirecting existing demand response services towards peak-shaving products.</p>
<p>The group will operate until summer 2025, with the possibility of extending throughout the year for further analysis.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How to apply?</span></p>
<p>Follow the instructions in the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsFCQIJU1gBAExfAAVVHVZcDAQdUA5SUBoHUAsGUgpTBQQDAggdAAZXVQ4PAVQdV10CBB0GCAgEGlQEUQ8ZAgZTAQNVB1cFVwACRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Open Letter</a>, ensuring that you fulfill all the criteria.<br />The deadline for application is&nbsp;<strong>Monday, 20 January 2025</strong>.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Express, Inc. With Failing To Disclose Nearly $1 Million In Perks Provided To Former CEO - Commission Declines To Impose A Penalty Based On Company’s Self-Report, Cooperation, And Remediation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against Ohio-based Express, Inc., a multi-brand American fashion retailer, for failing to disclose executive compensation it paid to its now former CEO.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, in definitive proxy statements for fiscal years 2019, 2020, and 2021, Express failed to disclose $979,269 worth of perks and personal benefits provided to its CEO, including certain expenses associated with the CEO&rsquo;s authorized use of chartered aircraft for personal purposes. As a result, the company, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy earlier this year, understated the &ldquo;All Other Compensation&rdquo; portion of its CEO&rsquo;s compensation by an average of 94 percent over the three fiscal years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Public companies have a duty to comply with their disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation, including perks and personal benefits, so that investors can make educated investment decisions,&rdquo; said Sanjay Wadhwa, Acting Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;Here, although Express fell short in carrying out its obligation, the Commission declined to impose a civil penalty based, in part, on the company&rsquo;s self-report, cooperation with the staff&rsquo;s investigation, and remedial efforts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that Express violated Sections 13(a) and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-15(a), 14a-3, and 14a-9 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, Express agreed to a cease-and-desist order.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted in the Chicago Regional Office by Ruta G. Dudenas and Ann Tushaus, and supervised by Amy S. Cotter.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Avelacom - the low latency network solutions provider for global financial markets &ndash; announces the expansion of its network infrastructure to enhance interconnectivity between the Mexican and US financial markets. The initiative is driven by the growing demand for cross-border trading, particularly for algorithmic strategies and FX hedging.</span></p>
<p><span>The company has deployed new points of presence (PoPs) in the KIO data center in Mexico and the 165 Halsey data center in New York. Additionally, the company has upgraded its existing PoPs at key data centers, including Equinix facilities in Miami (MI1), New York (NY4/5), Ashburn (DC5), and Chicago (CH4). These enhancements are supported by newly built low-latency routes across the US and Mexico. The infrastructure is designed as a fully meshed network, delivering tier-1 redundancy capabilities to protect financial services firms from outages during critical low-latency trading activities.</span></p>
<p><span><img alt="Avelacom_17Dec24" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/Avelacom_17Dec24.jpg" title="Avelacom_17Dec24" /><br /></span></p>
<p><span>The expanded connectivity solutions by Avelacom set a new benchmark in the industry, enabling seamless trading between Mexico and the US. Along with low-latency connectivity, the upgraded infrastructure aligns with firms&rsquo; business continuity goals, ensuring reliability and resilience.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Lorenz Voss, Managing Director of Avelacom</span></strong><span>, comments: &ldquo;With 2025 expected to bring higher market volatility, both banks and non-bank financial institutions are seeking faster, more reliable connectivity solutions to optimize trading&nbsp;operations. As a US carrier, Avelacom&nbsp;is very well positioned to address these needs, providing lower network latency and unsurpassed reliability in connectivity solutions. This is the result of our investments throughout 2024 in fiber and submarine cabling systems&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Aleksey Larichev, CEO of Avelacom</span></strong><span>, adds: &ldquo;Avelacom continues to lead the way in providing connectivity as a competitive edge for global financial markets. We remain focused on delivering high-performance, reliable services that help our clients excel in a fast-paced environment and react instantaneously to market opportunities, regardless of asset class or market location.&rdquo;</span></p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Consults On New Private Stock Market</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-consults-on-new-private-stock-market/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-consults-on-new-private-stock-market/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>Proposals for a new platform - The Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System (PISCES) - on which shares in private companies will be bought and sold have been set out by the FCA.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>PISCES will open the door to more opportunities for investors to take stakes in private companies. Greater confidence to invest in these companies will lead to more funding to help them to grow and scale up.</p>
<p>With many companies choosing to stay private for longer, there is increasing demand for investors to be able to trade shares in private companies more easily. A world-leading innovation in private markets, PISCES could provide opportunities for more diversified returns for investors.</p>
<p>Such opportunities come with risk, which is why the FCA is consulting on risk warnings for investors to help them make informed investment decisions.</p>
<p>Simon Walls, interim executive director of markets at the FCA, said:</p>
<p>'Next year we will ring the bell on a new private stock market that could transform how private companies access funds and grow. It will offer investors more access and a greater confidence to invest in private companies and could act as a stepping stone to public markets for those firms.</p>
<p>'We want to work with industry and ensure we have the right building blocks in place to support investment in growing companies.'</p>
<p>Tulip Siddiq, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, added:</p>
<p>'PISCES will be an innovative new type of stock market for trading for private company shares and is a significant step forward in our reforms to capital markets. It will give investors the chance to get in on the ground floor of some of the most exciting companies and support the growth of those businesses.</p>
<p>'Today&rsquo;s consultation marks a significant step towards delivery of the new market next year and sits alongside our wider programme of reforms to boost competitiveness and investment. That includes the FCA&rsquo;s overhaul of the UK listing rules and the creation of pension megafunds which will unlock billions of pounds of potential investment in businesses.'</p>
<p>PISCES was a central pillar of the Chancellor&rsquo;s Mansion House speech just over a month ago, and the FCA has been working in partnership with the Treasury to build the right framework. &nbsp;</p>
<p>PISCES follows the FCA&rsquo;s wide-ranging reforms to the UK&rsquo;s world-leading markets to boost competitiveness by:</p>
<ul>
<li>reforming the prospectus regime, to make it cheaper and easier for companies to raise money in the UK</li>
<li>giving asset managers greater freedom in how they pay for investment research and setting out proposals to extend that flexibility</li>
<li>opening the Digital Securities Sandbox which allows firms to test innovative new technologies for trading and settling assets</li>
<li>setting out a roadmap to regulating crypto</li>
</ul>
<p>The FCA will work with market participants, industry leaders, trade bodies and platform operators to develop a proportionate regulatory framework that can support growth and enable innovation.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ol>
<li>Read&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/consultation-papers/cp24-29-private-intermittent-securities-and-capital-exchange-system" title="CP24/29: Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System: sandbox arrangements">CP24/29: Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System: sandbox arrangements</a>.</li>
<li>PISCES will be developed using a 'financial markets infrastructure (FMI) sandbox'. This will be the second use of the FMI Sandbox powers after the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/ps24-12-digital-securities-sandbox-joint-policy-statement-final-guidance" title="PS24/12: Digital Securities Sandbox joint Policy Statement and Final Guidance">Digital Securities Sandbox</a>.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The Treasury intends to lay a statutory instrument before Parliament by May 2025, which will provide the legal framework for the PISCES Sandbox. The FCA expects to publish its final rules shortly thereafter.</li>
<li>The sandbox environment will allow government and regulators to check it is working properly.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Firms wishing to run a PISCES platform will have to apply to the FCA, and once approved will be able to run intermittent trading events. The FCA will publish further information in early 2025 for firms interested in applying to be a PISCES operator.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The regulator and government will use any lessons from the sandbox period to improve the regime before making it permanent.</li>

<ul>
<li class="spanHeading"><span>Minimum spreads of Applicable Securities to be reduced by 50%-60% in two phases, to lower overall transaction costs and boost liquidity</span></li>
<li class="spanHeading"><span>Phase 1 to be implemented in mid-2025; Phase 2 to be launched one year later, subject to review of Phase 1 implementation</span></li>
<li class="spanHeading"><span>Stock Settlement fee structure, order input price limit and market making obligations for relevant single stock options also to be adjusted</span></li>

<p class="spanHeading"><span>Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) is pleased to announce</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>today (</span><span>Tues</span><span>day) the&nbsp;</span><span>conclusions to its Consultation Paper on the proposed reduction of minimum spreads in the Hong Kong securities market.</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading">HKEX received 110 non-duplicate responses from a wide spectrum of market participants. The proposals to reduce minimum spreads of equities, Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and other Applicable Securities (excluding Exchange Traded Products (ETPs), debt securities, Exchange Traded Options (ETOs) and Structured Products) in two phases received support from a majority of respondents, both in terms of the total number of respondents and from the proportion of the cash market turnover that the respondents in support of the proposals represent.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">Having carefully considered feedback from the consultation, HKEX will proceed with its proposal to reduce minimum spreads of the Applicable Securities in two phases (see table below). In order to provide adequate preparation time, Phase 1 will be implemented in mid-2025, while Phase 2 will be implemented in mid-2026, subject to a review of Phase 1&rsquo;s results.</p>

The minimum spreads reduction is the latest effort on this journey, and we are delighted to be moving forward with this important reform that will help lower overall transaction costs and support a more efficient price discovery process. We would like to sincerely thank all our market participants and stakeholders for taking part in the consultation process; their valuable feedback and support will help contribute to the long-term competitiveness and attractiveness of Hong Kong&rsquo;s markets.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading">The minimum spread is the minimum price change for a stock traded on an exchange and determines the tightest bid-ask spread allowed. A reduction of minimum spreads could therefore encourage trades to be transacted in smaller sizes.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="spanHeading">To help facilitate the smooth implementation of the reduction of minimum spreads without increasing the overall market trading cost, the stock settlement fee is proposed to be restructured. The minimum and maximum components would be removed and replaced with an adjusted fee rate charged on notional value traded. The new fee structure is designed to be cost-neutral to the market as a whole, while providing a more equitable and deterministic cost structure. The proposal is under consideration by the Securities and Futures Commission. Further details will be announced in due course, subject to regulatory approval.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">Alongside the changes in minimum spreads, HKEX will also adjust the order input price limit and make temporary adjustments to the market making obligations for the relevant single stock options, to provide greater flexibility for order input and trading activities under the tightened spreads.</p>

<title>Statement On Electronic Filing, SEC Chair Gary Gensler</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Today, the Commission approved a final rule to require broker-dealers, securities-based swap dealers, exchanges, clearing agencies, and other self-regulatory organizations to submit forms electronically. I am pleased to support this adoption because it would improve the efficiency of our markets by modernizing the filing process for a wide range of registrants.</p>
<p>We live in a digital age, in which technology and electronic trading have transformed our markets. In 2024, one might think that all filings to the Commission already could be made electronically. That&rsquo;s not yet true. The Commission oversees thousands of broker-dealers, the vast majority of whom submit annual audit reports. While many filers voluntarily submit these audits electronically, nearly half submitted them on paper last year.</p>
<p>In the digital era, such paper filings have become unnecessarily burdensome and impractical for both filers and the Commission. It costs investors money and time to travel to the SEC&rsquo;s reading room. It costs the SEC money and time to process paper filings. Further, as we saw during the spread of COVID-19, Commission staff couldn&rsquo;t access such physical copies onsite.</p>
<p>These amendments will, for the first time, require electronic filing for a significant majority of the remaining paper filings. Registrants will file electronically a range of annual and quarterly forms currently filed on paper. For instance, brokers and other filers need to submit electronically their annual audit filings and risk assessment reports.</p>
<p>The amendments also require forms to be submitted through the Commission&rsquo;s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system, commonly known as EDGAR. The Commission started to require electronic filings through EDGAR in April 1993. Brokers have been able to electronically file their annual audits through EDGAR since 2015.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-statement-electronic-filing-121624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">[1]</span></span></a></p>
<p>By streamlining the Commission&rsquo;s filing and processing under one system, the amendments will aid the Commission&rsquo;s oversight function more broadly, thereby ensuring that registrants are compliant with Congress&rsquo;s laws and our rules.</p>
<p>Finally, the amendments require filings and submissions be made in a structured, machine-readable data language where appropriate. Such requirements will benefit investors and markets by making the filings more transparent, accessible, and usable within the disclosures. They also help the Commission be more efficient in retrieving, aggregating, and comparing data across different filers and time periods &mdash; thus, saving the Commission time and resources.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s amendments build on more than 20 years of Commission actions to modernize filing and recordkeeping requirements. I'm pleased that the Commission has taken the next step towards updating our requirements for the digital age.</p>
<p>During this rulemaking, we received comment on proposed amendments related to certain aspects of the Commission&rsquo;s capital rules for broker-dealers that are dually registered as futures commission merchants with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Specifically, the Commission&rsquo;s capital rules include references to a CFTC segregated-funds requirement that commenters describe as &ldquo;outdated&rdquo; and &ldquo;irrelevant.&rdquo; While the Commission is not making these changes at this time, I&rsquo;ve asked staff to further consider this issue and make recommendations as to how the Commission&rsquo;s capital rules might be appropriately updated in the future.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the members of the SEC staff who worked on this matter, including:</p>

<title>Dissenting Statement On Electronic Submission Of Certain Materials Under The Securities Exchange Act Of 1934 And Amendments Regarding The FOCUS Report, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, SEC Commissioner Mark T. Uyeda, Dec. 16, 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The Commission is adopting rule amendments that require certain filings and submissions under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to be made electronically. The amendments will mandate that many of these filings and submissions be provided using structured, machine-readable data language.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-focus-report-121624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;While we generally support the transition from paper filings to electronic filings, we object to the manner in which the Commission is imposing structured data requirements. Accordingly, we are unable to support today&rsquo;s amendments.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Commission is mandating that certain disclosures be structured in Inline eXtensible Business Reporting Language (&ldquo;Inline XBRL&rdquo;) and other disclosures in eXtensible Markup Language (&ldquo;XML&rdquo;) that are specific to those documents (&ldquo;custom XMLs&rdquo;). The adopting release acknowledges that, though rare, &ldquo;[d]ata languages&hellip;can be subject to obsolescence.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-focus-report-121624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Yet the Commission proffers no instruction on performing a future review of the prescribed data languages to determine whether they remain appropriate. In an era where large language models and artificial intelligence are rapidly advancing, the possibility that the structured data format may become irrelevant is very real.</p>
<p>Good regulatory practices include designing &ldquo;new regulations in a way that will make later retrospective review easier and more effective.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-focus-report-121624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;In this regard, regulators should have a &ldquo;target time frame or frequency with which they plan to reassess the proposed regulation&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-focus-report-121624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;and technological advances could help identify strong candidates for retrospective review.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-focus-report-121624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Like any technology, specific structured data languages can become obsolete&mdash;similar to how the &ldquo;write once, read many&rdquo; technological storage format (i.e., CD-ROM) for broker-dealer books and records remained a rule requirement far beyond its useful life.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-focus-report-121624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;Absent a retrospective review requirement, there is no obligation for the Commission to re-consider the continued relevance of the specified technology. This is the exact type of outcome that the recommendation of the Administrative Conference is designed to prevent.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-focus-report-121624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>To reduce the need for a retrospective review requirement, the Commission could have adopted a less prescriptive approach to electronic filing. Such an approach would have required filings to be machine-readable without prescribing the use of particular structured data languages.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-focus-report-121624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;The Commission acknowledges that a principles-based approach &ldquo;could accommodate unknown future developments,&rdquo; but rejects the approach on the grounds that it &ldquo;would make it more difficult for Commission staff and market participants to compare disclosures across differing data languages.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-focus-report-121624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s apparent insatiable appetite to obtain and store more and more surveillance data in its systems grows with each rulemaking&mdash;with little consideration on issues such as cost and purpose. This same approach is reflected in the Consolidated Audit Trail (&ldquo;CAT&rdquo;), which the Commission boasts will &ldquo;allow regulators to efficiently and accurately track all activity throughout the U.S. markets in National Market System (NMS) securities.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-focus-report-121624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p>The CAT is a system that one would expect to find in a dystopian surveillance state, not the shining beacon for liberty and the free world. The CAT system is expensive and essentially funded by the public but operates outside the direct oversight or authorization of Congress. The Commission must reflect on the costs&mdash;both monetary and societal&mdash;of its quest to have an omnibus surveillance system that tracks every investment move of its citizens, including the cyber vulnerabilities of that very system.</p>
<p>An additional concern is the Commission&rsquo;s use of CAT data in economic analyses to justify certain rulemakings while at the same time failing to make public the underlying data. A key aspect of the notice and comment process allows interested persons to critique the Commission&rsquo;s work, including efforts to replicate its analytical results. Access to the original data goes to the heart of scientific integrity. It may be convenient for those wishing to wield power to restrict access to the data upon which decisions are based, but it renders truly informed comment impossible. It is not enough to respond with &ldquo;trust us&mdash;no need to verify.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it is unacceptable to allow broad access to an individual&rsquo;s trading information as captured by CAT. If the Commission cannot find a way to allow the public to examine its work without compromising an individual&rsquo;s private and proprietary information, then perhaps the Commission should stop using CAT data as support for its policy choices.</p>
<p>While we are unable to support today&rsquo;s amendments, we thank the staff in the Divisions of Trading and Markets and Economic and Risk Analysis, as well as the Office of the General Counsel, for their efforts. We particularly appreciate the staff&rsquo;s efforts to develop phased compliance dates for firms with lower minimum fixed dollar net capital requirements.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="PR-Body">The Securities and Exchange Commission today adopted amendments to require the electronic filing, submission, or posting of certain forms, filings, and other submissions that national securities exchanges, national securities associations, clearing agencies, broker-dealers, security-based swap dealers, and major security-based swap participants make with the Commission.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Today&rsquo;s amendments build on more than 20 years of Commission actions to modernize filing and recordkeeping requirements," said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. "I'm pleased that the Commission has taken the next step towards updating our requirements for the digital age."</p>
<p>Prior to today&rsquo;s amendments, registrants filed with, or otherwise submitted to, the Commission many Exchange Act forms, filings, or other materials in paper form. Under the amendments, registrants will make these filings and submissions electronically using the Commission&rsquo;s EDGAR system, in structured data format where appropriate, or by posting them online. The Commission is also adopting amendments regarding the Financial and Operational Combined Uniform Single (FOCUS) Report to harmonize with other rules and forms, make technical corrections, and provide clarifications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The adopting release&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/final/2024/33-11342.pdf">is published on SEC.gov</a>&nbsp;and will be published in the Federal Register. The effective date for these amendments is 60 days after the release is published in the Federal Register. The compliance dates for these amendments vary depending on the applicable form or rule but range from 60 days after the release is published in the Federal Register to on or after June 30, 2028.</p>

<title>SEC: Becton Dickinson To Pay $175 Million For Misleading Investors About Alaris Infusion Pump - New Jersey-Based Company Will Also Retain Independent Compliance Consultant</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-becton-dickinson-to-pay-175-million-for-misleading-investors-about-alaris/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-becton-dickinson-to-pay-175-million-for-misleading-investors-about-alaris/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against Becton, Dickinson and Company, a New Jersey-based medical device manufacturer known as BD, for repeatedly misleading investors about risks associated with its continued sales of its Alaris infusion pump and for overstating its income by failing to record the costs of fixing multiple software flaws with the pump. BD agreed to pay a $175 million civil penalty.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, BD determined in 2016 that software changes made to the Alaris pump required regulatory clearance from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, BD did not have the data required for clearance, and generating the data would delay the release of new features, so BD continued selling the pump without clearance. By January 2019, BD identified more than 25 flaws in the pump&rsquo;s software that its experts categorized as presenting risks of the greatest potential harm to patients. Rather than inform investors that these issues heightened the risk that the FDA would limit BD&rsquo;s ability to continue selling Alaris&mdash;a product whose sales contributed about 10 percent of BD&rsquo;s profits&mdash;BD made misleading statements in its periodic reports about its regulatory risks.</p>
<p>The order finds that BD revealed Alaris&rsquo;s software flaws to the FDA in October 2019 and proposed that the agency allow it to continue selling the pump while it worked to fix the flaws and complete the lengthy FDA clearance process. The FDA firmly rejected this proposal so BD immediately stopped shipping Alaris. But several days later, BD decided it would resume shipping the pump after fixing its software flaws &ndash; without FDA clearance. During an earnings call in early November 2019, BD misleadingly told investors that it was pausing Alaris sales to make &ldquo;some improvements&rdquo; to the pump as part of its strategy to &ldquo;continually iterate and make enhancements to the platform.&rdquo; BD also made financial forecasts for fiscal year 2020 without warning investors that those forecasts were based on conjecture that the FDA would allow BD to resume sales of Alaris without clearance.</p>
<p>The order finds that, in mid-November, BD changed its plan; it would resume shipping Alaris with a new version of the software that would exclude fixes that required FDA clearance. This meant BD would not fix several flaws the FDA had expressed significant concerns about, making it even less likely that the agency would allow BD to fully resume Alaris sales. Nevertheless, during subsequent investor conferences in November and December 2019, BD echoed its prior misleading statements.</p>
<p>The order finds that BD resumed shipping Alaris with the new software in December 2019 without any indication from the FDA that it concurred with this approach. After the FDA learned in January 2020 what BD had done, the agency warned that BD&rsquo;s decision to resume selling Alaris was &ldquo;misaligned with our previous conversations regarding your software issues and our mutual agreement that your firm should not be distributing devices to new customers.&rdquo; BD reinstated the ship hold and understood there would likely be a materially negative impact on the company&rsquo;s revenue in fiscal year 2020. Nevertheless, during its subsequent annual shareholders meeting in late January 2020, BD again reaffirmed its prior fiscal year 2020 revenue guidance. BD finally told investors in February 2020 that it had ceased shipping Alaris and would not resume normal sales until it had completed the lengthy FDA clearance process. Its share price subsequently declined 12 percent. Following the announcement, one analyst texted a senior member of BD&rsquo;s investor relations group, &ldquo;I do not understand what happened here. 10 days ago we heard everything in pumps was ok and back on market and better than expected . . . I&rsquo;m stunned and have a lot of angry people with pitchforks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;BD repeatedly painted a misleading picture of its Alaris infusion pump for investors and then doubled down by keeping them in the dark when the device&rsquo;s issues came to a head with the FDA in late 2019,&rdquo; said Sanjay Wadhwa, Acting Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;Public companies have a fundamental duty to accurately disclose material business risks and should expect to be held accountable when they fall short in that regard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that BD materially overstated its operating income in FY2019 by failing to properly account for the costs of remediating Alaris to fix the software flaws, resulting in the company overstating its operating income in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 by 82 percent.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that BD violated antifraud, reporting, internal accounting controls, books and records, and disclosure controls provisions of the federal securities laws. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, BD agreed to cease and desist from further violations of these provisions, to retain an independent compliance consultant to review and make recommendations concerning its disclosure controls and procedures, and to the civil penalty referenced above.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Benjamin Perlman, Kia Grant-Smith, Ryan Leonard, and Michael Peterson, and supervised by Rami Sibay.</p>

<title>CFTC Commissioner Kristin N. Johnson Announces Reports And Recommendations Advanced By MRAC In 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-commissioner-kristin-n-johnson-announces-reports-and-recommendations-advan/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Market Risk Advisory Committee held a public meeting Dec. 10 during which the MRAC adopted three sets of recommendations for the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission&rsquo;s consideration. The reports and accompanying recommendations, detailed below, address (i) U.S. Treasury markets with a focus on effective risk management practices for the cash-futures basis trade, (ii) modernization of regulation governing cyber resilience and critical third-party service providers for central counterparties, and (iii) the potential benefits and limitations of formally adopting obligations to employ legal entity identifiers for beneficial account holders of certain intermediaries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Commissioner Johnson, "the MRAC&rsquo;s success advancing three sets of recommendations adopted on Dec. 10 as well as the recommendations on derivatives clearing organization recovery and resilience and the report on concentration risk related to the declining number of futures merchant commissions adopted in April demonstrate the exceptional work of the members of the MRAC." The MRAC examines risks across our financial markets, including systemic issues that could threaten the stability of derivatives markets, and the risks associated with evolving market structures and the implementation of novel technologies across clearinghouses, exchanges, intermediaries, market makers and end-users.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>December 10, 2024, MRAC Meeting&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>On Dec. 10, the MRAC held its last meeting of the year. The meeting consisted of thoughtful commentary and discussion on the following topics: the current state of the Treasury markets from the Honorable Josh Frost, Assistant Secretary for Financial Markets, U.S. Department of the Treasury; the importance of cyber resilience for market participants, central counterparties and the broader market and economy from Sanjeev Bhasker, Deputy General Counsel, Office of the National Cyber Director, Steve Pugh, Chief Information Security Officer, Intercontinental Exchange, and Don Byron, Head of Global Industry Operations and Execution, Futures Industry Association; the intersection of potential harm to the financial services sector from cyber threats and artificial intelligence from Todd Conklin, Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer &amp; Deputy Assistant Secretary of Cyber, U.S. Department of the Treasury; and remarks addressing current topics in the area of climate-related market risk, including an update on FSOC initiatives from Sandra Lee, Deputy Assistant Secretary, Financial Stability Oversight Council, U.S. Department of the Treasury, the private carbon credit market and its use by corporations to offset CO2 emissions from Chris Odinet, Professor of Law &amp; Mosbacher Research Fellow, Texas A&amp;M University School of Law, and equity, sustainability, and the need to increase economic opportunity in rural areas and provide financial education and access to resources, knowledge, and networks needed to thrive in agriculture to underserved farmers from Kim Ratcliff, Chair, U.S. Department of Agriculture Advisory Committee on Minority Farmers; Board Member, Capital Farm Credit Advisory Committee; Treasurer and Board Member, Independent Cattlemen Association.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After discussions, the MRAC voted to advance three reports and recommendations to the Commission on the following critical issues:&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>
<p>The Treasury cash-futures basis trade and effective risk management practices.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol><ol start="2">
<li>
<p>DCO system safeguard standards for third party service providers, including recommendations to build upon and incorporate the language, concepts and principles already set out in the System Safeguards Rule found in Part 39.18 of the CFTC&rsquo;s regulations with respect to DCOs.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol><ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Benefits and limitations of adopting legal entity identifiers for beneficial account holders of certain market intermediaries.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Treasury Cash-Futures Basis Trade and Effective Risk Management Practices&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Over the course of the last two years, the Treasury Market Reform working group of the Market Structure Subcommittee examined the state of Treasury markets and further analyzed the Treasury cash-futures basis trade. The subcommittee examined benefits and risks associated with the basis trade and aimed to provide recommended effective risk management practices to address identified risks. The report and recommendations presented at the meeting and approved by the MRAC include the following recommended effective practices:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Market participants, including basis traders, futures markets participants, intermediaries, and others engaged in or providing intermediation for trades associated with the cash-futures basis &mdash; including the basis, long futures positions, and financing positions &mdash; should continuously assess and manage the risks associated with these trades including market, liquidity, counterparty credit, and other risks. These risks should be modeled, and a mark-to-market attribution analysis should be conducted.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Market participants should manage market risks that could affect the performance of their portfolios.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Market participants should evaluate and manage their liquidity risks, including the risk that margin costs increase rapidly and significantly, and that financing is reduced or becomes unavailable.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Market participants should appropriately monitor and manage counterparty credit risks associated with the basis trade or its intermediation, including through effective due diligence, onboarding, credit risk mitigants, and continuous monitoring process.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations on DCO System Safeguards Standards for Third Party Service Providers&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The Technology and Operations working group of the Central Counterparty Risk and Governance Subcommittee examined cyber resilience and third-party risks for derivatives clearing organizations. The subcommittees recommendations, which were approved by the MRAC, propose specific amendments to DCO Rule 18, 17 C.F.R. &sect; 39.18 (system safeguards), and incorporation of Annex F of the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructure: Assessment methodology for the oversight expectations applicable to critical service providers. As noted in the recommendations, the proposals seek to inform the Commission&rsquo;s mission of promoting the integrity, resilience, and vibrancy of the U.S. derivatives markets through sound regulation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations on Legal Entity Identifiers at the Beneficial Account Holder Level&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The Technology and Operations working group of the CCP Risk and Governance Subcommittee also examined the concept of the Legal Entity Identifier to align the domestic regulatory framework with global standards that mandate the use of LEIs, or equivalent identifiers, by beneficial account owners for daily reporting by DCOs. The MRAC approved an amended recommendation that invites the Commission to host a roundtable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The subcommittee recommendations, which were approved by the MRAC, propose a roundtable to examine CFTC Reg. &sect;39.19 (17 C.F.R. &sect; 39.19) and whether CFTC Reg. &sect;39.19 should be amended to align U.S. regulatory structure with global standards by mandating the use of LEIs, or equivalent identifiers, by the beneficial account owner (obtained and maintained by the beneficial account owner) for daily reporting by DCOs; as well as the impacts of the implementation of such a proposed rule and any affected rules.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>April 9, 2024, MRAC Meeting&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Earlier this year, at the April 9 MRAC meeting the MRAC members advanced two other reports submitted by the Market Structure Subcommittee and CCP Risk &amp; Governance Subcommittees to be submitted to the Commission:&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>
<p>Data and Analysis Regarding FCM Capacity Trends.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol><ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Recommendations on DCO Recovery and Orderly Wind-Down Plans; Information for Resolution Planning.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Data and Analysis Regarding FCM Capacity Trends&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>A few years prior to voting to approve this recommendation, the FCM Capacity Workstream of the Market Structure Subcommittee began examining the current state of the market for FCMs. The workstream aimed to examine the structural changes that have occurred within the FCM industry over the last 20 years. To facilitate its analysis, the workstream assembled a database from reports prepared by the Commission. These publicly available reports contain, among other data, select financial information taken from FCM regulatory filings. The data looks at trends relating to the number of FCMs, activity over the years, client margins, and FCM capital requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The data reflects information for a 20-year period running from 2003 through 2023. Among other observations, the workstream noted industry consolidation as well as structural changes, including an increased concentration of bank-affiliated FCMs. The workstream also noted increased concentration among FCMs that are dually registered as broker-dealers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations on DCO Recovery and Orderly Wind-Down Plans; Information for Resolution Planning&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The MRAC also voted to approve the recommendations on DCO Recovery and Orderly-Wind Down Plans; Information for Resolution Planning at the April 9 meeting. This report and recommendation included five sets of recommendations for the Commission&rsquo;s consideration, including the following:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Implement Supervisory Stress Tests.</strong>&nbsp;Commission staff should adopt and implement supervisory stress testing of credit and liquidity risks for all DCOs. Commission staff should adopt and implement supervisory stress testing of operational and other non-default risks for all DCOs, leveraging industry exercises covering these risks, where appropriate. Commission staff should include reverse stress tests in their supervisory stress tests. The results of the supervisory stress tests should be made available to the public, in a level of detail determined to be appropriate by Commission staff, within a reasonable time after the stress tests have been concluded. Subcommittee members representing end-users, FCMs and academia believe these stress tests should be required to take place at least annually. Subcommittee members representing DCOs do not believe the frequency of reverse stress tests should be annual but rather the frequency of reverse stress tests should be determined by Commission staff.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Require DCOs to Determine Recovery and Wind-Down Scenarios and Analyses</strong>. In the final rule, the text of CFTC Regulation 39.39(c)(2) should be amended to require that DCOs conduct scenario analysis that includes extreme but plausible scenarios that could trigger recovery or wind down. The final rule should retain the requirement that SIDCOs include in their plans an assessment of (1) the financial resources and tools available in the event of recovery and wind down, and (2) how they would address the scenarios identified that could trigger recovery and wind down.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Support Inclusion of NDLs in Recovery and Resolution Planning for All DCOs</strong>. The Commission should retain the proposal to require a DCO that is neither a SIDCO nor a Subpart C DCO to maintain and submit to the Commission viable plans for orderly wind down necessitated by default losses as well as NDLs. The Commission should retain the proposed definition of NDL as applicable to all DCOs.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Support the Provision of Data to the CFTC for Resolution Planning.</strong>&nbsp;Subcommittee members representing end-users, FCMs and academia believe the Commission and FDIC should develop an inter-agency task force to discuss the sharing of information for resolution planning purposes for DCOs. However, subcommittee members representing DCOs believe that coordination already occurs between the FDIC and the CFTC with respect to SIDCOs, an inter-agency task force is not necessary, and coordination can and will continue to occur through existing channels.</li>
<li><strong>Set up an Inter-agency Task Force to Address Challenges to Porting of Customer Positions and Collateral During Recovery and Wind Down</strong>. The Commission should develop an inter-agency task force, which should include the National Futures Association, to discuss and address impediments to the porting of customer positions and collateral in the context of a DCO resolution and clearing member default.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Conclusion&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Commissioner Johnson expressed thanks "to each and every member of MRAC and the subcommittees for their exceptional work this year in submitting important and thoughtful recommendations to the Commission. I want to thank the MRAC Chair, Alicia Crighton; Co-Chairs Alessandro Cocco and Elizabeth King of the CCP Risk and Governance Subcommittee; and Co-Chairs Ann Battle and Biswarup Chatterjee of the Market Structure Subcommittee for their leadership and efforts in providing these recommendations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I also want to thank members of my staff who supported the MRAC and the subcommittees at each of this year&rsquo;s meetings, including Tamika Bent, who served as MRAC Designated Federal Officer&nbsp; during her service at the Commission and Danielle Abada who currently serves as MRAC DFO; Peter Janowksi, MRAC Alternate DFO; Rebecca Lewis Tierney and Julia Welch who served as MRAC&nbsp; ADFOs of the CCP Risk and Governance and Market Structure Subcommittees during their service at the Commission; and Chris Lamb and Nita Somasundaram who currently serve as MRAC ADFOs of the Climate-Related Market Risk and Future of Finance Subcommittees, and the CCP Risk and Governance and Market Structure Subcommittees, respectively. I also would like to thank CFTC logistics and administrative staff and contractors who ensured that MRAC meetings ran smoothly and efficiently as well as each of the honored guests and subject matter experts who agreed to share their time with the MRAC."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commissioner Johnson noted, "it is an honor and a privilege to serve the Commission as the sponsor the MRAC and to facilitate engagement among the diverse stakeholders who serve as members of MRAC and the Commission as we build and reinforce our regulatory framework."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 11px;">Confusion persists around what constitutes an ESG fund. According to PRI, an UN-supported initiative which seeks to understand the investment implications of ESG issues, 56% of adopters believe there is a lack of clarity in ESG definitions. ETFGI&rsquo;s classification system attempts to provide greater precision, with ETFs/ETPs listed globally organised into categories, including core ESG products and theme-based groups, such as Clean/Alternative Energies and Gender Diversity.&nbsp;</span></p>

<title>US Office Of The Comptroller Of The Currency Reports On Key Risks In Federal Banking System</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today reported the key issues facing the federal banking system in its&nbsp;<em>Semiannual Risk Perspective for Fall 2024</em>.</p>
<p>The OCC reported that the strength of the federal banking system remains sound. The OCC expects banks to remain diligent and adhere to prudent risk management practices across all risk areas. Continuous assessments of and improvements to risk management practices support banks&rsquo; efforts to guard against complacency and to build and enhance resiliency against potential future economic and operational challenges.</p>
<p>The OCC highlighted credit, operational, compliance, and market risks, as the key risk themes in the report. Highlights from the report include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Commercial credit risk remains moderate and shows signs of stabilizing as risks are better identified, monitored, and controlled. Commercial credit risk drivers indicate the presence of pockets of risk specific to a lender&rsquo;s region and lending market. The commercial real estate (CRE) office sector remains stressed. Risks in multifamily CRE lending remain elevated, particularly in the luxury segment.</li>
<li>Overall retail credit risk is stable. Delinquency and loss rates on residential real estate-secured loans held by banks remain historically low but are increasing. Delinquencies in other retail asset classes, namely credit cards and auto loans, reflect an increasing trend. However, banks&rsquo; retail credit loan performance is consistent with many industry forecasts reflecting delinquency and seasonal loss patterns normalizing from atypical historically low levels.</li>
<li>Operational risk is elevated. Banks continue to respond to an evolving and increasingly complex operating environment. Evolving cyber threats by sophisticated malicious actors target the financial services industry and their key service providers. Recent significant disruptions across many sectors, including the financial sector, highlight the importance of sound third-party risk management and operational resilience.</li>
<li>From a compliance risk perspective, banks continue to operate in a dynamic banking environment as customers&rsquo; needs and preferences related to products, services, and delivery channels evolve. It remains important for banks to maintain appropriate risk-based compliance risk management frameworks capable of growing and transforming as their risk profiles change. Banks should perform timely investigations of fraud and unauthorized transaction disputes and resolve them in accordance with applicable laws. Data governance gaps as well as customer or transaction exclusions in Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering (BSA/AML) transaction monitoring may result in increased noncompliance with requirements to report potentially suspicious activity.</li>
<li>Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) related risks remain stable as the OCC continues to assess banks&rsquo; CRA performance under the 1995/2021 regulatory framework.</li>
<li>Regarding market risk, banks net interest margin (NIM) performance has varied across bank asset sizes. Bank funding costs trended higher throughout 2024 but at a slower pace compared with 2023. Funding cost trends have had mixed impacts on NIMs due to trends in earning asset yields. Deposit volumes, deposit mix, and wholesale funding usage have started to stabilize while banks build asset liquidity.</li>
</ul>
<p>The special topic focuses on the increasing trend in external fraud activity targeting consumers and the federal banking system. The frequency of both traditional and novel, more sophisticated fraud activities targeting customers and banks continues to increase. Banks should maintain sound fraud risk management practices through prudent controls and appropriate fraud monitoring capabilities to identify, investigate, mitigate, and report fraudulent activity.<span>&nbsp;</span>Banks can also support their customers by providing educational information about trending fraud activities and ways to protect themselves.</p>
<p>The report covers risks facing national banks, federal savings associations, and federal branches and agencies based on data as of June 30, 2024, unless otherwise indicated. The report presents information in four main areas: special topics, trends in key risks, operating environment, and bank performance. The report focuses on issues that pose threats to those financial institutions regulated by the OCC and is intended as a resource to the industry, examiners, and the public.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The federal bank regulatory agencies, as members of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), today released data on small business, small farm, and community development lending during 2023. The Community Reinvestment Act regulations require the agencies to annually disclose these data.</p>
<p>The FFIEC also prepared aggregate disclosure statements of small business and small farm lending for all of the metropolitan statistical areas and non-metropolitan counties in the United States and its territories. The statements are available&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ffiec.gov/cra/craproducts.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<title>ISDA Board Appoints New Chair As Eric Litvack Steps Down After 10 Years</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-board-appoints-new-chair-as-eric-litvack-steps-down-after-10-years/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ISDA has announced that its Board of Directors has elected Jeroen Krens as its new Chair. The move follows the decision of former Chair Eric Litvack to step down after 10 years in the role.</p>
<p>Jeroen Krens is Managing Director, COO, Markets &amp; Securities Services at HSBC Bank Plc. He has worked for HSBC for 10 years and has had two stints on the ISDA Board &ndash; from January 2012 to February 2014 while working at Royal Bank of Scotland and since November 2016 while at HSBC. The appointment is effective from January 1, 2025.</p>
<p>Mr. Litvack, who is Managing Director and Group Director of Public Affairs at Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale, joined the ISDA Board in November 2006 and took on the role of Chairman in January 2015, making him the longest-serving Chair in ISDA&rsquo;s 40-year history.</p>
<p>During his chairmanship, ISDA has taken a leading role in several critical regulatory and market reforms, including the transition from LIBOR and the development of robust contractual fallbacks based on risk-free rates, implementation of new margin rules for non-cleared derivatives and the creation of the ISDA Standard Initial Margin Model, and the shift to greater automation and digitization of derivatives markets. The structure and governance of the Board has also been transformed under his watch. The Board now has representation from a broader universe of derivatives users and greater gender diversity, with the proportion of women increasing from 11% to 38% over 10 years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very proud of what we have collectively achieved at ISDA over the past 10 years and how the Board has evolved to better reflect the market it serves. ISDA&rsquo;s strength is its ability to tap into the collective expertise of its 1,000-plus member firms and reach consensus solutions to common problems. Together as an industry, we have solved some of the biggest challenges ever to face our markets, including finalizing post-crisis regulatory reforms and the transition from LIBOR, and ISDA is well positioned to tackle the challenges ahead. Now is the right time to hand the torch to the next generation of leaders, and I&rsquo;m very confident that Jeroen will do a terrific job as he takes the helm during the next phase of the derivatives market&rsquo;s development,&rdquo; said Mr. Litvack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eric has chaired the Board during a period that included the post-crisis regulatory implementation process, the coronavirus pandemic and the transition from LIBOR. Throughout, he has been committed to serving the industry and ensuring derivatives markets function efficiently. I&rsquo;d like to thank him for his leadership, partnership and support,&rdquo; said Scott O&rsquo;Malia, ISDA&rsquo;s Chief Executive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would also like to welcome Jeroen as new Chair. I know that we share a vision of bringing greater automation and digitization to the derivatives markets to improve efficiency and reduce costs. I look forward to working with Jeroen and his HSBC colleagues to make this vision a reality and to expand derivatives markets across the globe,&rdquo; Mr. O&rsquo;Malia added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m honored to take on the role of Chair in what will be ISDA&rsquo;s 40<span>th</span>&nbsp;year. ISDA was established in 1985 to bring standardization and common legal documentation to derivatives markets, an objective that remains just as relevant today. I&rsquo;m looking forward to working with my colleagues on the Board, Scott and the ISDA team as we continue realize ISDA&rsquo;s mission of ensuring derivatives market are safe and efficient. I would also like to thank Eric for his leadership, friendship and many contributions to ISDA,&rdquo; said Mr. Krens.</p>

<title>ESMA Publishes Its Final Report On Bond Transparency And Reasonable Commercial Basis Under MiFIR Review</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, published today the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-12/ESMA74-2134169708-7775_MiFIR_Review_Final_Report_on_amendment_of_RTS_2_and_RTS_on_RCB.pdf">Final Report</a>&nbsp;covering mandates under the MiFIR Review on bond trade transparency and reasonable commercial basis (RCB).</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify">The report includes the amendments to regulatory technical standards (RTS) on the mandates for bonds, structured finance products (SFPs) and emission allowances (EUA). Regarding the bond deferral regime, ESMA has performed a new data analysis, focusing on metrics such as the average daily volumes, to improve the deferral regime initially proposed in the public consultation.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">The proposed pre- and post-trade transparency requirements for non-equity instruments are designed to ensure a high level of transparency whilst ensuring that liquidity providers are protected from undue risk. The RTS also ensures that the new deferral regime is in place ahead of the go live&nbsp;of the bond&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/inline-images/CTPs_-_expected_timeline_0.png">consolidated tape.</a></p>
<p class="text-align-justify">Regarding the new mandate on RCB, the report covers the obligation to make pre- and post-trade data available on an RCB. The fees of market data will need to be based on the cost of producing and disseminating the market data and a reasonable margin.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">The RTS is designed to ensure that market data is available to all market participants in an accessible, fair and non-discriminatory manner and this will be fundamental to guarantee a proper implementation of the&nbsp;MiFIR Review.&nbsp; More information on the changes due to MiFID II and MiFIR Review can be found in the ESMA&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/trading/mifid-ii-and-mifir-review">dedicated webpage</a>.</p>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Next steps</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify">The report has been submitted to the European Commission, that will now have three months to decide whether to endorse the proposed RTSs.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">ESMA also intends to publish another consultation paper addressing the transparency mandate for derivatives under Article 11a of MiFIR in early 2025.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Publishes Decisions Against Director And Financial Adviser For Pension Transfer Advice Failings</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-publishes-decisions-against-director-and-financia/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-publishes-decisions-against-director-and-financia/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="copy-block__call-out">
<p><span>Mr Richard Fenech and Ms Heather Dunne have each referred their Decision Notice to the Upper Tribunal. The findings outlined in the Decision Notices given to them reflect the FCA&rsquo;s belief as to what occurred and how it considers their conduct should be characterised. The proposed action outlined in their Decision Notices will have no effect pending the determination of the references by the Tribunal, whose decision will be made public on its website.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Tribunal will determine, in the case of the decision to impose a financial penalty, what (if any) the appropriate action is for the FCA to take, and remit the matter to the FCA with such directions as the Tribunal considers appropriate and, in relation to the decision to make prohibition orders or a decision to withdraw approval, whether to dismiss the reference or remit it to the FCA with a direction to reconsider and reach a decision in accordance with the findings of the Tribunal.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The FCA has decided to ban Mr Richard Fenech and Ms Heather Dunne from working in financial services and fine them &pound;270,646 and &pound;399,817 respectively. The FCA found that the pair operated a flawed advice model that put customers&rsquo; guaranteed pension benefits at significant risk, and that Ms Dunne failed to act with due skill, care and diligence when providing pension transfer advice.</p>
<p>Mr Fenech was the sole director of Financial Solutions Midhurst Limited (FSML) and responsible for overseeing Ms Dunne, who was FSML's appointed representative (trading as HDIFA).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms Dunne failed to take into account the destination of the customers&rsquo; investments when advising whether defined benefit pension transfers were suitable. This was due to the use of a flawed two-adviser advice model in which Ms Dunne provided the pension transfer advice while another firm provided investment advice on the proposed onward investment after the pension transfer had concluded. As a result, Ms Dunne did not know where her clients&rsquo; money was going when advising on the transfer, leaving customers exposed to the risk of unsuitable pension transfers.</p>
<p>Ms Dunne advised approximately 92% of her clients to transfer out of their DB pension schemes, resulting in over &pound;126m of funds being transferred, often against her clients' best interests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr Fenech was responsible for the oversight of HDIFA&rsquo;s business. However, despite being made aware by FSML&rsquo;s external compliance consultant of the risk arising from HDIFA&rsquo;s use of the two-adviser advice model, Mr Fenech did not stop HDIFA from operating it. He also failed to ensure that Ms Dunne&rsquo;s pension transfer advice complied with regulatory standards.</p>
<p>Mr Fenech and Ms Dunne also failed to act with integrity because of their involvement in the dishonest provision of a backdated appointed representative agreement to the FCA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therese Chambers, Joint Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight, said:</p>
<p>&rsquo;People must be able to trust the advice they receive about their pension. The actions of these individuals are wholly unacceptable, as they exposed customers to significant financial risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms Dunne provided advice which was fundamentally flawed, and Mr Fenech failed in his responsibilities to oversee her work. In doing so, both demonstrated a complete disregard for customers&rsquo; needs through retirement, and the suitability of pension transfers, and it is right we ban them from the industry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The FCA has decided to fine Mr Fenech and Ms Dunne and ban them from working in financial services. They have referred the FCA&rsquo;s decisions to the Tribunal.</p>
<p>Ms Dunne&rsquo;s fine was reduced to &pound;399,817 from &pound;494,917, having shown this amount would cause her serious financial hardship.</p>
<p>FSML and HDIFA are both now in liquidation. To date, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) has paid over &pound;770,490 in compensation to FSML clients, (with potential total losses estimated at nearly &pound;2m) because of losses suffered by those clients following advice they received.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Colleges On Anti-Money Laundering And Countering The Financing Of Terrorism Have Become More Effective But Further Progress Is Needed, The EBA Finds</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published its fourth Report on the functioning of anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) colleges. The Report finds that competent authorities continued to improve the functioning of AML/CFT colleges in 2023. Nevertheless, further progress is needed especially in two key areas, namely: adjusting the functioning of AML/CFT colleges to the money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risks to which the underlying firm is exposed, and discussing the need for a common approach or joint action.</span></p>
<p>This Report sets out findings and observations from EBA staff&rsquo;s monitoring of AML/CFT colleges in 2023, which suggest that, overall, competent authorities continued to improve the effectiveness of AML/CFT colleges. The EBA, nevertheless, identified two key areas in which the progress made by competent authorities was seen as insufficient, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implementing the risk-based approach to the organisation of colleges.</li>
</ul>
<p>The EBA found that the functioning of colleges (especially the frequency of meetings and form in which the information is exchanged) was not sufficiently adapted to the risks to which the firms were exposed and to their specificities. This meant that competent authorities could not allocate their resources in a sufficiently strategic manner.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensuring that discussions on the need for a common approach are meaningful and systematic.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the main purposes of AML/CFT colleges is to allow competent authorities to identify common ML/TF risks and AML/CFT issues, and to coordinate the actions they take to address those risks and issues. The EBA found that few colleges had meaningful discussions on these aspects. As a result, competent authorities were rarely able to identify whether there were risks and/or issues that should be addressed in a coordinated manner.</p>
<p>The Report includes targeted recommendations to help competent authorities improve in these two key areas.</p>
<p>In addition, through its thematic monitoring of colleges, the EBA identified a number of ML/TF risks to which firms of the banking, payment and e-money sectors with a technology-oriented business model could be particularly exposed. The Report encourages competent authorities to take these risks into consideration when supervising such firms.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<ul>
<li>Directive (EU) 2018/843 (AMLD) introduced an explicit requirement for competent authorities to cooperate with each other but did not provide a framework of how this cooperation should happen in practice.</li>
<li>The ESAs Guidelines (JC 2019 81) on cooperation and information exchange between competent authorities supervising credit and financial institutions published in December 2019 provide details on how competent authorities should give effect to the cooperation requirements set out in AMLD, by establishing a framework for AML/CFT colleges.</li>
<li>AML/CFT colleges are permanent structures that serve to enhance cooperation between different supervisors involved in the supervision of cross-border institutions. As of 31/12/2023, competent authorities reported 264 established colleges, 34 of which were set up in 2023.</li>

It sets out proposals for firms to introduce strong controls that prevent harm. We are also suggesting certain firms, like authorised crypto trading platforms, share information with each other to help stop suspected market abuse. This will reduce fraud and help promote good practices in the sector.</p>
<p>We encourage industry to share its expertise and help us shape the rules. We want industry to take the lead in developing new ways of disclosing important information to make sure people understand the risks before purchasing crypto.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Discussion Paper reflects insights gained from a series of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/blogs/developing-our-approach-crypto-regulation" title="Developing our approach to crypto regulation">FCA-led crypto roundtables</a>&nbsp;we held with the industry earlier in the year.

<p>We want to develop a crypto regime that is fair, balanced and proportionate for all. We need input from the Government, our international partners, industry and consumers to help us get the future rules right. You have until 14 March 2025 to give us your feedback.</p>
<p>We continue to remind people that while we continue to develop the UK&rsquo;s crypto regulation, crypto remains largely unregulated in the UK and high risk. If something goes wrong, it&rsquo;s unlikely you will be protected and you should be prepared to lose all your money. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Bitcoin, the world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency, topped its previous all-time high and soared to a new peak on Monday. Petr Kozyakov, Co-Founder and CEO at Mercuryo, a leading payment infrastructure platform in the digital token space, commenting on today&rsquo;s bitcoin price said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bitcoin has yet again breached a new all-time high of $106,000 as the King of Crypto continues its stratospheric rise. The prospect of a Santa rally may be having a self-fulfilling prophecy as institutional and retail traders alike pile into the biggest cryptocurrency. While institutional interest grabs the headlines, the retail market has more opportunities than ever before to press the &lsquo;buy bitcoin&rsquo; button. Myriad platforms are now available that provide a seamless and secure interface on which to transact with cryptocurrency. As familiarity with Web3 architecture grows, so does the process of moving effortlessly between digital tokens and fiat currency. The advancement of Web3 technologies is quietly mirroring bitcoin&rsquo;s rise as the space continues to evolve at a breakneck pace.&rdquo;</p>

<title>ESG Reporting Software Spend Set To Quadruple By 2029, With Market Predicted To Grow To $5.6 Billion - Regulatory Pressure And Stakeholder Demand Driving Resurgence In ESG Reporting Spend As Businesses Turn To Tech To Tackle Increasingly Complex And Urgent Requirements</title>

<ul>
<li>New research reveals: 
<ul>
<li>Global ESG reporting software market to grow from over $1.3 billion in 2023 to over $5.6 billion in 2029</li>
<li>Europe to see the fastest growth, with a CAGR of 29%, followed by North America (25%) and Asia (24%)</li>
<li>Manufacturing and wholesale &amp; retail trade industries to lead adoption, driven by supply chain complexity and regulatory pressures</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A new global report by&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.verdantix.com/contact-us" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Verdantix</a>, the independent research and advisory firm, reveals the ESG reporting software market is set to skyrocket, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 26% from 2023 to 2029. The market will expand from $1.3 billion to over $5.6 billion, fuelled by tightening regulations such as the EU&rsquo;s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and increasing investor and stakeholder demands for auditable sustainability data that minimizes ESG-related risks.</p>
<p>Europe will spearhead this growth, with the region expected to drive a CAGR of 29%. The phased implementation of the CSRD, along with complementary measures such as the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), will drive rapid adoption among over 50,000 EU firms and more than 1,000 non-EU organisations.</p>
<p>North America and Asia are also set for strong growth, with CAGRs of 25% and 24%, respectively, as US firms look to tackle changing international, federal and state-level ESG reporting commitments and in Asia, the adoption of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) standards gains traction.</p>
<p>Manufacturing and wholesale and retail trade are forecasted to see the highest growth rates among industries, with CAGRs of 28% and 29%, respectively. These sectors, which have highly complex supply chain networks, face increasing pressure to provide holistic and high-quality, auditable data. This is driven by regulatory requirements, and sector specific supply chain legislation such as the EU CSDDD, the US Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) and the Australian Modern Slavery Act.</p>
<p><b>Kim Knickle, Research Director of the ESG &amp; Sustainability practice at Verdantix, comments</b>: &ldquo;Global ESG reporting software spend is projected to surge, peaking between 2026 and 2028, before stabilising. Over 50,000 firms globally are facing imminent sustainability reporting deadlines such as the CSRD, with significant risks of non-compliance, driving demand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As businesses face ever-evolving complexities, robust, adaptable reporting technologies are critical to ensure transparency, build stakeholder trust and maintain a competitive edge. Beyond compliance, firms are using ESG reporting and data management tools to enhance decision-making, improve efficiency, and manage risks &ndash; which is driving the involvement of a more diverse set of stakeholders, like finance and compliance teams. As adoption accelerates, these systems will become integral to how businesses operate in an evolving sustainability landscape.&rdquo;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, ACER publishes its Monitoring Reports on electricity infrastructure, and security of electricity supply respectively.</p>
<p>ACER Director, Christian Zingelersen, presents the two ACER Monitoring Reports to EU Energy Ministers during today's lunchtime presentation at the Transport, Telecommunications and Energy (TTE)&nbsp;Council meeting.</p>
<p>ACER&rsquo;s first&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsAUwMCVQBTAkxfUldaHVYLUwMdCw8AUBoCBgIPUVJWAAMJUggdBAdTWFwCVlUdBw4CBR0GXwdWGldSBQ4ZBFMFBwMFAVlQXQBYRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">electricity infrastructure monitoring report</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assesses the cost impacts of investing in electricity transmission and distribution networks to keep pace with the energy transition.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Analyses how cross-border electricity network planning aligns with grid capacity needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>ACER&rsquo;s annual monitoring report on&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsFAVcEBFdVUUwIVw1VHVYBU1UdUAkIVBoCUlYFVgVQBQdUAQAdBAdTWFwCVlUdBw4CBR0GXwdWGldSBQ4ZBFMFBwMFAVlQXQBYRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">security of EU electricity supply</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Examines implementation&nbsp;by Member States and the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E)&nbsp;of the resource adequacy framework to safeguard Europe&rsquo;s security of electricity supply.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Provides new information on measures aimed at securing electricity supplies (i.e. national capacity mechanisms) and supporting non-fossil flexibility.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Assesses whether national capacity mechanisms align with the European goals of decarbonisation and affordability.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are ACER&rsquo;s key findings?</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The stakes are high for the clean energy transition.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Failing to address power grid capacity needs and the persistent support of fossil-fuel generators by capacity mechanisms risks delaying the energy transition. Europe has a unique opportunity. Speeding up grid development and increasing the capacity of existing grids play a big role in enabling&nbsp;decarbonisation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Containing system costs (one of the main drivers of electricity costs) is key for EU competitiveness:&nbsp;System costs refer to the expenses incurred beyond the cost of energy. These include grid-related costs, expenses associated with support schemes such as national capacity mechanisms, and other related expenditures which together add up significantly.&nbsp;ACER points to the need to contain the rise in costs: in 2023 the costs of capacity mechanisms increased by 40%. ACER&rsquo;s monitoring forecasts network cost increase of 20-40% by 2030, and possibly up to 100% by 2050; if so, possibly endangering the overall affordability of electricity bills.&nbsp; ACER points out that in many cases, increasing the capacity of existing electricity grids could be a less expensive alternative to new lines build-out.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Implementation of the infrastructure planning and resource adequacy frameworks has advanced, but much more is needed promptly. For example, there is still no joined up (electricity and gas) infrastructure planning by the European gas and electricity transmission system operator bodies.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are ACER&rsquo;s recommendations?</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Prioritise efficiency: 
<ul>
<li>Make better use of existing grids to increase grid capacity before building new ones. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Ensure that any national capacity mechanism is firstly needed, well-designed, open to cross-border participation, and coordinated with any support schemes for flexibility to control costs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Further implement and improve the security of supply and infrastructure planning frameworks.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Foster a more&nbsp;coordinated approach between Member States to lower security of supply costs and accelerate cost-efficient investments in regional infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Carefully monitor investments across all grid levels to track how grid developments align with the energy transition.</li>
</ul>

</ol>
<p>As disclosed at the Capital Markets Day held on November 19, 2024:</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li>Havas is aiming to achieve an Adjusted EBIT margin ranging between 14.0% and 15.0% by no later than the financial year ended December 31, 2028.

<li>Havas believes it can achieve the following as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024: 
<ul class="bwlistcircle">
<li>A change in net revenue on an organic basis ranging between a decrease of 1.0% and no change, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023;</li>
<li>Adjusted EBIT in excess of &euro;330 million, reflecting management of operating expenses (such as personnel and travel expenses);</li>

<title>FSB Reports Strong Growth In Non-Bank Financial Intermediation In 2023</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fsb-reports-strong-growth-in-non-bank-financial-intermediation-in-2023/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fsb-reports-strong-growth-in-non-bank-financial-intermediation-in-2023/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><span>Annual monitoring exercise shows the non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) sector&nbsp;<a>grew&nbsp;</a>at more than double the pace of the banking sector in 2023, led by investor inflows and higher asset valuations.</span></li>
<li><span>Most vulnerability metrics of NBFI entities involved in credit intermediation activities that may pose bank-like financial stability risks remained stable.</span></li>
<li><span>FSB report also includes data on non-bank fintech lending for the first time. The outstanding amounts reported by 10 jurisdictions totalled around $42 billion.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) today published its annual&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/12/global-monitoring-report-on-non-bank-financial-intermediation-2024/">Global Monitoring Report on Non-Bank Financial Intermediation</a>. The report describes broad trends in financial intermediation in 2023 across 29 jurisdictions that account for around 88% of global GDP, before narrowing its focus to the subset of NBFI activities that may be more likely to give rise to vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>The main findings from this year&rsquo;s monitoring exercise include:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>In 2023, the NBFI sector grew 8.5%, more than double the pace of banking sector growth (3.3%), raising the NBFI share of total global financial assets to almost 50%&nbsp;<a>(roughly $250 trillion).&nbsp;</a>This growth was largely attributed to higher asset valuations, which rebounded after a decrease in 2022. Investor inflows to NBFI entities also contributed to the increase.</li>
<li>All NBFI subsectors grew at rates of around two times their five-year average.&nbsp;<a>The assets of other financial intermediaries (OFIs) &ndash; a subset of the NBFI sector that includes money market funds, hedge funds, other investment funds, central counterparties, and structured finance vehicles (SFVs) &ndash; increased by almost 10% over the year, to just under $160 trillion. Insurance corporation and pension fund assets also grew strongly.</a></li>
<li>The narrow measure of the NBFI sector &ndash; which consists of entities that authorities have assessed as being involved in credit intermediation activities that may pose bank-like financial stability risks &ndash; increased by almost 10% to reach $70 trillion, the highest level ever recorded in this exercise.</li>
<li>Most vulnerability metrics of NBFI entities &ndash; measuring credit intermediation, maturity transformation, liquidity transformation, and leverage &ndash;&nbsp;remained stable. Metrics for liquidity transformation in fixed income and mixed funds, as well as for leverage in finance companies, broker-dealers and SFVs,&nbsp;<a>were relatively high.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The report also includes data on non-bank fintech lending for the first time, in response to a recommendation in the third phase of the G20&nbsp;<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Seminars/Conferences/g20-data-gaps-initiative" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Data Gaps Initiative</a>&nbsp;to close data gaps related to this activity. 10 jurisdictions reported total non-bank fintech lending of around $40 billion, or 1% of the total loan assets held by their OFIs.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h2>
<p>The FSB created a system-wide monitoring framework to track developments in NBFI in response to a G20 Leaders&rsquo; request at the Seoul Summit in 2010. The objective of the monitoring exercise is to identify the build-up of vulnerabilities in NBFI and initiate corrective actions where necessary.</p>
<p>Complementing this monitoring, the FSB has been coordinating the development of policies, together with its member standard-setting bodies and international organisations, to mitigate potential vulnerabilities associated with NBFI. Progress under the FSB work programme to enhance resilience in NBFI is detailed in the FSB&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/07/enhancing-the-resilience-of-non-bank-financial-intermediation-progress-report-4/">July 2024 report</a>.</p>
<p>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. The FSB also conducts outreach with approximately 70 other jurisdictions through its six Regional Consultative Groups.</p>
<p>The FSB is chaired by Klaas Knot, President of De Nederlandsche Bank. The FSB Secretariat is located in Basel, Switzerland and hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>

<title>Opening Remarks Entitled “SROs – Up For The Challenge In A Fast-Evolving World” By Professor Tan Cheng Han, Chairman Of SGX RegCo, At CFTC-MAS Self-Regulatory Organisation Day</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/opening-remarks-entitled-sros-up-for-the-challenge-in-a-fast-evolving-world/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/opening-remarks-entitled-sros-up-for-the-challenge-in-a-fast-evolving-world/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good morning to our friends at the Monetary Authority of Singapore, our distinguished guests from fellow SROs, exchanges and regulators visiting Singapore, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>Markets are complex, often fast-moving, organisms. SROs function within this state of affairs and it therefore behoves us every so often to reflect on what has been achieved, what more needs to be done (and there is always something that needs improvement) and what more we should be expecting.</p>
<p>When I reflect on the challenges SROs face, I see these as falling into 3 main buckets:</p>
<p>First, in what I call the trust bucket, the issues include how independent the SRO is, potential conflicts of interest and how they are managed, the demand for transparency and how it is addressed, and investor protection. These are perennial issues which means that SROs probably already have many of the levers in place to strike the balance that enables marketplaces to thrive. Still, these trust factors are fundamental to the continued relevance of SROs, which is why such matters will be raised throughout today&rsquo;s discussion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, is what I call the complexity issues. When Apple released its smartphone in 2007, it was a revolutionary device, being the first to target the mass market using a large touchscreen allowing finger input as the main means of interaction. Some 17 years later, the form factor for smartphones is still recognizable from the iPhone of 2007, but the software and hardware have become more complex as functionalities have increased exponentially. Markets are similar. SROs today operate in increasingly complex worlds. For one, products are getting ever more complex. Markets also involve many agents who do not necessarily operate on a level playing field with other actors. There is also greater interconnectivity between more and more markets such that changes in one market can affect others, making an understanding of such interconnectivity important. Politics and international affairs are yet additional elements that can disrupt the best laid plans.</p>
<p>Third are the swift changes that are sweeping across the financial industry. Technology is one of the most oft-quoted changes. Artificial intelligence, or AI, is of course top of mind at many companies: how to harness it and yet be mindful of limitations and risks, how to ensure our staff are ready for it, how to repurpose processes for or because of it, and how to prevent malfeasance perpetrated with the use of AI tools. Other aspects of&nbsp;technological change are also rapid, including the rise of fintech and digital assets, with the risks that come with them such as ransomware, malware and data loss, all of which demand that SROs stay ahead with their understanding of technology. This includes monitoring and regulating new financial products and services.&nbsp;And then, there are also unpredictable events that require quick responses such as COVID and the Great Financial Crisis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How have SROs fared amid these challenges and are they even relevant today?</p>
<p>I would argue that most SROs have been resilient enough to acquit themselves well despite events such as the Great Financial Crisis and COVID. There is no denying that both the GFC and the pandemic posed challenges and changed the world in significant ways beyond the markets in the case of the GFC, and beyond the medical situation in the case of COVID, to the wider economic and social environment. Yet SROs were able to carry out their duties and responsibilities, albeit perhaps with some difficulty initially, but we soldiered on and ultimately, delivered on what was expected of us. And this was only possible because of three characteristics that speak to the strength of SROs.</p>
<p>First is the closeness of SROs to the market. In many cases, SROs have members that are market participants. This enables the SRO to deeply understand market developments, benefit from a constant flow of feedback and engagement, and work together with its members. A good example of this is how during COVID, our members raised concerns about the impact of lockdowns on their operations and their ability to comply with requirements such as inspections. The solution was to transition to virtual inspections and we were able to do this without disrupting activities too much.</p>
<p>Second is that SROs also work closely with the ultimate regulator and lawmakers in their ordinary course of business. During COVID, in the Singapore and SGX Regulatory context, we collaborated with the MAS and the various ministries such as the Finance Ministry and Law Ministry to very quickly enable, for instance, temporary changes in legislation governing the conduct of shareholder meetings and the conveyance of documents to shareholders. Because our various teams were well-apprised of each other&rsquo;s operating framework, the process was very smooth despite the circumstances we were operating in.</p>
<p>Finally, our strong relationship with our members and our regulators enables us to achieve some degree of regulatory flexibility and a highly efficient time-to-market. In Singapore during &nbsp;COVID, this was demonstrated with the flexibility in member inspections (as I mentioned earlier) and extensions of deadlines for AGMs, both of which involved changes in processes, market-wide communication and specific direct engagement. And all these were achieved in quick order under very difficult circumstances. We also provided regular guidance to member participants and our listed issuers on how to handle disclosure of problems arising from COVID-related circumstances.</p>
<p><span>Conclusion</span></p>
<p>While many SROs have performed their role well, one fundamental matter we need to keep front and center is what I term the &lsquo;Goldilocks paradigm&rsquo;. Human beings constantly strive for balance. This is reflected in many religions and philosophies. For example, in Buddhism it is represented by aspects such as the Middle Way and the yin and yang symbol. In Christianity it is about being guided by God&rsquo;s message and not by one&rsquo;s personal passions alone. Similarly, SROs must strive to co-create systems and processes that are &ldquo;just right&rdquo;. Too much regulation risks stifling markets and too little risks bringing markets into disrepute. In other words, we don&rsquo;t want what we are doing to be too hot or too cold.</p>
<p>While often judgement will have to be exercised with imperfect knowledge, we hope that it will not take multiple attempts before we discover what is &ldquo;just right&rdquo; (as Goldilocks did before finding the solution in the last possibility left). I often ask myself if there is anything we can do to solve the Goldilocks problem. To some extent, I believe I have one important part of the answer. It is to be humble. Only by understanding that we have limitations can we have the attributes to maximize our effectiveness, such as being open to different perspectives, even criticism; the ability to engage in meaningful self-reflection; and a bit of positive paranoia. SROs aren&rsquo;t perfect; we will make mistakes. But genuine humility can minimize our mistakes and optimize our time to market when we have made mistakes. It is my hope that today&rsquo;s discussions and presentations will provide us with suggestions and opportunities that will among other things reveal our weaknesses and biases, the better with which to shape our future thinking towards higher standards and quality. On this note, thank you for having me this morning and I wish all of you a productive day ahead.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC has today published its&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/what-we-do/how-we-operate/asic-industry-funding/regulatory-costs-and-levies/#Annualdashboardreport" title="Regulatory costs and levies">annual dashboard outlining regulatory costs</a>&nbsp;by sector and subsector for 2023-24 under the ASIC industry funding model (IFM).</p>
<p>This is a requirement under s138 of the&nbsp;<em>Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act</em>&nbsp;<em>2001</em>.</p>
<p>These costs, calculated at the end of each financial year, reflect ASIC&rsquo;s actual costs of regulating the subsectors these organisations operate in.</p>
<p>ASIC has also published the variances between its estimated and actual costs for subsectors.</p>
<p>Estimated costs were published in our 2023-24&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/what-we-do/how-we-operate/asic-industry-funding/cost-recovery-implementation-statement/" title="Cost recovery implementation statement">Cost Recovery Implementation Statement</a>&nbsp;(CRIS) in July 2024.</p>

Around 40,000 invoices for these levies will be issued to entities between January and March 2025.</p>
<p>ASIC determines where it directs its regulatory efforts and resources based on our ongoing assessment of the threats and harms across the industries we regulate. As a result, levies can be difficult to predict and can vary over time.</p>

<title>SET Announces 228 Listed Companies On SET ESG Ratings 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/t-announces-228-listed-companies-on-set-esg-ratings-2024/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">KEY POINTS</span></b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>228 listed companies included in SET ESG Ratings 2024.</b><b>&nbsp;</b></li>
<li><b>Average ESG scores improved </b><b>in all aspects</b><b>, with </b><b>particular focus on </b><b>climate risk management, carbon-neutral and net-zero commitments.</b><b></b></li>
<li><b>SET ESG Ratings stands as one of the investment </b><b>policies</b><b> adopted by Thailand ESG Funds (TESG)</b><b> </b><b>and Vayupak Fund 1 (Class A) with combined AUM of around THB 160 billion.</b><b></b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>SET Senior Executive Vice President Soraphol Tulayasathien </b>announced that SET ESG Ratings 2024 reached a new record high with 228 listed companies clinching their spots on the list, echoing the surging wave of sustainable investments locally and globally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;SET ESG Ratings serves as an additional tool for investors, analysts and fund managers in evaluating risk profiles and growth opportunities of businesses alongside other information," Soraphol explained. " With ESG performance now crucial to business competitiveness and growth potential, funds in certain categories adopt SET ESG Ratings as one of their investment policies. Examples include the Thailand ESG Funds (TESG) and Vayupak Fund 1 (Class A), which manage THB 14.6 billion and THB 150 billion in assets, respectively. ESG-focused funds are expected to increase as sustainability gains traction among both investors and listed companies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>SET ESG Ratings 2024 recognized 228 listed companies, awarding AAA rating to 56 firms, AA to 80 firms, A to 71 firms, and BBB to 21 firms. These companies collectively represent 82 percent of total market capitalization of SET and Market for Alternative Investment (mai) as of December 12, 2024.<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Notably, a total of 106 medium-sized and small-sized listed companies, with market capitalization under THB 10 billion, passed SET ESG Ratings criteria in 2024. This showed remarkable progress as the number surged by 43 percent from the previous year, underlining their strong commitment to sustainability practices. The average scores of all companies listed on the SET ESG Ratings also improved across all ESG dimensions, particularly in customer-centric product and service offerings, climate risk management, GHG emissions disclosure, and concrete targets for carbon neutrality and net zero emission,&rdquo; said Soraphol.</p>
<p>SET ESG Ratings comprises listed companies that voluntarily participate in the assessment and score at least 50 percent in each ESG pillar. Other qualification criteria include a three-star or higher corporate governance report (CGR) rating by Thai Institute of Directors (IOD), and neither the company itself nor its directors or executives being alleged or convicted of ESG-related offenses by regulators or relevant authorities. Companies with CB, CC, CF, or CS sign designations are ineligible.</p>
<p>The assessment criteria are reviewed and updated annually to reflect the dynamic ESG landscape in both local and global contexts. SET also maintains stringent post-assessment monitoring, where rated companies failing to meet the criteria may face removal from the SET ESG Ratings list. Moreover, SET displays a remark to encourage users of SET ESG Ratings to review additional ESG information.</p>
<p>SET ESG Ratings 2024 is available at <a href="http://www.setsustainability.com/ESG-ratings">www.setsustainability.com/ESG-ratings</a>.</p>
<p>In a move to global standards, SET ESG Ratings will transition into the FTSE Russell ESG Scores, a globally-renowned sustainability assessment trusted by institutional investors worldwide, with public disclosure of assessment results starting 2026.</p>

<title>ASIC Sues HSBC Australia Alleging Failures To Adequately Protect Customers From Scams</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>HSBC Bank Australia Limited (HSBC Australia) failed to adequately protect customers scammed out of millions of dollars, according to documents filed by ASIC in the Federal Court today.</p>
<p>ASIC alleges HSBC Australia failed to have adequate controls in place to prevent and detect unauthorised payments and failed to comply with its obligations to investigate customer reports of unauthorised transactions within the specified timeframes required, and to promptly reinstate their banking services in a timely manner.</p>
<p>ASIC alleges that there was a significant escalation in reports of unauthorised transactions by HSBC Australia customers from mid-2023 which often occurred after scammers had obtained access to their accounts by impersonating HSBC Australia staff.</p>
<p>Between January 2020 and August 2024, HSBC received approximately 950 reports of unauthorised transactions, resulting in customer losses of about $23 million. Almost $16 million of this occurred in the six months from October 2023 to March 2024.</p>
<p>ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said, &lsquo;We allege HSBC Australia&rsquo;s failings were widespread and systemic, and the bank failed to protect its customers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We allege that from at least January 2023, HSBC Australia was aware of the risks of unauthorised transactions occurring and that there were gaps in their fraud controls. This resulted in some customers getting scammed out of $90,000 or more.</p>
<p>'We allege HSBC Australia compounded the problem by failing to comply with its obligations under the ePayments Code and let its customers down when they needed their help the most, on average taking 145 days to investigate customers&rsquo; reports that they had been scammed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are also concerned that HSBC Australia failed to promptly restore customers&rsquo; full access to their bank accounts, on average taking 95 days to do so. One customer did not have full access restored for 542 days.&rsquo;</p>
<p>ASIC alleges HSBC Australia failed to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>From January 2020, adequate systems and processes to ensure that significant, widespread or systemic non-compliance with its obligations to investigate reports of unauthorised transactions within specified timeframes and to promptly reinstate banking services to customers who reported unauthorised transactions; and</li>
<li>From 1 January 2023 to 1 June 2024, adequate controls for the prevention and detection of unauthorised payments.</li>
</ul>
<p>ASIC contends that as a result, HSBC Australia failed to do all things necessary to ensure that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the financial services covered by its Australian financial services licence were provided efficiently, honestly and fairly in contravention of its obligations under s 912A(1)(a) of the&nbsp;<em>Corporations Act 2001</em>&nbsp;(Cth); and</li>
<li>the credit activities authorised by its credit licence were engaged in efficiently, honestly and fairly in contravention of its obligations under s 47(1)(a) of the&nbsp;<em>National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009&nbsp;</em>(Cth).</li>
</ul>
<p>&lsquo;We know scammers are constantly looking for new ways to exploit people. Customers can lose their life savings in an instant. Scammers do not discriminate,&rsquo; Ms Court said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All banks need to pull their weight in the fight against scams. We will not hesitate to take court action where we consider banks fail to comply with their obligations to protect their customers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>ASIC is seeking declarations of contraventions, pecuniary penalties, adverse publicity orders, and costs.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The ePayments Code plays an important role in the regulation of electronic payment facilities in Australia. It applies to consumer electronic payment transactions, including ATM, EFTPOS and credit card transactions, online payments, internet and mobile banking, and BPAY. It complements other regulatory requirements, including financial services and consumer credit licensing, advice, training and disclosure obligations under the <em>Corporations Act 2001</em> and the <em>National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009</em>.</p>
<p>HSBC Australia has obligations as a subscriber to the ePayments Code to complete an investigation into a report of an unauthorised transaction (Report) and advise the customer in writing of the outcome. An unauthorised transaction is a transaction that is not authorised by a customer. Under the ePayments Code, HSBC Australia is required to:</p>
<ul>
<li>within 21 days of receiving a Report, either complete its investigation and advise the customer of the outcome or advise the customer more time is required to complete the investigation;</li>
<li>within 45 days of receiving a Report, complete its investigation, unless there are exceptional circumstances. Exceptional circumstances may include delays caused by other banks or foreign merchants involved with the transaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>On 2 February 2024,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.scamwatch.gov.au/about-us/news-and-alerts/scam-alert-hsbc-bank-impersonation">Scamwatch released a scam alert</a>&nbsp;on the HSBC Australia impersonation scam.</p>
<p>According to the ACCC, in 2023, Australians lost $2.74 billion to scams.</p>
<p>On 7 November 2024 legislation was introduced to Parliament to establish a new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r7275">Scams Prevention Framework</a>, imposing obligations on entities in designated sectors to prevent, detect, disrupt, report and respond to scams, and to establish effective governance systems.</p>
<p><a href="https://moneysmart.gov.au/online-safety/protect-yourself-from-scams">ASIC&rsquo;s Moneysmart</a>&nbsp;website has information for consumers on how to protect themselves from scams. If consumers think they have been scammed, they should visit scamwatch.gov.au where there are a range of resources to help limit the damage and protect themselves from further loss.</p>

<p>SIFMA today issued the following statement from Ellen Greene, managing director, equity and options market structure, on the SEC&rsquo;s approval of an amendment to the Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT) NMS Plan:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The amendment to the Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT) NMS plan which was approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is designed to save the industry approximately $20 million annually. Much of the cost savings are attributable to a modification of the requirements related to linking market maker quotes for equity options. In addition, it also makes changes to storage and retention requirements. SIFMA advocated for this action, and we will continue our advocacy opposing the CAT funding scheme. We also continue to advocate for the implementation of the long-pending data protection rule and wholesale review of the collection of personally identifiable information, or PII, which puts investors&rsquo; data at serious risk of a data breach without the data protection rule in place.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization Aims To Revise Guidance For Order Execution Only Dealers</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) is requesting comments from industry representatives, investor advocates and investors on how to update Guidance for Order Execution Only (OEO) dealers working with Do-It-Yourself (DIY) investors.</p>
<p>Order Execution Only dealers are firms that generally offer a broad range of investment products for DIY investors to buy and sell at their own discretion.</p>
<p>CIRO is looking to enhance investor protection for DIY investors by ensuring access to high-quality information from verified sources. Updates to the guidance for OEO dealers could allow the use of low-cost and scalable tools designed to help investors make the most of their investments by making better decisions for themselves based on non-tailored advice. CIRO seeks comments on the range of alerts, proactive notifications, educational information and self-help investing tools that would be useful for OEO dealers to provide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;DIY is its own landscape where investors often access their accounts online or on their mobile device, and make investment decisions on the move,&rdquo; said Alexandra Williams, Senior Vice-President of Member Regulation and Corporate Strategy. &ldquo;Being able to provide DIY investors with appropriate tools and information as well as a &lsquo;speedbump&rsquo; alert if they are about to purchase a high-risk security or remind them that their cash accounts could be doing more for them by being invested, is something that many dealers want to offer. We see it as a win-win because it ensures investors can access high-quality financial information when and where they need it and also have certain protections in place&rdquo;.</p>
<p>CIRO&rsquo;s inaugural Investor Survey found that four out of 10- DIY investors opened their first DIY account within the last three years, and that DIY investors are considerably more likely than other investors to use social media, internet forums or finfluencers as sources of investing information and advice&mdash;all unregulated platforms for advice and information where misinformation can circulate unchecked. Changing the Guidance will support and protect a greater number of investors through the delivery of regulated, non-tailored financial information via new tools such as self-assessment, filters and model portfolios, that will meet the evolving needs of Canadian investors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Protecting investors requires us as regulators to get ahead of and respond to changes in how Canadians invest,&rdquo; said Williams. &ldquo;Considering the popularity of DIY investing, updating the OEO guidance to clarify and enable certain forms of non-tailored advice will have a material impact on investors simply by improving the quality, kind and frequency of information available, so they can make better decisions for themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<title>ISDA - FRTB Implementation Challenges: Capitalization Of Funds</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-frtb-implementation-challenges-capitalization-of-funds/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-frtb-implementation-challenges-capitalization-of-funds/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On December 13, ISDA published a second whitepaper on the capitalization of equity investment in funds (EIIFs) under the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB) framework.</p>
<p>This paper builds upon an earlier ISDA publication in 2022 that highlighted the overly conservative capital requirements and operational complexities resulting from the proposed Basel III framework associated with EIIFs. Since then, several jurisdictions have implemented the FRTB (ie, Canada and Japan), while others have finalized their FRTB rules (ie, the EU and the UK) or are consulting on the final rules (ie, the US). This topic continues to be a globally important issue for the industry, with many unresolved concerns related to the treatment of EIIFs.</p>
<p>Moreover, the significance of these issues may not be fully recognized by supervisors and regulators. There is a clear disconnect between the theoretical expectations for EIIF capitalization and the practical realities observed, as evidenced by modifications to the submitted data from 19 banks as part of the European Banking Authority&rsquo;s Basel III monitoring report. This led to a capital reduction of 80% for EIIFs. A similar adjustment is reported in the Bank for International Settlements Basel III monitoring exercise, although the number of banks involved is not disclosed.</p>
<p>This paper sets out recommendations for capitalizing EIIFs under the revised market risk framework and urges regulators to take action given the importance of EIIFs for capital allocation, risk diversification, market liquidity and economic growth.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota issued an order of default judgment against&nbsp;<span>Richard &ldquo;Rick&rdquo; Miller</span>&nbsp;and his company,&nbsp;<span>Flip 2 Futures Trading Company LLC</span>, both based in Minnesota, and&nbsp;<span>Punch Drunk Marketing LLC</span>, a Wisconsin limited liability company, for their operation of a fraudulent futures trading scheme.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The order requires Miller and F2F to pay a $900,000 civil monetary penalty and, jointly and severally with PDM, $364,000 in restitution to victims of the scheme. The order also requires PDM to pay a $750,000 civil monetary penalty and imposes permanent trading and registration bans against Miller and F2F and a permanent injunction prohibiting Miller and F2F from further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations, as charged.&nbsp;</span><span>The order resolves the CFTC&rsquo;s enforcement action against Miller, F2F, and PDM.&nbsp; [See CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;</span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8663-23"><span>8663-23</span></a><span>.]</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Case Background</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>The order stems from a CFTC complaint filed Feb. 22, 2023, and finds&nbsp;</span><span>from approximately July 2019 through November 2020, PDM&nbsp;</span><span>solicited and accepted $400,000 from nine individuals to participate in a commodity pool for the purpose of trading futures contracts. PDM failed to provide pool participants with required disclosure documents and illegally collected their funds in accounts held in PDM&rsquo;s name before transferring the funds to F2F and Miller for trading.&nbsp;<span>PDM also&nbsp;</span>misappropriated pool participants&rsquo; investment funds by failing to transfer all funds provided to PDM by pool participants for the purpose of futures trading to F2F and Miller for trading as provided in PDM&rsquo;s agreements with pool participants and by failing to return to pool participants funds repaid by F2F.<span>&nbsp;The order also finds PDM acted as a commodity pool operator without being registered with the CFTC as required.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The order further finds&nbsp;<span>Miller&nbsp;</span>made material misrepresentations about his futures trading performance and having other assets under management, to persuade PDM to transfer funds to F2F for the purpose of trading futures contracts<span>. In fact, Miller did not trade as successfully as he claimed and did not have millions under management. Moreover, Miller and F2F misappropriated some of PDM&rsquo;s funds by failing to transfer all of PDM&rsquo;s funds to Miller&rsquo;s trading account and failing to transfer to PDM funds withdrawn from Miller&rsquo;s trading account.&nbsp;</span>Miller and F2F also illegally collected funds from the pooled investment vehicle in F2F&rsquo;s or Miller&rsquo;s bank and trading accounts, failed to provide a required disclosure document to PDM, and failed to maintain required records. The order finds that by soliciting funds from and engaging in discretionary trading on behalf of the pool established by PDM,&nbsp;<span>F2F acted as a commodity trading advisor and Miller acted as an associated person of a CTA without being registered with the CFTC as required.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this action are Dmitriy Vilenskiy, Julia Colarusso, Christine Ryall, and Paul G. Hayeck.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<title>EU Banks’ Liquidity Coverage Ratio Increased In June 2024, Underpinned By Growth In Banks’ Holdings Of Liquid Assets</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/eu-banks-liquidity-coverage-ratio-increased-in-june-2024-underpinned-by-growth/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/eu-banks-liquidity-coverage-ratio-increased-in-june-2024-underpinned-by-growth/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published a Report on liquidity measures, which monitors and evaluates the liquidity coverage requirements currently in place in the EU. Between June 2023 and June 2024, EU banks&rsquo; liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) increased by 3 percentage points to reach 167%. Within that period, we observed changes in the composition of banks&rsquo; funding deposits while banks&rsquo; holdings of liquid assets steadily increased. EU banks&rsquo; average LCR in USD and in GBP improved during the period under review, to exceed 100% as of June 2024.</span></p>
<p>EU banks&rsquo; LCR buffers remain comfortably above the minimum requirement. In the second half of 2023 the average LCR increased sharply due to a marked decline in the net outflows (the denominator of the LCR) and a simultaneous increase of High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLAs) (the nominator of the LCR). The observed decline in net outflows is mostly explained the shifting of retail deposits to categories that are exempted from the calculation of the outflows. This move reversed in the first half of 2024, when net outflows increased by more than HQLAs and the average LCR declined. The increase in net outflows is explained by a drop in deposits exempted from the calculation of outflows which was not fully offset by the increase in outflows from other categories.</p>
<p>The composition of EU banks&rsquo; liquidity buffer has changed in June 2024 compared to June 2023. The&nbsp;increase in Level 1 securities, mainly sovereign bonds, exceeded the decline in Level 1 cash and central bank reserves. As a result, HQLAs increased in the period from June 2023 to June 2024.</p>
<p>The reduction in Level 1 cash and central bank reserves occurred for all banks. However, banks in the euro area that repaid targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO) loans in the first half of 2024 reported sharper declines. These repayments resulted in a drop in the LCR by -4 percentage points for the affected banks on average, while banks with no such liabilities increased their LCR by 0.64 p.p. on average. At the end of June 2024, euro area banks reported EUR 197bn of remaining TLTRO balances.</p>
<p>As it has been the case in previous years, EU banks continue to hold lower liquidity buffers in foreign currencies. The LCR in US dollar improved during the period of review from June 2023 to June 2024. Over the same period, the LCR in GBP also improved for the total sample (but declined for the common sample of banks reporting positions in GBP at all reference dates). The ability of banks to access the market for currency swaps may become constrained during periods of stress. Therefore, banks and competent authorities need to pay attention to any shortfalls in foreign currency LCRs to avoid unforeseen liquidity mismatches during volatile market conditions.</p>
<p>Finally, the Report also includes an assessment of the impact of the LCR on the banks&rsquo; lending activities. It also assesses the effect of&nbsp;deposits exempted from the calculation of the outflows on banks&rsquo; LCR, the impact of TLTRO repayments made between June 2023 and June 2024 on the liquidity profile of euro area banks, and the impact of the ongoing reduction of central bank liquidity on central bank assets and exposures over time.</p>
<h4>Background</h4>
<ol>
<li>This Report has been drafted in accordance with Article 509(1) of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR).</li>
<li>Article 412(1) of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) foresees the possibility of monetising liquid assets during times of stress (resulting in an LCR below 100%), as maintaining the LCR at 100% under such circumstances could produce undue negative effects on the credit institution and other market participants.</li>
<li>The CRR does not foresee a minimum requirement for LCR in foreign currencies. However,&nbsp;article&nbsp;8(6) of the LCR&nbsp;Delegated Regulation requires banks to ensure that the currency denomination of their liquid assets is consistent with the distribution by currency of their net liquidity outflows. The same article also includes a discretion to competent authorities to require credit institutions to restrict currency mismatches by setting limits on the proportion of net liquidity outflows in a currency that can be met during a stress period and by holding liquid assets not denominated in that currency.</li>
<li>The results of the Report on liquidity measures are presented separately for G-SIIs, O-SIIs and &ldquo;other banks&rdquo; (non G-SIIs or O-SIIs). Some figures are presented by country.</li>

<title>Decision By The Disciplinary Committee Of Nasdaq Stockholm Regarding Oscar Properties Holding AB</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Disciplinary Committee of Nasdaq Stockholm (the &ldquo;Exchange&rdquo;) has dismissed a disciplinary case concerning Oscar Properties Holding AB ("the Company").<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>On October 21, 2024, the Exchange requested the Disciplinary Committee to review a disciplinary case against the Company. The Exchange claimed that the Company had violated the rules of Nasdaq Stockholm (the &ldquo;Rulebook&rdquo;) in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Company repeatedly failed in 2024 to fulfill its obligation to disclose inside information in accordance with the EU Market Abuse Regulation ("MAR"). The violations involved late disclosure of inside information that had both the potential to and actually did significantly impact the price of the Company's shares.</li>
<li>The Company has repeatedly failed in 2024 to fulfill its obligations under the Securities Market Act (2007:528), the Companies Act (2005:551), and the Rulebook. 
<ul>
<li>During the first half of 2024, the Company was significantly delayed in publishing all financial reports. The late publication of the annual report also resulted in the annual general meeting being held late.</li>
<li>The Company lacked a CEO for more than two months in 2024.</li>
<li>During the months without a CEO, the Company lacked an information policy that was current in relation to the Company's organization.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Company's repeated violations of the information disclosure requirements in the Rulebook, law, and MAR, show that the Company lacked the necessary routines, controls, and systems, including systems and routines for financial reporting, to meet the Rulebooks' requirements to provide the market with reliable, accurate, and timely information.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Exchange requested that the Disciplinary Committee decide to delist the Company's shares from Nasdaq Stockholm.</p>
<p>On October 31, 2024, the Company was declared bankrupt, and its shares were delisted by the Exchange on November 4, 2024. In light of this, the Exchange has chosen to withdraw its application from the Disciplinary Committee.</p>
<p>As the Exchange has withdrawn its application, the Disciplinary Committee has dismissed the case. The case will therefore not be reviewed by the Disciplinary Committee.</p>
<p>The Disciplinary Committee&rsquo;s decision is available at:</p>

<title>Competent Authorities Have Made Significant Progress In Their Approaches To Tackling Money Laundering And Terrorist Financing, The EBA Report Finds</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published the findings from its fourth and final round of reviews of competent authorities&rsquo; approaches to tackling money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risks in the banking sector. With this round, the EBA has now assessed all competent authorities that are responsible for the AML/CFT supervision in thirty EU/EEA member states.</span></p>
<p>The EBA&rsquo;s findings indicate that anti-money laundering and counter terrorism financing (AML/CFT)&nbsp;supervisors have taken important steps to implement a risk-based approach to AML/CFT and, since the first round of reviews in 2018, the EBA has seen significant developments in competent authorities&rsquo; approaches to supervision. The Report highlights good practices, for example in relation to cooperation and&nbsp;risk assessments,&nbsp;which reflect the positive changes in supervisory approaches.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the EBA continued to find weaknesses in competent authorities&rsquo; risk assessment methodologies and enforcement processes not being fully effective or deterrent. Additionally, the EBA found divergent approaches in the way prudential supervisors consider and address ML/TF risks. In the absence of AML/CFT colleges, cooperation was limited, and it was still lacking with tax authorities. The EBA, therefore, recommended actions tailored to each competent authority to support their approach.</p>
<p>Overall, while the EBA continued to identify issues and shortcoming in this last round of reviews, the progress made since the first round suggests that the effectiveness of AML/CFT supervision will facilitate the effective implementation of the new AML/CFT package. This is the result of the actions taken by competent authorities following the EBA&rsquo;s recommendations.</p>
<h4>Legal basis, background&nbsp;and next steps</h4>
<p>The EBA&rsquo;s implementation reviews have been conducted in accordance with Articles 1, 8(1), 9a and 29(1) and (2) of the EBA Regulation, which confers on the EBA a duty to ensure effective and consistent supervisory practices, to contribute to the consistent and effective application of Union law and to contribute to preventing the use of the EU&rsquo;s financial system for ML/TF purposes. To this effect, the EBA can carry out peer reviews and investigate potential breaches of Union law, and it can take other measures such as staff- led implementation reviews to assess NCAs&rsquo; responses to specific compliance challenges.</p>
<p>The EBA assessed all competent authorities that are responsible for the AML/CFT supervision in thirty EU/EEA MS.</p>
<p>The EBA will conduct a final review in 2025 of all the actions taken by competent authorities to take stock of the current state of AML/CFT supervision of banks and publish a final report as part of the EBA&rsquo;s handover to AMLA.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify">The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, has today published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/consultations/consultation-esef-rts-sustainability-reporting-and-amendments-eeap-rts">Consultation Paper</a>&nbsp;seeking stakeholders&rsquo; views on how the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF) can be applied to sustainability reporting. The proposals also aim to ease the burden associated with financial reporting.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify">It is a priority for ESMA that investors are able to effectively access relevant and comparable information, enabling them to enhance and accelerate their data-driven investment strategies. Digitalised sustainability and financial information from undertakings will be integrated in the future European Single Access Point (ESAP), ensuring the efficient access and use of this information by investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">The Consultation Paper includes proposals for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Defining the marking up rules for sustainability reporting; with a&nbsp;phased implementation&nbsp;for ESRS sustainability statements in three steps, each lasting two years, and a full implementation for Article 8 disclosures; and</li>
<li>Redefining the marking up approach for the Notes to the IFRS consolidated financial statements.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p class="text-align-justify">The Consultation Paper also proposes amendments to the Regulatory Technical Standards on the European Electronic Access Point.&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Next steps</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify">Interested stakeholders are invited to submit their feedback by 31 March 2025. These proposals are of particular relevance to listed and non-listed undertakings and parent undertakings of large groups, auditors, investors, data analysts and other users of financial information and other electronic reporting stakeholders at large impacted by the ESEF Regulation.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">ESMA will consider the feedback it received to this consultation in Q2 2025. ESMA expects to publish a final report in Q3 2025 and to submit the draft technical standards to the European Commission for endorsement.</p>

<ul class="bullet-listing">
<li>
<h5>Market capitalisation of approximately NOK 184 million</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>The 45<span>th</span>&nbsp;listing on Euronext in 2024 and the 11<span>th</span>&nbsp;listing on Euronext Oslo B&oslash;rs&rsquo; markets</h5>

In total 31 alumni have listed their company on Euronext markets, and Oncoinvent is the first Norwegian alumnus.</p>
<p>&Oslash;ystein Soug, CEO of Oncoinvent, said: &ldquo;<em>Oncoinvent is thrilled to join Euronext Growth Oslo, a milestone that underscores our commitment to advancing innovative cancer therapies. This listing will enhance our visibility, attract new investors, and provide the financial flexibility and stability needed to accelerate our clinical development program to data in 2025 and 2026.

<title>Brokers “Pay To Play” Dynamic Drives Market Share In Investment Research: Substantive Research</title>

<ul>
<li> <span><strong><em><span>Brokers are hiring talent to compete more effectively&nbsp;</span></em></strong></span> </li>

<li> <span><strong><em><span>&lsquo;Juniorisation&rsquo; trends reversing - 1,400 years of net experience returned to top 30 brokers in 2024 YTD</span></em></strong></span> </li>
</ul>
<p><span><span>Substantive Research, the research and market data discovery and spend analytics provider for the buy side, today publishes the findings of its latest survey into investment research pricing and consumption, highlighting how research spending has evolved during 2024.<br /><br /></span></span><span>To compete more effectively, brokers are hiring talent, a clear indication that human judgment is preferred over AI. This means that the juniorisation trend of recent years is now reversing, with 1,400 years of experience returning to the top 30 brokers.&nbsp;<br /><br /></span><span><span>In terms of research payment rankings, JP Morgan maintains their top spot, with Jeffries rising to second place. This represents a large advancement in market share for Jefferies, as the research market concentrates significantly at the very top. In Substantive Research&rsquo;s&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fsubstantiveresearch.com%2Finsights-and-press%2Finvestment-research-pricing-study-shows-which-providers-are-gaining-market-share%2F/1/01020193bf071c5b-64e3e2e4-8c2b-4956-8a57-6721dcee133b-000000/L8X3M521dCXFefP2JeT8Fwhzo-g=404" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>2023 study</span></a><span>&nbsp;into the investment research market, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley held the top two positions in market share, with Jefferies in third place overall. At that time, market share gains were a direct result of investing in hiring and retaining skilled research analysts, against a backdrop of post-MiFID II price deflation and a move towards juniorisation of research.<br /><br /></span></span><span><strong><span>2024 Study Findings<br /></span></strong></span><span>Overall, hiring talent remains a key priority for the research market and investment in new talent is considered a key way to increase market share in a market driven by consumption of analyst and corporate access meetings.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li> <span>The pace of hiring analyst talent has increased, indicating that the market still puts a high value on human insight vs AI. Moreover, our research found that those firms prepared to invest in the right people, reap the most rewards in terms of market share.</span> </li>
<li> <span>Jefferies rises to second place in terms of research payments and is top in terms of net headcount increases this year. It was still able to make these market share gains, despite being only seventh in terms of driving client meetings with its sector analysts &ndash; this is a significant result in a market where the number of analyst meetings traditionally drives much of the remuneration/value calculations.</span> </li>
<li> <span>JP Morgan continues to top the list in terms of market share as well as analyst interactions, but when it comes to headcount, it has only grown its team modestly when compared with the peer group. Despite JP Morgan&rsquo;s much-publicised low rates for access to written research post-MiFID II, the firm dominates the market for analyst and corporate direct access, areas where the vast majority of each budget is allocated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> </li>
<li> <span><span>The juniorisation trend in research analyst headcount is reversing, with 1,400 years of net experience returning to the top 30 brokers from niche providers, the corporate sector and the buy side. The market has cleared since the&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fsubstantiveresearch.com%2Finsights-and-press%2Fsubstantive-research-latest-analyst-mapping-finds-that-the-research-brain-drain-has-stabilised%2F/2/01020193bf071c5b-64e3e2e4-8c2b-4956-8a57-6721dcee133b-000000/du6idX7WTsnNSMkAfydyixDpLik=404" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>'brain drain'</span></a><span>&nbsp;- a loss of 7,500 years of net experience between 2018 and 2021 - only a handful of firms juniorised their teams in 2024. Brokers are looking for targeted, experienced hires in a market which has &lsquo;turned the corner&rsquo;, but has stabilised at a much lower base post-MiFID II.&nbsp;</span></span> </li>
<li> <span>Mid-tier brokers are also beginning to hire and &ldquo;seniorise&rdquo; certain teams where they feel they have comparative advantage or where they see new opportunity.&nbsp;</span> </li>
</ul>
<p><span>Since Substantive Research&rsquo;s 2023 study,&nbsp; the investment research industry has witnessed significant changes.&nbsp; A particular area of development was that payment optionality is now available to all asset managers in the UK, updating the MiFID II rules mandating that research costs had to be &lsquo;unbundled&rsquo; from execution costs.&nbsp; The new payment optionality means that, in theory, asset managers will once again be able to pass research costs back on to the end investors. However, the majority of the market remains hesitant, waiting to see how any changes are received by asset owners, and subsequently, which method is employed by the largest firms.<br /><br /></span><span><strong><span>Mike Carrodus, CEO of Substantive Research, said:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>&ldquo;What remains to be seen is how much of this renewed hiring is a natural stabilisation from previous years, and how much is due to optimism around the recent efforts by the UK and the EU regulators to help reflate research supply and coverage. Both sets of regulators are making it easier for asset managers to return to charging their end investor clients for these multi-million-dollar research budgets, however the buy side is currently in &ldquo;wait and see&rdquo; mode as it assesses the potential risks of making this move.&rdquo;<br /><br /></span></span><span><strong><span>He added:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;The risk in the short term is that the regulatory softening seen in the FCA&rsquo;s Payment Optionality and the EU Listing Act doesn&rsquo;t translate to the increased pricing and higher research budgets that 2024 hiring trends could be relying on. While a move from asset managers in Europe to charging their end investors once again won&rsquo;t guarantee a rise in research pricing, many brokers hope that the buy side does make the transition in 2025, and budgets become more flexible once again. Brokers at the top of research provider lists with the accompanying market share and resources can be patient while this all plays out &ndash; those further down who are investing will no doubt have a sharp focus on which way the buy side decides to go in 2025.&rdquo;<br /><br /></span></span><span><strong><span>Universe of firms covered by the research:</span></strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li> <span>45 of the largest asset managers surveyed</span> </li>
<li> <span>AUM : &gt; $16 Trillion&nbsp;</span> </li>
<li> <span>Geographic split: 33% N. America, 18% EU, 49% UK</span> </li>

<title>Hong Kong Securities And Futures Commission Steps Up Anti-Scam Publicity With “Don’t Be Sucker” Campaign</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/hong-kong-securities-and-futures-commission-steps-up-anti-scam-publicity-with-d/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/hong-kong-securities-and-futures-commission-steps-up-anti-scam-publicity-with-d/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="newsc">
<p>The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) today launched a new anti-scam campaign titled &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be Sucker&rdquo; to raise public awareness of the common tactics used in fraudulent schemes, as part of its ongoing efforts to caution investors against investment scams especially in the digital realm.</p>
<p>Central to this initiative is the debut of an original cartoon character named Shui Yu (水魚), which pervades the SFC&rsquo;s new anti-scam advertisements and other publicity materials. Shui Yu symbolises an impulsive, simple-minded and gullible personality that is commonly an easy target of investment scams (Note 1).</p>
<p>To keep up with the evolving trends of scams and more effectively help investors sidestep pitfalls, the SFC has remodelled its publicity efforts by focusing on three common scam scenarios, namely online romance&nbsp;scams, impersonation, and deceptive tips from financial influencers.</p>
<p>In recent years, investors are increasingly exposed to scams of emerging forms, given the rise of online investment as well as prevalence of instant messaging and social media apps. In the first nine months of 2024, over 3,400 cases of online investment scams were reported to the Police, involving a total loss of $2.2 billion. The SFC also handled more than 360 complaints related to fraud and scams during the same period.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like enforcement, education is another essential prong of our efforts to maintain financial market integrity and protect investors against fraudsters,&rdquo; said Ms Julia Leung, the SFC&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer. &ldquo;While bad actors continue to leverage new methods and technology for their own gains, it is critically important that we also move with the times in our education efforts, to empower investors to serve as the first line of defence themselves against potential harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our new, innovative approach centring on Shui Yu will find an audience among investors of all age groups, especially the younger generation, thus driving home our key message to stay cool-headed towards too-good-to-be-true investment offers,&rdquo; Ms Leung added.</p>
<p>Apart from the Shui Yu character, the campaign presents a catchy rap song and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzuXs8PRnGA" target="_blank">music video</a>&nbsp;which reinforce the SFC&rsquo;s fraud prevention messages and instil a vigilant mindset in a more engaging manner. The song and music video are available on Shui Yu&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@shuiyufocusgroup" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>&nbsp;and more anti-scam tips will be shared on Shui Yu&rsquo;s dedicated&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/shuiyufocusgroup/" target="_blank">Instagram account</a>.</p>
<p>To further engage with the public, the SFC will set up a booth themed &ldquo;Rescuing Shui Yu&rdquo; providing fun and educational games for all age groups at the Anti-Scam Carnival hosted by the Hong Kong Police Force. The carnival will be held at the Art Park of the West Kowloon Cultural District on 14-15 December 2024.</p>
<p>End</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<ol>
<li>Shui Yu has unfocused eyes that drift towards quick gains. It is often misled by superficial information and overlooks potential risks, with a craving for investment tips without deep understanding and a tendency to invest without considering its own risk appetite.</li>
</ol></div>

<title>NZX Welcomes Capital Markets Reforms</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/nzx-welcomes-capital-markets-reforms/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/nzx-welcomes-capital-markets-reforms/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The package of reforms announced today by Commerce Minister Andrew Bayly will unlock access to capital, and boost New Zealand market liquidity and economic growth, NZX Chief Executive Mark Peterson says. </span></p>
<p><span> &ldquo;NZX&rsquo;s welcomes the reforms. New Zealand needs to remove regulatory roadblocks that are hindering investment and access to capital for New Zealand companies and projects,&rdquo; Mr Peterson says. </span></p>
<p><span> &ldquo;Minister Bayly&rsquo;s announcements on streamlining or removing regulations that add cost to companies looking to list, and the intention to consult on changes to climate-related disclosures and KiwiSaver settings, are a positive step in supporting investment and economic growth in New Zealand.</span></p>
<p><span> &ldquo;The package of changes, which include making the requirement to provide prospective financial information for initial public offers optional, signalling consultations on climate-related disclosure settings, and general disclosure requirements &ndash; alongside the Law Commission review into director liability settings &ndash; will materially improve the viability for companies wanting to meet their growth aspirations via the listed market.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span> &ldquo;New Zealand needs the public markets now more than ever. With investment required into schools, hospitals, houses, roads and other infrastructure, what better way to accelerate this than by using public markets and KiwiSaver to assist in funding this growth and development. For a healthy, well-functioning, productive economy that is internationally competitive, New Zealand needs vibrant, liquid capital markets, and the changes signalled by the Minister will help achieve that.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11px;">The Government&rsquo;s announcements align with initiatives recommended in the Growing New Zealand&rsquo;s Capital Markets 2029 report released in 2019. That review had 42 recommendations from 210 New Zealand industry participants covering KiwiSaver, regulation, public sector assets and infrastructure, promotion of public markets, tax, new products, and technology. All were designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of New Zealand&rsquo;s capital markets.</span></p>
<p><span> &ldquo;Industry has implemented the recommendations assigned to it. NZX has implemented NZX Dark &ndash; a mid-point order book &ndash; reformed and simplified Listing Rules, including initiatives to facilitate listings of cooperatives, and is planning to launch an index futures product in 2025. All these industry initiatives will assist with Government reforms in improving the liquidity and depth of our capital markets. We look forward to working with the Government and its agencies in delivering further initiatives to help unlock growth and opportunities for New Zealanders.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span> Mr Peterson says adjustments are urgently needed to improve New Zealand&rsquo;s climate-related disclosures. </span></p>
<p><span> &ldquo;NZX supports climate reporting but there needs to be balance in how this is applied. At present New Zealand&rsquo;s climate-related disclosures, standards and settings do not align with other international markets. NZX is of the view New Zealand&rsquo;s mandatory CRD reporting requirements need to align to global standards &ndash; particularly with that of Australia and its approach to implementation. If New Zealand is serious about transition, disclosures would also apply equally to both listed and unlisted companies. Level playing fields are important for these matters of greater good,&rdquo; Mr Peterson says. </span></p>
<p><span> &ldquo;We must ensure our regulations are fit for purpose and right sized for a country of our size. With directors of climate-reporting entities personally liable for a company&rsquo;s emissions reporting, this has imposed significant cost to companies in assurance and legal fees. That is money that would be better spent on climate mitigation and adaptation. </span></p>
<p><span> &ldquo;Likewise NZX welcomes consultation on KiwiSaver settings. KiwiSaver funds could invest in range of New Zealand assets, including hospitals, schools, roading, housing and water infrastructure &ndash; if the products were structured right. Those assets would be built, Kiwis would still receive a steady flow of returns into their KiwiSaver accounts, and our country and people would benefit not only from the assets being delivered, but through jobs and growth. Everyone wins from New Zealanders investing in New Zealand. </span></p>
<p><span> &ldquo;Andrew Bayly and the Government should be congratulated for taking positive steps in helping New Zealand companies, families, and our economy get ahead. NZX and our stakeholders look forward to working with the government in implementing these reforms &ndash; and others &ndash; in the years ahead.&rdquo; </span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC is urging directors, preparers of financial reports and auditors to be aware of the enduring and ongoing focus areas in its proactive surveillance of financial reports for the year ending 31 December 2024.</p>
<p>ASIC Commissioner Kate O&rsquo;Rourke said, &lsquo;We have highlighted matters that require the most judgement and use of estimates as these areas have previously shown the highest rates of non-compliance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Areas of focus for the upcoming reporting season include:</p>
<ul>
<li>impairment and asset values</li>
<li>provisions</li>
<li>events after year end and before completing the financial report, and</li>
<li>disclosures in the financial report and Operating and Financial Review (OFR).</li>
</ul>
<p>&lsquo;While these areas are emphasised, ASIC expects all reporting entities to ensure the reports are complete, accurate and informative,&rsquo; Ms O&rsquo;Rourke said.</p>
<p>Commissioner O&rsquo;Rourke said ASIC would also target non-compliance with financial reporting obligations more broadly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;ASIC is aware that some formerly grandfathered large proprietary companies may not be lodging financial reports, despite being required to do so since years ending 31 December 2022 or 30 June 2023. We will be contacting a number of these entities and, in certain circumstances, may take action against companies for failing to comply with their reporting obligations.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This will also be the first financial year for December year-end reporters to prepare and lodge a consolidated entity disclosure statement. ASIC will be monitoring for compliance with this requirement. We will also review the financial reports of registrable superannuation entities with December year ends.</p>
<p>For some entities, new sustainability and climate reporting requirements will commence for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2025.</p>
<p>While the first cohort of reporters will be the very largest entities that report under Chapter 2M of the Corporations Act 2001<em>,&nbsp;</em>all entities subject to the sustainability reporting requirements should understand how the new requirements apply to them.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s surveillance project focusing on auditors&rsquo; compliance with independence and conflicts of interest obligations will continue in early 2025. We encourage auditors to self-identify and self-report non-compliance with these obligations.</p>
<p>Further detail is available on&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-reporting-and-audit/financial-reporting-and-audit-focus-areas/" title="Financial reporting and audit focus areas">ASIC&rsquo;s financial reporting and audit focus areas page</a>.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s surveillance program reviews the financial reports of a sample of publicly listed companies and other economically significant public interest entities such as large proprietary companies.</p>
<p>In October 2024, ASIC released Report 799&nbsp;<em>ASIC&rsquo;s oversight of financial reporting and audit 2023&ndash;24</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-799-asic-s-oversight-of-financial-reporting-and-audit-2023-24/">REP 799</a>) which summarises findings from our financial reporting and audit surveillances and other complementary work for the period 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024. It highlights areas where the quality of financial reporting and audits can be improved.</p>

<title>Statement On CAT Cost Savings, SEC Chair Gary Gensler</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-on-cat-cost-savings-sec-chair-gary-gensler/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-on-cat-cost-savings-sec-chair-gary-gensler/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, the Commission approved amendments to the 2016 National Market System Plan that established the Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT). I am pleased to support this amendment estimated to save $21 million annually while maintaining the core functionality of CAT.</p>
<p>This amendment modifies requirements related to linking market maker quotes for equity options. In addition, it also makes changes to storage and retention requirements.</p>
<p>Beyond these cost savings measures, a number of commenters made additional suggestions. While we are not addressing these further suggestions in this order, I do support exploration of these and potentially other cost savings measures.</p>
<p>The Commission and self-regulatory organizations depend on the CAT to carry out our respective surveillance and enforcement responsibilities. It is a key tool for maintaining fair and orderly markets and holding wrongdoers to account, including for front running, market manipulation, and insider trading.</p>
<p>No tool, though, should be static. Technology and business models are constantly evolving. Thus, it is important to regularly evaluate the requirements of the CAT with an eye towards ensuring the system is cost effective while still preserving core regulatory functionality.</p>

<title>US Department Of Justice: Early Bitcoin Investor Sentenced For Filing Tax Returns That Falsely Reported His Cryptocurrency Gains</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-department-of-justice-early-bitcoin-investor-sentenced-for-filing-tax-return/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>An Austin, Texas, man was sentenced today to two years in prison for filing a tax return that falsely underreported the capital gains he earned from selling $3.7 million in bitcoins.</p>
<p>According to court documents and statements made in court, between 2017 and 2019, Frank Richard Ahlgren III, filed false tax returns that underreported or did not report the sale of $4 million worth of bitcoins in which he had substantial gains. All taxpayers are required to report any sale proceeds and gains or losses from the sale of cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin, on a tax return.</p>
<p>Ahlgren was an early investor in bitcoins and purchased bitcoins as early as 2011. In 2015, Ahlgren bought approximately 1,366 bitcoins using his accounts with Coinbase. The highest price bitcoins sold for that year was approximately $495.56. In October 2017, Ahlgren sold approximately 640 bitcoins trading at approximately $5,807.53 per bitcoin for a total of $3.7 million, and used the proceeds to purchase a house in Park City, Utah. Most of the bitcoins used to purchase the house came from bitcoins Ahlgren bought in 2015 using his Coinbase account. When it came time to prepare his 2017 federal income tax return, Ahlgren lied to his accountant by submitting a false summary of his gains and losses from the sale of his bitcoins. To conceal the full extent of his gain, Ahlgren claimed that he bought the bitcoins at prices much higher than he actually did &mdash; indeed, his claimed purchase prices were greater than the highest price bitcoins sold for in the market prior to the purchase of the Utah house. Ahlgren then filed a false 2017 federal income tax return that substantially inflated the cost basis of the bitcoins, thereby underreporting&nbsp; his true capital gain from his sale of bitcoins.</p>
<p>In 2018 and 2019, Ahlgren sold bitcoins for more than $650,000, and did not report these sales at all on his 2018 and 2019 tax returns. For these years, Ahlgren took several sophisticated steps to attempt to conceal his transactions on the bitcoin blockchain by moving his bitcoins through multiple wallets, meeting an individual in person to exchange bitcoins for cash, and using mixers, which are designed to conceal the individual who made the particular transaction. Indeed, in May 2014, Ahlgren had blogged about his knowledge of mixers as ways to add anonymity to bitcoin transactions. In total, the tax loss from Ahlgren&rsquo;s criminal conduct was over $1 million.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frank Ahlgren III earned millions buying and selling bitcoins,&rdquo; said Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stuart M. Goldberg of the Justice Department&rsquo;s Tax Division &ldquo;But instead of paying the taxes he knew were due, he lied to his accountant about the extent of a large portion of his gains, and sought to conceal another chunk of his profits through sophisticated techniques designed to obscure his transactions on the bitcoin blockchain. That conduct today earned him a two-year sentence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahlgren will serve time because he believed his cryptocurrency transactions were untraceable.&nbsp;This case demonstrates that no one is above the law.&nbsp;My team at IRS Criminal Investigation has the expertise and tools to track financial activity, whether it involves dollars, pesos, or cryptocurrency,&rdquo; said Acting Special Agent in Charge Lucy Tan of IRS-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI)&rsquo;s Houston Field Office.&nbsp;&ldquo;This case marks the first criminal tax evasion prosecution centered solely on cryptocurrency.&nbsp;As the prices for cryptocurrency are high, so is the temptation to not pay taxes on its sale.&nbsp;Avoid the temptation and avoid federal prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to his prison sentence, U.S. District Court Judge Robert Pitman for the Western District of Texas ordered Ahlgren to serve one year of supervised release and to pay $1,095,031 in restitution to the United States.</p>
<p>IRS-CI and the Texas Office of Attorney General are investigating the case.</p>
<p>Assistant Chief Michael C. Boteler and Trial Attorney Mary Frances Richardson of the Tax Division and Assistant U.S. Attorney William R. Harris for the Western District of Texas are prosecuting the case.</p>

<p>Since July 2023, the Commission has brought three cases against special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) and/or SPAC sponsors, charging them with fraud because they made false and misleading statements regarding the details of their communications with potential target companies. I have declined to support these cases because the alleged misstatements and omissions are not material, and I do not view the facts in the Order as demonstrating investor harm.</p>
<ol>
<li><span>The SPAC Cases</span></li>
</ol>
<p>On July 20, 2023, the Commission charged Digital World Acquisition Corp. (&ldquo;DWAC&rdquo;) with violating Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (&ldquo;Securities Act&rdquo;) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;) and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder for making false and misleading statements and omissions in its registration statement on Form S-1, which was filed for the IPO, and Form S-4, which was filed for the de-SPAC transaction.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-spac-121224#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;The Order found that the Form S-1 stated that &ldquo;neither DWAC nor its officers and directors had had any discussions with any potential target companies prior to the IPO.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-spac-121224#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;It included the following statement: &ldquo;[w]e have not selected any specific business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, engaged in any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target with respect to an initial business combination with us.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-spac-121224#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;According to the Order, DWAC had been engaging in discussions with Trump Media and Technology Group Corp. (&ldquo;TMTG&rdquo;) prior to the filing of the Form S-1.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-spac-121224#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;The Commission imposed civil penalties of $18 million.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-spac-121224#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>On January 25, 2024, the Commission charged Northern Star Investment Corp. II (&ldquo;Northern Star&rdquo;) with violating Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act for making false and misleading statements in its registration statements on Form S-1 and Form S-4.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-spac-121224#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;Northern Star&rsquo;s Form S-1 contained similar language to DWAC and indicated that it had not selected any potential target or initiated any substantive discussions with a potential target.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-spac-121224#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;According to the Order, Northern Star had been engaging in discussions with Apex Clearing Holdings, LLC (&ldquo;Apex&rdquo;) prior to the filing of the Form S-1.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-spac-121224#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;The Order also indicated that Northern Star omitted communications between the parties in the Form S-4.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-spac-121224#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;The Commission imposed civil penalties of $1.5 million.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-spac-121224#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p>On December 12, 2024, the Commission charged Cantor Fitzgerald, L.P. (&ldquo;Cantor&rdquo;) with causing violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act and Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-3 thereunder, again alleging that two SPACs that it sponsored, CF Finance Acquisition Corp. II (&ldquo;CFAC II&rdquo;) and CF Acquisition Corp. V (&ldquo;CFAC V&rdquo;), made materially false and misleading statements in its registration statements on Forms S-1 and S-4.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-spac-121224#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;A team at Cantor, which has sponsored at least nine SPACs, the majority of which were launched between August 2020 and February 2021, identified potential targets for each of the individual business combinations.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-spac-121224#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;Sometimes, a potential target company was considered as a possible acquisition by multiple SPACs. In the Forms S-1 filed by both CFAC II and CFAC V, the SPACs each stated, &ldquo;[w]e have not selected any specific business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target regarding an initial business combination with our company.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-spac-121224#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;The Order states that &ldquo;Cantor personnel had already had substantive discussions&rdquo; and thereby &ldquo;caused [the SPAC] to make these materially misleading statements.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-spac-121224#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;The Order also finds that the Form S-4 filings, which stated that the SPAC entered into a transaction agreement or exclusive negotiations with another target and ceased discussions with other potential target businesses, were not accurate.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-spac-121224#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;The Commission imposed civil penalties of $6.75 million.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-spac-121224#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><span>Materiality</span></li>
</ol>
<p>In bringing these charges, the Orders appear to treat the disclosure of potential merger discussions and history of merger negotiations by the SPAC respondents in the same context as if the disclosure had been made by an operating company. However, SPACs are fundamentally different from operating companies. The purpose and day-to-day operations of a SPAC are reflected in its name &ndash; a vehicle formed for the special purpose of acquiring an operating company. In contrast, an operating company&rsquo;s purpose is to sell a product or service, and any merger activity, especially those requiring shareholder approval, is rare and an extraordinary corporate event.</p>
<p><i>IPO Disclosure</i></p>
<p>In each SPAC respondent&rsquo;s IPO filing, its purpose was disclosed throughout the Form S-1. Given this purpose, the most important information to an investor in deciding whether to purchase securities in the SPAC&rsquo;s IPO are (1) information about the SPAC&rsquo;s sponsor, such as its ability to source an acquisition and conflicts of interest and (2) the investor&rsquo;s rights, including those related to the SPAC&rsquo;s redemption of the purchased securities. The Orders did not find that these disclosures by any SPAC respondent were materially misleading.</p>
<p>Instead, the Orders focused on boilerplate disclosure by each SPAC respondent that it had not yet selected a specific operating company to acquire and that it had not had &ldquo;substantive discussions&rdquo; with any target company.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-spac-121224#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>&nbsp;To the extent a SPAC respondent omitted details about its preliminary merger negotiations with a particular target company, the materiality of such omission must be analyzed in the context of a SPAC&rsquo;s purpose.</p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court in&nbsp;<i>Basic v. Levinson</i>&nbsp;adopted the probability/magnitude test for assessing the materiality of preliminary merger negotiations.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-spac-121224#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a>&nbsp;The Second Circuit case cited by&nbsp;<i>Basic</i>&nbsp;for this test involved a small corporation that would be merged out of existence.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-spac-121224#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>&nbsp;For this corporation, the Second Circuit stated, and&nbsp;<i>Basic</i>&nbsp;agreed, that its merger was &ldquo;the most important event that can occur in [its] life, to-wit, its death&rdquo; and accordingly, information about the merger &ldquo;can become material&rdquo; before there is an agreement on the acquisition price and structure.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-spac-121224#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></p>
<p>Unlike the corporation discussed in&nbsp;<i>Basic</i>, each SPAC respondent&rsquo;s stated purpose was to acquire a target company. The SPAC&rsquo;s &ldquo;death&rdquo; is planned for and sought after from the time the SPAC is formed. Given this distinction, the probability/magnitude test, as applied to information concerning a SPAC&rsquo;s preliminary merger negotiations, should result in such information not becoming material until a time much closer to the SPAC and target company reaching a binding agreement on the acquisition price and structure. Any discussions prior to such time, even if they are &ldquo;substantive,&rdquo; are part of the day-to-day operations of a SPAC.</p>
<p><i>de-SPAC Transaction Disclosure</i></p>
<p>The Orders also found that each SPAC respondent&rsquo;s Form S-4 filed for its de-SPAC transaction misstated or omitted information regarding merger discussions between the SPAC and the target company.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-spac-121224#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a></p>
<p>Similar to its materiality analysis for each SPAC respondent&rsquo;s IPO disclosure, the Orders do not address the context in which the disclosure was made. Merger negotiations are not part of the day-to-day duties for an operating company&rsquo;s board of directors and senior management. When an operating company seeks shareholder approval for a merger, information about the history of merger discussions, including how the board reached its decision to merge with a particular company instead of other acquirors or targets, can help shareholders assess whether the board satisfied its fiduciary duties.</p>
<p>In contrast, the sole job of a SPAC&rsquo;s board and senior management is to identify a target company for acquisition. When deciding whether to approve a SPAC&rsquo;s combination with a target company, the most important information to investors are the target company&rsquo;s business, risks, and financial performance. The Orders did not find that the SPAC respondents&rsquo; disclosure in these areas were materially misleading.</p>
<p>To make an informed voting decision, a SPAC&rsquo;s investors do not require a &ldquo;play-by-play&rdquo; in how the SPAC&rsquo;s board arrived at its decision to select a particular target company for acquisition. Such a low bar for materiality may result in investors being inundated with details about specific interactions that obscure more important information about the target&rsquo;s business prospects. While certain aspects of a SPAC&rsquo;s merger negotiation history can be material, the allegations against the SPAC respondents do not arise to that level.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><span>Investor Harm</span></li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to the alleged misstatements and omission not being material, I also did not support the three proceedings because the Orders do not include facts demonstrating that each SPAC respondent&rsquo;s investors were financially harmed.</p>
<p>A SPAC, in essence, is merely the holding vessel for a pot of money that sits in an interest-bearing escrow account until an acquisition is made. A common feature among SPACs is the right of investors to redeem their shares in the SPAC upon completion of the de-SPAC transaction. This right protects investors by allowing them to exchange their shares for an amount approximate to the SPAC&rsquo;s IPO price, plus interest. Each SPAC respondent offered redemption rights to its shareholders.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-spac-121224#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a></p>
<ol start="4">
<li><span>Conclusion</span></li>
</ol>
<p>When charging SPACs with disclosure violations, the Commission should be mindful of the unique nature of SPACs and how they differ from operating companies. The day-to-day operation of a SPAC is to engage in merger discussions. A low threshold for whether a misstatement or omission concerning merger negotiations is material may result in unnecessary proceedings, such as those against these three respondents.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Cantor Fitzgerald Over Misleading SPAC Disclosures</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-charges-cantor-fitzgerald-over-misleading-spac-disclosures/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged global financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald, L.P. with causing two special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) that it controlled to make misleading statements to investors ahead of their initial public offerings (IPOs). Cantor Fitzgerald has agreed to pay a $6.75 million civil penalty to settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges.</p>
<p>A SPAC is an entity with no underlying business operations that is formed to raise money through an IPO so it can then identify and acquire an operating business.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s Order, in 2020 and 2021, a team of Cantor Fitzgerald executives managed and controlled two SPACs &ndash; CF Finance Acquisition Corp. II and CF Acquisition Corp. V &ndash; which raised $750 million from investors through IPOs ahead of the SPACs&rsquo; eventual mergers with View, Inc. and Satellogic Inc., respectively.&nbsp;The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that Cantor Fitzgerald caused the SPACs in their SEC filings to deny having had contact or substantive discussions with potential business combination targets prior to their IPOs. However, the Order finds that at the time of each SPAC&rsquo;s IPO, Cantor Fitzgerald personnel, acting on behalf of the SPACs, had already commenced negotiations with a small group of potential target companies for the SPACs, including with View and Satellogic, the companies with which the SPACs eventually merged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cantor Fitzgerald misled investors about a critical investment consideration by repeatedly stating in public filings that it had not identified or approached any potential merger targets, despite having had substantive discussions with several private companies regarding a potential merger, including with the companies with which its SPACs eventually merged,&rdquo; said Sanjay Wadhwa, Acting Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;This enforcement action reflects the straightforward proposition that any disclosures about substantive discussions with potential targets must be materially accurate."&nbsp;</p>
<p>The order charges Cantor with causing violations of certain antifraud and proxy provisions of the federal securities laws. Without admitting or denying the order&rsquo;s findings, Cantor agreed to cease and desist from violations of the charged provisions and to pay the aforementioned $6.75 million civil penalty.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Eugene Bull, Rebecca Schendel Norris, and Gargi Chaudhuri. It was supervised by Laura B. Josephs.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Former Representative Of Advisory Firm SeaCrest With Cherry-Picking - Firm Settles SEC Charges Related To Former Employee’s Misconduct</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-charges-former-representative-of-advisory-firm-seacrest-with-cherry-picking/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-charges-former-representative-of-advisory-firm-seacrest-with-cherry-picking/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Eric Cobb of South Carolina with engaging in a fraudulent scheme where he allocated profitable securities trades to favored accounts and unprofitable trades to disfavored clients, a practice known as cherry-picking, while he was a representative of investment adviser SeaCrest Wealth Management, Inc. The SEC also announced settled charges against SeaCrest in connection with the scheme.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint against Cobb, from at least June 2019 to mid-April 2022, Cobb allegedly disproportionately allocated profitable trades to his personal and wife&rsquo;s accounts, and unprofitable trades to the accounts of his other clients. Cobb allegedly executed the scheme by buying securities in an omnibus account and then often waiting a day or longer to allocate the trades, which allowed him to see whether the securities had increased in price. The SEC&rsquo;s complaint also alleges that Cobb routinely placed clients in highly volatile and risky investments that were inconsistent with their investment profiles. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order regarding New York-based SeaCrest, which oversees representatives located in more than two dozen offices around the country, found that the firm failed to implement policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations of the federal securities laws and failed to supervise Cobb&rsquo;s activities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will use all the tools at our disposal to hold individuals accountable, including asking Courts to enforce our subpoenas, as we&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-25998#:~:text=On%20May%207%2C%202024%2C%20the%20Court%20granted%20the%20SEC's%20application,hold%20him%20in%20civil%20contempt.">did in this case</a>,&rdquo; said Sheldon L. Pollock, Associate Regional Director in the New York Regional Office. &ldquo;The enforcement action against SeaCrest demonstrates the importance of decentralized firms having robust compliance oversight with regard to employees who may be located elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Cobb with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, civil monetary penalties, disgorgement, and prejudgment interest. The SEC&rsquo;s order found that SeaCrest willfully violated antifraud and books and recordkeeping provisions of the federal securities laws and failed to supervise Cobb. SeaCrest, without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, agreed to be censured and pay a $375,000 penalty.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Bennett Ellenbogen, James Flynn, Richard Primoff, and Lindsay S. Moilanen of the New York Regional Office and was supervised by Mr. Pollock. The SEC&rsquo;s litigation will be led by Mr. Ellenbogen and Mr. Primoff and supervised by Alex Vasilescu. The SEC appreciates the assistance of SEC Division of Examinations staff, Arjuman Sultana, Michael Qualter, Emanuel Asmar, and Merryl Hoffman; and SEC Division of Economics and Risk Analysis staff, Kathryn Paige and Tyler Remick.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota issued an order of default judgment against&nbsp;<span>Richard &ldquo;Rick&rdquo; Miller</span>&nbsp;and his company,&nbsp;<span>Flip 2 Futures Trading Company LLC</span>, both based in Minnesota, and&nbsp;<span>Punch Drunk Marketing LLC</span>, a Wisconsin limited liability company, for their operation of a fraudulent futures trading scheme.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The order requires Miller and F2F to pay a $900,000 civil monetary penalty and, jointly and severally with PDM, $364,000 in restitution to victims of the scheme. The order also requires PDM to pay a $750,000 civil monetary penalty and imposes permanent trading and registration bans against Miller and F2F and a permanent injunction prohibiting Miller and F2F from further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations, as charged.&nbsp;</span><span>The order resolves the CFTC&rsquo;s enforcement action against Miller, F2F, and PDM.&nbsp; [See CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;</span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8663-23"><span>8663-23</span></a><span>.]</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Case Background</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>The order stems from a CFTC complaint filed Feb. 22, 2023, and finds&nbsp;</span><span>from approximately July 2019 through November 2020, PDM&nbsp;</span><span>solicited and accepted $400,000 from nine individuals to participate in a commodity pool for the purpose of trading futures contracts. PDM failed to provide pool participants with required disclosure documents and illegally collected their funds in accounts held in PDM&rsquo;s name before transferring the funds to F2F and Miller for trading.&nbsp;<span>PDM also&nbsp;</span>misappropriated pool participants&rsquo; investment funds by failing to transfer all funds provided to PDM by pool participants for the purpose of futures trading to F2F and Miller for trading as provided in PDM&rsquo;s agreements with pool participants and by failing to return to pool participants funds repaid by F2F.<span>&nbsp;The order also finds PDM acted as a commodity pool operator without being registered with the CFTC as required.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The order further finds&nbsp;<span>Miller&nbsp;</span>made material misrepresentations about his futures trading performance and having other assets under management, to persuade PDM to transfer funds to F2F for the purpose of trading futures contracts<span>. In fact, Miller did not trade as successfully as he claimed and did not have millions under management. Moreover, Miller and F2F misappropriated some of PDM&rsquo;s funds by failing to transfer all of PDM&rsquo;s funds to Miller&rsquo;s trading account and failing to transfer to PDM funds withdrawn from Miller&rsquo;s trading account.&nbsp;</span>Miller and F2F also illegally collected funds from the pooled investment vehicle in F2F&rsquo;s or Miller&rsquo;s bank and trading accounts, failed to provide a required disclosure document to PDM, and failed to maintain required records. The order finds that by soliciting funds from and engaging in discretionary trading on behalf of the pool established by PDM,&nbsp;<span>F2F acted as a commodity trading advisor and Miller acted as an associated person of a CTA without being registered with the CFTC as required.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this action are Dmitriy Vilenskiy, Julia Colarusso, Christine Ryall, and Paul G. Hayeck.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>The Board also recently appointed a Public Governor, Erik Sirri, Emeritus Professor of Finance at Babson College and a former Director of the SEC's Division of Trading and Markets, who participated in his first Board meeting. Professor Sirri has extensive experience with securities regulation and his research focuses on the interaction of securities law and finance, investment management, securities market structure and capital markets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am pleased to welcome Erik to the Board and I look forward to working with him. His wide range of expertise and experience will contribute significantly to the Board&rsquo;s efforts to provide strategic guidance for FINRA&rsquo;s vital work of protecting investors and ensuring market integrity,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/about/governance/finra-board-governors/eric-noll">FINRA Board Chair Eric Noll</a>.</p>
<p>The Board approved two items during the meeting: FINRA&rsquo;s 2025 budget and FINRA&rsquo;s plan to publish a Regulatory Notice soliciting comments on a proposal to replace FINRA&rsquo;s Outside Business Activities and Private Securities Transactions Rules with a single Outside Activities Requirements Rule. The Notice will provide specifics about the proposed rule, and soliciting comments will allow FINRA to incorporate perspectives on how to ensure investor protection while addressing the varying business models of member firms.</p>
<p>FINRA staff presented the Board with an overview of the 2025 FINRA Annual Regulatory Oversight Report, which consolidates information gathered from across our regulatory operations that member firms can then leverage to enhance their compliance programs. Specifically, the report, which is slated to be published in January, summarizes noteworthy findings from recent examinations and other interactions with firms, outlines effective practices, highlights applicable rules and identifies resources for member firms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The FINRA Annual Regulatory Oversight Report includes findings from across FINRA&rsquo;s Member Supervision, Market Regulation and Enforcement programs that provide critical information to member firms. Compliance challenges continue to evolve as the industry does, highlighting the importance of this report. We look forward to sharing the full report in early 2025,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/about/governance/executives">FINRA CEO Robert Cook</a>.</p>
<p>The Board appointed new members to the Small Firm Advisory Committee (SFAC) and National Adjudicatory Council (NAC). FINRA will also soon publish an Election Notice announcing these newly appointed members, as well as the newly elected members of the SFAC and regional committees. It will also include an update on the NAC election.</p>
<p>More information regarding the Board&rsquo;s operations, including the membership and responsibilities of its committees, is available&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/about/governance">here</a>.</p>

<title>SEC Office Of The Investor Advocate Issues Report On Nationally Representative Survey Of Investors And Continues Focus On Investment Fraud</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-office-of-the-investor-advocate-issues-report-on-nationally-representative-s/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s Office of the Investor Advocate today published its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/fy24-oiad-sar-activities-report.pdf">Report on Activities</a>&nbsp;for the Fiscal Year 2024 to Congress, highlighting the work of the office during the fiscal year.</p>
<p>The report includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The office&rsquo;s findings from a program of quarterly, longitudinal surveys of investors launched in fiscal year 2024. The Thoughtful Households Relating InVesting Experiences (THRIVE) Panel is a nationally representative survey panel that can facilitate frequent survey research to provide timely data on investment-related topics and support investor testing projects to help inform policymaking or long-run research priorities.</li>
<li>The office&rsquo;s continued focus on investment fraud. Reported fraud incidents continued to grow in 2024, as reported by numerous investors, regulators, and law enforcement agencies.</li>
<li>An update on the SEC&rsquo;s creation of the Interagency Securities Council, a joint task force where federal, state, and local regulatory and law enforcement professionals meet to discuss the latest in financial frauds, scams, trends, and mitigation strategies, and receive briefings on emerging and complex topics to better protect investors.</li>
<li>From the Office of the Ombuds, part of the Office of the Investor Advocate, a report which describes in detail what has emerged as a prevalent pattern of investment fraud, as learned from the victims who contact the Ombuds for assistance. The Office of the Investor Advocate and the Office of the Ombuds continue to seek insights and recommendations from a variety of stakeholders on this proliferation of fraud and encourage the greatest possible coordination among regulators and law enforcement to curb and cure the impacts on individual victims, but also on the victims&rsquo; families and communities who all pay a price for fraud.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;This year&rsquo;s report brings into focus our efforts to understand investors&rsquo; preferences related to their investments through data and research, and outline some of the investment fraud trends that are increasingly common,&rdquo; said Cristina Martin Firvida, Director of the Office of the Investor Advocate. &ldquo;I am particularly supportive of the Commission&rsquo;s efforts to combat retail investor fraud and the formation of the Interagency Securities Council to coordinate efforts across the whole of government. The ongoing fraud epidemic in America continues to be of paramount concern, and our advocacy reflects those interests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Office of the Investor Advocate is an independent office within the SEC, created by Congress, to provide investors with a voice inside the Commission, to assist retail investors, to study investor behavior, and to advocate for investors&rsquo; interests. The Office also provides operational support to the SEC Investor Advisory Committee.</p>

<p><span>The U.S. Department of the Treasury&rsquo;s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection (OCCIP) released an advisory to consumers highlighting tips for consumers to avoid cyber and online scams during the holiday season. Since the onset of the COVID pandemic, cyber and fraud scams have significantly increased, costing consumers billions of dollars per year. To avoid becoming a victim of fraud during the holiday shopping season, there are steps you can take to protect yourself.</span></p>
<p><span>This holiday season stay vigilant, be proactive, and respond quickly if you are targeted by a scammer or fraud.</span></p>
<p><span face="times new roman,times" size="3"><span>&ldquo;The U.S. Department of the Treasury urges consumers to stay vigilant against the increasing threat of online cyber scams and fraud,&rdquo;&nbsp;said Deputy Assistant Secretary for OCCIP Todd Conklin.</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;These scams are costing both consumers and financial institutions billions of dollars annually, and it&rsquo;s crucial to take proactive steps to protect yourself. Be cautious when responding to unsolicited messages, especially on social media platforms like LinkedIn, TikTok, and Instagram, and avoid being rushed into making purchases or payments. Remember, taking the time to think, research, and consult with trusted individuals can help you avoid falling victim to fraud.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>In the advisory, OCCIP details several tips consumers should follow to avoid being scammed. Unfortunately, there is often an increase in fraud and cyber crime around the holiday shopping season, some of which are detailed in the advisory. In the event you are targeted, the advisory provides guidance for victims of fraud to attempt to mitigate the damages and losses to consumers.</span></p>

<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, and home to the most liquid markets for trading MSCI<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;futures, today announced the launch of MSCI&reg; MarketAxess Tradable Corporate Bond Index futures.</p>
<p>The futures contracts will be based on MSCI and MarketAxess&rsquo; newly created corporate bond indices. These tradable indices aim to provide a benchmark for the performance of the corporate bond market, incorporating sector and credit allocation to ensure low tracking error to the MSCI parent indices and reliable replication of the credit market.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The introduction of ICE MSCI MarketAxess Corporate Bond futures are a welcome addition to the existing suite of credit futures,&rdquo; said Antony Harden, Executive Director, Goldman Sachs. &ldquo;Timing couldn&rsquo;t be better as client adoption hits an all-time high as credit futures find their way into investors toolkits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The MSCI MarketAxess Tradable Corporate bond indices methodology uses MarketAxess&rsquo; Relative Liquidity Scores to identify and measure the performance of a selection of liquid fixed income securities from MSCI&rsquo;s broader Corporate Bond Indices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;ICE&rsquo;s markets account for over 70% of global MSCI futures trading by volume in equity markets, and we are pleased to expand our relationship to the corporate bond futures market,&rdquo; said Caterina Caramaschi, Vice President, Financial Derivatives, ICE. &ldquo;The launch reflects growing investor demand for products that allow better management of corporate bond portfolios, and we thank MSCI and MarketAxess for their collaboration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>"We are excited to be working with ICE and MarketAxess to provide investors with innovative tools designed to manage credit exposures more efficiently,&rdquo; said George Harrington, Managing Director, MSCI. &ldquo;By leveraging MSCI's index methodologies, MarketAxess' unique liquidity metrics and ICE's leading trading platform, clients can efficiently trade and achieve enhanced liquidity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>ICE&rsquo;s MSCI MarketAxess Tradable Corporate Bond Index Futures will join ICE&rsquo;s existing suite of liquid futures based on MSCI ACWI, MSCI EAFE, MSCI Emerging Markets, MSCI ESG and MSCI Climate indices, providing participants around the world with a set of tools to manage equity risk. So far in 2024, the average daily volume for ICE&rsquo;s MSCI complex is over 190,000 contracts, equal to an estimated $13.6 billion of notional value. Approximately 45 million ICE MSCI futures contracts have traded year-to-date.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li class="spanHeading"><span>HKEX kicks off multi-year post-trade services enhancement programme</span></li>
<li class="spanHeading"><span>New post-trade features and services to be rolled out progressively beginning mid-2025</span></li>
<li class="spanHeading"><span>HKEX systems will be technically ready to support T+1 settlement cycle by end-2025</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) is pleased to announce today (</span><span>Thurs</span><span>day) that it is embarking on a multi-year post-trade services enhancement programme for its cash equities market, reflecting the Group&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to build future-ready market infrastructure.</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span class="spanHeading">Starting from mid-2025, new features will be progressively added to the Orion Cash Platform (OCP), HKEX&rsquo;s integrated cash market platform, to provide more advanced, reliable and efficient post-trade services for the securities market.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>New features include automated post-trade report download and information exchange, as well as enabling real-time transmission and processing of trade data, related positions and reference data, and real</span><span>-</span><span>time matching of settlement instructions. As part of the enhancement programme, HKEX&rsquo;s post-trade systems will become technically ready to support a T+1 settlement cycle by the end of 2025, though any future changes to Hong Kong&rsquo;s settlement cycle will be subject to extensive market engagement.</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>HKEX Chief Executive Officer, Bonnie Y Chan, said: &ldquo;At HKEX, we are committed to the long-term vibrancy of Hong Kong&rsquo;s capital markets through ongoing investment in our technology and market infrastructure. We are pleased to be launching the modernisation programme for our cash market platform, developing the capabilities for real-time and more efficient post-trade services. The ongoing development of OCP will ensure that our markets remain well-positioned for future opportunities as they continue to expand in breadth and diversity, strengthening Hong Kong&rsquo;s status as an IFC.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>HKEX will progressively introduce these new post-trade features and services on OCP, with respective release dates to be announced in due course.</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>Meanwhile, HKEX will continue to provide core post-trade processing through its Central Clearing and Settlement System (CCASS). HKEX will engage with stakeholders and market participants on the future of CCASS as the new OCP post-trade features progressively become available.</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading">HKEX Group Chief Information Officer, Richard Leung, said: &ldquo;Platform development is a core part of HKEX&rsquo;s strategy to futureproof its business and its markets. We are delighted to adopt modular architecture to introduce new post-trade features, in order to provide maximum flexibility for market adoption. We look forward to engaging and collaborating with our market participants on this infrastructure advancement journey, as together we work to enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong&rsquo;s capital markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="spanHeading">Earlier this year, HKEX also announced plans to develop the new Orion Derivatives Platform (ODP) for Hong Kong&rsquo;s derivatives market. The ODP and OCP development demonstrate the Group&rsquo;s strategic focus on building the long-term resilience of Hong Kong&rsquo;s market infrastructure with technology developed in-house.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">For more details on HKEX&rsquo;s post-trade services enhancements scheduled for 2025 &ndash; 2027, please refer to the&nbsp;<span><span><a href="https://www.hkex.com.hk/-/media/HKEX-Market/Services/Circulars-and-Notices/Participant-and-Members-Circulars/HKSCC/2024/CCASS_051_English.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">circular</a></span></span>&nbsp;published today.</p>

<title>FSB Issues Recommendations Related To Data Flows And Regulation And Supervision Of Cross-Border Payments</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fsb-issues-recommendations-related-to-data-flows-and-regulation-and-supervision/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fsb-issues-recommendations-related-to-data-flows-and-regulation-and-supervision/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><span>Recommendations address frictions in data flows related to cross-border payments and promote a level playing field between bank and non-bank providers of payment services.</span></li>
<li><span>Recommendations form part of the FSB&rsquo;s efforts to prioritise work and strengthen private-sector participation under the G20 cross-border payments roadmap.</span></li>
<li><span>The FSB is inviting market stakeholders to join its Taskforce on Legal, Regulatory, and Supervisory matters and is establishing a new Forum on Cross-Border Payments Data to take these recommendations forward in a coordinated manner and encourage cross-sectoral collaboration.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) published today its finalised recommendations to promote&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/12/recommendations-to-promote-alignment-and-interoperability-across-data-frameworks-related-to-cross-border-payments-final-report/">greater alignment in data frameworks related to cross-border payments</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/12/recommendations-for-regulating-and-supervising-bank-and-non-bank-payment-service-providers-offering-cross-border-payment-services-final-report/">consistency in the regulation and supervision of bank and non-bank payment service providers</a>. These recommendations advance key actions from the G20 Roadmap to address legal, supervisory, and regulatory issues in cross-border payments. As part of these efforts and to enhance private sector engagement, the FSB is inviting market stakeholders in cross-border payments to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/12/the-financial-stability-board-invites-cross-border-payments-market-stakeholders-to-join-its-taskforce-on-legal-regulatory-and-supervisory-matters/">join its Taskforce on Legal, Regulatory, and Supervisory matters</a>&nbsp;(LRS Taskforce).</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><span>Policy recommendations to promote greater alignment and interoperability in data frameworks related to cross-border payments</span></h4>
<p>The transfer of data across borders is essential to the functioning of cross-border payments. Frictions from data frameworks (i.e. the range of laws, rules and regulatory requirements for collecting, storing and managing data) can pose significant challenges to improving the cost, speed, transparency and accessibility of cross-border payments.&nbsp;<a>The FSB&rsquo;s recommendations aim to address identified frictions, while maintaining the safety and security of cross-border payments and upholding the objectives of protecting the privacy of individuals and fostering innovation.&nbsp;</a>Identified frictions include different data requirements in payments that interfere with the smooth processing of cross-border payments, restrictions on data sharing that impede the ability to safely process cross-border payments, and increased costs due to data storage and handling requirements.</p>
<p>To take forward these recommendations in a coordinated manner and to identify emerging issues that should be addressed, the FSB is establishing a&nbsp;<a>Forum on Cross-Border Payments Data</a>. The Forum will be comprised of public-sector stakeholders covering payments, anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), sanctions, and data privacy and protection. The Forum will also establish a private sector advisory group.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><span>Policy recommendations to strengthen consistency in regulating and supervising banks and non-banks providing cross-border payment services</span></h4>
<p>Advances in technology have led to an increasing number and variety of payment services providers (PSPs) and the services they offer. In the absence of comprehensive international standards applicable to non-bank PSPs&rsquo; provision of cross-border payment services, jurisdictions have taken varying approaches to regulating and supervising bank and non-bank PSPs offering these services. These recommendations aim to ensure quality and consistency in the legal, regulatory and supervisory regimes of banks and non-banks in their provision of cross-border payment services in a way that is proportionate to the risks associated with such activities. This approach reduces the likelihood of regulatory arbitrage by establishing a level playing field for both banks and non-bank PSPs, despite differences in business models and risk profiles. Greater consistency in the regulation and supervision of banks and non-banks providing cross-border payment services can foster lower costs, higher delivery speed, and better financial access and transparency.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h2>
<p>Both reports reflect public feedback received by the FSB on the consultative versions issued in July 2024. The FSB also published today overviews of the responses to these public consultations.</p>
<p>The G20 has made enhancing cross-border payments a priority to achieve faster, cheaper, more transparent and more inclusive cross-border payments, while maintaining their safety and security. In 2020, the FSB, in coordination with the Bank for International Settlements&rsquo; Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and other international organisations and standard-setting bodies, developed a Roadmap to address these challenges. In October 2022, G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors endorsed a<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2022/10/g20-roadmap-for-enhancing-cross-border-payments-priorities-for-the-next-phase-of-work/">&nbsp;plan for prioritising work</a>&nbsp;under the Roadmap and for enhancing engagement with the private sector and jurisdictions beyond the G20. In February 2023, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/02/g20-roadmap-for-enhancing-cross-border-payments-priority-actions-for-achieving-the-g20-targets/">FSB outlined three priority themes to drive the Roadmap forward</a>. The themes cover: payment system interoperability and extension; legal, regulatory and supervisory frameworks; and cross-border exchange and message standards.</p>
<p>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. The FSB also conducts outreach with approximately 70 other jurisdictions through its six Regional Consultative Groups.</p>
<p>The FSB is chaired by Klaas Knot, President of De Nederlandsche Bank. The FSB Secretariat is located in Basel, Switzerland and hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>

<title>Christian Zinglersen Reappointed To Lead ACER For The Next Five Years</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/christian-zinglersen-reappointed-to-lead-acer-for-the-next-five-years/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/christian-zinglersen-reappointed-to-lead-acer-for-the-next-five-years/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Administrative Board of the EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) has extended the mandate of the current Director, Mr Christian Zinglersen, for another five-year mandate. This takes effect from 1 January 2025 until 31 December 2029.</p>
<p>Mr Zinglersen&rsquo;s reappointment as ACER Director ensures continued leadership of the Agency at a time of significant challenges in EU energy markets, ambitious EU energy and climate goals and an expanded role for ACER. The Agency is on the path of significant growth, reflecting its expanding role following three major legislative packages adopted in 2024. These reforms (which aim to enhance electricity market integration, strengthen the oversight of energy markets to protect businesses from market abuse, and support gas decarbonisation) coupled with its previously mandated work shape ACER&rsquo;s agenda for the years ahead.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chair of ACER&rsquo;s Administrative Board, Ms Edit Herczog, said:</span></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;In the context of today&rsquo;s planetary and geopolitical boundaries and the importance of energy to our society and the economy, the role of ACER in driving an interconnected EU energy ecosystem is vital. This is the mission of the ACER Director and leadership for the next five years.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chair of ACER&rsquo;s Boards of Regulators, Ms Clara Poletti, said:</span></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The unanimous favourable opinion of the Board of Regulators to the Director&rsquo;s reappointment underscores the national regulators&rsquo; belief in Mr Zinglersen&rsquo;s strong leadership and his dedication to steering the Agency through its evolving mandate.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On his reappointment as ACER Director, Mr Zinglersen said:</span></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I am honoured to have the trust and confidence of the ACER Boards to steer the Agency through its evolving mandate for the coming years. At ACER, we understand the real-world energy challenges and trade-offs that governments and stakeholders face. One such key challenge facing Europe, and a promise of the European Commission under its new political mandate, is to enhance EU competitiveness while reducing energy bills for companies and households. A key component here will be how Europe&rsquo;s integrated energy markets evolve in the years ahead. Naturally ACER and our members, the National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs), will have a key role to play here if leaders across the EU decide to leverage further this potential asset.</em></p>
<p><em>Building trust is not built solely on shared values but also through ACER&rsquo;s daily graft alongside the NRAs of monitoring energy markets and networks to ensure the rules are respected, removing barriers, increasing transparency, analysing data to detect market manipulation and insider trading, and providing evidence-based insights that help decision-makers make informed decisions about the trade-offs they face. As the saying goes, &lsquo;The only easy day was yesterday&rsquo;, reflecting that as our energy transition unfolds, there will be ample new and exciting challenges to devote ourselves to.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The ACER Administrative Board&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsFCAQBUAUGUUwOUwdRHVZYVlcdCltTUhoHUFZSVwcDU1cHAFcdAFECBFxXA1IdUFwHVR0GXQJfGldVAVIZCgYPDldXVARYVFBZRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">decision</a>&nbsp;(at its 11-12 December meeting) to reappoint Director Zinglersen was based on a proposal by the European Commission and supported by a favourable opinion from the ACER Board of Regulators by consensus. Ahead of the decision of the Administrative Board, Mr Zinglersen appeared before the ITRE Committee of the European Parliament (3 December 2024), answering questions from its members.</p>

<title>SET Market Report For November 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/set-market-report-for-november-2024/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/set-market-report-for-november-2024/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>U.S. stocks and Bitcoin staged a strong rally in the wake of Donald Trump's presidential election victory. However, analysts have raised concerns over potential trade policy uncertainties ahead, warning that Trump&rsquo;s follow-through on his campaign promise of severe trade tariffs against China could undermine the U.S. economy and compel investors to shift their portfolios toward safe-haven assets. If the disinflation progress is hampered by the escalating trade tensions, the Federal Reserve may have to delay its interest rate reductions to curb the risk of inflation resurgence. This more restrictive monetary policy stance could heighten volatility across global financial and capital markets over the next 1-2 years.</p>
<p><b>SET Senior Executive Vice President Soraphol Tulayasathien </b>noted that the Thai economy in 2017 during Trump 1.0 administration was stronger than today, as evidenced by the period&rsquo;s higher GDP growth and current account surplus. Nonetheless, Thailand&rsquo;s GDP expanded 3.0 percent in the third quarter of 2024, driving the nine-month growth to 2.3 percent which was above analyst expectation. In parallel, the Office of the National Economic and Social Development Council (NESDC) also revised upward its full-year growth projection to 2.6 percent on the back of tourism recovery, export growth, and public investment expansion. While listed companies post robust revenue growth in the first nine months of 2024, declining oil prices and narrower refining margins weighed down net profits of the oil and petrochemical sectors.</p>
<p><b>Key highlights for November</b><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<ul>
<li>At the end of November 2024, the SET Index closed at 1,427.54 points, down 2.6 percent from the previous month, moving in line with the regional peers. The SET index rose 0.8 percent from the end of 2023. </li>
<li>Compared to the end of last year, Technology group emerged as the only industry group that outperformed the SET Index.</li>
<li>SET&rsquo;s and Market for Alternative Investment (mai)&rsquo;s average daily trading value in November 2024 decreased 3.4 percent YoY to THB 44.26 billion (approx. USD 1.29 billion). For the first 11 months of 2024, the daily trading value averaged at THB 47.05 billion, a decrease of 13.5 percent YoY. However, local institutional investors&rsquo; trading value has risen for two consecutive months and accounted for more than 10 percent of total trading value.</li>
<li>There were three newly listed companies, with Specialty Natural Products pcl (SNPS) listed on SET, and MPJ Logistics pcl (MPJ) and Interroyal Engineering pcl (IROYAL) listed on mai.</li>
<li>The Thai stock exchange&rsquo;s forward P/E ratio at the end of November 2024 was 16.3 times, above the Asian stock markets&rsquo; average of 12.6 times. The historical P/E ratio stood at 19.3 times, exceeding the Asian stock markets&rsquo; average of 14.3 times. </li>
<li>Dividend yield ratio at the end of November 2024 was 3.34 percent, higher than the Asian stock markets&rsquo; average of 3.10 percent. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Derivatives Market</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Thailand Futures Exchange (TFEX)&rsquo;s daily trading volume in November 2024 averaged 487,638 contracts, down 4.2 percent from the previous month largely due to the lower trading volume of Single Stock Futures. For the first 11 months of 2024, TFEX&rsquo;s average daily trading volume dropped 10.7 percent over the same period last year to 479,145 contracts mainly due to the decline in trading volume of Single Stock Futures and SET50 Index Futures. </li>

<title>Kraken Crypto Exchange Operator To Pay $8 Million Following ASIC Enforcement Action</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Legal proceedings launched by ASIC have seen the Australian operator of the Kraken crypto exchange ordered to pay $8 million for unlawfully issuing a credit facility to more than 1100 Australian customers.</p>
<p>From October 2021, Bit Trade Pty Ltd, which operated the Kraken exchange, had offered its customers a &lsquo;margin extension&rsquo; product without a target market determination (TMD). The product provided for margin extensions to be made and repaid in either digital assets like bitcoin or national currencies such as US dollars.</p>
<p>In August this year, the Federal Court found that Bit Trade&rsquo;s product was a credit facility and required a TMD as the product offered margin extensions in national currencies. As a result, the company breached its design and distribution obligations (DDO) each time it offered the margin extension product to a customer without the required TMD.</p>
<p>ASIC Chair Joe Longo said, &lsquo;Target market determinations are fundamental in ensuring that investors are not inappropriately marketed products that could harm them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bit Trade issued its margin extension product to over 1100 Australians who were charged fees and interest of more than US$7 million without considering if the product was appropriate for them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Those customers Bit Trade targeted suffered trading losses of more than US$5 million, including one investor who lost almost US$4 million.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is a significant outcome. It is ASIC&rsquo;s first penalty against an entity for failing to have a TMD and a reminder for digital assets firms to consider their regulatory compliance obligations.</p>
<p>&lsquo;ASIC believes many products offered by digital assets firms are captured by the current law, which means those products need to be properly designed and marketed to the right consumers to ensure Australians receive appropriate protections.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In handing down his penalty decision today, Justice Nicholas noted that Bit Trade &lsquo;did not turn its mind to the requirement of the DDO regime until these were first drawn to its attention by ASIC&rsquo; and that &lsquo;the failure to consider that matter points to a seriously deficient compliance system.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His Honour observed that the product was made available to customers without any consideration of the impact of the DDO regime until after ASIC intervention and that Bit Trade continued to offer the product when it knew or ought to have known it was likely in breach of the law. &lsquo;I am satisfied that Bit Trade's contraventions were serious and motivated by a desire to maximise revenue,&rsquo; His Honour said.</p>
<p>The penalty comes shortly after&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-266mr-asic-invites-feedback-on-proposed-updates-to-digital-asset-guidance/" title="24-266MR ASIC invites feedback on proposed updates to digital asset guidance">ASIC commenced industry consultation with the digital-assets sector</a>. ASIC is seeking feedback from digital assets providers and exchanges on draft updates to our guidance on when products offered by digital asset firms may be considered regulated products under the current law.</p>
<p>Bit Trade was also ordered to pay ASIC&rsquo;s costs for the proceedings.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>ASIC commenced proceedings against Bit Trade on 20 September 2023 (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2023-releases/23-256mr-asic-sues-crypto-exchange-alleging-design-and-distribution-failures/" title="23-256MR ASIC sues crypto exchange alleging design and distribution failures">23-256MR</a>).</p>
<p>The Federal Court found that Bit Trade failed to comply with its design and distribution obligations on 23 August 2024. The Federal Court found that Bit Trade&rsquo;s product was a credit facility on the basis that the product involved an extension of margin in a national currency which created a deferred debt. The Court found that the obligation to repay a digital asset was not an obligation to repay money and therefore not a deferred debt (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-186mr-asic-wins-case-against-kraken-crypto-exchange-operator-for-design-and-distribution-failure/" title="24-186MR ASIC wins case against Kraken crypto exchange operator for design and distribution failure">24-186MR</a>).</p>
<p>Bit Trade is registered with AUSTRAC. It is a subsidiary of Payward Incorporated. Bit Trade is the local operator of the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange.</p>
<p>ASIC Information Sheet 225&nbsp;<em>Crypto-assets</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/digital-transformation/crypto-assets/" title="Crypto-assets">INFO 225</a>) provides guidance on the circumstances in which a digital asset related offering may be a financial product. ASIC released draft updates to INFO 225 on 4 December. Industry participants have until 28 February 2025 to provide feedback on ASIC&rsquo;s proposed updates (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-266mr-asic-invites-feedback-on-proposed-updates-to-digital-asset-guidance/" title="24-266MR ASIC invites feedback on proposed updates to digital asset guidance">24-266MR</a>).</p>
<p>ASIC will continue to use its full range of regulatory and enforcement tools, such as guidance, licensing, compliance and enforcement action, to protect consumers and uphold market integrity in the digital asset sector.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/financial-advice/your-obligations-when-giving-financial-advice/design-and-distribution-obligations/" title="Design and distribution obligations">design and distribution obligations</a>&nbsp;(DDO) require firms to design financial products that meet the needs of consumers, and to distribute those products in a targeted manner. A target market determination is an important requirement under DDO. It is a mandatory public document that sets out the class of consumers a financial product is likely to be appropriate for (the target market) and matters relevant to the product&rsquo;s distribution and review.</p>

<title>Greater Connectivity Driving Hong Kong’s Capital Markets Forward: Hong Kong Securities And Futures Commission Quarterly Report</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/greater-connectivity-driving-hong-kongs-capital-markets-forward-hong-kong-secu/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/greater-connectivity-driving-hong-kongs-capital-markets-forward-hong-kong-secu/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Hong Kong&rsquo;s capital markets have continued to reap benefits since the third quarter from the success of Connect schemes with the Mainland and breakthroughs in Middle East market connectivity, according to the Securities and Futures Commission&rsquo;s (SFC)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/-/media/EN/files/COM/QR-Reports/202407-09/0_SFC_Quarterly-Report_JulSep2024_ENG.pdf?rev=acc29c654d094b2f887402c0d92d28e2" target="_blank">Quarterly Report</a>&nbsp;published today.</p>
<p>Marking the tenth anniversary of the scheme, the Mainland-Hong Kong Stock Connect had notched up strong net southbound inflows up to end-November, amounting to RMB664.3 billion year-to-date and RMB3.2 trillion cumulatively. Driving the growth of the city&rsquo;s exchange-traded fund (ETF) market, the enhanced ETF Connect boosted the number of eligible Hong Kong ETFs to 16 with a total market capitalisation of more than $300 billion (Note 1).</p>
<p>Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect scheme recorded a more than 60% increase in southbound investment since its February enhancement. Under the Mainland-Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds scheme, net subscriptions for Hong Kong funds amounted to RMB8.8 billion for the quarter. Swap Connect &ndash; the first derivative market connect &ndash; saw active investor participation, with daily transactions of renminbi interest rate swaps averaging RMB10 billion.</p>
<p>Connectivity with the broader Asian markets also made strides with the landmark cross-listing of two Hong Kong ETFs on the Saudi exchange. Being the largest in the Saudi ETF market with a combined market capitalisation exceeding US$1.6 billion upon listing, the two feeder ETFs have been trading actively since their listing in late October.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our ETF market has achieved new milestones this year with continued robust growth in eligible ETFs under the Connect scheme and with new connectivity to the Middle East,&rdquo; said Ms Julia Leung, the SFC&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going forward, with broadening mutual market access with the Mainland, the SFC will strive to elevate Hong Kong to a global hub for multi-asset investing and offshore renminbi fixed-income business,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>Other highlights in the quarterly report included:</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hong Kong&rsquo;s ETF market continued to grow, with the market capitalisation of ETFs up 34% year-on-year (YoY) (Note 2). They recorded net inflows of $6.3 billion in the quarter. Hong Kong-domiciled funds saw assets under management up 29.5% YoY to $1.67 trillion, with continued net fund inflows of about $34 billion in the quarter. The number of licensed asset managers jumped 24% YoY, while the number of open-ended fund companies also surged 132.6% YoY.</p>
<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The numbers of both corporate and individual licence applications received by the SFC increased in the quarter, up 56% and 23% YoY, respectively.</p>
<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SFC is reviewing 15 licence applications from virtual asset (VA) trading platforms (11 deemed to be licensed), and is on track to license a few deemed operators this year under a swift licensing process. The market capitalisation of Asia&rsquo;s first batch of VA spot ETFs listed in Hong Kong was up more than 70% with average daily turnover doubling from their launch in April to late November.</p>
<p>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A number of leading Mainland enterprises went public through IPOs in Hong Kong after the Mainland announced support measures in April. With the SFC&rsquo;s approval, the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong streamlined the new listing vetting procedure. All market operations under severe weather trading were smooth on 14 November.</p>
<p>e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Court of First Instance handed down the heaviest jail sentence on market manipulation cases since the Securities and Futures Ordinance took effect. Besides, the District Court has set the next hearing date for three large ramp-and-dump cases involving suspected securities-related fraud and money laundering following joint&nbsp;investigations by the SFC and the Police.</p>
<p>The quarterly report is available on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/Published-resources/Corporate-publications/Quarterly-report" target="_blank">SFC website</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notes:</p>

<li>Unless otherwise specified, figures are as of end-September 2024.</li>
<li>The number of ETFs includes leveraged and inverse products.</li>

<div>
<p class="component-text">Tokyo Commodity Exchange, Inc. (TOCOM) has made an agreement to partner with the Tokyo Metropolitan Government (Tokyo MG) on its project for trial trading of green hydrogen. TOCOM will carry out said trial trading in collaboration with the Tokyo MG this December.<br /><br />The Japanese government is actively considering how hydrogen can be utilized as an important energy source on the road to carbon neutrality by 2050, including its formulation of a Basic Hydrogen Strategy. The Tokyo MG has also positioned green hydrogen, which is obtained through the use of renewable energy, as a key to decarbonization and is working to expand its use accordingly. As part of this, TOCOM supports the idea of building a hydrogen exchange as being considered by the Tokyo MG and would like to contribute to this. It will therefore utilize the expertise in market operations held by JPX Group to collaborate with the Tokyo MG to build the project's rule framework and operate the market.<br /><br />JPX has launched a dedicated page for the green hydrogen trial trading project (in Japanese only) on 29 November 2024 and will continue to update this page with the latest information.</p>

<title>Supporting Superior Projects With Better Treatment, The Shanghai Stock Exchange Creates A New Ecology For The REITs Market To Promote The Superior And Limit The Inferior</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The SSE continues to promote the construction of key mechanisms for listed REITs, support the high-quality development of all REITs project participants who are honest and trustworthy, and have the willingness and ability to improve mechanism construction in order to spare no effort to improve project operation quality and efficiency, and actively reward investors. The SSE gives positive feedback on transparent, standardized and growing REITs projects to realize the coordinated development of both market investment and financing and promote a virtuous cycle in the entire REITs market.</p>
<p>In terms of China's practice of REITs, enterprises, especially originators, attach great importance to the construction of REITs platforms. It is understood that several REITs projects such as AVIC Jingneng Photovoltaics, JD Storage and China Resources Youchao have set the role of REITs operating officer at the level of originators, which coordinates the promotion and implementation of major issues after REITs listing from the group strategic level and provides a steady stream of resources for the development of REITs platforms.</p>
<p>In addition to the attention at the group level, the industrial party also plays a vital role in operation management. Some projects have established market-oriented incentive and restraint mechanisms that directly link the operation effectiveness of infrastructure projects with team and individual performance to fully stimulate the motivation of the operation management team.</p>
<p>The deep participation of originators and market-oriented incentive and restraint mechanisms not only play an important role in the daily operation of REITs but also contribute to the promotion of REITs fundraising expansions. Since 2024, 6 fundraising expansion announcements have been issued in terms of REITs projects in the SSE, reflecting the characteristics of asset mixing and cross-regional asset portfolio in asset screening.</p>
<p>As an open market securities product, the price discovery mechanism of REITs relies on information disclosure. At present, all parties involved pay more and more attention to the disclosure of REITs information, and an increasing number of originators and operation management agencies focus on communicating with investors.</p>
<p>For related parties such as originators who actively promote the construction of REITs mechanism, the SSE adheres to the philosophy of classified supervision to give support to all REITs participants in comprehensively applying various policies and measures, hence strengthening market demonstration and guidance, ensuring improvement, and creating long-term benefits for investors. In terms of information disclosure, the SSE simplifies the preparation of relevant materials and information disclosure arrangements to improve the pertinence and effectiveness. In terms of investment and financing matchmaking, the SSE market has built a full-chain roadshow service platform, hence enriching the communication methods and channels among all parties.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority: Millions Of People Could Get More Support With Their Pensions Under New Proposals</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-millions-of-people-could-get-more-support-with-t/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-millions-of-people-could-get-more-support-with-t/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p align="left"><span>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has set out proposals for extra support for millions of UK savers to help them make better decisions about their pensions.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<div>
<p align="left"><span>This is part of a wider review of how the boundary between advice and guidance on investments operates, which is underway to help make sure consumers are better supported.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><span>Making sure consumers can make informed investment decisions is an important part of ensuring healthy capital markets which deliver growth. The FCA aims&nbsp;</span><span>to help people have access to more help, guidance and advice across all aspects of their financial lives.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><span>More than 16 million people in the UK save for their retirement into defined contribution pension schemes.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><span>However, 75% of consumers, aged over 45, do not have a clear plan for how to take money from their pension or didn&rsquo;t know they had to make a choice. (</span><span>Financial Lives survey, 2024)</span><span>. FCA consumer research shows:</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><span>engagement by consumers with and understanding of pensions is low.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><span>the vast majority of consumers are ill-equipped to manage complex pension decisions confidently as only 9% of adults have taken full regulated advice in the last 12 months (Financial Lives Survey, 2024).</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><span>some people are disengaged because they fear knowing the reality of their pension pots - the so-called Ostrich effect -&nbsp;</span><span>worrying about whether their pension will be sufficient in retirement.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><span>Most people still lack the support needed to make critical choices about their pensions. Decisions on saving, investing and how to use their life savings are critically important, and some may struggle to make the right choice for them without help.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><span>Now the FCA has set out ways to tackle the gap that exists between bespoke financial advice and guidance &ndash; examples of existing guidance being information provided for free through&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/en/pensions-and-retirement" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MoneyHelper</a><span>, as well as by firms</span><span>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><span>Targeted support would allow firms to provide support to consumers in different scenarios, for example, if they identify someone is drawing down on their pension unsustainably, or where a consumer is facing uncertainty about how to take a retirement income. Firms would be able to provide a bespoke suggestion to specific groups of consumers who share the same characteristics. The FCA is suggesting that targeted support is provided for free.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><span>The FCA will follow with further proposals on introducing concepts of targeted support and simplified advice for other retail investments next year.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><span>This is a significant moment as the reform to the regulatory framework will set the standards for years ahead.</span><span>&nbsp;The FCA encourages feedback from all stakeholders about the proposals&nbsp;</span><span>and views are sought by mid-February 2025.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><strong>Sarah Pritchard, Executive Director of Consumers, Competition and International, at the FCA, said</strong><span>:</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p align="left"><span>&ldquo;We want people to have access to the help, guidance and advice that they need, at a cost they can afford, when they need it, so that they can make informed decisions. So, we are reviewing the boundary between guidance and advice across investments.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><span>&ldquo;We know people find pensions particularly difficult to understand, so we are deliberately starting with this to help consumers with their pension decisions.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><span>&ldquo;If we get this right, consumers will be better supported in making financial decisions. This will potentially lead to more people investing which will help provide capital necessary to stimulate economic growth.&rdquo;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><span>Alongside this, the FCA is seeking views on whether there are any other specific areas of its regulatory framework which may need to change to enable firms to better support consumers.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><span>Through a separate discussion paper the FCA is seeking views on whether further changes might be needed&nbsp;</span><span>to better support consumers such as the use of digital tools, consolidation of pension pots and the rules around Self-Invested Personal Pensions (SIPPs).</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<title>SEC Charges Ken Peterman, Former Comtech CEO, With Insider Trading In Advance Of Negative Earnings Announcement - Defendant Placed Order To Sell Company’s Securities Within Hours Of His Termination For Cause While Subject To Multiple Trading Blackouts</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced insider trading charges against Ken Peterman, the former CEO, president, and Chair of the Board of Comtech Telecommunications Corp., in connection with his sale of Comtech shares on the basis of material non-public information about Comtech&rsquo;s forthcoming negative quarterly earnings results.</p>
<p>According to the SEC complaint, Peterman allegedly received a confidential presentation detailing Comtech&rsquo;s forthcoming negative quarterly earnings results on March 4, 2024. He was allegedly informed that he was being terminated for cause eight days later, on March 12, 2024. The SEC&rsquo;s complaint alleges that a few hours after he was terminated, and while subject to two different trading blackouts, Peterman placed an order to sell Comtech stock. On March 18, 2024, Comtech reported its negative quarterly earnings, which caused its stock price to drop more than 25 percent. The complaint alleges that Peterman avoided losses of about $12,445 by trading in advance of Comtech&rsquo;s negative earnings announcement. Peterman allegedly directed his financial advisor to sell additional Comtech stock he held in a joint account, but the financial advisor was unable to complete the sale because of a trading blackout. Had the sale been completed, Peterman allegedly would have avoided additional losses of about $110,000.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no gray area when it comes to trading on the basis of material non-public information in breach of one&rsquo;s fiduciary duty. C-suite executives like the defendant, a CEO with decades of experience, know that it is illegal to use their company&rsquo;s confidential information for their own financial gain,&rdquo; said Tejal D. Shah, Associate Director of the SEC&rsquo;s New York Regional Office. &ldquo;Our action today should serve as a strong deterrent to those executives who might think about going down the same path.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, charges Peterman with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and a bar preventing Peterman from serving as an officer or director of a public company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Eastern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Peterman.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Mary Kay Dunning, Jordan Baker, and Liora Sukhatme, and it was supervised by Ms. Shah, all of the New York Regional Office, with assistance from Leigh Barrett of the Office of Investigative and Market Analytics, and Heidi Verheggen and Kathryn Paige of the Division of Risk and Economic Analysis. The litigation will be managed by Travis Hill and Ms. Dunning and supervised by Preethi Krishnamurthy, all of the New York Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI and U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Eastern District of New York.</p>

<title>US Department Of Justice: TD Bank Insider Arrested And Charged With Facilitating Money Laundering</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A former Florida-based employee of TD Bank N.A. was arrested and charged by criminal complaint yesterday for facilitating money laundering to Colombia through the financial institution.</p>
<p>According to court documents, Leonardo Ayala, 24, worked at a TD Bank store in Doral, Florida, between February and November 2023. Starting in June 2023, Ayala allegedly exploited his position as a bank employee to facilitate money laundering. As alleged, after another TD Bank employee opened accounts in the names of shell companies with nominee owners, Ayala assisted the money laundering network by issuing dozens of debit cards for the accounts in exchange for bribes. Those accounts were then allegedly used to launder millions of dollars in narcotics proceeds through cash withdrawals at ATMs in Colombia.</p>
<p>Ayala made his initial appearance yesterday in Miami federal court, and all future court proceedings will be in New Jersey. He is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p>
<p>Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department&rsquo;s Criminal Division; U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger for the District of New Jersey; Special Agent in Charge Jenifer L. Piovesan of the IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) Newark Field Office; Special Agent in Charge Denise Foster of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Caribbean Division; and Special Agent in Charge Patricia Tarasca of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG) New York Region made the announcement.</p>
<p>The IRS-CI Newark Field Office, DEA San Juan Field Office, and FDIC-OIG New York Field Office are investigating the case. The U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Southern District of Florida, IRS-CI Miami Field Office, FDIC-OIG South Florida Field Office, DEA Miami Field Office, and Morristown Police Department provided valuable assistance in the investigation.</p>
<p>Trial Attorneys D. Zachary Adams and Chelsea Rooney of the Bank Integrity Unit of the Criminal Division&rsquo;s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS) and Assistant U.S. Attorney Marko Pesce for the District of New Jersey are prosecuting the case.</p>
<p>MLARS&rsquo;s Bank Integrity Unit investigates and prosecutes banks and other financial institutions, including their officers, managers, and employees, whose actions threaten the integrity of the individual institution or the wider financial system.</p>
<p><em>An indictment is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</em></p>

<title>DTCC’s Insurance And Retirement Services Launch API Messaging Service, Delivering Real-Time Status Requests And Responses - This Service Delivers Consistent And Immediate Activity Status Messaging For Annuity Applications Through The Application Process Across Platforms And Planning Tools</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>he Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the premier post-trade market infrastructure for the global financial services industry, today announced the launch of Insurance &amp; Retirement Services (I&amp;RS) Activity Status Tracking (ACT), a real-time status request and response API messaging service, increasing efficiency, streamlining processes and mitigating risk by centralizing the status messaging.</p>
<p>The new API messaging service delivers consistent and immediate activity status messaging for annuity applications, regardless of their submission method, through the application process across platforms and planning tools, eliminating multiple endpoints and connectivity. The launch of the new API messaging service follows two prior enhancements to messaging capabilities, including Producer Authorization and Paperless Replacements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are pleased to offer a centralized, digitalized method to manage status messaging with DTCC&rsquo;s ACT service as the third of the three advanced API capabilities that we promised the industry and delivered in conjunction with IRI&rsquo;s Digital First for Annuities initiative. This service demonstrates our dedication to modernization efforts that improve the client experience, deliver increased value and offer greater access to critical transaction data,&rdquo; said Justin Schwartz, Executive Director, Product Management for Wealth Management Services at DTCC.</p>
<p>ACT continually supports real-time activity status messaging using APIs, offering a single implementation across companies and providing governance. Carriers and distributors can digitally track annuity applications and specific statuses throughout the underwriting stages, including suitability, document review, producer credentials and funding, using ACT&rsquo;s standardized communication capabilities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Overseeing the statuses of new annuity business can be difficult and inefficient, with many communications existing across multiple mediums. ACT offers a new way for distributors to keep track of activity status messaging by requesting statuses for all activity, increasing operational efficiencies across the insurance industry,&rdquo; said Jeanann Smith, Director, Product Management for Insurance and Retirement Services at DTCC.</p>
<p>ACT offers a single implementation across all carriers and distributors, providing flexible data access options on demand, and APIs. The new API will be part of the IIEX API Library and is available to firms that are members of DTCC&rsquo;s National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC).</p>

<div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item">
<p><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced U.S. District Court, Central District of California, issued a consent order against&nbsp;<span>Marco A. Ruiz Ochoa</span>&nbsp;of Nashua, New Hampshire, and an order of default judgment on Oct. 21, against&nbsp;<span>David Carmona&nbsp;</span>formerly of Elmhurst, New York<span>,&nbsp;Juan Arellano Parra&nbsp;</span>formerly of Chino, California,<span>&nbsp;Moses Valdez&nbsp;</span>of Hesperia, California, and&nbsp;<span>David Brend&nbsp;</span>of Tampa, Florida.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The orders stem from the CFTC&rsquo;s May 24, 2023, complaint charging the defendants, jointly doing business as&nbsp;<span>Icomtech</span>, with fraud in connection with their digital asset scheme and misappropriation. [See CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8706-23">8706-23</a>].</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The default judgment order finds Carmona, Arellano, Valdez and Brend liable for all violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations alleged in the complaint including that they fraudulently solicited over $1 million from 190 individuals in the U.S. and other countries to supposedly trade bitcoin and other digital asset commodities for them, and for misappropriating customer funds. They are required to pay jointly and severally over $1 million in restitution to defrauded customers and to each pay a $1 million civil monetary penalty. The default judgment order also permanently enjoins them from engaging in conduct that violates the CEA, as charged, and permanently bans them from registering with the CFTC and from trading in any CFTC-regulated markets.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The consent order finds, and Ochoa admits, that Ochoa engaged in the fraud scheme with the other defendants. and requires him to pay jointly and severally with the other defendants over $1 million in restitution to defrauded customers. The consent order also imposes a permanent injunction and permanent trading, solicitation, and registration bans against Ochoa.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The court&rsquo;s orders resolve the CFTC&rsquo;s enforcement action against the defendants.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Case Background</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The default judgment order against the four defendants and consent order against Ochoa both find&nbsp;that from approximately August 2018 through December 2019, to get actual and prospective customers to give them money, the defendants and other Icomtech agents falsely represented they would use the money to trade Bitcoin and other digital asset commodities for the customers; that Icomtech would provide &ldquo;daily returns&rdquo; of between 0.9% to 2.8% on the customers&rsquo; money from trading; and Icomtech would double the customers&rsquo; money within eight months. The default judgment order and consent order also find the defendants did not trade Bitcoin or other digital asset commodities for the customers as they said, and did not earn daily returns nor double the customers&rsquo; investments based on trading. Instead, the defendants misappropriated the customer funds, and some customers lost all their money.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Parallel Criminal Action</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>On Oct.13, 2022, the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office, Southern District of New York, unsealed an indictment charging the defendants with wire fraud in connection with a much larger scheme, of which the Icomtech scheme the Commission charged was a subset.&nbsp;<i>United States v. Carmona,&nbsp;</i>1:22-cr-00551-JLR (S.D.N.Y October 13, 2022), ECF No. 2 (indictment).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>As a result of that indictment, Carmona and Ochoa pled guilty to the wire fraud charges. Arellano pled guilty to superseding indictment for wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. After a jury trial, Brend was found guilty of wire fraud. The indictment against Valdez for wire fraud, has yet to be resolved.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In criminal judgments, Carmona was sentenced to 10 years in prison, three years of supervised release, and forfeited over $329,450; Ochoa was sentenced to five years in prison, two years of supervised release, and forfeited $914,000.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina issued an order for summary judgment and a permanent injunction against&nbsp;<span>Storm Bryant</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span>Elijah Bryant III</span>, formerly of Raleigh, North Carolina and Los Angeles, and&nbsp;<span>CapitalStorm LLC, GenerationBlack LLC</span>, and<span>&nbsp;Ncome LLC</span>, all North Carolina limited liability companies, on charges the defendants operated a fraudulent foreign currency scheme, misappropriated over $1.9 million in client funds and committed related registration violations.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The court&rsquo;s order permanently bans Storm Bryant, Elijah Bryant, and their three related companies from trading in any CFTC-regulated markets and registering with the CFTC. It also requires them to pay, jointly and severally, $1.3 million in restitution to their victims and a $3.9 million civil monetary penalty in connection with a fraudulent forex scheme.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The order finds from March 2018 to September 2021, the three LLCs acted as commodity trading advisors without being registered with the CFTC, mishandled client funds and failed to keep and maintain books and records as required by CTAs; and Storm and Elijah Bryant acted as associated persons of a CTA without being registered with the CFTC as required.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The court&rsquo;s order resolves the CFTC&rsquo;s enforcement action against Storm Bryant, Elijah Bryant, Capital Storm LLC, Generation Black LLC, and Ncome LLC.&nbsp; [See CFTC Press Release&nbsp;</span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8446-21"><span>8446-21</span></a></span><span>]</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Case Background</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The order stems from a CFTC complaint filed Sept.15, 2021, and finds during the&nbsp;</span><span>relevant period, the Bryants, individually and through their three LLCs, solicited clients who were not eligible contract participants, to engage in retail transactions in off-exchange forex on a leveraged, margined, or financed basis. The defendants received over $1.9 million from 233 clients, all of which they misappropriated. The defendants sent nearly $664,000 back to clients as withdrawals of principal or purported forex trading &ldquo;profits&rdquo; in the manner of a Ponzi scheme.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The order finds the defendants made material misrepresentations and omissions to induce clients into depositing money, including statements regarding how clients&rsquo; funds would be used to open trading accounts; defendants&rsquo; success, performance, and generous returns; and defendants&rsquo; ability to lawfully trade for anyone. They also failed to disclose they never opened accounts for their clients; they did not conduct trading for clients; the trading accounts clients viewed were demos; and neither the corporate defendants nor the Bryants were registered with the CFTC. They misappropriated the funds they received in the scheme by depositing the money into personal accounts to support their lavish lifestyle.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The order also finds the Bryants controlled all three LLCs and knowingly induced the underlying violations or failed to act in good faith and are therefore liable for the violations as controlling persons.&nbsp;</span><span>The court&rsquo;s order lifts a previous 2021 injunction to freeze the defendants&rsquo; assets, for the limited purpose of transferring such assets up to the amount owed to satisfy the defendants&rsquo; restitution and civil monetary penalty obligations.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The CFTC cautions victims that an order of repayment may not result in the recovery of any money because the wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Western District of North Carolina and the North Carolina Office of the Secretary of State, Securities Division.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this case are Timothy J. Mulreany, George H. Malas, Kassra Goudarzi, Paul G. Hayeck, and former staff member Hillary Van Tassel.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>CFTC&rsquo;s Forex Fraud Advisory</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The CFTC has issued several customer protection&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/learnandprotect/learningresources"><span>fraud advisories and articles</span></a></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;that provide the warning signs of fraud, including the&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/ConsumerProtection/FraudAwarenessPrevention/CFTCFraudAdvisories/fraudadv_forex.html"><span>Foreign Currency Trading (Forex) Fraud Advisory</span></a></span><span><span><span>, which alerts customers to forex fraud and lists simple ways to spot forex scams.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The CFTC also urges the public to verify an individual or company&rsquo;s registration at&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/Exit/index.htm?http://www.nfa.futures.org/basicnet" target="_blank"><span>NFA BASIC</span></a></span>&nbsp;<span><span><span>before investing funds. Customers should be wary of providing funds to any unregistered entity.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Suspicious activities or information, such as possible violations of commodity trading laws, should be reported to the Division of Enforcement via a toll-free hotline 866-FON-CFTC (866-366-2382),&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/complaint"><span>file a tip or complaint online</span></a></span><span><span><span>, or contact the&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><a href="https://www.whistleblower.gov/"><span>Whistleblower Office</span></a></span><span><span><span>. Whistleblowers are eligible to receive between 10 and 30 percent of the monetary sanctions collected, paid from the Customer Protection Fund financed through monetary sanctions paid to the CFTC by violators of the CEA.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ontario-securities-commission-publishes-exempt-market-activity-dashboard/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) today published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/industry/companies/selling-securities-ontario/exempt-market/ontario-exempt-market-dashboard">dashboard of exempt market data</a>&nbsp;on capital raising activity by Canadian corporate (non-investment fund) issuers in Ontario&rsquo;s exempt market.</p>
<p>This new dashboard format provides an overview of prospectus-exempt distributions by corporate issuers headquartered in Canada that raised capital from Ontario investors between 2018 and 2023.</p>
<p>About the dashboard:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focuses on capital formation activity by Canadian issuers in Ontario&rsquo;s exempt market.</li>
<li>Highlights trends in capital raising activity across multiple parameters such as exemption type, issuer sector, and issuer headquarters.</li>
<li>Dynamic format allows for more timely updates and users to personalize search parameters and dashboards based on user needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The dashboard does not include information about prospectus exempt distributions made by foreign issuers in Ontario&rsquo;s exempt market. OSC staff are reviewing the Coordinated Blanket Order 13-933 &ndash;&nbsp;<em>Temporary exemption from the requirement to transmit a report of exempt distribution through SEDAR+ in connection with distributions of eligible foreign securities to permitted clients,</em>&nbsp;which expires in January 2025. We will provide an update prior to the expiration of the blanket order.</p>
<p>The mandate of the OSC is to provide protection to investors from unfair, improper or fraudulent practices, to foster fair, efficient and competitive capital markets and confidence in the capital markets, to foster capital formation, and to contribute to the stability of the financial system and the reduction of systemic risk. Investors are urged to check the registration of any persons or company offering an investment opportunity and to review the OSC investor materials available at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.osc.ca/">http://www.osc.ca</a>.</p>

In addition, ESMA, together with the European Commission and the European Central Bank, hosted a first meeting with industry representatives to discuss setting up a governance structure.

<title>SEC Charges Three Individuals With Impersonating Financial Professionals In Fraud Scheme Targeting Retail Investors</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Chibuzo Augustine Onyeachonam, Stanley Chidubem Asiegbu, and Chukwuebuka Martin Nweke-Eze with fraud for impersonating legitimate securities brokers and investment advisers in an elaborate online scheme through which the defendants stole more than $2.9 million from at least 28 investors.</p>
<p>As alleged in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, from at least 2019 to the present, the three defendants, who reside in Nigeria, created websites impersonating nearly two dozen actual securities brokers and investment adviser representatives (collectively, representatives) at well-known U.S. securities firms as part of a fraudulent scheme to entice potential investors in the United States to invest funds with the defendants. The defendants allegedly lured investors to the websites by placing fictitious comments from purported clients on social media and in investment group chats praising the representatives&rsquo; trading success. The SEC&rsquo;s complaint alleges that the defendants promised monthly returns of up to 25 percent and directed investors to fake online investment platforms they created to make investors think their portfolios were increasing in value. In addition, according to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendants purchased voice changing software to talk to investors, as most of the impersonated professionals were women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s charges highlight how fraudsters can manipulate online information and use technology to gain trust with investors,&rdquo; said Sanjay Wadhwa, Acting Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;We caution the investing public to be on heightened alert when investing with someone who is soliciting investments through social media, even if that person appears to be a financial industry professional.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, charges Onyeachonam, Asiegbu, and Nweke-Eze with violating the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Exchange Act of 1934, and charges Onyeachonam and Asiegbu with violating the anti-fraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, conduct-based injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against all defendants.</p>
<p>In a parallel action, the United States Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the District of New Jersey announced criminal charges against Onyeachonam, Asiegbu, and Nweke-Eze.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, in collaboration with the FBI&rsquo;s Criminal Investigative Division, has issued an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-alerts/beware-fraudsters-impersonating-investment-professionals-and-firms-investor-alert">investor alert</a>&nbsp;about impersonation scams, with tips on how investors can protect themselves.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation is being conducted by Elizabeth Doisy and Mike Kerrane of the SEC&rsquo;s Home Office, Martin Zerwitz, Nicholas Bohmann, and Deborah A. Tarasevich of the Enforcement Division&rsquo;s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit, and Rhonda Jung, and Adam S. Grace of the SEC&rsquo;s New York Regional Office, with assistance from David R. Karasik, Owen A. Granke, and Marlee Miller in the Office of International Affairs, and Kenneth Zavos and Jennifer Ross of the Home Office. The case has been supervised by Tejal D. Shah, Jorge G. Tenreiro, and Stacy L. Bogert. The litigation is being conducted by Travis Hill and supervised by Preethi Krishnamurthy of the New York Regional Office.</p>
<p>The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI and the United States Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the District of New Jersey, as well as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services, the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, the Central Bank of Ireland, the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission, the Israel Securities Authority, the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority, the Central Bank of Lithuania, the Financial Supervisory Commission of Taiwan, the Financial Services Commission of the Republic of Korea, and the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><i>Extended collaboration enables seamlessly connected ecosystem uniting the very best in digital fintech experiences for consumers and small businesses</i></p>
<p><a href="https://www.fiserv.com/" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Fiserv, Inc.</a>&nbsp;(NYSE: FI), a leading global provider of payments and financial services technology, today announced an expanded relationship with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cocc.com/" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">COCC</a>, a client-owned fintech serving over 200 community banks and credit unions. This collaboration delivers industry-leading digital banking solutions powered by Experience Digital (XD) from Fiserv, paving the way for continuous innovation to transform the standard of financial services and empowering COCC&rsquo;s community of financial institutions to stand at the forefront of technology for their customers.</p>
<p>Together, Fiserv and COCC are setting a new standard of excellence in the digital banking landscape. XD delivers a seamless, connected digital experience powered by open banking APIs and enhanced by a suite of data-rich, intelligent tools that drive highly personalized financial experiences. Under the enhanced partnership, the platform will extend to the cloud in a microservices architecture, enabling swift adaptability to evolving market needs. Additionally, with the goal of unlocking easy access to fintech integrations, a developer studio will facilitate the creation of custom experiences made available in an app market.</p>
<p>Despite consumers&rsquo; growing demand for digital experiences that delight them, a recent survey by Javelin Strategy &amp; Research of more than 10,000 U.S. consumers found that 30% of dissatisfied mobile banking users said they were unsure why or how to use many of the features in their banks&rsquo; apps, and 28% said it is difficult to find what they need through mobile banking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s imperative for financial institutions to continue investing in digital banking and offer their clients the best possible digital banking experience,&rdquo; said Jacob Jegher, President at Javelin. &ldquo;Digital banking is a critical driver of customer satisfaction and banks of all sizes need to differentiate in a crowded and competitive playing field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bar is set by consumers and businesses&rsquo; best digital experience &mdash; likely on a mobile phone. This challenges financial institutions to accelerate digital innovation, unlocking the opportunities digital banking can provide,&rdquo; said Whitney Russell, President of Digital and Financial Solutions at Fiserv. &ldquo;Our partners at COCC maintain a commitment to enabling success through enhanced digital banking, and together we look forward to providing their clients access to a wide range of experiences that meet tomorrow&rsquo;s digital expectations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re thrilled to further strengthen our partnership and co-development arrangement with Fiserv as COCC joins them on the journey to deliver the latest cutting-edge, cloud-native digital banking platform,&rdquo; said Matt L&rsquo;Heureux, Senior Vice President and Chief Innovation Officer at COCC. &ldquo;Their innovative approach aligns perfectly with our vision to continue to enable our clients to remain competitive with a tech-forward, seamless, secure and future-ready experience that attracts and retains consumers and businesses alike.&rdquo;</p>

<title>ICE Midland WTI (HOU) Reaches Record Open Interest And Delivers A Record 20 Million Barrels Of Midland WTI Crude During November</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ice-midland-wti-hou-reaches-record-open-interest-and-delivers-a-record-20-mill/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced that its ICE Midland WTI (ICE:HOU) crude futures reached record open interest of 160,600 contracts on November 20, 2024, up over 130% year-over-year (y/y).</p>
<p>Since launch, HOU has grown into a widely accepted benchmark price for Midland-origin and Midland-quality crude. A record 20 million barrels of Midland WTI crude were delivered through the exchange settlement for HOU and via EFPs (Exchange for Physicals) in November, the highest delivery month to date. EFPs provide customers with the flexibility to deliver barrels to different locations, as well as flexible delivery dates.</p>
<p>In a significant endorsement of HOU as the price of Midland crude, Continental Resources recently announced that it has switched a portion of its Permian production to price off of HOU, replacing a differential to WTI Cushing. In recognition of HOU's establishment within Midland WTI pricing, Platts, part of S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights,&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span>has proposed to launch a daily price assessment of Midland WTI crude as a differential to HOU, effective January 22, 2025. This follows General Index&rsquo;s launch of a full suite of all North American Crude grades priced as differentials to HOU, also replacing WTI Cushing as a benchmark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Each of these milestones are critical elements of establishing a new crude benchmark,&rdquo; said Jeff Barbuto, Global Head of Oil Markets at ICE. &ldquo;We appreciate all of the work and support of our partners and customers in developing this physically deliverable benchmark for crude oil in the U.S. Gulf Coast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ICE HOU pricing reflects current fundamentals in Houston, delivering physical crude into two of the biggest crude oil systems on the U.S. Gulf Coast, the ONEOK Magellan East Houston (MEH) and Enterprise Crude Houston (ECHO) terminals. Both are connected to Platts-approved water terminals to deliver Midland WTI into Brent. HOU is the only exchange-guaranteed source of ratably deliverable Midland WTI, with the quality spec of HOU matching the Platts spec for Midland WTI.</p>
<p>ICE offers HOU time spreads, as well as inter-commodity spreads with Brent and WTI Cushing (Domestic Light Sweet) to help customers mitigate price risk between locations and grades. Meanwhile, customers can benefit from margin offsets as high as 98% when clearing HOU alongside other oil positions cleared at ICE. Offsets are available across a range of over 800 oil contracts, including ICE Brent, ICE Gasoil, ICE WTI (Cushing), ICE Dubai (Platts), and ICE Murban, as well as NY Harbor RBOB Gasoline and Heating Oil.</p>
<p>Across ICE&rsquo;s global oil complex, open interest stands at 14.3 million contracts, up approximately 20% y/y. Alongside record highs in HOU, ICE&rsquo;s broader oil futures markets hit record open interest of 9.5 million contracts on November 28, 2024. Oil is one part of ICE&rsquo;s extensive global commodity markets where open interest stands at 63.8 million contracts, up over 10% y/y.</p>

<p>ACER has released its&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsAUw4DA1ABV0wAVAxTHVYBDQcdUwBVVhpWUwMCVQQHB1IGB1AdUVwHBwkHUVEdW1pTUx0GDVMEGg0DCgMZAVdSVFBTB1QDU1QCRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Opinion</a>&nbsp;on the recent decisions to grant a temporary exemption for the STORK I pipeline.

However, temporary exemptions can be granted following a detailed assessment and consultations with stakeholders, other Member States, and the European Commission.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ACER&rsquo;s assessment</span></p>
<p>ACER reviewed the coordinated decisions taken by the Czech and Polish responsible Ministries. Both decisions accept the respective TSOs&rsquo; proposals to grant the temporary exemption until the end of 2025. &nbsp;</p>
<p>ACER notes that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The exemption complies with regulatory requirements.</li>
<li>The reverse gas flow project at this IP is unlikely to significantly improve gas supply security in the Czech Republic. However, enabling reverse flow could offer benefits, such as improved access to Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) supplies from Poland.</li>
<li>A market assessment by the project promoters shows no interest in developing transportation capacity from Poland to the Czech Republic.</li>
<li>The exemption (valid until December 2025) allows more time to evaluate the project's necessity and feasibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>ACER also recommends project promoters to reassess the project before the exemption expires, with the aim of improving security of gas supply.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the next steps?</span></p>
<p>ACER has submitted its Opinion to the relevant authorities of the Czech Republic and Poland, as well as to the European Commission for further consideration.</p>

<li>&nbsp;BCX commenced its continuous trading service offering of Gold Standard carbon credits from 2 December 2024&nbsp;</li>
<li>Bursa Malaysia encourages corporates to onboard onto BCX to prepare for their sustainability reporting</li>
</ul>
<p>Bursa Carbon Exchange (&ldquo;BCX&rdquo;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bursa Malaysia Berhad (&ldquo;Bursa Malaysia&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Exchange&rdquo;), is pleased to announce the go-live trading of Gold Standard carbon credits since 2 December 2024. This milestone follows the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed with Gold Standard at COP28 in Dubai last year, aimed at enhancing Malaysia&rsquo;s voluntary carbon market landscape.</p>
<p>Gold Standard is an internationally recognised standard setter and issuer of carbon credits, recorded and tracked on the Gold Standard Impact Registry. The addition of Gold Standard carbon credits complements BCX&rsquo;s existing suite of offerings - carbon credits from Verra, and I-REC (E) for renewable energy certificates (RECs).</p>
<p>"We are pleased to expand our product offerings with the inclusion of Gold Standard carbon credits," said Datuk Muhamad Umar Swift, Chief Executive Officer of Bursa Malaysia. &ldquo;The adoption of both leading independent carbon standards - Verra and Gold Standard - on BCX, underscores our commitment to broadening our marketplace to include carbon projects registered with these globally-recognised standards, thereby facilitating access to a wider range of carbon credits, while building the ecosystem,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>As part of the aforementioned MOU signed, Gold Standard will next, among other activities, work with Bursa Malaysia to support capacity building for local project developers and encourage the development of validation and verification bodies, for the implementation of carbon projects in the Malaysian market.</p>
<p>To support this latest offering, all relevant documentation, including the Voluntary Carbon Market Handbook will be updated in stages and made available on the BCX website by the end of January 2025.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the Exchange&rsquo;s role in supporting the adoption of multi-faceted ways to stepup the embodiment of sustainability across the Malaysian capital market, it continuously encourages corporates to onboard onto BCX. This ensures companies are ready to execute their emissions reduction plans and targets, and are well-prepared for their sustainability reporting.&nbsp;</p>

<title>FSB Notes Significant Progress In Monitoring, Regulating And Supervising Crypto-Asset Activities In France</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><span>Peer review highlights significant progress by the French authorities to enhance the monitoring, regulation and supervision of crypto-asset markets in recent years.</span></li>
<li><span>France&rsquo;s PACTE Law has successfully brought most of crypto activities within the regulatory perimeter.</span></li>
<li><span>Review recommends further steps to facilitate the transition to the EU MiCAR regime, strengthen enforcement and promote cross-border cooperation and information sharing.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) today published its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/12/peer-review-of-france-2/">Peer Review of France</a>, examining France&rsquo;s regulation and supervision of crypto-asset activities.</p>
<p>The French authorities have made significant progress in monitoring, regulating and supervising crypto-assets in recent years. They successfully brought a large part of the crypto-asset market into the regulatory perimeter through the 2019 Action Plan for Business Growth and Transformation (PACTE Law). The PACTE Law introduced registration and licensing regimes for digital asset service providers, enabled authorities to build up their regulatory expertise in crypto-assets, and fostered regulatory literacy and awareness for the industry.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these achievements, the review notes further steps can be taken to strengthen the regulatory framework for crypto-assets and stablecoins. These include: facilitating a smooth transition to the European Union&rsquo;s Markets in Crypto-Asset Regulation (MiCAR); strengthening enforcement efforts; and promoting cross-border cooperation and information sharing. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ryozo Himino, Chair of the FSB&rsquo;s Standing Committee on Standards Implementation (SCSI) that oversaw the preparation of the peer review said: &ldquo;Regulatory authorities around the world are in the process of implementing the FSB&rsquo;s 2023 regulatory framework for crypto-asset activities. The French authorities&rsquo; experience in introducing and adjusting their framework for crypto-assets and stablecoins will give those authorities invaluable insights on possible implementation challenges and ways to address them.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h2>
<p>The peer review focused on French authorities&rsquo; steps to implement reforms for the regulation and supervision of crypto-asset activities. It also took into account the recent adoption of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/07/fsb-global-regulatory-framework-for-crypto-asset-activities/">FSB&rsquo;s high-level recommendations for the regulation, supervision, and oversight of crypto-asset activities and markets and global stablecoin arrangements</a>, and France&rsquo;s ongoing transition to the European Union&rsquo;s Markets in Crypto-Asset Regulation (MiCAR).</p>
<p>The report was prepared by a team of experts from FSB member institutions and led by Emily Shepperd, Chief Operating Officer and Executive Director, Authorisations, Financial Conduct Authority, United Kingdom. The review benefited from dialogue with the French authorities and market participants as well as the FSB&rsquo;s Standing Committee on Standards Implementation (SCSI).</p>
<p>FSB member jurisdictions have committed to undergo periodic peer reviews to evaluate their adherence to international financial standards. To fulfil this responsibility, the FSB has established a regular programme of country and thematic peer reviews of its member jurisdictions. As part of this commitment, France volunteered to undergo a peer review in 2023-2024. A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/about/leading-by-example/">schedule of country peer reviews</a>, as well as all completed peer review reports, are available on the FSB website.</p>
<p>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. The FSB also conducts outreach with approximately 70 other jurisdictions through its six Regional Consultative Groups.</p>
<p>The FSB is chaired by Klaas Knot, President of De Nederlandsche Bank. The FSB Secretariat is located in Basel, Switzerland and hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>

<title>BNP Paribas Asset Management 2025 Market Outlook</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bnp-paribas-asset-management-2025-market-outlook/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bnp-paribas-asset-management-2025-market-outlook/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li><strong>US soft-landing in focus as we head into the new year</strong></li>
<li><strong>Broadening of market likely</strong></li>
<li><strong>AI and Healthcare sectors potentially primed to benefit next year</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Market outlook &ndash; Daniel Morris, Chief Market Strategist at BNPP AM:</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;The Republican sweep of the US election is likely to boost equity markets, particularly those in the US, if the pattern of the first Trump administration is any guide. The risks are that either growth accelerates too much and the US economy overheats, or that large tax cuts prompt a negative reaction from the bond market. We will have to wait until there is more clarity, not only on policy proposals but also on what can actually be implemented.</p>
<p>Aside from political developments, developed market central banks are cutting policy rates. This should boost both equities &ndash; as shorter-term financing costs fall &ndash; and fixed income, as the policy rate component of bond yields declines. Of course, anticipating the reaction of markets is not so simple as that because the other, arguably more important, factor driving asset prices is economic growth.</p>
<p>Investors should initially be circumspect in anticipating positive equity returns during a rate-cutting cycle given that four out of the last five such cycles in the US coincided with a recession. Not surprisingly, the onset of a recession led to negative returns in equities.</p>
<p>The critical consideration in anticipating returns for next year is whether or not 2025 will be exceptional in not having a recession.</p>
<p>The consensus view has been that the US will indeed see a soft landing &ndash; that growth will slow but remain positive as inflation moves back towards the Fed&rsquo;s 2% target. Europe has already had a slowdown, but we believe 2025 should see a very modest rebound. Positive economic growth would be supportive for equity markets and earnings, leading to price gains in the year ahead.</p>
<p>Our regional preference remains the US. Next year, the returns distribution is expected to be more balanced, even if NASDAQ growth earnings are still superior.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>2025 geopolitical landscape outlook - Richard Barwell, Head of Macro Research at BNPP AM:</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone has a laser-like focus on what the incoming White House occupant will do. But we are interested in a broader picture - the secular geopolitical trend &ndash; the multi-faceted, cross-country negation of many aspects of the neo-liberal order, with the retreat from globalisation, the return of tariffs and industrial policy and the looming political challenge to the unelected power of technocrats and market power of massive corporations. As well as the decline of multilateralism and a comeback for great power competition.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Is now the time to consider US Small Caps? Geoff Dailey &ndash; Head of US Equities, Senior Portfolio Manager at BNPP AM:</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;US Small Cap stocks are poised to benefit from continued US economic strength.&nbsp; The new administration is pro-growth. In particular, pro-domestic policies should be an additional tailwind to these US oriented companies. US Small cap stocks are also prime beneficiaries of the expected revival of mergers and acquisitions activity in &rsquo;25 and beyond.</p>
<p>Another element to consider is that US Small cap stocks are highly levered to the domestic capital spending generated by reshoring, AI growth, and electrification.</p>
<p>Ultimately, US small caps are an inefficient, diverse asset class, ripe for alpha generation from rigorous fundamental analysis by sector experts.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Broader exposure will be key in asset allocation - Claire Mehu, Head of Balanced Solutions at BNPP AM:</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;The combination of moderate growth (without recession) and&nbsp;central banks rate cutting cycle remains positive for risky assets. However, divergences are emerging between regions in terms of growth/ inflation/central banks and will increase in 2025. So will dispersion. 2025 will probably be more a cross-sectional market more than a directional market.&nbsp;Broadening of our exposures within asset classes will be key as well as diversification.</p>
<p>We remain long US technology stocks but have started to broaden our exposures towards S&amp;P 500 Equally weighted index, resulting in more exposure to cyclicals and industrials stocks.</p>
<p>Gold should keep on shining, benefiting from steady demand of emerging countries&rsquo; central banks.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Healthcare a compelling sector next year &ndash; Jon Stephenson, Senior Portfolio Manager at BNPP AM:</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;The setup for healthcare equities is highly compelling. Robust innovation is resulting in a steady stream of new drug and device approvals, while M&amp;A activity seems poised to remain strong as the largest companies seek to prevent revenue growth deceleration. With the sector valuations depressed due in part to post-election regulatory concerns, which we believe are overblown, the outlook for healthcare stocks is compelling.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>AI momentum to continue - Pamela Hegarty, Senior Portfolio Manager at BNPP AM:</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Artificial Intelligence is becoming pervasive.&nbsp; There will continue to be momentum behind the theme, with a broadening of the &lsquo;winners&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Mag 7 leadership may lose edge - Christian Fay, Lead Manager of the BNP Paribas US Growth Fund at BNPP AM:</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;We believe growth as an asset class will continue to work into 2025 as these companies are among the best in the world, with innovative and disruptive products and services, best-in-class management teams and tremendous cash flow generation and capital allocation. We believe leadership will likely change away from Mag 7 and mega-cap tech to some degree and will shift towards high quality beneficiaries of AI and astounding cap ex spending in other sectors like healthcare, industrials and areas of consumer.&rdquo;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Credit Guarantee Corporation Malaysia Berhad (CGC Group) and CGC Digital Sdn. Bhd. to enhance access for Malaysian micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) and mid-tier companies (MTC) to capital market financing solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The three-year MoU aligns with the SC&rsquo;s 5-Year Roadmap to catalyse MSME and MTC access to the capital market (2024-2028). By collaborating with CGC Group, this initiative leverages CGC Group&rsquo;s expertise in financing guarantees and its established network in the MSME sector.&nbsp;</p>

The platform matches MSMEs and MTCs with Peer-to-Peer Financing (P2P) operators. The MoU aims to further expand this access by onboarding more P2P operators. Currently the platform offers products from six P2P operators.</li>
<li>Supporting MSME and MTCs&rsquo; de-risking of investments by providing credit guarantees, and extending credit guarantees to additional capital market solutions.

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority Cancels Auditor’s Licence To Carry Out FMC Audits For Multiple Failures</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-cancels-auditors-licence-to-carry-out-f/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-cancels-auditors-licence-to-carry-out-f/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; has cancelled the New Zealand licence of Sydney based auditor, Mr Sam Danieli, to carry out FMC audits in New Zealand. Mr Danieli&rsquo;s licence was issued by the FMA under the Auditor Regulation Act 2011 (the AR Act). New Zealand allows recognition of Australian based auditors under the Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition Act 1997 (the TTMRA).</p>
<p>The decisions stem from the audit of former FMC reporting entity Alliant Perpetual&rsquo;s financial statements for the year ended 31 January 2022 (the audit). Mr Danieli conducted the audit.</p>
<p>The FMA made orders under section 78 of the AR Act cancelling Mr Danieli&rsquo;s licence for multiple failures relating to the audit. During the investigation, Mr Danieli accepted that his conduct fell below the required standard and raised arguments in mitigation which were considered by the FMA. The FMA has also ordered that Mr Danieli may not reapply for an audit licence for FMC audits in New Zealand for three years.</p>
<p>Alliant Perpetual lodged its financial statements in December 2022 along with Mr Danieli&rsquo;s auditor&rsquo;s report. Following a review of Alliant Perpetual&rsquo;s financial statements and auditor&rsquo;s report for the year ended 31 January 2022, the FMA opened an investigation into Mr Danieli&rsquo;s conduct of the audit. The investigation found that Mr Danieli did not:</p>
<ul>
<li>Obtain sufficient evidence to support the existence and valuation of Alliant Perpetual&rsquo;s investments</li>
<li>Perform a thorough evaluation of management&rsquo;s assessment of the Alliant Perpetual as a going concern</li>
<li>Perform the audit with professional scepticism particularly when assessing the valuation of the investments</li>
<li>Take responsibility for the overall quality of the audit by completing the audit before the Engagement Quality Control Reviewer had performed an objective evaluation of the significant judgements made by the engagement team</li>
<li>Obtain external confirmation when assessing Alliant Perpetual&rsquo;s Cash at Bank</li>
<li>Obtain reasonable assurance Alliant Perpetual&rsquo;s financial statements were free from material misstatements.</li>
</ul>
<p>The FMA found that Mr Danieli also did not comply with the conditions of his licence by failing to notify the FMA that he had accepted other audit engagements which he had not previously undertaken, and by failing to provide the FMA with details of a separate review of his audit work by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC).</p>
<p>The orders have been published on the Companies Office Auditor&rsquo;s Register.</p>
<p>FMA Head of Auditing, Financial Reporting, and Climate Related Disclosures, Jacco Moison, said: &ldquo;Mr Danieli&rsquo;s conduct fell materially short of the reasonable care, diligence and skill expected and included serious breaches of auditing and assurance standards. The breaches are serious because they were systemic. Although the Investigation focused on the 2022 audit of Alliant Perpetual, the broader circumstances illustrate a poor compliance history on Mr Danieli&rsquo;s part. Poor auditing practices, especially in respect of FMC reporting entities, can cause real investor harm and erode the public&rsquo;s confidence in capital markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The FMA would like to thank ASIC for its assistance under our Memorandum of Understanding. It is important for the effectiveness of the regulation of overseas auditors licensed in New Zealand, pursuant to the TTMRA, and subject to New Zealand&rsquo;s regulatory requirements, that we work closely together as regulators to maintain audit quality in both Australia and New Zealand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alliant Perpetual</p>
<p>Alliant Perpetual was a registered building society that was struck off the register in September 2023.</p>

<title>Remarks At The Meeting Of The Investor Advisory Committee, SEC Commissioner Mark T. Uyeda, Washington D.C., Dec. 10, 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/remarks-at-the-meeting-of-the-investor-advisory-committee-sec-commissioner-mark-2/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/remarks-at-the-meeting-of-the-investor-advisory-committee-sec-commissioner-mark-2/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good morning and welcome to the final Investor Advisory Committee meeting of 2024. This year has been one of transition for the Committee. There were changes in Committee leadership, a large number of Committee members completed their terms and left the Committee, and five new Committee members were appointed. This year, the Commission reformed the IAC selection process to foster greater continuity of Committee membership by staggering terms, which is intended to limit turnover to no more than 25% in any given year.</p>
<p>I have had the privilege to work with every iteration and combination of the IAC during my career with the SEC, including its predecessor before the Dodd-Frank Act when it was an advisory committee under the Federal Advisory Committee Act. I saw the tremendous negative impact when you lose 12 or 14 members in a given year. The new committee members come in and you have to start all over again. In some ways, it reminded me of the movie&nbsp;<i>Ground Hog Day.&nbsp;</i>So, I am really pleased with these changes.</p>
<p>I give credit to our Investor Advocate Cristina Martin Firvida and her staff, Barbara Roper in the Chairman&rsquo;s office, our General Counsel&rsquo;s office, and Chair Gensler and my fellow commissioners for achieving these changes. Whether you are new to the Committee or have been a member for a number of years, thank you for your efforts and commitment.</p>
<p>Over the course of the year, the Committee has addressed a wide range of topics, and today&rsquo;s panel discussions close the loop on a topic that began at the Committee&rsquo;s first 2024 meeting in March. At that meeting, the Committee discussed the Commission&rsquo;s oversight of investment advisers and examined the growth of private markets relative to public markets. At today&rsquo;s meeting, the Committee will discuss the use and scope of mandatory arbitration clauses by investment advisers, a topic that was studied by the staff of the Office of the Investor Advocate and the Office of the Ombud in 2023, and will explore the methods by which retail investors can gain access to private market investments, such as through direct investments in registered funds.</p>
<p>I am particularly mindful of the costs associated with the use of mandatory arbitration clauses by investment advisers. The staff study states that a &ldquo;notable percentage of advisory agreements with mandatory arbitration clauses also imposed requirements on the type and/or number of arbitrators&mdash;<i>e.g</i>., requiring a panel of three arbitrators, or requiring arbitrators to be affiliated with the securities industry.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-iac-121024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;The report contrasts this practice with FINRA rules for arbitration arrangements between broker-dealers and their customers, which require panels consisting of a&nbsp;<i>single</i>&nbsp;arbitrator for disputes involving amounts under $100,000. I will be interested in hearing perspectives on whether arbitrations involving investment advisers and their clients are more costly than necessary &ndash; including due to the use of multiple arbitrators when a single arbitrator would suffice.</p>
<p>The panel on the mainstreaming of alternative assets to retail investors is particularly timely. Just last week, the&nbsp;<i>Wall Street Journal</i>&nbsp;reported that, in 2024, private companies have sold more than $6 billion in stock using a tender offer mechanism. By comparison, only $31 billion has been raised by companies in traditional IPOs.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-iac-121024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;In addition, the total number of unicorns &ndash; which are private companies with a valuation of $1 billion or more &ndash; has increased from 47 to 1,250 over the last decade.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-iac-121024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;With the increasing reporting burdens on public companies, including the politicization of annual meetings through special interest shareholder proposals, it is no surprise that the idea of becoming a public company is now less attractive.</p>
<p>Consistent with its mission to facilitate capital formation and protect investors, it is incumbent upon the Commission to foster innovation as it relates to providing retail investors with access to private markets. The use of registered funds, which are professionally managed by investment advisers subject to a fiduciary duty, is a good start. I look forward to hearing the perspectives of the panelists and Committee members as they tackle this important topic.</p>
<p>Finally, the Committee will be considering a recommendation regarding the protection of investors in their interactions with &ldquo;finfluencers.&rdquo; More individuals are turning to social media for a wide array of information, including financial information. This evolving landscape presents opportunities for individuals to be led astray, but regardless of who you are, you are still subject to the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.</p>
<p>The Commission also has authority to regulate investment advisers, which is statutorily defined as any person who, for compensation, advises others as to the value of securities or the advisability of investing in securities. The definition also captures those who, for compensation, and as part of a regular business, issue or promulgate analyses or reports concerning securities. While social media presents new potential pitfalls for investors, the Commission must be mindful of which types of conduct fall within its jurisdiction, and which ones do not.</p>
<p>If a &ldquo;finfluencer&rdquo; is an investment adviser, the full range of laws and rules that apply to investment advisers potentially apply to any advice that is promulgated through social media channels. But mere opinions expressed by individuals in an online setting do not necessarily trigger investment adviser status, so the Commission must not exert authority over conduct that does not fall within its statutory remit. Of course, the Commission is fully empowered to educate investors about emerging issues, and perhaps in this case investor education can go a long way to assisting individuals in making investment decisions that are consistent with their own interests.</p>
<p>Thank you to the Committee members and panelists for your time in preparing for this meeting. I look forward to the discussions that follow.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I am pleased to welcome back the members of the Market Risk Advisory Committee (MRAC). &nbsp;I very much appreciate your service. I also welcome our distinguished speakers today.&nbsp; I am so pleased to see Commissioner Johnson leading today&rsquo;s meeting and want to thank her for bringing us together today and for her sponsorship of MRAC.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span><i><span><span>U.S. Treasury Markets</span></span></i></span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Today we welcome back to the CFTC, Treasury Assistant Secretary Josh Frost for an update on Treasury&rsquo;s work to build resilience in U.S. Treasury markets, which he first presented at a CFTC Global Market Advisory Committee (GMAC) meeting.&nbsp; I am looking forward to his remarks as well as the discussion of industry and other MRAC members to share their perspectives and views on Treasury markets and effective risk management practices. &nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>As a longstanding markets regulator at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and CFTC, as well as serving at Treasury for 12 years, I have direct experience in overseeing how Treasury markets are foundational to the U.S. financial system.&nbsp; Treasury markets are the deepest and most liquid markets in the world.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The U.S. Treasury futures markets, which the CFTC regulates, had an average daily trading volume of $750 billion.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/romerostatement121024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; These markets are transparent and subject to central clearing.&nbsp; In the CFTC&rsquo;s experience, central clearing has reduced systemic risk and improved transparency. &nbsp;During a time of stress in Treasury markets a few years ago, the Treasury futures market remained resilient.&nbsp; I have talked to Assistant Secretary Frost in the past about how the Treasury futures market can serve as a model for the Treasury markets.&nbsp; Treasury has advocated for an expansion of central clearing.&nbsp; The SEC has now expanded central clearing in cash and repo Treasury transactions. &nbsp;I look forward to continuing the dialogue with industry on these markets and continue exploring how we as regulators can effectively oversee Treasury markets.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>As I sponsor the CFTC Technology Advisory Committee (TAC), I want to touch on two areas on the agenda today that TAC covers&mdash;cybersecurity and AI.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span><i><span><span>Cyber Resilience</span></span></i></span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>I believe that regulat</strong>ors are at their best when they are engaged in ongoing dialogue with registered entities and other stakeholders to understand their perspectives, challenges, and what they are doing to meet those challenges.&nbsp; I have had many conversations over the last two years with banks, commodities producers, futures commission merchants, clearinghouses, and other registered entities to understand their perspectives on the challenge of cybersecurity, and the steps they are taking.&nbsp; This dialogue, the events in the ION Markets cyber attack, the TAC&rsquo;s work on cyber resilience, and my conversations with all of my fellow Commissioners, informed my work in leading the CFTC staff to draft the Commission&rsquo;s first ever proposal on operational resilience for swap dealers (including banks) and brokers.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/romerostatement121024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; That proposal, adopted unanimously by the Commission in a 5-0 vote, recognized the need for a framework to address third-party service provider cyber risk.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Today, we welcome a number of speakers to give their perspectives, including Treasury Deputy Assistant Secretary of Cyber and Chief AI Officer Todd Conklin.&nbsp; DAS Conklin is a member of TAC, has presented at TAC meetings on the ION Markets cyber attack and Treasury&rsquo;s response, and participated in TAC&rsquo;s exploration of how best to promote cyber resilience.&nbsp; He and I talk often about cyber resilience.&nbsp; I welcome him back to the CFTC, as well as the other speakers.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span><i><span><span>AI</span></span></i></span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I understand that DAS Conklin will update the Commission on Treasury&rsquo;s efforts related to AI, which he discussed earlier at a TAC meeting.&nbsp; DAS Conklin is one of several well-respected AI experts that serve on TAC and contributed to drafting the TAC&rsquo;s 65-page report entitled &ldquo;Responsible AI in Financial Markets: Opportunities, Risks, and Recommendations,&rdquo; issued in May 2024.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/romerostatement121024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;My understanding is that Treasury&rsquo;s work dovetails with several of the recommendations in the TAC report, and I look forward to hearing more about it.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The TAC report was a first-of-its kind comprehensive report by a U.S. government entity on AI in financial markets.&nbsp; The TAC report acknowledges that AI has been used for years in U.S. markets and that we are at the forefront of understanding how the evolution of AI, including generative AI, will be used in markets.&nbsp; This report recognizes the opportunities that the evolution of AI presents.&nbsp; It also balances the need for risk management, particularly in areas like AI-enabled market manipulation, cyber attacks, and fraud.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I believe there are great opportunities in the evolution in AI to solve many of the world&rsquo;s toughest problems.&nbsp; To gain those opportunities, it is critical for regulators to be engaged in dialogue with our registered entities about how they are using AI, how they are thinking about using generative AI, and how they are thinking about the concept known as Responsible AI. &nbsp;Responsible AI is generally known to include five properties including privacy, explainability, transparency, fairness, and robustness.&nbsp; In my discussions with our registered entities, there is agreement that these are important properties, but they may face practical challenges implementing them.&nbsp; I have focused on foundational best practices like governance, development of expertise, training, testing, and considerations of the role of humans.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>TAC Recommendations for the CFTC in &ldquo;Responsible AI in Financial Markets: Opportunities, Risks, and Recommendations&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The TAC took a foundational, iterative approach in findings and recommendations to the CFTC.&nbsp; In the report, the TAC provides a list of potential use cases for generative AI.&nbsp; The TAC also addressed the need for risk management and responsible design and deployment of AI.&nbsp; The recommendations in the TAC report are based on high-level principles rather than prescriptive:&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>(1)&nbsp;<i>Regulatory dialogue and outreach with CFTC-regulated entities</i>&nbsp;to inform the CFTC about key technical and policy considerations for AI in financial markets, develop common understanding and frameworks, build on the TAC&rsquo;s report, and establish relationships;</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>(2)&nbsp;<i>Consider NIST&rsquo;s AI Risk Management Framework</i>&nbsp;similarly to how the CFTC employs NIST&rsquo;s Cybersecurity Framework for its cyber requirements;</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>(3)&nbsp;<i>Develop an inventory of existing regulations that already apply to AI along with conducting a gap analysis</i>, recognizing that existing regulations require registrants to manage risks, while recognizing that regulations may need to be clarified or amended;</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>(4)&nbsp;<i>Strive to align any CFTC policies with other federal agencies</i>; and</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>(5)&nbsp;<i>Engage in ongoing AI dialogue and develop CFTC technical expertise</i>.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The CFTC is proceeding with implementing some of these recommendations.&nbsp; I have been and will continue to be engaged in dialogue with our registered entities to understand their perspectives, challenges, and efforts.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>TAC Findings for the CFTC on AI in the Report</span></span></span></span></span></strong><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/romerostatement121024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>Appropriate industry engagement and consideration of relevant guardrails to ensure that potential vulnerabilities from using AI applications and tools do not erode public trust in financial markets, services, and products.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>AI has been used in impactful ways in the financial industry for more than two decades.&nbsp; AI represents a potentially valuable tool to improve automated processes governing core functions, and to improve efficiency.&nbsp; This includes, for example, in areas of risk management, surveillance, fraud detection, back-testing of trading strategies, predictive analytics, credit risk management, customer service, and to analyze information about customers and counterparties.&nbsp; As AI continues to learn from the trusted dataset, it can adapt and optimize its algorithms to new market conditions.&nbsp; As automation and digitization proliferate in financial markets, it is crucial that markets simultaneously prioritize operational resilience, such as cybersecurity measures that are robust to AI-enabled cyberattacks.&nbsp; AI can monitor transactional data in real-time, identifying and flagging any unusual activities.&nbsp; Advanced machine learning algorithms can aid in the prediction of future attack vectors based on existing patterns, providing an additional layer of cybersecurity.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>AI systems can be less beneficial and, in some instances, more dangerous if the potential challenges and embedded biases in AI models are regressive to financial gains, and in worst case scenarios, prompt significant market instabilities due to the interjection of misguided training data, or the goals of bad actors to disrupt markets.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Other well-known AI risks include:</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span><span><span><span>Lack of transparency or explainability of AI models&rsquo; decision-making process (the &ldquo;black box&rdquo;);</span></span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><span><span>Risks related to data relied on by AI systems, including overfitting of AI models to their training data or &ldquo;poisoning&rdquo; real world data sources encountered by the AI model;</span></span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><span><span>Mishandling of sensitive data;</span></span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><span><span>Fairness concerns, including the AI system reproducing or compounding biases;</span></span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><span><span>Concentration risks that arise from the most widely deployed AI foundation models relying on a small number of deep learning architectures, as well as the relatively small number of firms developing and deploying AI foundation models at scale; and</span></span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><span><span>Potential to produce false or invalid outputs, whether because of AI reliance on inaccurate &ldquo;synthetic&rdquo; data to fill gaps or because of unknown reasons (hallucinations).</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Additionally, where AI resembles more conventional forms of algorithmic decision-making, the risks likely include a heightened risk of market stability, and, especially when combined with high frequency trading, potential institutional and wider market instability.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Where firms use their versions of generative AI, there could be increased risks of institutional and market instability if registered entities do not have a complete understanding of, or control over, the design and execution of their trading strategies and/or risk management programs.&nbsp; If proper data governance is not currently possible for some registered entities employing generative AI models, the CFTC may consider proposals to enable firms to access the AI models in a semi-autonomous way that will balance the intellectual property protection of the AI model provider with the imperative of the firm using the model to properly manage and report its trading and clearing data.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Additionally, new issues and concerns emerge with the use of generative AI particularly if the AI system hallucinates, and/or humans use AI to produce fake content which is not distinguishable from reality (deep fakes). &nbsp;Generative AI also raises a host of legal implications for civil and criminal liability.&nbsp; It also may be unclear who, if anyone, is legally liable for misinformation generated by AI.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>More specific areas of risk can be identified within the context of specific use cases in CFTC-regulated markets.&nbsp; Identifying the specific risks that have high saliency for CFTC-regulated markets, and measuring the potential harm if risks are insufficiently managed is important.&nbsp; To aid in these efforts, the Committee identified a partial list of potential use cases for AI in trading and investment, customer advice and service, risk management, regulatory compliance, and back office and operations.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>These use cases may introduce novel risks to companies, markets, and investors, especially in high-impact, autonomous decision-making scenarios (for example, business continuity risks posed by dependence on a small number of AI firms; procyclicality risks or other risks caused by multiple firms deploying similar AI models in the same market; erroneous AI output or errors caused by sudden, substantial losses to a particular firm, asset class or market such as a flash crash; data privacy risks; and the potential inability to provide a rationale demonstrating fiduciary duties; etc.).</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The Commission (including through the Technology Advisory Committee) should start to develop a framework that fosters safe, trustworthy, and responsible AI systems.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Responsible AI is defined as five typical properties which speak to how AI models are designed and deployed: (1)&nbsp;<i>Fairness</i>&nbsp;refers to the processes and practices that ensure that AI does not make discriminatory decisions or recommendations; (2)&nbsp;<i>Robustness</i>&nbsp;ensures that AI is not vulnerable to attacks to its performance; (3)&nbsp;<i>Transparency</i>&nbsp;refers to sharing information that was collected during development and that describes how the AI system has been designed and built, and what tests have been done to check its performance and other properties; (4)&nbsp;<i>Explainability</i>&nbsp;is the ability of the AI system to provide an explanation to users and other interested parties who inquire about what led to certain outputs in the AI&rsquo;s modeling (which is essential to generate trust in AI from users, auditors, and regulators); and (5)&nbsp;<i>Privacy&nbsp;</i>ensures that AI is developed and used in a way that protects users&rsquo; personal information.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The use of AI by CFTC-registered entities will require further exploration and discussion, particularly raising awareness as to the function of automated decision-making models, and governance.&nbsp; Even where firms disclose their use of technologies, it is not always clear the type of AI they are using (e.g. generative or predictive).&nbsp; Additionally, financial institutions should take care to respect the privacy of customers&rsquo; financial data and behaviors, particularly in the collection and surveillance of financial information.&nbsp; They should be encouraged to follow proper procedures and comply with disclosures to the federal government, especially in the face of concerns about national security and financial risk management.&nbsp; Also, the responsible and trustworthy use of AI will require the creation of a talent pipeline of professionals trained in the development and use of AI products.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Governance can set guiding principles for standards and practices such as the NIST AI Risk Management Framework.&nbsp; Governance also applies to various stages of the technology.&nbsp; The first type of AI governance is focused on a series of checks, consultations, reporting and testing at every phase of the lifecycle to make sure that the resulting AI is trustworthy and responsible.&nbsp; This includes &ldquo;value alignment&rdquo;&mdash;restricting an AI model to only pursue goals aligned to human values, such as operating ethically.&nbsp; This also includes determinations of where humans fit in the design, deployment, and oversight of models.&nbsp; In particular, the role of a human-in-the-loop, and human-out-the-loop will impact governance strategies.&nbsp; Second, AI governance can refer to corporate or public policies/regulations, including the concept of responsible AI.&nbsp; Third is the AI governance that companies put in place internally.&nbsp; Fourth are guardrails set by governments that can influence or set requirements for AI governance.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Given the collective decades of AI experience of TAC members, their findings and recommendations regarding the need for responsible AI practices, as well as the importance of the role of humans, governance, data quality, data privacy, and AI risk management frameworks, should be taken seriously.&nbsp; These expert findings and recommendations are aimed at realizing the opportunities that the evolution of AI can bring, while balancing the need of oversight to safeguard financial markets.&nbsp; I hope that the TAC report will drive future work on this evolving technology.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Good morning and welcome to the final meeting of the Market Risk Advisory Committee (MRAC) for 2024. I am delighted to have you all here, in person and virtually, to continue the thoughtful conversations and important developments of the Committee to advance a number of potential risks facing the futures and derivatives markets. Today, we continue the long tradition of this Committee&rsquo;s engagement with the Commission, its valuable insight into the concerns that shape the stability and integrity of global derivatives markets, and its collaboration toward developing ways that the industry and the Commission can prepare for and mitigate the most critical risks facing our markets today. The work of this Committee influences the creation of regulation, industry standards, and best practices that govern global derivatives markets. The Committee provides valuable thought leadership on critical issues that impact citizens and businesses in every corner of the world by shaping the direction of the development of markets.</p>
<p>We have a full agenda for today&rsquo;s meeting, and we are grateful for the many distinguished speakers and MRAC members who will share their expertise with us and create a diverse set of viewpoints on pressing risks not only to our markets and market participants, but the economy more broadly. The MRAC will introduce three formal recommendations, reports, and presentations with insightful guidance informed by diverse stakeholders to improve the integrity and stability of our markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, we will discuss the current state of Treasury markets, with opening remarks from The Honorable Josh Frost, Assistant Secretary for Financial Markets, U.S. Department of Treasury. Following Assistant Secretary Frost&rsquo;s remarks, we will explore the U.S. Treasury cash-futures basis trade. A range of participants and members of the Market Structure Subcommittee will present recommendations on effective risk management practices. Next, we will continue the Committee&rsquo;s efforts to robustly evaluate, and now propose recommendations related to, the importance of cyber resilience and especially critical risks related to third party service providers. We will hear the from chief cybersecurity officers, industry trade associations, and other experts as we continue to address the necessity of, and challenges related to, cyber resilience for financial markets.</p>
<p>MRAC has focused significant attention on cyberthreats to our markets since the creation of the advisory committee. In March 2023, MRAC held a first-of-its-kind public meeting to discuss then-recent cyber disruptions that affected cleared derivatives markets. Today, the MRAC advances proposals aimed at addressing cyber risks that may threaten market infrastructure and business continuity for several of our largest market participants. The Central Counterparty (CCP) Risk and Governance Subcommittee will present recommendations on central counterparty system safeguards for third party service providers. Our focus is driven, in part, by an increasingly significant industry-wide reliance on important services that facilitate critical market functions and for which there may be limited service providers, and, potentially, concentration risk. The CCP Risk and Governance Subcommittee will also share recommendations related to legal entity identifiers at the beneficial account holder level.</p>
<p>Next, we will hear presentations addressing a wide range of topics relevant to the MRAC&rsquo;s market risk-related mandate, including in the areas of emerging technology-oriented risks affecting the derivatives and related financial markets, such as risks related to cybersecurity and artificial intelligence, and climate-related market risks and related developments. The recommendations address novel risks that market participants must navigate, and aim to help identify potential pathways for the Commission to smooth frictions and mitigate potential risks.</p>
<p>Treasury Cash-Futures Basis Trade</p>
<p>In our first presentation, we will hear a briefing on Treasury cash, futures, and repo markets as well as the broader Treasury ecosystem from market participants, as well as members of the Market Structure Subcommittee. Presentations will explore how Treasury markets are crucial to price discovery and liquidity across the financial system, as well as risk management practices for the Treasury cash-futures basis trade. We are grateful to Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC) Chair Deirdre Dunn and TBAC members David Rogal and Scott Rofey for sharing their perspectives on Treasury markets and their work with TBAC.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s presentation and recommendations on effective risk management practices for the Treasury cash-futures basis trade are the culmination of the workstreams diligent efforts on this topic and its excellent work proposing effective risk management practices. At the December 2023 and April 2024 meetings, we had productive conversations about the role of the basis trade in U.S. treasury markets and mechanics of the trade, risk-management practices that are intended to limit leverage, oversight and transparency, and benefits, risks, and regulatory changes impacting these markets.</p>
<p>As the Subcommittee&rsquo;s introductory report describes:</p>
<p>The Treasury cash-futures basis trade, which enables market participants to express a market view efficiently, supports the Treasury ecosystem by enhancing market liquidity and efficiency, lowering government funding costs, improving capital formation, and optimally allocating portfolio risk. The basis trade is a convergence trade where market participants arbitrage the price difference&mdash;or basis&mdash;between a Treasury security and a related Treasury futures contract by buying the deliverable security and selling the futures contract (or vice versa in the event the deliverable security were overvalued in comparison to the futures contract).</p>
<p>The basis trade has garnered significant attention recently, with elevated Treasury futures activity driving speculation that the strategy has grown amongst leveraged fund managers and that it has the potential to amplify market stress.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement121024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As discussed in the introductory report, a number of private and public sector studies have explored the role of the basis trade in the market stress that occurred around March 2020. In addition, report identifies both benefits and risks of the Treasury cash-futures basis trade. As noted,</p>
<p>Basis traders seek to arbitrage the difference in prices between Treasury securities and related Treasury futures contracts by purchasing the positions that are relatively undervalued and selling the others in anticipation that the prices will converge. Market participants will take different views of which of the position pair (securities or futures) is undervalued. This dynamic makes the basis trade appealing to various market participants and provides several benefits.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement121024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2">[2]</a></p>
<p>These benefits include (i) greater market depth and liquidity, which contribute to overall efficiency of the Treasury market, (ii) greater price efficiency, (iii) lower funding costs for the federal government, and (iv) improvement of portfolio optimization and capital formation.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement121024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Market participants in the basis trade are also exposed to potential losses that can arise from market, liquidity, and counterparty risks. As discussed in the report, these risks are dynamic, and in certain market conditions, can quickly impact the economics of the basis trade.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement121024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4">[4]</a></p>
<p>A summary of these risks includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Market Risk:&nbsp;</i>Treasury futures and Treasury securities positions are subject to market price risk. When futures prices rise, there will be a mark-to-market variation margin call to cover this change in market prices. When Treasury security prices also rise, if the basis trader has provided margin on the Treasury security leg of the basis trade, the futures margin calls may be offset by a variation margin credit on the long Treasury securities positions in the basis trade. This price correlation relationship can change under market stresses. For example, even where margin is collected by dealers on the securities position, that collected margin may not be sufficient to meet the variation margin requirement on the futures leg. For highly leveraged investors, small changes in overall correlations could result in large margin calls and/or position liquidations. Although typically less significant than other forms of market risk, participants in the basis trade are also exposed to market risks associated with the Treasury security that is deliverable into the futures contract.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li><i>Liquidity Risk:&nbsp;</i>For the basis trade, leveraged participants generally finance Treasury securities positions with repo transactions. The repo financing can be overnight or term, with overnight repo rates generally being lower and increasing the potential basis return. However, when repo duration does not match the maturity of the basis trade, interest rate changes could affect the financing costs and the return of the basis trade. Additionally, there is a possibility at repo maturity that the lender may not offer financing due to liquidity constraints or counterparty concerns. Therefore, prevailing repo market conditions could also require unanticipated funding needs or force an unwind of the basis position.&nbsp;</li>
<li><i>Counterparty Credit Risk:&nbsp;</i>Counterparty credit exposures arise if a counterparty defaults prior to the settlement of all outstanding obligations&hellip;Since there are different counterparties and agents that may facilitate the trading and settlement activities in a basis trade, there are several ways that&nbsp;counterparty&nbsp;risk can arise in the basis trade and that exposure can change with market conditions. Parties to the trade may require margin to mitigate counterparty risk. As exposures increase or market prices change, counterparty risk mitigation may include reduction in current or future exposure via increased margin, reduction in capacity or services provided, liquidation of positions or a combination of these risk reducing measures.&nbsp;<br /><br />Counterparty credit risk can increase due to combinations of high leverage, maturity mismatches, changes in correlation, or other market shocks that may result in anticipated margin calls and/or a reduction in the availability of repo financing.&nbsp;</li>
<li><i>Leverage Considerations:&nbsp;</i>As discussed in more detail in the report, significant leverage is generally required to make the basis trade economically viable. The unwind of that leverage could pose systemic risk&nbsp;considerations&nbsp;given the critical role of the Treasury market and ecosystem.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement121024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5">[5]</a>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Effective risk management practices are crucial and with respect to the Treasury cash-futures basis trade, can help to minimize the risks associated with it. Following its evaluation of the risk described above, the Market Structure Subcommittee has developed recommended practices to serve as a guide to effective management of market, liquidity and counterparty credit risks associated with the Treasury cash-futures basis trade &ndash; risks that could have a broad, systemic impact on markets and market participant associated with the trade.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement121024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6">[6]</a>&nbsp;The Subcommittee&rsquo;s recommendations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Market participants, including basis traders, futures markets participants, intermediaries, and others engaged in or providing intermediation for trades associated with the cash-futures basis&mdash;including the basis, long futures positions, and financing positions&mdash;should continuously assess and manage the risks associated with these trades including&nbsp;<i>market</i>,&nbsp;<i>liquidity,</i>&nbsp;<i>counterparty credit</i>, and other risks. These risks should be modeled, and a mark-to-market attribution analysis should be conducted.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Market participants should manage&nbsp;<i>market risks</i>&nbsp;that could affect the performance of their portfolios.</li>
<li>Market participants should evaluate and manage their&nbsp;<i>liquidity risks</i>, including the risk that margin costs increase rapidly and significantly, and that financing is reduced or becomes unavailable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Market participants should appropriately monitor and manage&nbsp;<i>counterparty credit</i>&nbsp;risks associated with the basis trade or its intermediation, including through effective due diligence, onboarding, credit risk mitigants, and continuous monitoring processes.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement121024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7">[7]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>While these recommendations will help to ensure stability to this market and in turn, the financial system, the report acknowledges that these risk management practices should continue to be evaluated in light of changes in market structure, including Treasury central clearing rules, and changes in cross margining or available data, among others.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement121024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8">[8]</a>&nbsp;We are grateful to Nate Wuerffel, who led the workstream&rsquo;s efforts, as well as Alessandro Cocco, Tim Cuddihy, David Bowman and Jennifer Han for their remarks today, in addition to other members of the Subcommittee that assisted in various stages of this workstream along the way.</p>
<p>Cyber Resilience and Critical Third-Party Recommendations</p>
<p>As noted above, MRAC has been at the forefront of the Commission&rsquo;s efforts to address the importance of cyber resilience for market participants, central counterparties and the broader market and economy. At our March 2023 meeting, we brought together diverse viewpoints of the MRAC membership and others to begin to identify, examine, and explore both the vulnerabilities in our markets and specific policy interventions for consideration by the Commission, best practices for industry participants, and public-private partnerships or industry-engineered initiatives designed to effectuate collaborative cyber threat responses and create cyber-defenses for interconnected segments of our markets.</p>
<p>We look forward to hearing remarks from various stakeholders including Sanjeev Bhasker, Deputy General Counsel, Office of the National Cyber Director, Steve Pugh, Chief Information Security Officer, Intercontinental Exchange, and Don Byron, Head of Global Industry Operations and Execution, Futures Industry Association.</p>
<p>Since kicking off this workstream, the CCP Risk and Governance Subcommittee has worked to develop recommendations that highlight the importance of central counterparty cyber resilience and address the need for a more robust regulatory framework. As I have previously noted, the Commission has focused on similar cyber risk in other areas, but has not focused on CCPs, despite CCPs posing significant potential risk to derivatives markets and the broader financial industry. For example, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) has previously addressed potential emerging threats and vulnerabilities, most recently noted the dangers to the financial system presented by underexamined cybersecurity at CCPs.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement121024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9">[9]</a></p>
<p>The CCP Risk and Governance Subcommittee&rsquo;s recommendations bridge this gap by addressing the critical cybersecurity risk to financial markets that is posed by CCPs face use of third-party service providers. In particular, the Subcommittee&rsquo;s report addresses DCO system safeguard standards for third party service providers and advances recommendations to build upon and incorporate the language, concepts and principles already set out in the System Safeguards Rule found in Part 39.18 of the CFTC&rsquo;s regulations (DCO Rule 18 -- System Safeguards) with respect to DCOs.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement121024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10">[10]</a></p>
<p>As noted in the report, DCO Rule 18 currently imposes requirements with respect to outsourcing, but never expressly refers to a third-party relationship program.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement121024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11">[11]</a>&nbsp;The report sets forth recommendations to build upon existing regulatory frameworks to close a crucial gap and provide guidance with respect to third party relationships. In particular, the report states:</p>
<p>It is recommended that the proposed regulation build upon and incorporate the language, concepts and principles already set out in the System Safeguards Rule found in Part 39.18 of the CFTC&rsquo;s regulations (Rule 18-System safeguards)<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement121024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12">[12]</a>&nbsp;with respect to DCO.&nbsp; The proposed regulation would further require that each DCO establish, implement, and maintain a Third-Party Relationship Management Program (a &ldquo;TPMP&rdquo;)<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement121024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13">[13]</a>&nbsp;beyond what is currently in the Rule 18-System Safeguards.</p>
<p>We recommend that the Commission take a principles-based approach by adding TPMP principles to current Rule 18 (2). These principles are intended to reflect lessons learned from industry efforts and best practices in derivatives, the guidance notes in Form DCO, the NFA interpretive guidance, lessons learned from the wider context of third-party relationship management, as well as the principles enunciated in the PFMIs. Incorporating these principles in Commission regulations would enable the Commission to update its regulatory framework with respect to critical third party service providers and to bring its regulations in line with internationally accepted standards, while maintaining a principles based approach to regulation.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement121024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14">[14]</a></p>
<p>More specifically, as described in more detail in the report, the Subcommittee recommends amendments to Rule 39.18(d)(2) on retention of responsibility, to&nbsp;retain responsibility over critical third-party arrangements provided by Third Party Service Providers (TPSP) by establishing a robust Third-Party Risk Management Program (TPRM).<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement121024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15">[15]</a>&nbsp;The proposed language would include the following:</p>
<p>A robust TPRM program should identify, assess, mitigate and monitor the full scope of risks that the use of third party arrangements through implementation, at a minimum, of the following principles:</p>
<p>A DCO should:</p>
<ol>
<li>Implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to cover the entire lifecycle6&nbsp;of the third-party service relationship and to manage risks associated with Third Party arrangements.</li>
<li>Employ personnel with the expertise necessary to enable the DCO to monitor and supervise TPSP&rsquo;s performance against contractual requirements;</li>
<li>Conduct a pre-selection and an onboarding due diligence assessment, before entering into any third-party service arrangement, of the impact to the DCO&rsquo;s operational risk, including an assessment of the TPSP&rsquo;s financial posture, insurance coverage, contingency plans</li>
<li>Establish written policies and procedures to determine which of a DCO&rsquo;s TPSPs are Critical TPSPs (CTPSPs) considering the following:</li>
</ol><ol>
<li>dependencies on functionality or support which would have a material impact on CFTC regulated activities if unavailable or if the service is impaired;</li>
<li>impact to critical operations or firm viability;</li>
<li>material impact on the ability to meet key legal and regulatory obligations;</li>
<li>significant customer impact;</li>
<li>potential significant security risks (including cybersecurity);</li>
<li>risk of concentration of third-party providers that the DCO has an arrangement with; and</li>
</ol><ol start="5">
<li>Exit strategy and alternative solutions.&nbsp;With respect to CTPSPs, apply enhanced risk based due diligence and oversight to critical services.</li>
<li>Establish written policies and procedures to perform ongoing risk-based monitoring of performance of each CTPSP, based on generally accepted industry standards.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Maintain adequate records of the agreements between the DCO and each CTPSP, each such agreement identifying (1) the scope of services that will be provided; (2) applicable services level agreements (SLAs); (3) contact at the CTPSP; and termination provisions.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Establish reasonable standards for offboarding/ termination of CTPSPs.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement121024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16">[16]</a></li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, the report recommends incorporating Annex F of the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructure (PFMI)<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement121024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17">[17]</a>: assessment methodology for the oversight expectations applicable to critical service providers. In particular, the Subcommittee recommends that the Commission consider requiring DCOs to obtain assurance from their critical service providers that they comply with the expectations set forth in Annex F of the PFMI.</p>
<p>Many thanks to Alessandro Cocco, Dick Berner and Juan Blackwell for presenting on the report today, and to the many others on the Subcommittee that have been involved in the workstream&rsquo;s efforts.</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence</p>
<p>The cybersecurity risks discussed above, and their potential to harm the financial service sector, is amplified by technological advances such as artificial intelligence. We will hear a presentation from Todd Conklin, Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer &amp; Deputy Assistant Secretary of Cyber, U.S. Department of the Treasury that addresses the intersection of these risks. This past March, Treasury issued a report on Managing Artificial Intelligence-Specific Cybersecurity Risks in the Financial Services Sector.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement121024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18">[18]</a>&nbsp;The report draws on in-depth interviews with market participants to report on the current state of artificial intelligence in the financial services sector, and identifies best practices for financial institutions as mandated by Executive Order (EO) 14110, Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement121024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19">[19]</a></p>
<p>Treasury&rsquo;s report notes in its executive summary:</p>
<p>Financial institutions have used AI systems in connection with their operations, and specifically to support their cybersecurity and anti-fraud operations, for years. Early adopters in the financial services sector may be revisiting AI&rsquo;s potential strategic value and considering new use cases in light of the recent rate of change and rapid developments in AI technology. Thus far, many financial institutions have incorporated AI-related risks into their existing risk management frameworks, especially those related to information-technology, model, compliance, and third-party risk management.</p>
<p>Some of the financial institutions that Treasury met with reported that existing risk management frameworks may not be adequate to cover emerging AI technologies, such as Generative AI, which emulates input data to generate synthetic content. Hence, financial institutions appear to be moving slowly in adopting expansive use of emerging AI technologies. Interview participants generally agreed that the safe adoption of AI technologies requires cross-enterprise collaboration among model, technology, legal, compliance, and other teams, which can present its own challenges. Further, in the case of cybersecurity and anti-fraud AI usage, interviewees largely agreed that effectively managing risks requires collaboration across the financial services sector. Applying appropriate risk management principles to AI development is critical from a cybersecurity perspective, as data poisoning, data leakage, and data integrity attacks can take place at any stage of the AI development and supply chain. AI systems are more vulnerable to these concerns than traditional software systems because of the dependency of an AI system on the data used to train and test it.</p>
<p>Like other critical infrastructure sectors, the financial services sector is increasingly subject to costly cybersecurity threats and cyber-enabled fraud. As access to advanced AI tools becomes more widespread, it is likely that, at least initially, cyberthreat actors utilizing emerging AI tools will have the advantage by outpacing and outnumbering their targets. At the same time, many industry experts believe that most cyber risks exposed by AI tools or cyber threats related to AI tools can be managed like other IT systems. To counter the threat actors&rsquo; initial advantage, financial institutions should expand and strengthen their risk management and cybersecurity practices to account for AI systems&rsquo; advanced and novel capabilities, consider greater integration of AI solutions into their cybersecurity practices, and enhance collaboration, particularly threat information sharing. According to interviewed financial institutions, the adoption of AI technology, including Generative AI, has the potential to significantly improve the quality and cost efficiencies of their cybersecurity and anti-fraud management functions.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement121024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20">[20]</a></p>
<p>Treasury&rsquo;s report identifies next steps, both challenges and opportunities, which we look forward to hearing more about today. The report concludes:</p>
<p>AI presents opportunities for the financial sector, but also significant potential risks, particularly for consumers and historically marginalized groups. Applications of AI in consumer financial services, insurance underwriting, fraud detection, and other areas of financial services have the potential to perpetuate or amplify existing inequities. Use of AI in these contexts also raises questions regarding consumer privacy and data security.</p>
<p>Treasury and financial regulators are also considering other potential risks and benefits associated with the use of AI by financial institutions. As discussed in the report in the context of cyber risk management, longstanding principles for sound risk management, including model risk management and third-party risk management, are critical to addressing the risks of AI more broadly. Treasury continues to monitor the development and use of these tools and consider risks to financial institutions and the financial system. To better understand the use of AI by financial institutions and its impact on consumers and investors, as well as the sufficiency of existing regulatory frameworks, Treasury is exploring opportunities for deeper engagement with the public.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement121024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21">[21]</a></p>
<p>I have long expressed my agreement that the use of AI in financial markets may hold the potential for substantial benefits, and that such use may also introduce unprecedented risks concerning market integrity, customer protection, governance, data privacy, bias, and cyber threats.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement121024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn22">[22]</a>&nbsp;The derivatives market provides many potential applications for AI. Accordingly, given the Commission&rsquo;s mandate to promote responsible innovation while safeguarding market integrity, effective risk management is essential to address these concerns.</p>
<p>Throughout the years, I have maintained an unwavering commitment to researching and proposing regulatory solutions for AI in financial markets, driven by a steadfast dedication to ensure integrity and stability in this rapidly evolving landscape. Five years ago, I began to convene and participate in convenings of AI developers, adopters, academics, government and industry researchers, regulators, and public interest organizations. During my term as a Commissioner and in the decade prior to my appointment, I have advocated for market and prudential regulators to have clear visibility into the diverse technologies that increasingly define the infrastructure of our markets.&nbsp;I have advocated for working in partnership with market participants, and working with other market and prudential regulators to consider how best to integrate responsible innovation that reflects our regulatory values, protects customers, and preserves capital.</p>
<p>While I strongly support the Commission&rsquo;s efforts to advance inquiries regarding the integration of AI in our markets and to explore the need to introduce guardrails to mitigate the risks that AI technologies may present, including the issuance of a Staff Advisory on AI last week,<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement121024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn23">[23]</a>&nbsp;I believe that there are some tangible steps that the Commission can take immediately to enhance the safety and benefits of incorporating AI in markets while minimizing the risks. As noted in my recent statement on future-proofing financial markets and assessing the integration of AI in global derivatives markets,<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement121024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn24">[24]</a>&nbsp;I have advocated for a few key proposals to develop a robust regulatory framework for our markets. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Creation of an AI Fraud Task Force</i>: I encourage the&nbsp;Commission to consider a CFTC Task forced focused on mitigating AI enabled misconduct&nbsp;and would welcome an opportunity to work with our Division of Enforcement on developing an AI Fraud Task Force.</li>
<li><i>Enhanced Supervision and Enforcement Resources</i>:&nbsp;I believe that the Commission would benefit from increased resources dedicated to enabling several of the Divisions within the Commission to prepare for and meet the challenges of regulating innovative trading, clearing, and settlement technologies, among other changes to operational infrastructure that merits consideration.</li>
<li><i>Heightened Civil Monetary Penalties to Deter Fraudulent Actors</i>:&nbsp;I have encouraged enhanced penalties for bad actors who would use the powerful and important technologies described as AI to facilitate fraud or other illegal activity. Increasing civil monetary penalties against individuals and entities who misuse AI to engage in fraud or evade CFTC regulations will stymie the proliferation of misconduct.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Interagency Collaboration</i>:&nbsp;I believe it is important that regulators across financial markets within the United States and globally work in collaboration to establish effective regulatory approaches. Within the community of domestic market and prudential regulators, I have encouraged the creation of an inter-agency task force focused on understanding the implications of integrating more complex AI models into regulated markets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Legal Entity Identifiers</p>
<p>The CCP Risk and Governance Subcommittee will also discuss their report and recommendations on legal entity identifiers, first describing the concept of the legal entity identifier, which was introduced in 2012 in the wake of the financial crisis, and its development in different markets around the world.&nbsp; In its report, the Subcommittee recommends:</p>
<p>[CFTC Rule 39.19] should be amended to bring the US regulatory structure in line with global standards by mandating the use of Legal Entity Identifiers, or equivalent identifiers, by the beneficial account owner level (obtained and maintained by the beneficial account owner) for daily reporting by DCOs [and] &hellip;&nbsp;to the extent not already required, DCOs and futures commission merchants should also require that a beneficial account owner always provide an LEI with respect to any activity subject to such registered entity&rsquo;s reporting obligation to the CFTC.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement121024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn25">[25]</a></p>
<p>Thank you to Dick Berner and John Bottega for sharing remarks on this important topic.</p>
<p>Climate-Related Market Risk</p>
<p>At the MRAC meeting in March of this year, members held a roundtable discussion focused on three mains topics related to carbon credit markets: (1) market integrity, disclosure, transparency and enforcement, (2) market design and intermediation, and (3) product design and reliability, and shared enthusiasm for the CFTC to create more robust standards for carbon credit markets. At this meeting, the discussion will continue as we hear remarks surrounding the private carbon credit market and its use by corporations to offset CO2 emissions.</p>
<p>We will also hear how climate-related financial risk can occur broadly. On December 6, FSOC unanimously approved its 2024 annual report, which addresses climate-related financial risks and notes that:</p>
<p>Climate-related financial risk can manifest as and amplify traditional risks, such as credit, market, liquidity, operational, compliance, reputational, and legal risks.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement121024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn26">[26]</a>&nbsp;Climate-related financial risks may be occurring simultaneously with other stresses, such as financial crises or pandemics, and may also compound nonlinearly with other climate risks. For example, the joint impact of a physical climate shock and pandemic occurring simultaneously could be 50 percent larger than the sum of the impacts of the individual shocks.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement121024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn27">[27]</a>&nbsp;Also, sea level rise can compound with heavy precipitation, increasing the likelihood of flooding events.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement121024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn28">[28]</a>&nbsp;Given the Council&rsquo;s focus on the stability of the U.S. financial system as a whole, it is important to consider a systemwide approach that combines individual firm and market risk assessments by taking into account interconnections and spillovers, which may amplify the financial effects on individual firms. A systemwide approach may also highlight possible trade-offs and the need to balance them. Actions individual firms take to protect themselves may lead to unexpected losses at other firms or hinder objectives related to low- and moderate-income community development, including fair access to credit.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement121024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn29">[29]</a></p>
<p>The 2024 FSOC report focuses on recent developments in physical risk, housing, and property insurance markets that are imposing significant costs to the economy. The report notes that:</p>
<p>From January through early November 2024, the United States experienced 24 confirmed weather and climate disaster events in which losses exceeded $1 billion, up from an annual average of 8.5 events per year between 1980 and 2023 and also up from a recent five-year annual average of 20.4 events from 2019 to 2023. This increase in events with losses exceeding $1 billion is driven by a combination of factors, including rising exposure values and replacement costs, natural variability, and the effects of climate change.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement121024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn30">[30]</a>&nbsp;The costs of some of these events greatly exceed $1 billion. In the fall of 2024, the United States experienced two strong late-season storms, which resulted in the deaths of over 200 people and caused significant damage to property and infrastructure.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement121024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn31">[31]</a>&nbsp;Hurricane Helene caused an estimated total flood and wind loss between $30.5 and $47.5 billion, of which between $10.5 and $17.5 billion are estimated to be insured.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement121024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn32">[32]</a>&nbsp;Hurricane Milton, which made landfall as a Category 3 hurricane, is estimated to have caused between $30 and $50 billion in insured losses.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement121024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn33">[33]</a>&nbsp;The exposure of the financial system to the effects of physical risk on real estate remains a primary transmission channel of interest. Acute climate related events and chronic physical climate risks may reduce the value of real estate, which could affect homeowners and owners of commercial real estate (CRE), and such events can also increase the probability of default and associated loss.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement121024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn34">[34]</a>&nbsp;As markets factor these risks into pricing, real estate (and real estate investment products) exposed to physical risk could lose market value.</p>
<p>Today we will hear from three different speakers regarding climate-related market risk. First, we will hear from Sandra Lee, Deputy Assistant Secretary, Financial Stability Oversight Council, U.S. Department of Treasury on current topics and FSOC developments in the area of climate-related market risk. We will also hear from Chris Odinet, Professor of Law &amp; Mosbacher Research Fellow, Texas A&amp;M University School of Law, about the voluntary carbon credit market, including discussion of the smaller, private market-oriented carbon credit market which corporations use as part of their strategy to commit to CO2 reduction and the work of the Uniform Law Commission on a commercial law framework for voluntary carbon credits. Finally, we will hear from Kim Ratcliff, U.S. Department of Agriculture Advisory Committee on Minority Farmers; Board Member, Capital Farm Credit Advisory Committee; Treasurer and Board Member, Independent Cattlemen Association, to discuss equity, sustainability, and increasing economic opportunity in rural areas and by providing financial education and access to resources, knowledge, and networks needed to thrive in agriculture to underserved farmers.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>This meeting is an opportunity to continue to advance discussions and pragmatic next steps on critical issues facing our markets. I am hopeful for an open and meaningful discussion among MRAC members informed by the viewpoints of our diverse group of expert speakers.</p>
<p>Allow me to thank our MRAC Chair and Chair of the FIA Board, Alicia Crighton; MRAC Designated Federal Officer (DFO) Danielle Abada; and MRAC Alternate DFO Peter Janowski. I also thank each of the ADFOs who support MRAC&mdash;Chris Lamb and Nita Somasundaram. Thank you to Christian Johnson for his assistance in preparing for the meeting. I also want to thank the CFTC logistics and administrative staff and contractors who ensured that our physical conference room and our virtual conference room were ready to go for our members and our invited speakers, including Andy Brighton, Jean Cespedes, Clarence Davis, Kashawn Diggs, Jude Luellen, Monae Mills, Ty Poole, Pete Santos, Gordon Schauer and Margie Yates.</p>

<title>Ontario Securities Commission Publishes Compliance Review Findings And Guidance For Crypto Asset Trading Platforms</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) published its findings from a focused compliance review of crypto asset trading platforms (CTPs).&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/securities-law/instruments-rules-policies/3/33-757/osc-staff-notice-33-757-review-restricted-dealer-crypto-asset-trading-platforms-compliance-account">OSC Staff Notice 33-757&nbsp;<em>Review of Restricted Dealer Crypto Asset Trading Platforms&rsquo; Compliance with the Account Appropriateness, Investment Limits and Client Limits Requirements</em></a>&nbsp;summarizes the OSC&rsquo;s findings from the review and provides guidance to help CTPs in meeting their regulatory obligations.</p>
<p>The review found firms had inadequately assessed initial and ongoing account appropriateness, including instances where a CTP took a mechanical &lsquo;tick box&rsquo; approach without following up with clients on any inconsistencies. This led to inappropriate client accounts being opened and maintained. Staff also found instances where CTPs did not set meaningful client limits (loss limits) that were tailored to their specific needs. However, the review found CTPs were keeping in line with their regulatory obligations around limiting the client&rsquo;s purchase of crypto assets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Account appropriateness, investment limits and client limits are all essential measures to protect investors,&rdquo; said Matthew Onyeaju, Senior Vice President of Registration, Inspections and Examinations at the OSC. &ldquo;While some of the findings were positive, it&rsquo;s clear additional guidance is needed. We encourage CTPs to review and assess their practices against the guidance we issued today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As part of this compliance review, staff looked at six Ontario-based, registered CTPs to assess their compliance with the terms and conditions of their registration. Issues were identified, and staff have engaged with firms to resolve our concerns. The Staff Notice is intended to provide additional clarity on expectations for compliance with the conditions surrounding account appropriateness, investment limits and client limits. Staff will continue to monitor CTPs&rsquo; compliance with the conditions alongside other fundamental registrant obligations in securities legislation.</p>
<p>The mandate of the OSC is to provide protection to investors from unfair, improper or fraudulent practices, to foster fair, efficient and competitive capital markets and confidence in the capital markets, to foster capital formation, and to contribute to the stability of the financial system and the reduction of systemic risk. Investors are urged to check the registration of any persons or company offering an investment opportunity and to review the OSC investor materials available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/">https://www.osc.ca</a>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced a civil enforcement action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington against&nbsp;<span>Francier Obando Pinillo</span>, doing business as&nbsp;<span>Solanofi, Solano Partners Ltd.,</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span>Solano Capital Investments</span>&nbsp;&ndash;collectively&nbsp;<span>Solanofi entities</span>&nbsp;&ndash; for engaging in a fraudulent digital assets multilevel marketing scheme worth at least $5.9 million.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Pinillo targeted at least 1,515 customers in the United States, including members of a Spanish church where he was the pastor in Pasco, Washington, in the scheme.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks restitution to defrauded customers, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil monetary penalties, trading bans, and a permanent injunction against further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC Regulations.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Case Background</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>As alleged in the complaint, Pinillo, individually and doing business as the Solanofi entities, mainly targeted Spanish-speaking customers who had little to no experience or understanding in digital asset transactions or commodity interest trading. He abused his position of trust as the church pastor to attract customers and claimed to be the CEO of the Solanofi entities that had an automated computer trading system which he called Solanofi. Pinillo claimed to operate a leveraged staking trading platform which rewarded users through an interest pool based on high performance trading of cryptographic assets. He further claimed it was risk free and guaranteed profits of up to 34.9% compounded monthly.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Pinillo provided customers with access to an online dashboard with account statements showing their purported account balances and profits. He encouraged customers to involve friends and family in his fraudulent scheme by offering to pay a 15% referral fee to them for referring additional customers. These representations and account statements were false. During the relevant period, there was no trading platform, no trading took place, no profits were generated, and Pinillo misappropriated all assets that customers transferred to him.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Pinillo made omissions of material facts in solicitations to actual and prospective customers, including, but not limited to failing to disclose: there was no leveraged staking trading platform; no trading took place for the customers; the online account statements were fabricated; the Solanofi entities were a sham and their alleged profitability and trading track record were non-existent; profits can&rsquo;t be guaranteed in the commodity markets; he misappropriated all assets he received from customers; and, payments he sent to earlier-in-time customers in the form of sham profits and/or referral payments were actually misappropriated assets of later-in-time customers in the nature of a Ponzi scheme.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this case are Ken Koh, Karen Kenmotsu, Kelly Makimoto-Murphy, Timothy J. Mulreany, and Paul G. Hayeck.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>* * * * * *</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>CFTC&rsquo;s Fraud Advisory</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The CFTC has issued several customer protection&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/index.htm">Fraud Advisories and Articles</a>, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/CustomerAdvisory_RomanceScam.html">Avoid Forex, Precious Metals, and Digital Asset Romance Scams</a>, which warns users of online dating and social media platforms about an increase in scams that lure victims into sending their money to fraudulent websites that claim to trade foreign currency exchange contracts, precious metals contracts, and/or digital assets.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The CFTC also strongly urges the public to verify a company&rsquo;s registration with CFTC at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nfa.futures.org/basicnet">NFA BASIC</a>&nbsp;before investing funds. Customers should be wary of providing funds to an unregistered entity.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<title>Arbitration, Alternative Assets, And Aging Actors: Remarks At The Meeting Of The SEC Investor Advisory Committee, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, Washington D.C., Dec. 10, 2024</title>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>As we close out 2024, allow me a moment to thank you for sharing your time and your wisdom this last year.&nbsp; I look forward to working with all of you next year, which is likely to be a particularly eventful year for both the Commission and the Investor Advisory Committee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you also to the panelists who are joining you today to discuss arbitration and alternative assets. &nbsp;Last year, the Office of the Investor Advocate and the Office of the Ombuds published a report concerning the use of mandatory arbitration clauses by registered investment advisers.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-iac-121024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a>&nbsp; Though inconclusive as to the effects of mandatory arbitration on advisory clients, the report suggested &ldquo;establishing uniform disclosure requirements for adviser arbitration information.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-iac-121024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a>&nbsp; A disclosure regime can morph into a prohibitory regime. Today&rsquo;s discussion, therefore, should not lose sight of the importance of allowing investors and their advisers to choose binding arbitration to resolve disputes.&nbsp; Freedom of contract is a bedrock principle. Submitting a dispute to arbitration is, in many instances, a cheaper and less burdensome process than litigation.&nbsp; Moreover, as Professor Todd Zywicki has pointed out, &ldquo;although [] contractual provisions to arbitrate disputes are initially agreed to by contract, [] a substantial body of common law regulation has been built up by courts to ensure that [arbitration processes] are fair and effective alternatives to lawsuits.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-iac-121024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s second panel will take up some of the many questions associated with increasing retail investor opportunities to invest in alternative assets.&nbsp; For too long, misguided efforts to shield retail investors from risk have prevented them from directly accessing private market opportunities.&nbsp; Exploring how retail investors can gain diversified exposure to alternative assets with professional advice through existing products, like ETFs, interval funds, BDCs, and closed-end funds is a worthy topic for the IAC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Committee also will consider draft recommendations concerning the protection of investors from so-called &ldquo;finfluencers.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-iac-121024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a>&nbsp; As the draft acknowledges, &ldquo;[s]ome finfluencers assist . . .&nbsp; investors in understanding complex financial information in clear and digestible social media content,&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-iac-121024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;but others are nothing more than a digital twist on the aging actors and gone-to-seed athletes found on any late-night cable channel fronting for a boiler room.&nbsp; Today&rsquo;s finfluencers may be talking about crypto on social media, but the concept is the same.&nbsp; All investors should exercise good judgment, skepticism, and circumspection before putting their money at risk.&nbsp; To that end, the Commission plays an important role in ensuring that investors have the information they need to make thoughtful decisions in step with their goals and risk tolerance.&nbsp; The Commission has successfully brought enforcement actions against finfluencers for alleged securities law violations.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-iac-121024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn6" name="_ednref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The draft includes some useful recommendations for further action. &nbsp;For example, the draft recommends that the Commission explore possible gaps in disclosure requirements, work with the Federal Trade Commission, make investors aware of finfluencer misconduct, and educate would-be finfluencers about the rules.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-iac-121024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn7" name="_ednref7">[7]</a>&nbsp; But some aspects of the draft are much less compelling and raise numerous questions. &nbsp;Is there really a regulatory gap to fill? &nbsp;What is the scope of the recommendation? &nbsp;For example, is the Committee recommending that we require all finfluencers register as investment advisers, or is it focusing only on finfluencers that are associated with investment advisers?&nbsp; Has the Committee considered the draft recommendations, which seem to suggest that we have too much unregulated online speech, through a First Amendment lens?&nbsp; Should the mere mention of one&rsquo;s holdings in a Tweet really be proscribed because followers might buy those same securities?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-iac-121024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn8" name="_ednref8">[8]</a>&nbsp; Should the SEC really require a person posting investment musings on a social media site to accompany such musings with &ldquo;regulatory status, educational background and business experience of the finfluencer or lack thereof?&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-iac-121024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn9" name="_ednref9">[9]</a>&nbsp; Should &ldquo;social media posts give rise to Section 12 seller liability&rdquo;?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-iac-121024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn10" name="_ednref10">[10]</a>&nbsp; Does the SEC have the authority to demand information from social media platforms &ldquo;to understand their controls for monitoring problematic finfluencers activities?&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-iac-121024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn11" name="_ednref11">[11]</a>&nbsp; Even if it does have the authority to do so, couldn&rsquo;t attempts to control social media platform content turn into censorship?&nbsp; Would the recommendation to work to establish an international &ldquo;baseline set of requirements that would apply to all finfluencers&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-iac-121024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn12" name="_ednref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;be wise in a world where other jurisdictions accept censorship that would be illegal in the United States?</p>
<p>As the draft recommendations acknowledge, social media and innovative technologies have fueled the welcome influx of new investors into our markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-iac-121024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn13" name="_ednref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Emphasis on the potential mischief that can be perpetrated on apps and social media sites ignores that these platforms also enable investors to learn from others&rsquo; experiences and be warned of dodgy products and untrustworthy voices.&nbsp; If we want to serve these new investors, we should focus on upping our game and becoming a bigger presence online, rather than otherizing apps and platforms and infantilizing new investors.&nbsp; One thing the Commission can do immediately is reinstate OIEA&rsquo;s standalone social media accounts, which proved to be a very effective way to alert and inform investors.&nbsp; We also could right our multi-year failure to elucidate clearly what a security is, rather than expecting musicians and athletes to become Howey experts before they tweet.</p>
<p>I am always ready to be persuaded, however, and look forward to all of today&rsquo;s discussions.&nbsp; I would like to thank Brian Schorr and the other members of the Committee for their dedication, as well as Cristina Martin Firvida, Marc Sharma, Andrew Sporkin, Adam Moore, and the countless others here at the Commission for their hard work in putting together today&rsquo;s meeting.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-iac-121024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn14" name="_ednref14">[14]</a></p>

<title>“The Investor’s Advocate”: Prepared Remarks Before The Investor Advisory Committee, SEC Chair Gary Gensler, Washington D.C., Dec. 10, 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-investors-advocate-prepared-remarks-before-the-investor-advisory-committ/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-investors-advocate-prepared-remarks-before-the-investor-advisory-committ/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good morning. I am pleased to meet with the Investor Advisory Committee. As today&rsquo;s meeting is the last of this Administration, I&rsquo;d like to share some reflections about this Committee and its importance to everyday investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As is customary, I&rsquo;d note that my views are my own as the 33rd Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and I am not speaking on behalf of my fellow Commissioners or the staff.</p>
<p>When President Franklin Roosevelt and Congress enacted the securities laws in the 1930s, they had lived through the 1920s when hucksters, fraudsters, scam artists, and Ponzi-like schemers took advantage of investors. They learned what happens when unregulated markets were left on their own. They understood that protecting investors was critical to the functioning of capital markets.</p>
<p>In 1937, the SEC&rsquo;s third Chair, William O. Douglas, went further in speaking of the importance of the SEC in fulfilling Congress&rsquo; vision. At his first press conference, he told members of the press that, in this country, &ldquo;We have got brokers&rsquo; advocates; we have got Exchange advocates; we have got investment-banker advocates; and we are the investor&rsquo;s advocate.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/investors-advocate-prepared-remarks-investor-advisory-committee?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>His words are every bit as relevant 87 years later. We, at the SEC, are the investor&rsquo;s advocate.</p>
<p>Protecting investors is fundamental to each part of the SEC&rsquo;s current three-part mission.</p>
<p>The first part of our mission is, in fact, to protect investors.</p>
<p>At its core, investor protection helps promote trust in our capital markets. Thus, it undergirds the second part of our mission, which is to promote fair, orderly, and efficient markets. The only way to truly have fair, orderly, and efficient markets is to look out for investors.</p>
<p>Further, investor protection is fundamental to the third part of our mission, to facilitate capital formation. Issuers benefit from the broad public&rsquo;s trust in the markets and willingness to participate in offerings.</p>
<p>This Committee, in its current form, is a direct result of a breakdown in those markets&mdash;as witnessed in the 2008 financial crisis. As part of the Dodd-Frank reforms enacted after the crisis, Congress mandated the creation of the Investor Advisory Committee. Though the SEC had benefitted from earlier advisory committees, Congress created this committee to ensure that investors are able to make their voices heard in the Commission&rsquo;s policy deliberations. The SEC may be the investor&rsquo;s advocate, but we benefit from hearing directly from investors.</p>
<p>During my tenure as Chair, the Committee has raised important issues concerning everyday investors&mdash;including protections for older Americans, for self-directed investors, and for those investing in Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (&ldquo;SPACs&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Today, you will continue in that tradition and advise the Commission on mandatory arbitration clauses, as well as the risk and opportunities of everyday investors investing in alternative assets. The Committee also will discuss a recommendation regarding finfluencers and social media.</p>
<p>Investor protection promotes trust in our securities markets. It&rsquo;s what brings investors and issuers to the market like fans to a football game. It&rsquo;s what underpins the world&rsquo;s largest capital markets. It&rsquo;s what has contributed to our nation&rsquo;s great economic success these last 90 years.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I have felt so privileged to lead this mission-driven agency these past four years and do my part on behalf of the American public.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fitting that William O. Douglas&rsquo;s words have long hung on a plaque outside of the Chair&rsquo;s office at the SEC. From the 3rd to the 33rd Chair and beyond, the importance of investor protection transcends eras,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/investors-advocate-prepared-remarks-investor-advisory-committee?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;markets, and Commissions.</p>
<p>This Committee&rsquo;s work gives those words, &ldquo;we are the investor&rsquo;s advocate,&rdquo; added weight.</p>
<p>I thank all the members for your willingness to serve, and for sharing your important perspectives on behalf of investors.&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The three European Supervisory Authorities (EBA, EIOPA and ESMA - the ESAs) today published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-12/Joint_ESA_Final_Report_on_Art_97_Guidelines_MiCAR.pdf">joint Guidelines</a>&nbsp;intended to facilitate consistency in the regulatory classification of crypto-assets under MiCAR. The Guidelines include a standardised test to promote a common approach to classification as well as templates market participants should use when communicating to supervisors the regulatory classification of a crypto-asset.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>To support market participants and supervisors in adopting a convergent approach to the classification of crypto-assets the templates for explanations and legal opinions provide descriptions of the regulatory classification of crypto-assets in the following cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asset-referenced tokens&nbsp;(ARTs): The white paper for the issuance of ARTs must be accompanied by a legal opinion that explains the classification of the crypto-asset &ndash; in particular, the fact it is not an electronic money token (EMT) nor a crypto-asset excluded from the scope of MiCAR.</li>
<li>Crypto-assets that are not ARTs or EMTs under MiCAR: The white paper for the crypto-asset must be accompanied by an explanation of the classification of the crypto-asset &ndash; in particular, the fact that it is not an EMT, an ART or crypto-asset excluded from the scope of MiCAR.</li>
</ul>
<p>The overall aim of these Guidelines is to promote convergence in classification for the consistent application of MiCAR across the EU. In turn, this is intended to contribute to enhancing consumer/investor protection, securing a level playing field, and mitigating risks of regulatory arbitrage. &nbsp;These guidelines will be translated into the official EU languages and published on the ESAs&rsquo; websites. The guidelines will apply from three months after the publication of the translations.</p>
<h4><span>Standardised test for crypto-assets</span></h4>
<p><img alt="Standardised test for crypto-assets" height="890" src="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/inline-images/image_16.png" width="629" /></p>
<h4><span>Background and next step</span></h4>
<p>The Guidelines have been developed in accordance with Article 97(1) of the Regulation on Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCAR) (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/1114/oj">Regulation (EU) 2023/1114</a>) which requires the ESAs, by 30 December 2024, to jointly issue Guidelines in accordance with Article 16 of the ESA Founding Regulations (Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, Regulation 1094/2010, Regulation 1095/2010) to specify the content and form of the explanation accompanying the crypto-asset white paper referred to in Article 8(4), and the legal opinions on the qualification of asset-referenced tokens (ARTs) referred to in Article 17(1), point (b)(ii), and Article 18(2), point (e) of MiCAR. The Guidelines are required to include a template for the explanation and the opinion and a standardised test for the classification of crypto-assets. This is the only joint ESA policy mandate under MiCAR.</p>
<p>MiCAR establishes regimes for regulating the issuance, offering to the public, and admission to trading of ARTs and EMTs and other crypto-assets. The Regulation also establishes a framework for crypto-asset service provision.</p>
<p>The regime for ARTs and EMTs established by MiCAR entered into application at the end of June 2024, with other parts of the Regulation (issuance of other types of crypto-assets, and crypto-asset service provision) entering into application at end-2024.</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">The EU-U.S. Joint Financial Regulatory Forum took place on December 4-5, 2024, with participants exchanging views on topics of mutual interest as part of their regular financial regulatory dialogue. &nbsp;The dialogue was co-chaired by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the European Commission.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">EU participants included representatives of the European Commission, European Banking Authority (EBA), European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), European Central Bank (ECB), and Single Resolution Board (SRB).</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">U.S. participants included representatives from the U.S. Department of the Treasury and staff from independent regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board (FRB), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">The Forum emphasized close,&nbsp;ongoing U.S. and EU cooperation in a range of areas and focused on seven themes: (1) market developments and financial stability; (2) operational resilience and digital finance; (3) the sharing and financial reporting of financial data; (4) anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT); (5) sustainable finance; (6) banking and insurance; and (7) capital markets. &nbsp;Agency participation varied across themes, with representatives expressing views on issues in their respective areas of responsibility.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">Participants started the conversation by focusing on financial stability and market developments. &nbsp;Globally, while inflation has continued to moderate, downside risks to the economic outlook continue to persist amid increased geopolitical tensions. &nbsp;Participants discussed financial stability vulnerabilities. Concerns remain around asset valuations, which remain elevated relative to fundamentals across several asset classes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants highlighted the importance of implementing robust prudential regulatory frameworks and supervisory practices as well as effective macroprudential policies. &nbsp;Participants discussed the importance of strong and consistent regulatory standards in particular for internationally active banks. &nbsp;International cooperation and continued dialogue, including in international fora, remain important for discussing appropriate and comparable regulatory standards, monitoring vulnerabilities, and enhancing the resilience of the financial system and its ability to withstand shocks, and preserving the level playing field.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">Participants continued their exchange of views on the use of artificial intelligence in financial services, looking at opportunities and challenges, but also implications for regulation, supervision, and financial stability. &nbsp;Both sides expressed interest in continuing the conversation on the topic, including in international fora. &nbsp;EU participants provided an update on the current implementation work under the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA). &nbsp;U.S. participants shared updates on the Treasury-FRB Critical Providers Dialogue, and the CFTC provided an update on its approach to operational resilience, including its proposed Operational Resilience Framework for Futures Commission Merchants, Swap Dealers, and Major Swap Participants. &nbsp;EU participants provided an update on the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) Regulation and shared considerations for the ongoing development of the Digital Euro, as well as underscoring the importance of the Financial Stability Board&rsquo;s work on issues related to crypto-assets, including stablecoins. &nbsp;U.S. Treasury shared considerations about a possible federal payments framework to include non-bank payment service providers. &nbsp;Participants discussed the importance of international cooperation to harness the benefits of digital financial innovation, while mitigating its risks. Both sides also emphasized the importance of continued coordination of international payments matters, including under the G20 Roadmap for Enhancing Cross-Border Payments.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">Participants also touched upon regulatory proposals and recent developments relating to managing consumer financial data within each jurisdiction, specifically the CFPB&rsquo;s final rule on&nbsp;Personal Financial Data Rights and the European Commission&rsquo;s proposal for a Regulation on Financial Data Access (FIDA).&nbsp; U.S. participants provided an update regarding ongoing work on the Financial Data Transparency Act.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">Both&nbsp;sides exchanged notes on the recent developments in the field of anti-money laundering and combatting the financing of terrorism.&nbsp; U.S. participants provided an update on the ongoing implementation of the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020, including the Corporate Transparency Act, as well as the issuance of two final rules to help safeguard the residential real estate, and investment adviser sectors from illicit finance. Participants also discussed the potential illicit finance risk related to stablecoins. &nbsp;EU participants provided an update on work to implement the recently adopted Anti-Money Laundering Package including the establishment of the new Anti-Money Laundering Authority.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">Participants discussed their respective work in the area of sustainable finance, including on climate disclosures and other corporate sustainability-related topics. An exchange also took place on recent developments on sustainable finance at international level, including the work of the G20&rsquo;s Sustainable Finance Working Group, while the EU provided an update on work of the International Platform for Sustainable Finance.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">An exchange followed to provide updates on U.S. and EU bank regulatory proposals and developments. &nbsp;Both sides gave an overview on the state of play of their respective rulemakings and regulatory frameworks which would implement the final set of Basel III reforms.&nbsp;Participants highlighted the importance of implementing Basel-based standards to enhance the stability of the financial system. Participants also informed each other of the latest developments in banking resolution matters. EU participants updated about the state of negotiations of the crisis management and deposit insurance framework. This was followed by an exchange on the interactions between U.S. securities laws and open bank bail-in operationalization, where participants took stock of continued engagement since the last Forum and in light of ongoing discussions in relevant international fora, emphasizing the importance of effective resolution frameworks in a cross-border context.&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;</em>Participants continued with an exchange on insurance-related matters, including on insurance recovery and resolution, and macroprudential developments. &nbsp;Participants also exchanged views on recent developments concerning climate-related financial risks assessment and related tools, during which the ECB presented recent developments in climate-related financial risks and their supervision and highlighted the importance of banks taking decisive steps to integrate climate and environmental risks into their strategy, governance and risk management.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">On capital markets, EU provided an update on work on the shortening of the settlement cycle in the European Union. &nbsp;The SEC shared observations on the lessons that could be learned and provided an update six months from the U.S. migration to T+1. &nbsp;The SEC provided also an update on their rules on clearing U.S. Treasuries. &nbsp;Discussions continued with an exchange on fund reforms. &nbsp;EU participants provided an update on their macroprudential review in the Non-Bank Financial Institution space.&nbsp; EU participants also touched upon the proposed Savings and Investment Union.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">The Forum closed with an update from U.S. participants on the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA).</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">Participants acknowledged the importance of the Forum in fostering ongoing financial regulatory dialogue between the United States and the European Union and will continue to discuss the scope of the potential implications of respective policies and laws in each other&rsquo;s jurisdictions. &nbsp;They further acknowledged that regular communication on regulatory and supervisory issues of mutual concern is important to support financial stability, investor protection, market integrity, and a level playing field.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">Participants will continue to engage on these topics, as well as on other topics of mutual interest, ahead of the next Forum meeting anticipated in summer 2025.</p>

<title>Remarks Before The 2024 AICPA &amp; CIMA Conference On Current SEC And PCAOB Developments: Accounting Matters, Paul Munter, SEC Chief Accountant, Washington D.C., Dec. 9, 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/remarks-before-the-2024-aicpa-and-cima-conference-on-current-sec-and-pcaob-develop/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/remarks-before-the-2024-aicpa-and-cima-conference-on-current-sec-and-pcaob-develop/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you to the AICPA for inviting me to speak with you today.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/munter-remarks-aicpa-cima-conference-120924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn1" name="_ednref1"><span>[1]</span></a>&nbsp;In my role as the SEC&rsquo;s Chief Accountant, I get to see first-hand the collective efforts put forth by the accounting profession towards the goal of ensuring that our financial markets continue to be supported by high quality financial information.</p>
<p>Like many of you, my experience in the accounting profession has been an exciting and unpredictable journey, taking me from colleges in Texas, Colorado and Florida to auditing in Miami and elsewhere; from an academic fellowship at the SEC here in Washington D.C. to serving as a partner at a large firm in New York and London, and now back once again at the SEC, leading the Office of the Chief Accountant for the past four years. Accounting has provided me with tremendous opportunities to travel the world, work with and learn from hundreds of incredible individuals from many different backgrounds and cultures, grow personally and professionally, and engage with and mentor the next generation of accounting professionals.</p>
<p>The most meaningful part of my accounting career has been the opportunity and responsibility to serve in the public interest. Now, when I say serving in the public interest, I&rsquo;m not referring solely to my role as a civil servant at the SEC. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong&mdash;I feel fortunate to be in a position to have a meaningful impact on the quality of financial information and audit quality to protect investors and support capital formation&mdash;but when I say serving in the public interest, I am referring to what I believe makes accounting a&nbsp;<i>profession</i>&nbsp;and not just a job (and I&rsquo;ll add, it&rsquo;s certainly not an industry!). There are certain responsibilities that come along with being a member of a profession. In addition to important professional conduct responsibilities, there is a public interest aspect to being a CPA. Whether you are a civil servant, auditor, tax accountant, preparer, or other accounting professional, I urge you to always keep in mind the &ldquo;Public&rdquo; aspect of Certified&nbsp;<i>Public</i>&nbsp;Accountant.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, across the globe, we have observed high-profile cases of unethical behavior by accountants that were not limited to just one firm, one issuer, or one jurisdiction. The recurrence of ethical lapses has adverse consequences on the accounting profession and global capital markets, undermining public trust in both accounting professionals and financial reporting. It also raises broader concerns about the culture and governance within accounting firms and issuers.</p>
<p>Accountants serve as important gatekeepers to promote the integrity of our markets and protect investors regardless of whether they are internal or external auditors, preparers, tax professionals, audit committee members, or serve in other roles. The value of an accountant&rsquo;s services depends on their credibility and trustworthiness. Trust is hard to gain and easy to lose, both individually and as a profession, so accountants should consider the importance of building and maintaining trust every single day.</p>
<p>For auditors, the foundation of this trust lies in the auditor&rsquo;s required independence. Every member of an audit firm should keep this in mind, and audit firm leadership should reinforce this message by actively championing the principles in the auditor independence rules, as opposed to setting a tone of independence as a compliance exercise where independence violations and the resultant enforcement actions are merely a &ldquo;cost of doing business.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/munter-remarks-aicpa-cima-conference-120924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>For audit firms and issuers, a strong culture and tone at the top that prioritizes doing the right thing above all else empowers all accountants, regardless of their role or level of experience, to exercise professional skepticism and, where appropriate, to challenge management. In many cases, fraud is eventually uncovered by an accountant who exercises professional skepticism, refuses to stop asking questions, and doesn&rsquo;t succumb to pressure, but these behaviors are also key to elevating financial reporting and audit quality.</p>
<p>In addition to the importance of a strong, ethical tone at the top, there is academic research that shows that behavior is driven the most by the people that are directly around you, which some refer to as the &ldquo;mood in the middle&rdquo; or the &ldquo;buzz at the bottom.&rdquo;<span>&nbsp;</span>For example, an academic study specific to auditors showed that staff auditors will be more influenced by the tone of their supervising senior than the partner when these two individuals provide conflicting tones.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/munter-remarks-aicpa-cima-conference-120924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;Leaders should therefore ensure that the tone they set at the top is actually flowing through the rest of the organization. While this academic study focused on auditors, I believe the same concept holds true across all practice areas of a firm or issuer&mdash;good ethical behavior has an impact on the decision-making and integrity of professionals. Further, when less-experienced accountants&rsquo; professional experience is anchored in doing the right thing, they are more likely to become leaders with this same mindset.</p>
<p>With ongoing concerns in our profession about our ability to continue to attract and retain talented individuals who are dedicated to serving in the public interest, I believe we are at an inflection point.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/munter-remarks-aicpa-cima-conference-120924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;That is why all of us should remember that those professionals around us are learning by our example and taking our lead&mdash;it is incumbent upon each of us to take seriously our responsibility to build and maintain public trust in our profession. In this regard, I&rsquo;d like to share two examples of how we can promote public interest in our work.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>First</i>, companies raising money from the public are part of a basic bargain under our federal securities laws. Under that basic bargain, investors get to decide what risks they wish to take, while those companies have an obligation to provide decision-useful information to investors on a regular basis. Fundamental to the functioning of this basic bargain is that the information companies provide to investors be of high quality. To this end, I believe it&rsquo;s critical that preparers view financial reporting as a communication activity, and not simply a compliance exercise. Companies benefit from a lower cost of capital when they report financial information that meets investors&rsquo; information needs.</li>
<li><i>Second</i>, audit professionals have a difficult job&mdash;they must sometimes make difficult determinations that potentially pit the public interest against self- or firm-interest. But that is precisely how public accountants fulfill their critical gatekeeping function to protect investors: by ensuring that issues are promptly identified and addressed. Keeping in mind the important role of the independent auditor as a gatekeeper, auditors would be well-served to view investors, and not management, as their client. This is why, by statute it is not management but the independent audit committee that is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, and oversight of the work of the auditor.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/munter-remarks-aicpa-cima-conference-120924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;Audit committees can set a proper tone by emphasizing to the independent auditor that the auditor is required to directly report to the audit committee and not to management, and also that the auditor should view investors as the auditor&rsquo;s ultimate client.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, these are just two examples, so please remember: what you do matters, not just to the issuer you may be engaged by, but to investors and the public at large. Your work has a direct bearing on the financial well-being of the global economy and all participants in that economy.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the importance of working together as members of a profession in the public interest, I&rsquo;m reminded of a speech I heard 35 years ago at the AICPA&rsquo;s sixteenth annual National Conference on Current SEC Developments. I was sitting in the audience, much like you are today, when then-SEC Chair, David Ruder, shared his perspectives on the interaction between the accounting profession, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo;), the business community, and the SEC in setting accounting standards.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/munter-remarks-aicpa-cima-conference-120924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn6" name="_ednref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;I would like to expand on some of the themes included in that speech and build on the relevance of his message for standard setting in today&rsquo;s environment.</p>
<p>Just as Chair Ruder said 35 years ago, high quality standard setting requires the cooperative efforts of all involved parties, including the standard setter, the many different stakeholders impacted by the quality of standard setting, including investors, and the Commission, which has a vital oversight responsibility. Today, we are focused on standard setting not just by the FASB as the SEC-recognized private-sector accounting standard setter for U.S. GAAP, but also by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (&ldquo;PCAOB&rdquo;), International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and others.</p>
<p>Essential to the cooperative efforts of all parties involved is a continued focus on the underlying objective to provide high quality financial information, supported by high quality independent audits, for the benefit of investors. The development of high quality standards, and high quality implementation of those standards, leads to investors receiving decision-useful financial information and promotes investor confidence in our markets, which results in a lower cost of capital for issuers.</p>
<p>To further frame my remarks today, I&rsquo;d like to highlight several points in the history of our accounting standard-setting process that are especially relevant to our activities today.</p>
<ul>
<li>Among other authorities, the Securities Act of 1933 gave the Commission, at its inception, broad authority to prescribe the accounting standards to be followed by issuers for the purpose of complying with federal securities laws.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/munter-remarks-aicpa-cima-conference-120924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn7" name="_ednref7">[7]</a></li>
<li>In 1937, through Accounting Series Release (&ldquo;ASR&rdquo;) No. 1, the Commission announced that it would publish &ldquo;opinions on accounting principles for the purpose of contributing to the development of uniform standards and practices on major accounting questions.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/munter-remarks-aicpa-cima-conference-120924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn8" name="_ednref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;Driving uniformity in standards and practices remains equally important today. I believe financial reporting that is comparable for similar facts and circumstances, both between companies and over time, should be a primary goal of accounting standard setting.</li>
<li>In 1938, the Commission issued ASR No. 4, warning that &ldquo;financial statements . . . prepared in accordance with accounting principles for which there is no substantial authoritative support . . . will be presumed to be misleading or inaccurate despite disclosures . . . provided the matters involved are material.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/munter-remarks-aicpa-cima-conference-120924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn9" name="_ednref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;To translate that prescient message for today&rsquo;s environment, I would say that accounting is critical, and disclosure is no substitute for getting the accounting right on difficult or complex issues, particularly since getting the accounting right is vital to consistency and comparability for investors. That message is relevant to both preparers applying accounting standards and the standard setters themselves. In standard setting, I believe that expanded disclosures can be beneficial to investors, but should never be viewed as an alternative to developing authoritative recognition and measurement standards that accurately reflect the economic substance of a transaction.</li>
<li>In 1973, the FASB was formed as an independent organization responsible for setting accounting and financial reporting standards, and the Commission formally recognized the FASB&rsquo;s standards as &ldquo;authoritative&rdquo; in the absence of any additional or contrary determination by the Commission.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/munter-remarks-aicpa-cima-conference-120924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn10" name="_ednref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;Almost thirty years later, in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Congress established statutory criteria and principles for the Commission to designate a private entity standard setter for accounting and auditing purposes and recognize the accounting principles established by such entity as &ldquo;generally accepted&rdquo; for purposes of the federal securities laws, which critically required an equitable shared funding mechanism with accounting support fees that foreclosed &lsquo;voluntary&rsquo; payments by issuers in exchange for actual or perceived preferential standard-setting outcomes.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/munter-remarks-aicpa-cima-conference-120924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn11" name="_ednref11">[11]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Back in 1989, then SEC Chair Ruder remarked that, &ldquo;While the formation of the FASB was a response to criticisms, it was not intended to end criticism. Because of the controversial nature of standard setting, ongoing criticism was to be expected.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/munter-remarks-aicpa-cima-conference-120924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn12" name="_ednref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;He went on to describe Congressional criticism of the SEC when it decided to continue looking to the private sector for authoritative accounting standard setting. However then-SEC Chair Ruder also noted a 1977 Congressional report that cited the accounting profession&rsquo;s desire and willingness to respond to criticism and take initiatives for improvement as a factor that weighed in favor of private independent standard setting.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/munter-remarks-aicpa-cima-conference-120924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn13" name="_ednref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;I believe that desire and willingness to address today&rsquo;s accounting standard-setting challenges is very much present within today&rsquo;s accounting profession, and I encourage all stakeholders to engage in the standard-setting process through constructive engagement and cooperation. Engagement with the accounting and auditing standard-setting process is more constructive when it includes suggestions on how to improve a standard rather than simply criticizing a proposal.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in a recently published statement regarding the significance of the FASB completing its comprehensive updates to the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting, I believe a focus on the Conceptual Framework by the FASB and all stakeholders involved in standard setting can facilitate effective collaboration.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/munter-remarks-aicpa-cima-conference-120924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn14" name="_ednref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;Feedback from stakeholders that is grounded in the Conceptual Framework, including a focus on financial statements being relevant and faithfully representing the underlying economics, effectively ensures that such feedback is, in fact, constructive. I also encourage FASB Board members to clearly articulate the basis for their individual standard-setting decisions and to explain the reasons for any deviation from the principles laid out in the Conceptual Framework to help stakeholders better understand both the standard in question and its application.</p>
<p>I encourage all of you to provide thoughtful feedback to the FASB as part of its current agenda consultation process. One accounting topic that is currently on the FASB&rsquo;s research agenda in response to calls by investors for improvements is the statement of cash flows.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/munter-remarks-aicpa-cima-conference-120924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn15" name="_ednref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;A clear and accurate depiction of the nature and quality of an issuer&rsquo;s cash flows can serve as an important tool for investors to make informed judgments regarding an issuer&rsquo;s ability to generate positive future net cash flows, meet its financial obligations, and pay dividends or otherwise return cash to investors. I am supportive of the FASB continuing to evaluate approaches to improve this critical component of high quality financial reporting for investors, including ways to improve consistency and comparability in cash flow classification, transparency of the relationship between the statement of cash flows and the balance sheet and income statement, and more information about non-cash transactions. Given the importance of cash flow information for investors, I also remind preparers and auditors to ensure that the statement of cash flows and related cash and non-cash disclosures are provided the same quality focus as other components of the financial statements. I also think that discussions concerning statement of cash flows provide a good reminder that when considering investor input to the FASB, it is important to dig deeper into that input and better understand what investors are telling us about their informational needs. For example, I have heard some investors say they either do not want or need a direct method cash flow statement. Instead, some investors say they want more information about things like cash collected from customers, cash paid to employees, cash paid to suppliers and other creditors, etc., all of which sounds like direct method cash flow information without the label!</p>
<p>Turning now to the Commission&rsquo;s oversight role with respect to auditing standards, much like the comments then-SEC Chair Ruder made 35 years ago related to accounting standards, audit standard setting requires the desire and willingness to respond to input and undertake initiatives for improvement. The development of new auditing standards fundamentally changed with the passing of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which led to the establishment of the PCAOB. The Commission has responsibilities defined by statute related to oversight of the PCAOB&rsquo;s standard-setting and rulemaking process. Once the Board adopts an audit standard or rule, the Commission publishes the new standard or rule in the Federal Register for public comment. Thereafter the Commission considers any comments received and determines whether the PCAOB&rsquo;s new standard or rule is consistent with Title I of SOX, is in the public interest, and serves an investor protection purpose. As demonstrated with the Commission&rsquo;s recent approval of several PCAOB standards and rules, including the PCAOB&rsquo;s update to the general responsibilities of the auditor in conducting an audit<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/munter-remarks-aicpa-cima-conference-120924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn16" name="_ednref16">[16]</a>&nbsp;and the PCAOB&rsquo;s standard regarding the quality control systems of audit firms,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/munter-remarks-aicpa-cima-conference-120924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn17" name="_ednref17">[17]</a>&nbsp;overseeing the PCAOB&rsquo;s audit standards is an important statutory responsibility of the Commission because those standards and rules are the basis for trust in the audited financial statements on which investors make investment and voting decisions. My earlier comments about engaging constructively in the standard-setting process are equally applicable to the PCAOB&rsquo;s standard-setting and rule-making process as well as to the Commission&rsquo;s consideration of those standards and rules.</p>
<p>In closing, I wish to reiterate my firm belief that accounting and auditing matter and our profession is vital to capital formation and capital flows. Our financial markets and our economy rest on the bedrock confidence of investors in financial reporting, which in turn relies upon the collective efforts of all accounting professionals involved in our financial reporting system. Every accountant has a professional responsibility to conduct our work in a manner consistent with applicable standards, rules, and ethical obligations. When you maintain a focus on investors and the public interest in every decision you make, the broader objective of providing high quality financial information can be achieved, ensuring that what you do matters. Thank you for your dedication to advancing our profession and I look forward to your questions.</p>

<title>ICE Launches Long European Union Bond Index Futures - Futures Reference ICE 8-13 Year European Union Index</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ice-launches-long-european-union-bond-index-futures-futures-reference-ice-8-13/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ice-launches-long-european-union-bond-index-futures-futures-reference-ice-8-13/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data today announced the launch of Long European Union (EU) Bond Index futures along with the first trades in the contract.</p>
<p>The cash-settled futures contract references the ICE 8-13 Year European Union Index (Ticker: G0EU8T13) which tracks the performance of long-term debt issued by the EU.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This innovative product provides a much-needed solution for managing exposure to EU sovereign bonds efficiently,&rdquo; said Mirco Bulega, Partner at ExodusPoint Capital Management U.K. &ldquo;We are pleased to see ICE leading the way in bringing such tools to market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Index is produced by ICE Data Indices (IDI), a recognized third country benchmark administrator under the U.K. Benchmarks Regulation. The ICE 8-13 Year European Union Index is a subset of the ICE European Union Index, including all securities with a remaining term to final maturity greater than or equal to 8 years and less than 13 years. The Index tracks exposure to a specific point on the EU curve and the historical volatility of the Index is similar to other European Bond futures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harmonized EU debt is an emerging space and as it scales, market participants need a futures hedging tool to help them manage risk,&rdquo; said Caterina Caramaschi, Vice President, Financial Derivatives at ICE. &ldquo;By introducing an equity-style index-based instrument that is cash-settled, ICE is opening up EU debt to a potentially larger pool of liquidity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the interest and debate around the status of European Union bonds not being included in sovereign bond indices, we saw that customers wanted a way to invest in, and manage, exposure to EU debt,&rdquo; said Varun Pawar, Chief Product Officer of ICE Fixed Income and Data Services. &ldquo;By leveraging ICE&rsquo;s leading fixed income pricing and reference data, IDI&rsquo;s index construction capabilities, and ICE&rsquo;s global futures team, we have created a product that allows customers to manage this risk, demonstrating the product innovation we can bring to customers across global financial markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The contract is available to trade and clear alongside ICE&rsquo;s deeply liquid, multi-currency European, U.K. and Swiss interest rate markets, including benchmarks Euribor, &euro;STR, SONIA and SARON as well as Gilts, the benchmark for the U.K. government bond yield curve. Open interest is up over 20% year-over-year across ICE&rsquo;s interest rate derivatives complex.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><b>Ten key financial institutions in Poland have presented a joint vision of the future of the European capital markets. The position paper includes eight key recommendations for advancing the Capital Markets Union and building the Savings and Investments Union. The priorities include a balanced approach to market integration, attracting individual investors, developing pension funds and plans and PE/VC/PD, simplifying regulations for SMEs, enhancing financial education, fostering market liquidity, optimizing post-trade processes, and rebuilding investment banking. The Polish presidency of the EU Council in 2025 will be an opportunity to promote these priorities among Member States to increase their impact on the development of the common capital market.</b></p>
<p>Polish institutions of the capital, insurance and banking markets and market infrastructure have jointly developed the position paper named "Advancing Capital Markets Union and Building Savings and Investments Union: Pan-European Integration and EU Regional Capital Markets Growth". The document, which was prepared as a result of advanced consultations, advocates for balanced pan-European integration while maintaining the competitive dynamics of regional markets, which are the foundation for financing small and medium-sized enterprises, a key sector for innovation in the EU economy.</p>
<p>Considering the intensification of debate on the shape of the European market in recent months, the position paper presents eight proposals for strengthening European capital markets. The aim of the recommendations is to advance the Capital Markets Union and build the Savings and Investments Union.</p>
<p>The authors of the position paper emphasize that the European Union needs efficient access to capital to stimulate innovative enterprises, drive energy and digital transitions, and accelerate infrastructure investments. Small and medium-sized enterprises, which constitute a significant source of national income and employment in the EU, are key beneficiaries of financing raised on regional capital markets.</p>
<p>To fully unleash the potential of this sector, it is necessary to simplify regulations and reduce reporting requirements, which may currently constitute an important barrier for SMEs. For the development of European capital markets, it is crucial to continue to attract individual investors, who are an essential part of capital markets development. The recommendations also include proposals for the development of pension funds and plans as well as long-term investment products that allow households to build capital for the future. Particular attention is paid in the position paper to the private equity, venture capital and private debt markets, which play a key role in financing early-stage enterprises and innovative projects. The paper also draws attention to the need to foster the liquidity of markets, optimize post-transaction processes on the capital market that meet the needs of regional and local markets, and rebuild European investment banking. The intensification of financial education and the support for equity culture, which will increase awareness of the benefits of investing on the capital market, are also proposed as an essential element.</p>
<p>The paper presents the perspective of the Polish market in the debate on the shape of the European capital market and emphasizes the importance of the activities of Polish organizations that will be promoted during the Polish presidency of the EU Council. The key message will be the drive towards interoperable regional financial hubs that will reflect the specificity tailored to the needs of regional innovative SMEs. The Polish proposal thus emphasizes the balance between broad integration and maintaining the competitiveness of regional capital markets.</p>
<p>The position paper, prepared by key institutions of the Polish capital, insurance and banking markets and market infrastructure, is an important contribution to the debate on the future of the European financial market. Implementation of the recommendations can significantly accelerate the development of European capital markets, stimulate innovation in the EU economy, and create a sustainable and integrated financial system.</p>

<p>As 2024 draws to a close, the global exchange sector continues to demonstrate resilience and growth, driven by robust business models, increased trading activity, and strategic advancements. Exchanges are benefiting from a rise in non-trading revenues, equity and derivatives trading, and IPO volumes, setting an optimistic tone for the year ahead.</p>
<p>The FTSE Mondo Visione Index, a leading benchmark for the performance of publicly listed exchanges, closed November at 84,718.72 points, up 2.6% from October&rsquo;s close of 82,561.44 points.</p>

<h4>Standout Performers of the Month</h4>
<p>Aquis Exchange, a UK-based challenger stock exchange listed on the London Stock Exchange, emerged as the top performer in November, with an extraordinary 108.4% share price increase. The strong growth comes as Aquis is set to be acquired by SIX Group in a deal valued at &pound;194 million, representing a staggering 120% premium.</p>
<p>Herbie Skeete, Managing Director of Mondo Visione and Co-founder of the Index, commented:<br />&ldquo;Aquis Exchange&rsquo;s acquisition by SIX is strategically significant. While it may not drive immediate earnings growth, it offers long-term value by expanding SIX&rsquo;s geographic reach, enhancing technological capabilities, and diversifying revenue streams. This acquisition positions SIX to remain competitive in an evolving market landscape.&rdquo;<br />Other notable performers include the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, which saw an 18.9% rise in share price, and Nasdaq, with a 12.3% increase.</p>
<h4>Exchanges Facing Challenges</h4>
<p>On the other hand, S.C. Bursa de Valori Bucuresti S.A. recorded the steepest decline in November, with an 18% drop in share price. Brazil&rsquo;s B3 followed with a 15.5% decrease, and the Saudi Tadawul Group experienced a 9.7% decline.</p>
<h4>Looking Ahead</h4>
<p>Global exchanges are expected to continue focusing on scaling and diversifying their offerings, particularly in data, analytics, and technology. By enhancing capabilities and competitiveness, exchanges are positioning themselves to capitalize on future growth opportunities in an increasingly dynamic market.</p>

<title>Samsung Active Asset Management Launches KoAct US Natural Gas Infrastructure Active ETF, Which Is Benchmarked Against The Solactive US Natural Gas Infrastructure Index</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Solactive is pleased to announce another collaboration with Samsung Active Asset Management. The KoAct US Natural Gas Infrastructure Active ETF, linked to the Solactive US Natural Gas Infrastructure Index, is designed to provide investors with broad exposure to the US natural gas value chain, reflecting opportunities in energy transition and energy security.</strong></p>
<p>The natural gas sector acts as a pivotal player in balancing global energy needs while supporting sustainability goals. As a &ldquo;bridge fuel&rdquo;, natural gas has lower carbon emissions compared to other fossil fuels, making it an essential alternative to address the gap between rising energy consumption and environmental targets.<span><a href="https://www.solactive.com/samsung-active-asset-management-launches-koact-us-natural-gas-infrastructure-active-etf-which-is-benchmarked-against-the-solactive-us-natural-gas-infrastructure-index/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></span>&nbsp;For example, the US Energy Information Administration reported that gas consumption in the US reached a record 90 billion cubic feet per day in 2024, further indicating robust demand for natural gas. In a recent earnings report, TC Energy (an index constituent) said that North America&rsquo;s rising demand was driven by higher LNG exports, retiring coal plants and growing consumption in data centers associated with artificial intelligence operations.<span><a href="https://www.solactive.com/samsung-active-asset-management-launches-koact-us-natural-gas-infrastructure-active-etf-which-is-benchmarked-against-the-solactive-us-natural-gas-infrastructure-index/#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;</span>As such, the sector attracts substantial investment in infrastructure, such as pipelines and storage facilities, while being bolstered by a supportive regulatory framework.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.solactive.com/indices/?se=1&amp;index=DE000SL0JKG1">Solactive US Natural Gas Infrastructure Index</a></strong>&nbsp;aims to provide investors with transparent and comprehensive access to the US natural gas ecosystem. It is designed to track the performance of the top 25 US-listed companies active throughout the entire natural gas value chain. Utilizing a granular classification framework, the selection process includes sectors representing the upstream (exploration and production), midstream (transportation and storage) and downstream (distribution and manufacturing) areas of the industry. For diversification purposes, category weight caps and single security weight caps are also applied.</p>
<p><strong>The ETF listed on 10 December 2024 on the Korea Stock Exchange (KRX) with the ticker code 497780.KS.</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Timo Pfeiffer, Chief Markets Officer at Solactive, commented</span>:<strong>&ldquo;</strong><em>We are delighted to expand our partnership with Samsung Active Asset Management. The natural gas sector continues to be at the forefront of the energy transition, and with the Solactive US Natural Gas Infrastructure Index, we provide a</em><em>&nbsp;diversified and robust&nbsp;</em><em>benchmark that allows investors to participate in the evolving dynamics of the sector. We look forward to future collaborations with KoAct, jointly bringing more investment products to market, which address the demographic, climate, and technological trends of tomorrow.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">James Oh, Manager in the ETF Solution Department at Samsung Active Asset Management, commented:</span>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;We are pleased to collaborate with Solactive on the KoAct US Natural Gas Infrastructure Active ETF, which is strategically focused on the gas value chain. We believe natural gas will play a crucial role as the greenest of fossil fuels while meeting the rising demand for electricity. By making monthly distributions to investors, we aim to provide both growth potential and reliable income through this ETF.&rdquo;</em></p>

<div>
<p class="component-text">S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC (&ldquo;S&amp;P DJI&rdquo;), the world&rsquo;s leading index provider, and JPX Market Innovation &amp; Research, Inc. (&ldquo;JPXI&rdquo;) today announced the launch of the S&amp;P/JPX Prime Market 250 Index. The index tracks and measures the performance of the largest and most liquid stocks traded on the Prime Market of Tokyo Stock Exchange, Inc. (&ldquo;TSE&rdquo;). The index is designed to help facilitate transparent access to the ever-evolving Japanese equity market for offshore investors.<br /><br />In April 2022, TSE introduced three new markets: Prime, Standard and Growth to support the sustainable growth of listed companies, help enhance their corporate value over the medium- to-long term and provide an attractive cash market that is highly supported by a diverse range of investors in Japan and overseas. The Prime Market is positioned as a market for companies that have appropriate levels of market capitalization (liquidity) and which can be utilized as investment instruments for many institutional investors, as well as achieve higher quality of corporate governance, emphasizing the commitment to sustainable growth and improvement of medium- to long-term corporate value and encouraging constructive dialogue with investors at the center.<br /><br />The Japanese equity market has been experiencing steady growth and global interest in recent years as institutional investors seek out additional value and diversification opportunities across developed markets. To reflect this rising offshore interest, the S&amp;P/JPX Prime Market 250 Index uses the Prime Market as an investable base, covering the largest and most liquid 250 constituents &ndash; calculated by float-adjusted market capitalization &ndash; from a universe of more than 1,500 companies listed on the Prime Market.<br /><br />&ldquo;S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices is pleased to continue innovating and growing its cobranded index offerings with JPXI. S&amp;P DJI and Japan Exchange Group, Inc. (&ldquo;JPX&rdquo;) have a longstanding partnership since 1999, and share a commitment to advance market education, participation, and transparency in the Asia-Pacific and global markets through our family of independently governed and rules-based S&amp;P/JPX indices,&rdquo; said Dan Draper, Chief Executive Officer at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.<br /><br />&ldquo;JPX Market Innovation &amp; Research, Inc. is pleased to offer new investment opportunities in Japanese equities to overseas investors through this index which is based on the Prime Market - the market oriented to companies which center their business on constructive dialogue with global investors - thanks to our partnership with S&amp;P DJI which has extensive experience internationally,&rdquo; said Miyahara Koichiro, President &amp; CEO at JPX Market Innovation &amp; Research, Inc.<br /><br />The S&amp;P/JPX Prime Market 250 Index aims to mirror the sector weightings of the broader universe of stocks from the underlying TSE Prime Market Index. This weighting approach helps ensure that, with 250 out of the total universe of over 1,500 stocks, the index will still offer investors and other market participants the same approximate level of industry representation within the Prime Market.<br /><br />The 250 index constituents cover approximately 84% of the Prime Market universe float-adjusted market capitalization. The index rebalances quarterly to reflect the companies listed on the Prime Market as constituents and to ensure adequate market capitalization and liquidity.<br /><br />For more information about the S&amp;P/JPX Prime Market 250 Index and the range of S&amp;P/JPX indices, please visit the below page.</p>

<title>ASIC Proposes To Remake Relief Instrument For 31-Day Notice Term Deposits</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-proposes-to-remake-relief-instrument-for-31-day-notice-term-deposits/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-proposes-to-remake-relief-instrument-for-31-day-notice-term-deposits/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>ASIC is inviting feedback on its proposal to remake a legislative instrument that gives relief for 31-day notice term deposits, with a minor amendment to the current settings around pre and post-maturity notices.</span></p>
<p><span>ASIC Class Order [CO 14/1262]&nbsp;</span><em>Relief for 31-day notice term deposits&nbsp;</em><span>gives 31-day notice term deposits of up to five years concessional regulatory treatment as &lsquo;basic deposit products&rsquo; under the&nbsp;</span><em>Corporations Act 2001</em><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>As a condition of the current relief, authorised deposit-taking institutions (ADIs) are required to provide a pre-maturity notice to depositors before the term deposit rolls over into a new term and a post-maturity notice that notifies depositors of a grace period of seven days to exit the term deposit.</span></p>
<p><span>ASIC has received feedback that it is difficult for some ADIs to comply with the existing one business day timeframe required for post-maturity notices in Class Order [CO 14/1262]. This is due to mail delivery times where a term deposit customer has not opted in to receiving electronic communications.</span></p>
<p><span>To address these concerns, ASIC proposes to remake the legislative instrument, and give ADIs the option of combining the pre and post-maturity notices into a single notice that must be given to the depositor at least seven days, and no longer than 14 days, before maturity.</span></p>
<p><span>ADIs may continue to comply with the current one business day post-maturity notice if they prefer. The seven-day grace period will continue to apply as currently set out in Class Order [CO 14/1262].</span></p>
<p>ASIC considers the relief to still be a necessary and a useful part of the legislative framework, and to be operating effectively and efficiently, subject to the minor amendment detailed above.</p>
<h2>Consultation&nbsp;</h2>
<p><span>ASIC invites feedback from stakeholders on its proposal to remake the legislative instrument, which is due to sunset on 1 April 2025. Submissions should be sent by 5pm AEDT on 7 February 2025 to&nbsp;</span><a href="mailto:rri.consultation@asic.gov.au"><span>rri.consultation@asic.gov.au</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Class Order [CO 14/1262] was issued in December 2014. See Media Release (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2014-releases/14-347mr-asic-provides-relief-for-31-day-notice-term-deposits">14-347MR</a>)&nbsp;<em>ASIC provides relief for 31-day notice term deposits</em>.</p>
<p><span>Many ADIs require customers to provide 31 days&rsquo; notice before breaking a term deposit to help with liquidity management or to assist in meeting the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority&rsquo;s prudential liquidity standards for the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) under Prudential Standard APS 210&nbsp;</span><em>Liquidity</em>&nbsp;(APS 210)<span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Class Order [CO 14/1262] provides certainty for industry that 31-day notice term deposits will be treated as &lsquo;basic deposit products&rsquo; and not be subject to more onerous regulatory requirements, including a higher level of training standards and more prescriptive disclosure obligations.</span></p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority Launches “Regulatory Sandbox” Pilot For 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-launches-regulatory-sandbox-pilot-for/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-launches-regulatory-sandbox-pilot-for/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As part of the FMA's commitment to support financial services innovation, the FMA is launching a pilot &ldquo;regulatory sandbox&rdquo; and is asking for applications from interested parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A regulatory sandbox is a concept which allows firms to test innovative products, services or business models.&nbsp; An initial pilot phase will run from January to July 2025, with a decision on the need for a permanent FMA regulatory sandbox to be made later in the year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This pilot will be open to all parts of the financial sector that come under the FMA remit and can include both new entrants and those firms already with a market presence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pilot is also open to more than just regulated financial services, and can include products or services that, for example, simplify compliance solutions, or use blockchain or regulatory technologies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sandboxes can help spur innovation by allowing both startups and established licensed financial institutions to test new products and services in a controlled environment.</p>
<p>Firms can test their systems in a monitored space, allowing them to obtain a deeper understanding of supervisory expectations. The opportunity to adjust a product or service before full commercial launch may help reduce costs for firms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In return, the FMA has the chance to gain greater insights into the benefits and risks of financial innovation and new technologies. By first testing a product or service in a regulatory sandbox, we should be able to better assess the viability of innovative products and services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Experiences gained through such a testing phase should allow the FMA to react faster and more effectively to regulatory and supervisory problems. It should also highlight gaps around investor and customer protection, allowing development of more appropriate and timely solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA is very grateful for the constructive work and support from FintechNZ and its members ahead of this launch. We are now asking for expressions of interest from firms interested in joining the sandbox pilot over the next six months.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are also welcoming applications from those firms bringing new products to market outside of this six-month window, which will help us build a forward-looking perspective on potential demand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this initial phase we are looking for firms who:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a product ready to be tested in the New Zealand market with customers.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Understand what aspects of existing financial regulation apply to their product or service.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Have considered where they need guidance from the FMA and why participation in the sandbox will help to their &lsquo;go to market&rsquo; plans.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>To participate in the regulatory sandbox, firms will have to apply to the FMA. We will examine whether the application meets the criteria for participation, such as what barriers the firm is facing in bringing their product to market, whether these are areas that the FMA can influence and the need and readiness of the firm. This information will be used to help decide whether to accept the firm for testing in the 2025 pilot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="button-link--green-dark"><a href="https://forms.office.com/r/RHQdig1QGv" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Link to application form">Please complete the Regulatory Sandbox expression of interest form</a></span></p>
<p>Please complete the expression of interest form above or contact FMA Technical Specialist, FinTech &amp; Innovation Alan Crofts for more information. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />You can reach Alan at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:alan.crofts@fma.govt.nz">alan.crofts@fma.govt.nz</a>&nbsp;or 027 283 3859&nbsp;</p>

<title>SEC Charges Morgan Stanley Smith Barney For Policy Deficiencies That Resulted In Failure To Prevent And Detect Its Financial Advisors’ Theft Of Investor Funds</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-charges-morgan-stanley-smith-barney-for-policy-deficiencies-that-resulted-in/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-charges-morgan-stanley-smith-barney-for-policy-deficiencies-that-resulted-in/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC (MSSB) with failing to reasonably supervise four investment adviser and registered representatives (hereafter, financial advisors) who stole millions of dollars of advisory clients&rsquo; and brokerage customers&rsquo; funds and for failing to adopt policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent and detect such theft. To settle the charges, MSSB agreed to pay a $15 million penalty and accept certain undertakings.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, MSSB failed to adopt and implement policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent its financial advisors from using two forms of unauthorized third-party disbursements, Automated Clearing House (ACH) payments and certain patterns of cash wire transfers, to misappropriate funds from advisory client accounts and brokerage customer accounts. The order finds that MSSB financial advisors made hundreds of unauthorized transfers from customers&rsquo; or clients&rsquo; accounts to themselves or for their own benefit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Safeguarding investor assets is a fundamental duty of every financial services firm, but MSSB&rsquo;s supervisory and compliance policy failures let its financial advisors make hundreds of unauthorized transfers from their customer and client accounts and put many other such accounts at significant risk of harm,&rdquo; said Sanjay Wadhwa, Acting Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;However, today&rsquo;s resolution also takes into account the firm&rsquo;s several self-reports to, and substantial cooperation with, the Commission staff and its remedial efforts, including compensating the financial advisors&rsquo; victims and retaining a compliance consultant to conduct a comprehensive review of the relevant policies and procedures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, until at least December 2022, MSSB did not have a policy or procedure to screen externally initiated ACH payment instructions to detect instances in which an MSSB financial advisor assigned to the account bore the same name as the beneficiary listed in the ACH payment instructions. The order finds that this led to the firm failing to detect hundreds of unauthorized ACH transfers between May 2015 and July 2022 from its customers&rsquo; or clients&rsquo; accounts to pay the credit card bill of the financial advisor assigned to the MSSB account or to otherwise benefit the financial advisor.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that MSSB violated Section 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-7 thereunder and failed reasonably to supervise four former investment adviser and registered representatives within the meaning of Section 203(e)(6) of the Advisers Act and/or Section 15(b)(4)(E) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, MSSB consented to a cease-and-desist order, a censure, certain undertakings that include having a compliance consultant review all forms of third-party cash disbursements from customer and client accounts, and to the $15 million penalty referenced above. MSSB previously entered into settlement agreements with the affected customers and clients to compensate them for their losses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Jonathan Grant of the San Francisco Regional Office and Eric Kirsch, Nicholas Flath, Emmy Rush, and James Flynn of the New York Regional Office and supervised by Wendy Tepperman and Tejal Shah, also of the New York Regional Office.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Ian Bell With Defrauding Professional Athletes And Others In Fraudulent Day-Trading Scheme</title>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Denver resident Ian G. Bell with securities fraud for lying to investors and misappropriating their funds in connection with a fraudulent day-trading scheme.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint alleges that, between July 2020 and March 2023, Bell raised more than $1.3 million from at least 29 investors, including professional athletes in Colorado, who are unidentified in the complaint. The SEC alleges that Bell lied to investors about his trading performance, including by sending many of them fabricated account performance screenshots. According to the complaint, several of Bell&rsquo;s investors then referred their family and friends to Bell because of the false statements. The SEC further alleges that Bell lost nearly all of the investors&rsquo; money, kept hundreds of thousands of dollars for his personal use, and, to conceal his fraud, lied about his efforts to repay investors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When things sound too good to be true, they often are, which is why it is crucial that investors research any firm or individual who is seeking to manage their hard-earned money, even if they come recommended by friends of family,&rdquo; said Jason Burt, Regional Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Denver office. &ldquo;As for those individuals who are looking to follow in this defendant&rsquo;s footsteps, know that your odds of getting away with it are exceedingly low.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint charges Bell with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.</p>
<p>In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the District of Colorado today unsealed criminal charges against Bell.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Ty Cottrill and Anne Romero and supervised by Laura Metcalfe, Nicholas Heinke, and Jason Burt of the Denver Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Christopher Martin and supervised by Gregory Kasper, Mr. Heinke, and Mr. Burt.&nbsp;The SEC&rsquo;s complaint and the USAO&rsquo;s criminal charges follow parallel investigations by the SEC and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and IRS&ndash;Criminal Investigation.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued investor alerts on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investor.gov/protect-your-investments/fraud/how-avoid-fraud/red-flags-investment-fraud-checklist">red flags</a>&nbsp;of investment fraud.

<p>The Federal Reserve Board on Monday provided a technical clarification that its account access guidelines also apply to excess balance accounts, known as EBAs. An EBA is a limited-purpose account at a Federal Reserve Bank established for maintaining the reserve balances of eligible institutions. An EBA is managed by an agent on behalf of the participating institutions.</p>
<p>The Board's account access guidelines establish transparent, risk-based, and consistent factors for Reserve Banks to use in reviewing requests for access to accounts and services.</p>
<p>The guidance on excess balance accounts is effective upon its publication in the&nbsp;<em>Federal Register</em>, which is expected shortly.</p>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cme-group-micro-e-mini-equity-index-futures-surpass-3-billion-contracts-traded/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>CME Group, the world's leading derivatives marketplace, today announced that as of&nbsp;November 29, more than 3 billion Micro E-mini Equity Index futures traded across all four indices.</p>
<p>"With over three billion of these contracts traded in less than five years, our Micro E-mini Equity Index futures continue to establish themselves among the most actively traded and deeply liquid index products," said&nbsp;
Tim McCourt, Global Head of Equities, FX and Alternative Products at&nbsp;CME Group. "As investors continue to navigate ongoing market uncertainty, index choice is as important as ever. Our breadth of products across every major&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;index allow clients of all sizes to more nimbly scale index exposure up or down."</p>
<p>"Nasdaq&nbsp;and&nbsp;CME Group&nbsp;have been providing investors with access to the Nasdaq-100 Index<span>&reg;</span>&nbsp;through innovative products for more than 25 years, including the Micro E-mini Nasdaq-100 Index, which offer investors greater flexibility as they manage their portfolios," said&nbsp;
Emily Spurling, Senior Vice President and Head of Global Index at Nasdaq. "We extend our congratulations to&nbsp;CME Group&nbsp;on achieving this milestone and look forward to our continued collaboration to deliver products that give investors more exposure to our Nasdaq-100 Index<span>&reg;</span>&nbsp;ecosystem, which has included the most groundbreaking and innovative companies in the modern economy for nearly 40 years."</p>
<p>"S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices&nbsp;congratulates CME Group for reaching another significant market milestone," said&nbsp;
Tim Brennan, Global Head of Capital Markets at&nbsp;S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. "This latest milestone reinforces the ongoing strength of both the S&amp;P 500 Index, widely regarded as the best single gauge of the&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;equity market, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, one of the world's most watched and widely cited benchmarks."</p>
<p>"FTSE Russell congratulates CME Group on reaching this significant milestone of three billion contracts traded across its Micro E-mini derivatives complex," said&nbsp;
Shawn Creighton, Director of Index Derivatives Solutions for FTSE Russell. "As our valued, long-term partner, we are proud to have supported&nbsp;CME Group&nbsp;in such an achievement and look forward to continuing our collaborative work on growing the Russell 2000 product suite. Since its introduction in 1984, the Russell 2000 Index has been widely viewed as the leading benchmark for small cap performance, serving as the basis of investable products. The Micro E-Mini Russell 2000 futures provide investors access to a highly liquid and efficient&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;small cap equity risk management tool."</p>
<p>Micro E-mini Equity Index futures became available for trading on the S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq-100<span>&reg;</span>, Russell 2000 and Dow Jones Industrial Average in May of 2019, becoming one of the most successful new product launches in&nbsp;CME Group's&nbsp;nearly 180-year history. In addition, Micro E-mini S&amp;P MidCap 400 and Micro E-mini SmallCap 600 futures joined the Micro E-mini futures suite in&nbsp;March 2023.</p>
<p>Due to ongoing client demand, and the strong support of index partners, brokers and the intermediary community, these contracts have continued to grow. Additional highlights include:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>2.5 million contracts in average daily volume in 2024-to-date</li>
<li>19% of volume outside of&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;trading hours</li>
<li>More than 700 firms and 620,000 unique accounts have traded these contracts in the last year</li>
</ul>

<title>EACH’s Women In Clearing Series – Inspiration With Vicky Hsu, BlackRock</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/eachs-women-in-clearing-series-inspiration-with-vicky-hsu-blackrock/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/eachs-women-in-clearing-series-inspiration-with-vicky-hsu-blackrock/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Following the successful launch of the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12789353/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><b>Women in Clearing Network</b></a>,<b>&nbsp;</b>in March 2024 EACH launched&nbsp;<b>EACH&rsquo;s Women in Clearing Series</b>, an initiative with the objective of featuring a key female leader on a regular basis to inspire other professionals in the industry.</p>
<p>EACH's inspirational contributor this month is Vicky Hsu. Vicky is responsible for the identification, assessment and management of BlackRock&rsquo;s and its client's counterparty credit risks in EMEA. She also co-leads risk management coverage for Securities Lending. Vicky serves as a member of the Risk Committee of Eurex Clearing AG, advising the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board on any arrangements that may impact the risk management of the Central Counterparty.&nbsp; She previously was a member of the Market Structure and Electronic Trading Team within BlackRock&rsquo;s Global Trading Group.&nbsp; Prior to that, she was a member of the Counterparty Risk Team in New York, then in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Vicky kindly shares with us her personal and professional journey by responding to three questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>What was the aspect of yourself that you had to work on the most to get where you are now?</b></li>
</ul>
<p>For me, the biggest area of growth has been learning to balance depth with breadth. I&rsquo;ve always thrived on being a deep subject matter expert and producing high-quality results. Early in my career, that focus and attention to detail served me well &ndash; it helped me build expertise and credibility. However, as I took on more responsibility, I realized that being deeply immersed isn&rsquo;t always enough. I had to step back, see the bigger picture, understand how different pieces fit together, and think strategically. This shift required me to trust my team to handle the details, allowing me to focus more on aligning people, priorities, and outcomes.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>What key tip would you give for professionals to successfully develop in their careers?</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Identify role models that you admire &ndash; they are often your best bosses and senior leaders. Take the best from each of them and become a version of them that is authentic to you.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Act like a leader, and you will be recognized before you realize it.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put yourself in a position to benefit from new opportunities.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trust yourself.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>How do you see the future of clearing in 10 years?</b></li>
</ul>
<p>I believe the future of central clearing from a risk perspective will likely be defined by increasing complexity, e.g., launch of new products, and higher demands for resilience.&nbsp; Central clearinghouses (CCPs) play a critical role in mitigating counterparty risk and promoting financial stability, but as markets evolve, so do the challenges. CCPs will adopt more advanced risk management tools and techniques, leveraging technology and data analytics to better assess and manage risks.&nbsp; CCPs will also become more transparent &ndash; they will enhance their disclosure practices and provide more detailed information about their risk management frameworks and processes. This transparency will help build trust among market participants and regulators.</p>
<p>Lastly, I expect to see an increase in the number of CCPs. As a risk manager, having more CCPs provides potential options for diversification, which is important for managing concentration risk. The presence of multiple CCPs could foster competition, driving improvements in risk management standards and practices across the industry. Additionally, it will allow market participants to choose CCPs that best align with their risk profiles and business needs.</p>

<title>SEC Announces Departure Of Trading and Markets Division Director Haoxiang Zhu - Deputy Director David Saltiel To Serve As Acting Director</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-announces-departure-of-trading-and-markets-division-director-haoxiang-zhu/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Haoxiang Zhu, Director of the Division of Trading and Markets, will depart the agency effective Dec. 10, 2024. Upon Mr. Zhu&rsquo;s departure, David Saltiel, a Deputy Director who also heads the Division&rsquo;s Office of Analytics and Research, will serve as Acting Director.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to thank Haoxiang for his leadership of the Division of Trading and Markets for the last several years,&rdquo; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. &ldquo;In that time, we&rsquo;ve worked to bring central clearing to the Treasury market, comprehensively update the national market system rules for the first time in nearly two decades, and shorten the settlement cycle. Investors and issuers will benefit because of these reforms achieved during Haoxiang&rsquo;s time of service. I wish him very well in his next steps. I also want to thank David for stepping into this leadership role and for his invaluable counsel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During Mr. Zhu&rsquo;s tenure, the SEC undertook a number of initiatives to modernize the regulation of U.S. securities markets. The SEC expanded central clearing for Treasury repurchase and cash transactions, which will significantly strengthen the resiliency of the $28 trillion U.S. Treasuries market. The SEC also successfully shortened the settlement cycle to one day, which reduces risk and enhances efficiency in U.S. equities, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and other markets. To further increase transparency and competition in the $55 trillion U.S. equity market, the SEC modernized its disclosure requirements regarding execution quality and updated Regulation NMS, a collection of rules that govern the market-wide mechanics of stock trading. Additionally, the SEC updated existing regulation for broker-dealers and adopted new rules that increase the transparency and integrity of markets for securities lending, short selling, and security-based swaps. Besides rulemaking, Mr. Zhu also led the Division&rsquo;s efforts in the day-to-day oversight of exchanges, alternative trading systems, broker-dealers, FINRA, clearing agencies, and other market participants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been my greatest honor and privilege to serve at the SEC,&rdquo; said Mr. Zhu. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m immensely grateful to Chair Gensler and the other Commissioners for entrusting me the responsibility to lead the Division of Trading and Markets, which has a 90-year history of protecting U.S. capital markets and investors. My deep gratitude also goes to the Division&rsquo;s staff for their unwavering dedication to the agency&rsquo;s mission and incredibly diligent and thoughtful work. They inspire me every day. I encourage everyone to consider public service at some point in their professional career -- if you haven&rsquo;t done it already. The sense of purpose and pride and the knowledge that you&rsquo;ve done your best for the American public are the ultimate rewards.&rdquo;<br /><br />Mr. Zhu joined the SEC in December of 2021. He will return to the MIT Sloan School of Management as the Gordon Y. Billard Professor of Management and Finance and Associate Professor of Finance, a position he held before joining the SEC. Mr. Zhu also previously served as an academic expert for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Bank for International Settlements, a member of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago&rsquo;s Working Group on Financial Markets, and a Research Associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research. Mr. Zhu earned a B.A. in mathematics and computer science from the University of Oxford and a Ph.D. in finance from Stanford University Graduate School of Business.</p>
<p>Mr. Saltiel has served as a Deputy Director in the Division of Trading and Markets since November 2021 and as Associate Director of the Division&rsquo;s Office of Analytics and Research since 2016. He previously served as the Division&rsquo;s Acting Director for several months in 2021.</p>

<title>Finansinspektionen Supervision 30: The Banks Can Strengthen Their Sanction Screening</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/finansinspektionen-supervision-30-the-banks-can-strengthen-their-sanction-scree/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/finansinspektionen-supervision-30-the-banks-can-strengthen-their-sanction-scree/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>FI has tested the effectiveness of 19 banks' automated sanction screening systems. The result shows that the effectiveness of the systems that the banks use could be higher and that there is room for some banks to improve their work in this area.</span></p>
<div class="editor-content">
<p>FI has analyzed the extent to which the banks' automated systems for sanction screening detects sanctioned persons and companies and transactions linked to such actors. It appears that none of the banks in the analysis have systems, that in the test environment, successfully managed to identify all names on the sanctions lists.</p>
<p>&ndash;&nbsp;The banks generally need to do more to strengthen their systems for sanction screening. In their actual operations, we expect all banks to be able to detect and prevent all activities that can be linked to sanctioned parties, says Erik Blomm&eacute;, head of department for Money Laundering Supervision at FI.</p>
<h2>The banks have technical solutions</h2>
<p>Despite the fact that no system could fully detect all names, FI assesses that the banks generally have a good understanding of the sanctions regulations and have the technical solutions required to be able to comply with the legal requirements. Furthermore, the analysis shows that the effectiveness is largely correlated to the size of the bank; in other words, the larger the bank, the higher the effectiveness. A consequence of this could be that risks are concentrated to small and medium-sized banks.</p>
<p>The analysis also shows that the banks' effectiveness was generally higher when screening transactions than for customer screening.</p>
<p>The fact that the review was carried out in a test environment means that the review of the systems' accuracy and efficiency did not include actual business relationships or transactions.</p>
<p>FI may follow up on how the banks comply with the sanctions regulations in the ongoing supervision or through separate investigations.</p>

<p>Good afternoon, thank you to OMFIF for the invitation to speak to you today, it&rsquo;s a pleasure to be here.</p>
<p>The end of the year is always a natural time for reflection. This time last year I gave a speech on banking resolution, looking back over a year influenced by the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse. And a year before that I reflected on the significant shocks that had struck the UK economy in 2022.</p>

<title>BME Launches SpainAtMid, A New Pool Of Non-Displayed Liquidity, To Make Trading In Spanish Equities More Attractive</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bme-launches-spainatmid-a-new-pool-of-non-displayed-liquidity-to-make-trading/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bme-launches-spainatmid-a-new-pool-of-non-displayed-liquidity-to-make-trading/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li><span>This new functionality will allow trading participants to seek contra liquidity in larger size, whilst minimising the price impact of resting orders or seeking price improvement on aggressive orders</span></li>
<li><span>First clients have already confirmed supporting the new offering from day one</span></li>
</ul>
<p>SpainAtMid, the new pool of Non-Displayed Liquidity in Spanish Equities, goes live today. SpainAtMid is a cutting-edge order book that enables the execution of trades in Spanish market securities at the midpoint of the bid-ask spread.</p>
<p>SpainAtMid provides an additional source of liquidity for Spanish securities, enabling large volume orders to be traded with minimal impact on the market with the robustness and efficiency of BME's trading system.</p>
<p><img height="178" src="https://www.bolsasymercados.es/aspx/Imagen.ashx?Num=6338" width="474" /></p>
<p>SpainAtMid has been designed to operate on the same atomic matching cycle as BME central order book and will be available during the continuous trading phase.</p>
<p>High Liquidity, Better Execution Price and Security are highlighted by the stakeholders as the main benefits of SpainAtMid. From the first day, SpainAtMid will start with several intermediaries, ensuring a robust and active market from the outset.</p>
<p>Trading participants will be able to specify how their market and limit orders interact with SpainAtMid in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Direct: Orders can be flagged to be routed to SpainAtMid only, where they will remain until execution at the prevailing mid-point or until they are cancelled.</li>
<li>Sweep: Orders can be flagged to be routed firstly to SpainAtMid, (for execution at the prevailing mid-point) and then any remaining unexecuted portion will be routed to the Central Limit Order Book where it will remain until it is either fully executed or cancelled.</li>
</ul>
<p>In both cases, orders may be market or limit orders, and have various conditions such as &ldquo;Execute or Cancel&rdquo; or &ldquo;Minimum Volume&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Iv&aacute;n Lorenzo, Product Manager, Equity Product at BME, added: &ldquo;SpainAtMid has been developed to meet the growing demand from our clients for non-displayed execution in Spanish securities. In Switzerland, SwissAtMid had been introduced in 2016 and fundamentally reshaped the trading landscape for Swiss Equities. With our extensive experience in this area in the Swiss market, we believe we are well placed to offer this option in Spain. By emulating this successful setup on the BME Exchange, SIX enables clients to benefit from the ongoing integration and knowledge exchange between its two home markets, Switzerland and Spain. And we are convinced that concentrating more liquidity on our exchanges is beneficial for all trading participants.&rdquo;</p>

<title>The EBA Consults On Draft Technical Standards That Specify Material Changes And Extensions To The Internal Ratings Based Approach</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-eba-consults-on-draft-technical-standards-that-specify-material-changes-and/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-eba-consults-on-draft-technical-standards-that-specify-material-changes-and/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today launched a public consultation on its draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) clarifying and enhancing the conditions for assessing material model changes (MMC) and extensions following a review of the related Delegated Regulation. This review aimed to align the existing RTS with the amendments brought in by the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR 3), and to introduce amendments to enhance the supervisory effectiveness of the approval process for model changes. The consultation runs until 10 March 2025.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Under the CRR, institutions shall apply for approval from their competent authorities prior to implementing material extensions and changes to their internal approaches. As such, the CRR differentiates between material extensions or material changes, which are subject to approval, and other extensions or changes, which are only subject to notification. The Delegated Regulation on MMC specifies the conditions for assessing material model changes and extensions.</p>
<p>The EBA has performed a review of the Delegated Regulation on MMC leveraging on 10 years of supervisory experience and is proposing several enhancements in these RTS. These updates&nbsp;<a name="_Hlk178839069">will align the standards with the CRR3, for example by removing references to the IRB approach for equity exposures. In addition, they will enhance the supervisory effectiveness&nbsp;</a>of the approval process of model changes and also clarify several aspects related to the scope of the RTS. The proposed amendments focus mainly on the qualitative criteria for the material changes related to the definition of default, the validation framework, and the modelling approaches used for slotting exposures and purchased receivables. The qualitative criteria for material extensions are also amended.<a name="_Hlk178839174">&nbsp;Finally, the updated RTS introduce clarifications on the calculation of the quantitative backstop criteria</a>.</p>
<h4>Consultation process</h4>
<p>Responses to this consultation can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the "send your comments" button on the consultation page. Please note that the deadline for the submission of comments is 10 March 2025.</p>
<p>A<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/public-hearing-rts-model-change" title="Public hearing on the RTS on Model Change"> public hearing </a>will take place via conference call on 15 January 2025 from 15:00 to 16:00 CET. The deadline for registration is the 10 January 25, 16:00 CET.</p>
<p>All contributions received will be published after the consultation closes, unless requested otherwise.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and next steps</h4>
<p>These draft RTS have been developed according to Article 143(5) of Regulation (EU) 2024/1623&nbsp;(CRR3), which mandates the EBA to specify the conditions for assessing the materiality of the use of an existing rating system for other additional exposures not already covered by that rating system and changes to rating systems under the&nbsp;internal ratings-based approach (IRB) Approach.</p>
<p>The mandate in Article 143(5) of Regulation (EU) 2024/1623 is very similar to the mandate in Article 143(5) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, which constitutes the legal basis for the existing Delegated Regulation.</p>
<p>As part of the next steps, the EBA is conducting a review to identify any potential unnecessary regulatory constraints on competent authorities and institutions leading to delays in the implementation of model changes by institutions. This may include the interaction of the RTS on MMC with the RTS on the assessment methodology for competent authorities used to approve material model changes in accordance with Articles 144(2), 173(3) and 180(3) of Regulation (EU) 2024/1623.</p>

<title>ICE Mortgage Monitor: Recent Vintage Borrowers Pounced On Early-Autumn Rate Drops As 300K+ Refinanced In September And October</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="bw-subheadline-wrapper">
<ul>
<li>More than 300K mortgage refinances closed in September and October &ndash; the most in 2.5 years &ndash; as borrowers took advantage of interest rates in the low 6% range</li>
<li>Nearly 150K of those were rate/term refinances, with October marking the first time in 3 years that rate/term volumes outpaced those of cash-out refis</li>
<li>The average rate/term borrower in September and October cut their first lien rate by more than a point and their payment by $320/month, for an aggregate $47M monthly savings in just those two months alone</li>
<li>Mortgage holders refinancing out of and back into Veterans Administration (VA) loans accounted for more than 30% of rate/term activity, more than 4x the VA market share among all active mortgages</li>
<li>More than 35% of VA and more than 10% of all rate/term refinances this year have been originated with loan-to-value ratios of over 100%, increasing potential performance risk down the road</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today released its December 2024&nbsp;<a href="https://mortgagetech.ice.com/resources/data-reports" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">ICE Mortgage Monitor Report</a>, based on the company&rsquo;s robust mortgage, real estate and public records data sets.</p>
<p>When 30-year conforming mortgage interest rates fell into the low 6% range in August/September of this year, the mortgage industry experienced a welcome burst of refinance activity. This month&rsquo;s Mortgage Monitor dives deep into ICE Mortgage Trends closed loan data to learn what that brief &ldquo;boomlet&rdquo; in borrowing activity reveals about U.S. mortgage holders and their motivations in today&rsquo;s market. As Andy Walden, ICE Vice President of Research and Analysis explains, homeowners with loans originated in the last few years were quick to act when the rate calculus turned in their favor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Homeowners pounced on their incentive to refinance as rates fell through August and September,&rdquo; said Walden. &ldquo;More than 300K mortgage holders closed on refinance transactions in September and October, the most we&rsquo;ve seen in two-and-a-half years. What&rsquo;s more, almost half of that activity involved the homeowner refinancing into a better rate, with October marking the first time in three years that there were more rate/term than cash-out refinances in a given month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ICE Market Trends data also showed that technologically-adept lenders were ready to meet that demand, with average closing times among all loan types &ndash; purchase as well as cash-out and rate/term refinances &ndash; all hitting their lowest October levels in the five years ICE has been tracking the metric. According to ICE McDash +NextLoan data, which tracks loans before and after a refinance or other prepayment, this is translating into higher retention rates as well, with servicers retaining more than a third of customers refinancing to improve their rate or term, the best in two and a half years. As has been the case in recent years, retention was strongest &ndash; nearing 40% &ndash; among those who&rsquo;d recently taken out their mortgages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This brief, but welcome, spike in refinancing was dominated by homeowners quickly ditching their recently acquired mortgages,&rdquo; Walden continued. &ldquo;Refinances out of 2023 and 2024 vintages drove an impressive 78% of recent rate/term lending and nearly half of refi activity overall. The average rate/term refinancer had been in their prior mortgage for just 15 months, the shortest average length of time in the nearly 20 years we&rsquo;ve been tracking that metric. For most, this was a no brainer; on average, these folks cut their first lien rates by more than a point and their monthly mortgage payment by $320 per month. That works out to roughly $47M in monthly payment savings locked in by homeowners in just September and October alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More than two thirds of all rate/term refinances dropped their rate by more than a full percentage point (pp), while nearly a third were able to improve their rate by 1.5 pp or more. Borrowers with mortgages backed by the VA saw the largest monthly improvements, dropping their rates by 1.28 pp on average in October, as compared to the 1.08 to 1.18 pp declines seen among other loan products and investor classes</p>
<p>"As you'd expect," Walden continued, "the interest rate threshold at which a given homeowner would be enticed to pull the trigger on a refi varied by loan size. Nearly half of refinancing borrowers with balances between $250K and $375K needed a 125 basis point (bps) reduction before deciding to refi. The distribution of rate savings for those with balances between $375K and $624K were largely similar. Once a borrower's balance got above $750K, however, it was clear that less rate incentive was required for a refinance to be of value. Nearly 40% of those borrowers cut their first lien 75 bps or less by refinancing, and about 12% saw benefit in doing so even with less than a 50 bps reduction."</p>
<p>Refinances from and back into VA mortgages accounted for approximately 30% of September and October rate/term lending, some four times their representation among active mortgages. In addition to the increased prepayment risk this represents, performance risk must be taken into consideration as well. More than 35% of 2024 VA rate/term refinances have had loan-to-value ratios over 100%. This stems from a combination of the refinancing of more recent vintages, which haven't had time to improve their equity positions, and loan programs that allow borrowers to finance closing costs and even interest rate buydowns up to certain thresholds.</p>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ice-expands-global-energy-offering-with-the-launch-of-japanese-power-futures/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced the latest addition to its global energy offering with the launch of Japanese Power Futures.</p>
<p>ICE has launched four Japanese Power Financial Baseload and Peakload Futures covering the Tokyo and Kansai areas respectively, allowing market participants to manage exposure to the day-ahead auction price of the Japanese Electric Power Exchange (JEPX) for these areas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By offering Japanese Power Futures on a single platform alongside our natural gas, coal, oil, clean energy attributes and carbon contracts, ICE is providing customers with a critical edge in navigating energy markets,&rdquo; said Gordon Bennett, Managing Director of Utility Markets at ICE. &ldquo;Secondary fuels including electricity are produced through the conversion of primary energy sources like natural gas, coal and oil, and the price of electricity is derived from the interaction of these competing input fuels, all of which trade on ICE. Natural gas and coal make up the majority of Japan&rsquo;s electricity generation and through trading of these contracts on ICE, customers benefit from improved price dissemination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ICE&rsquo;s Japanese Power Financial Futures will be offered in monthly, quarterly and seasonal contracts as well as a Calendar and Fiscal Year contract. In addition, customers can trade spreads between Tokyo and Kansai to manage positions and price differences across these regions, as well as manage exposure to regional price risks.</p>
<p>ICE&rsquo;s global energy markets are the most liquid in the world to trade energy derivatives. Japanese Power futures will join ICE&rsquo;s global energy offering which includes the benchmark price for natural gas in North-East Asia JKM LNG (Platts), the global benchmark TTF, the U.S. benchmark Henry Hub and globalCOAL Newcastle Coal Futures, as well as ICE&rsquo;s complex of over 800 oil and refined products including ICE Brent. Open interest across ICE&rsquo;s energy markets is up 20% year-over-year.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) today cautioned the public on fake letters and emails purportedly from the SC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These fraudulent letters and emails are allegedly linked to illegal investment schemes seeking payments from investors, supposedly on behalf of the SC. There are also claims by the fraudsters impersonating as SC to scam victims that they would be able to recover their losses for a &ldquo;fee&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SC would like to state that these are false representations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a regulatory body, the SC does not endorse any investment schemes or solicit monies from the public in such capacity.</p>
<p>The SC views this matter seriously.</p>
<p>The regulator has taken immediate steps, including lodging a police report over the matter. Where applicable, it has added the involved entities to its Investor Alert List at<a href="https://www.sc.com.my/investor-alert-list"> </a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/investor-alert-list">https://www.sc.com.my/investor</a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/investor-alert-list">-</a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/investor-alert-list">alert</a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/investor-alert-list">-</a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/investor-alert-list">list</a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/investor-alert-list">.</a></p>
<p>The SC would like to urge public to be cautious and to verify any investment offers through the SC&rsquo;s Investment Checker at<a href="https://www.sc.com.my/investment-checker"> </a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/investment-checker">www.sc.com.my/investment</a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/investment-checker">-</a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/investment-checker">checker</a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/investment-checker">.</a></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Singapore Exchange (SGX Group) today released its market statistics for November 2024. Securities market turnover rose as the Straits Times Index (STI) emerged as ASEAN&rsquo;s top performer. SGX&rsquo;s globally leading Asian derivatives markets notched significant wins with multiple foreign exchange (FX) futures volume records and a groundbreaking benchmark inclusion for iron ore.</span></p>
<p>Key highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>SDAV jumps:</span>&nbsp;Securities daily average value (SDAV) surged 51% year-on-year (y-o-y) in November to S$1.44 billion, climbing 17% on a month-on-month (m-o-m) basis. Securities market turnover also increased 51% y-o-y to S$30.2 billion, up 12% m-o-m.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Bursa Malaysia RAM Capital Sdn Bhd (&ldquo;BR Capital&rdquo;), a joint venture entity between Bursa Malaysia Berhad (&ldquo;Bursa Malaysia&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Exchange&rdquo;) and RAM Holdings Berhad (&ldquo;RAM&rdquo;), is pleased to announce the launch of a secondary market for its debt fundraising and investment platform (&ldquo;Platform&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The secondary market, which goes live today, enables investors to buy or sell investment notes that were issued on BR Capital&rsquo;s Platform. This effectively provides flexibility and liquidity to investors after the initial issuance or subscription of the investment notes, as well as contributes to refined price discovery and optimisation of investment strategies.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>This initiative empowers investors with greater choice in managing their investments, as part of BR Capital's commitment to creating a comprehensive debt fundraising and investment platform and promoting a vibrant investment environment.<b> </b>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are committed to providing a robust investment experience through BR Capital. By offering a secondary market, we are enhancing the liquidity and flexibility of our investment notes,&rdquo; said Datuk Muhamad Umar Swift, Chief Executive Officer of Bursa Malaysia, and Chairman of BR Capital. &ldquo;This represents a significant step forward in our goal to continuously empower investors with more product choices that meet their needs, for active and effective investment portfolio management.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chris Lee, Group CEO and Executive Director of RAM, and a Director of BR Capital, added,&nbsp; &ldquo;The rollout of a secondary market on BR Capital&rsquo;s Platform is a testament to our dedication to innovation and investor-centric solutions. We believe this will greatly benefit our investors by providing them with more options to manage their portfolios, in line with their credit risk appetite and ESG preferences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>BR Capital was launched in December 2023 to enable both listed and unlisted companies to tap into a fresh pool of capital outside of traditional wholesale markets. It offers a new avenue of fundraising for issuers, while simultaneously providing fixed income investment opportunities to individual and institutional investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The minimum investment for each investment notes campaign is one lot, which is equivalent to only RM100.

<title>Remarks By US Secretary Of The Treasury Janet L. Yellen At The US Financial Stability Oversight Council Conference On Artificial Intelligence And Financial Stability</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good afternoon. I would like to join Sandra in welcoming you to the Treasury Department for the first day of the Financial Stability Oversight Council&rsquo;s Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Financial Stability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a topic that I&mdash;and my colleagues across Treasury, FSOC member agencies, and the Biden Administration&mdash;take very seriously. And it will only become more important in the years ahead. This Conference provides a key opportunity for the public and private sectors to discuss the opportunities and risks arising from AI and for us to share the Council&rsquo;s work to date and our agenda for the future.</p>
<h3>I. Opportunities and Risks</h3>
<p>Let me start by briefly addressing the opportunities and risks of artificial intelligence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I know many of you here today recognize, AI offers tremendous opportunities for the financial system. And if we define AI broadly, the financial services sector has already been capitalizing on these opportunities. For many years, the predictive capabilities of AI have supported forecasting and portfolio management. AI&rsquo;s ability to detect anomalies has contributed to efforts to combat fraud and illicit finance. Many customer support services have been automated. Across these and many other use cases, we&rsquo;ve seen that AI, when used appropriately, can improve efficiency, accuracy, and access to financial products.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More recently, AI&rsquo;s rapid evolution could mean additional use cases. Advances in natural language processing, image recognition, and generative AI, for example, create new opportunities to make financial services less costly and easier to access.</p>
<p>But I know all of you here also recognize that the use of AI by financial institutions comes with risks alongside these opportunities. Last year, in its 2023 annual report,<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2395#ftn1"><span>[1]</span></a>&nbsp;FSOC identified the broader adoption of AI in financial services as a vulnerability for the first time. And the Council and member agencies have been working to deepen our collective understanding of financial stability risks associated with AI, while also recognizing that AI can improve financial services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Council&rsquo;s new Analytic Framework, published last November, provides helpful insights into the range of potential risks that AI can pose to the financial system. Specific&nbsp;vulnerabilities may arise from the complexity and opacity of AI models; inadequate risk management frameworks to account for AI risks; and interconnections that emerge as many market participants rely on the same data and models. Concentration among vendors developing models, providing data, and providing cloud services may also introduce risks, which could amplify existing third-party service provider risks. And insufficient or faulty data could also perpetuate or introduce new biases in financial decision making.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>II. Treasury Actions</h3>
<p>The Biden Administration has been focused on harnessing AI&rsquo;s potential to fuel innovation while mitigating risks, as reflected in President Biden&rsquo;s landmark Executive Order on AI last year. Treasury is proud to be playing a key role in spurring responsible innovation, especially in relation to AI and financial institutions.</p>
<p>As we look to address AI-related risks, we are not starting from scratch or seeking to reinvent the wheel. Treasury, the Council, and member agencies have frameworks and tools that can help mitigate risks related to the use of AI, such as model risk management guidance and third-party risk management. That said, there are also new issues to confront, and this is a rapidly evolving field. We have our work cut out for us and are pursuing a variety of initiatives to identify and address emerging risks.</p>
<p>We have carried out in-depth research and analysis, including on AI&rsquo;s potential financial and economic impacts. Under the President&rsquo;s Executive Order on AI, in March, Treasury released a detailed report providing an extensive overview of current use cases and best practices related to AI for cybersecurity and fraud prevention in the financial sector. The report also highlights key steps to address immediate AI-related operational risk, cybersecurity, and fraud challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are also in regular communication with federal financial regulators on their AI-related efforts. One of the key priorities in Treasury&rsquo;s 2024 National Illicit Finance Strategy is harnessing technology to mitigate illicit finance risks, and we&rsquo;ve engaged with the public and private sectors on using AI to detect some of the greatest risks we face, from money laundering, to terrorist financing, to sanctions evasion. At Treasury we are building our capacity to keep up with new technologies and leverage them in our own operations, such as the Internal Revenue Service&rsquo;s use of AI for enhanced fraud detection.</p>
<p>AI is of course not just a domestic issue, and our work has not been confined to the United States. We&rsquo;ve been engaging internationally with our allies and partners, including financial regulators, bilaterally and through bodies like the Financial Stability Board, to consider AI&rsquo;s impacts on the international financial system and global economy.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>III. Work Ahead</h3>
<p>Our work must continue to expand and evolve. I&rsquo;ll highlight a few of our key initiatives as we look ahead.</p>
<p>First, we are continuing our stakeholder engagement to improve our understanding of AI in financial services. I am pleased to announce today that Treasury is launching a formal public request for information to seek comments from financial institutions, consumers, advocates, academics, and other stakeholders on the current uses, opportunities, and risks of AI in the financial services sector.</p>
<p>I am also pleased to announce that Treasury&rsquo;s Federal Insurance Office will convene a roundtable on AI and insurance to discuss the benefits and challenges associated with the use of AI by insurers, best practices, and potential consumer protections to prevent discrimination. Together, these two initiatives will contribute to Treasury&rsquo;s improved understanding of how AI impacts different types of financial institutions.</p>
<p>Second, FSOC will continue its efforts to monitor AI&rsquo;s impact on financial stability, facilitate the exchange of information, and promote dialogue among financial regulators. The Council will also continue to support efforts to build supervisory capacity to better understand associated risks. Scenario analysis, often used by firms and governments to understand opportunities and risks in the context of uncertainty, could also be beneficial. Given how quickly AI technology is developing, with fast-evolving potential use cases for financial firms and market participants, scenario analysis could help regulators and firms identify potential future vulnerabilities and inform what we can do to enhance resilience.</p>
<p>Let me end here for now. The tremendous opportunities and significant risks associated with the use of AI by financial companies have moved this issue toward the top of Treasury&rsquo;s and the Financial Stability Oversight Council&rsquo;s agendas. And this Conference is a valuable opportunity to hear your perspectives on how AI could make our system more resilient and on the risks you see, as well as on how the Council can enhance how it identifies, assesses, and mitigates potential risks in this area. Thank you for joining us here.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), in partnership with the Brookings Institution, hosted the first day of a conference on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Financial Stability. This conference brought together public and private sector participants to discuss the evolving role of AI in the financial system and the potential implications for U.S. financial stability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In her&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2395">keynote address</a>, Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen highlighted opportunities and risks in the financial sector associated with AI. She noted that AI, &ldquo;when used appropriately, can improve efficiency, accuracy, and access to financial products.&rdquo; She also stated the &ldquo;Council&rsquo;s new Analytic Framework, published last November, provides helpful insights into the range of potential risks that AI can pose to the financial system. Specific vulnerabilities may arise from the complexity and opacity of AI models; inadequate risk management frameworks to account for AI risks; and interconnections that emerge as many market participants rely on the same data and models.&rdquo; The Secretary highlighted Treasury&rsquo;s research, analysis, and coordination efforts to deepen understanding of the risks posed by AI and Treasury&rsquo;s plans to continue its engagement with stakeholders.</p>
<p>Acting Comptroller Hsu provided a keynote address on the potential systemic risk implications from the use of artificial intelligence in banking and finance as both a useful tool and as a harmful weapon. He also discussed his views on the accountability challenges with AI and the need for a shared responsibility framework for AI safety. Several panel discussions explored the potential risks to financial stability posed by AI in financial services and approaches to promote its safe adoption by balancing innovation with appropriate risk management. Conference participants included representatives from technology, finance, and civil society organizations together with staff from FSOC member agencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FSOC identified AI as a potential vulnerability in the financial system for the first time in its&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1991">2023 Annual Report</a>. The report noted that financial institutions have rapidly adopted innovative technologies in recent years, and the use of AI in financial services has increased. The FSOC highlighted the potential benefits and risks posed by AI in the report and recommended that financial institutions, market participants, and regulatory and supervisory authorities deepen expertise and capacity to monitor AI innovation and usage and identify emerging risks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tomorrow, the conference will continue at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. The link to tomorrow&rsquo;s webcast and other conference details can be found at the&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-markets-financial-institutions-and-fiscal-service/financial-stability-oversight-council/2024-conference-on-artificial-intelligence-financial-stability">conference website</a>.</p>

<title>Remarks By US Deputy Assistant Secretary For The US Financial Stability Oversight Council Sandra Lee At The Conference On Artificial Intelligence And Financial Stability</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good afternoon and welcome to the Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Financial Stability, hosted by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) in partnership with the Brookings Institution. I am pleased to welcome everyone who has joined us here in person at the Treasury Department, as well as those tuning in via webcast. This is the first time in almost a decade that FSOC has hosted a conference like this, and we look forward to facilitating an enriching discussion and a thoughtful exchange of ideas over the next two days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FSOC was established by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act following the 2008 global financial crisis. Its mission was, and remains, to monitor the stability of the U.S. financial system. The FSOC brings together federal financial regulators and state regulators&nbsp;to identify risks to financial stability, promote market discipline, and respond to emerging systemic threats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the past few years, the FSOC has been working to enhance how the financial regulatory community understands evolving risks and assesses vulnerabilities in the financial system. The Council has advanced work on climate-related financial risk; digital assets; nonbank financial intermediation; Treasury market resilience; and financial market utilities. Last November, the Council published a new analytic framework for financial stability, which provides a detailed explanation on how the Council monitors, assesses, and responds to potential risks to financial stability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every year, the FSOC presents an annual report to Congress that provides the Council&rsquo;s view on vulnerabilities in the financial system and recommendations to address them. In the 2023 Annual Report, the increasing usage of AI in financial services was cited as a vulnerability for the first time. The Council recommended monitoring the rapid developments in AI to ensure oversight structures stay ahead of emerging risks and also recommended that financial institutions, market participants, and regulatory and supervisory authorities deepen their expertise and build capacity to effectively monitor AI innovation and usage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This conference is an outgrowth of the Council&rsquo;s work on AI. Our aim is to promote thoughtful discussion on the risks associated with AI and how to mitigate these risks while still harnessing AI&rsquo;s benefits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This conference is an outgrowth of the Council&rsquo;s work on AI. Our aim is to promote thoughtful discussion on the risks associated with AI and how to mitigate these risks while still harnessing AI&rsquo;s benefits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later today, you will hear from Council member Michael Hsu, the Acting Comptroller of the currency, on the potential systemic risk implications from the use of artificial intelligence in baking and finance as both a useful tool and as a harmful weapon. He will also share his views on the accountability challenges with AI and the need for a shared responsibility framework for AI safety.</p>
<p>We will also have three panel discussions, with the first panel focusing on the potential financial stability risks posed by AI. The second panel is centered on how to promote the safe adoption of AI across the public and private sectors. Our third panel will provide regulatory perspectives on AI in the financial system and feature staff from three FSOC member agencies.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, at the Brookings Institution, we will continue to explore AI in the financial services industry and focus on data quality for AI models and the intersection between the tech sector and finance, among other topics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, it is my honor to welcome the 78<span>th</span>&nbsp;Secretary of the Treasury, Janet Yellen. One of the nation&rsquo;s preeminent economists, Secretary Yellen is the first person in American history to have led the White House Council of Economic Advisors, the Federal Reserve, and now, the Treasury Department. Secretary Yellen is chair of the FSOC, and I can think of no one better person to set the tone for these next two days of collaboration, learning, and discussion. Secretary Yellen, thank you for your leadership of the FSOC and for your remarks today.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael J. Hsu today issued the following statement in support of the Financial Stability Oversight Council&rsquo;s (FSOC) Annual Report:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would like to thank you, Madam Secretary, for your leadership of the Financial Stability Oversight Council. You have restored the capacity and credibility of the Council, encouraging us to collaborate, to think outside of the box, and to be disciplined in doing the analytical work&mdash;and not relying on politics&mdash;to serve the American people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Annual Report is a fitting reflection of all the hard work the Council has done this past year. Its recommendations cover both traditional and emerging risks, from cybersecurity and commercial real estate risks in the banking system; to the growth of nonbanks, like mortgage servicers, hedge funds and private credit funds; to artificial intelligence, digital assets, and climate-related financial risks.</p>
<p>I support the issuance of the Annual Report and its recommendations. I would like to again thank you, Madam Secretary, as well as Deputy Assistant Secretary Sandra Lee, for your leadership, and to thank the staff at FSOC and the members&rsquo; agencies who have dedicated their time to this report and to FSOC&rsquo;s other initiatives this year. I am proud of all that the Council has accomplished this past year and over the last several years.</p>
</blockquote>

<title>New York Department Of Financial Services Superintendent Adrienne A. Harris Statement On US Financial Stability Oversight Council Annual Report</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank Secretary Yellen for her leadership on this Council, and to my fellow regulators for another productive and collaborative year working to protect the American people, the institutions we regulate, and the global financial system from new and emerging risks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also like to thank the Treasury staff and detailees for putting together this year&rsquo;s Annual Report. &nbsp;I know how much work goes into producing the final product, and your tireless efforts are noted and appreciated. &nbsp;The 2024 Report is a cumulative record of the extensive work that the FSOC has done this year.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2024, we addressed a number of new and developing risks that are key areas of focus for state regulators, including digital assets, non-bank mortgage servicing, and use of AI in financial services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s Report continues to highlight the growing interconnectedness of digital assets and traditional financial institutions.&nbsp; NYDFS appreciated the opportunity to contribute our experience and expertise as a representative of the states on the Council. &nbsp;However, I must note that this year&rsquo;s Report amends the Council&rsquo;s previous recommendation, and now focuses exclusively on the federal role for comprehensive stablecoin regulation. &nbsp;We share the goal of establishing a national framework to protect consumers across the country, but there is an important role for states to play in the regulation of innovative financial services. &nbsp;States can act nimbly in response to industry developments, to modernize regulations more quickly, and to support responsible innovation.&nbsp; I am proud of the leading work that New York and other states have done to establish strong regulation of digital assets.&nbsp; NYDFS was the first to provide regulatory clarity for stablecoins, which has protected New York consumers and created a strong, resilient market for digital asset businesses in the state. &nbsp;Any legislation should take advantage of state and federal expertise, and the states look forward to continuing to work with Congress as they develop a strong regulatory floor at the federal level.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Likewise, I appreciate that the Annual Report reaffirms the Council&rsquo;s commitment to implement the recommendations from the Report on Nonbank Mortgage Servicing. &nbsp;As the primary prudential regulators of nonbank mortgage companies, states have been leading the way. &nbsp;We have established model prudential standards and have adopted new processes and tools to license and examine these institutions on a multi-state basis. &nbsp;Given the market&rsquo;s rapid growth, I support greater collaboration between state regulators and federal agencies to enhance supervision of nonbank mortgage companies. &nbsp;Stronger coordination across all levels of government will better protect homeowners and the housing market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I appreciate the opportunity that FSOC provides to bring together regulators from different levels of government, with different perspectives and experiences.&nbsp; I am proud of the progress we have made, and I am proud to represent the innovative work happening in states across the country. &nbsp;The issues we face here have no simple solutions.&nbsp; By continuing to tackle these challenges together, we will more effectively meet our shared mission of protecting consumers, ensuring the health of the entities we regulate, and preserving the stability of the global financial system.</p>

<title>US Financial Stability Oversight Council Releases 2024 Annual Report</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-financial-stability-oversight-council-releases-2024-annual-report/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-financial-stability-oversight-council-releases-2024-annual-report/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council) today unanimously approved its 2024 annual report. The annual report reviews developments in financial markets, identifies vulnerabilities and emerging threats to U.S. financial stability, and makes recommendations to mitigate those vulnerabilities and threats. The report also details the activities of the Council and summarizes significant regulatory developments. The report was developed collaboratively by Council members and their agencies and staffs. Overall, the Council finds that the U.S. financial system remains resilient, though vulnerabilities warrant ongoing vigilance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The prosperity of the U.S. economy and the American people depend on the stability of the U.S. financial system,&rdquo; Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen said. &ldquo;This year, the financial system has continued to support a strong economy, marked by declining inflation, solid economic growth, and a healthy labor market. But we must remain focused on ensuring the financial system remains resilient and addressing emerging vulnerabilities. The annual report demonstrates the Council&rsquo;s commitment to monitoring and responding to current and emerging risks to enhance market resilience, efficiency, and stability.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Council&rsquo;s recommendations in the annual report include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Cybersecurity:</em>&nbsp;Cyber incidents have become increasingly frequent over the past two decades, posing risks to financial stability. Significant incidents at major financial institutions have the potential to disrupt critical operations and services more broadly. Financial institutions and systems are highly interconnected, so it is important for all financial sector participants to stay updated on cybersecurity developments within the financial sector and work to reduce cybersecurity risk. The Council supports ongoing partnerships between state and federal agencies and private firms and recommends continued information sharing related to cyber risk and additional work to assess and mitigate cyber-related financial stability risks. The Council also supports the G7 Cyber Expert Group&rsquo;s international efforts to help financial institutions better understand cybersecurity risks and improve the resilience of the financial system to cyber incidents through preparedness, a consensus un&shy;derstanding of the threat landscape, and a shared approach to mitigating risk.&nbsp;</li>
<li><em>Depository Institutions:</em>&nbsp;Depository institutions play a central role in the U.S. economy and the global financial system by providing credit to retail and commercial borrowers, helping firms raise capital or hedge risk, providing asset management and custody services, and facilitating payments. Overall, the U.S. banking system remains resilient, supported by sound levels of regulatory capital, adequate liquidity buffers, and healthy levels of profitability. However, some potential vulnerabilities warrant continued mon&shy;itoring, including the weakening credit conditions in commercial real estate (CRE) and the strong reliance of some banks on non-deposit funding and uninsured deposit funding. The Council recommends that banks continue to ensure they have sound risk management practices, including contingency planning for funding and liquidity events. The Council also encourages efforts to complete the Basel III reforms to further enhance the resilience of the banking system.</li>
<li><em>Third-Party Service Providers:</em>&nbsp;Financial institutions are increasingly using third parties to provide a range of products and services. While third-party service providers can offer benefits, they may also introduce or amplify risks, in part by limiting a financial institution&rsquo;s access to, control over, and oversight of its data or systems. Additionally, the authority to supervise third-party service providers varies among financial regulators. To enhance information security within third-party service providers and address other critical regulatory challenges, the Council recommends that Congress pass legislation ensuring the Federal Housing Finance Agency, National Credit Union Administration, and other relevant agencies have adequate examination and enforcement powers to oversee third-party service providers that interact with their regulated entities. The Council also recommends that federal banking regulators continue to coordinate third-party service provider examinations, work collaboratively with states, and&nbsp;identify additional ways to support information sharing among state and federal regulators.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li><em>Commercial Real Estate:</em>&nbsp;Signs of CRE credit risk have been&nbsp;evident in 2024. Increasing vacancies, slower rent growth, and higher borrowing costs were particularly notable in the office sector and to a lesser degree in the multifamily sector. These pressures on borrowers have led to increasing delinquencies, loan losses, and provision expenses for banks. The Council recommends regulators continue to focus on the financial industry&rsquo;s ability to withstand CRE stress from declines in property prices and loan quality. CRE exposure among bank and nonbank industry participants can also be interconnected. Therefore, the Council recommends that member agencies ensure financial institutions continue to monitor these correlated risks in their risk management and contingency planning.</li>
<li><em>Digital Assets:</em>&nbsp;The Council continues to monitor risks related to crypto assets. Though the market value of the crypto-asset ecosystem remains small compared with traditional financial markets, it has continued to grow. Absent appropriate risk management standards, stablecoins represent a potential risk to financial stability because of their vulnerability to runs. The Council reiterates its prior recommendation that Congress pass legislation to create a comprehensive federal prudential framework for stablecoin issuers. The Council also recommends that&nbsp;Congress pass legislation providing federal financial regulators with explicit rulemaking authority over the spot market for crypto assets that are not securities.&nbsp;</li>
<li><em>Investment Funds:</em>&nbsp;The Council and its member agencies have made progress addressing financial vulnerabilities stemming from investment funds, including the SEC&rsquo;s reforms to make money market funds more resilient, liquid, and transparent. Nevertheless, open-end funds with significant liquidity mismatches may face challenges meeting large redemption requests during times of market stress, potentially disrupting market functioning. Collective investment funds (CIFs) and other short-term investment vehicles share similar features that can contribute to financial stability risk. The Council supports the SEC&rsquo;s continued engagement on open-end funds, including the SEC&rsquo;s adoption of amendments to require more frequent and timely reporting of funds&rsquo; portfolio information. The Council and state and federal regulators should consider what steps are needed to address financial stability risks from open-end funds and CIFs. Lastly, the Council has continued working to support better data collection and monitoring to identify risks from highly leveraged hedge funds and the growth in private credit.</li>

<title>Remarks By US Secretary Of The Treasury Janet L. Yellen At The Open Session Of The Meeting Of The US Financial Stability Oversight Council</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This past year, the U.S. economy has been marked by a combination of developments that few thought possible. Inflation is down significantly, the unemployment rate is near historic lows, and economic growth is robust. This is the result of actions we&rsquo;ve taken over the past four years, including our Administration&rsquo;s focus on strengthening the resilience of the U.S. financial system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A resilient financial system is critical to a strong economy. And as the Financial Stability Oversight Council&rsquo;s 2024 Annual Report shows, the Council has played a key role in increasing the resilience of the U.S. financial system. Today I&rsquo;d like to speak to ongoing progress in three key areas, starting with the banking sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In March of 2023, we acted quickly and decisively to prevent contagion from regional banking stress that could have destabilized the U.S. financial system and undermined our historic economic recovery. Since then, the Council has provided direction and helped lead coordination among regulators to address the core weaknesses the banking stresses revealed. As the Annual Report lays out, we need to continue work to ensure that banks are prepared for liquidity stress by making sure that they have diverse sources of contingency funding and the capacity to borrow at the discount window. And we have also remained focused on credit risk in commercial real estate. This risk became more evident this year, and regulators should continue to focus on the financial industry&rsquo;s ability to address it.</p>
<p>We have also been addressing emerging risks from significant technological changes. Digital assets and artificial intelligence bring potential benefits such as efficiencies, but also financial risks, cyber risks, and risks from third-party service providers. The Council continues to call for legislation to create a comprehensive federal prudential framework for stablecoin issuers and for legislation on crypto assets that addresses the risks we have identified. And we recommend building further interagency expertise to analyze and monitor potential systemic risks associated with the use of AI in the financial services sector while facilitating innovation. Treasury&rsquo;s report on AI-specific cybersecurity risks is one example of recent progress, equipping financial institutions with information on best practices. Efforts like Treasury&rsquo;s Project Fortress, which brings more than 1,000 financial institutions together to combat cybersecurity risks, are also key.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And strengthening the resilience of the U.S. Treasury market has continued to be a top priority, with the Council playing an important coordinating role. We&rsquo;ve made progress, including on increasing the availability and quality of data on Treasury market and repo activity to advance transparency and on evaluating the use of leverage that could increase risks to Treasury market liquidity.&nbsp; Treasury also launched a new buyback program to bolster liquidity. This work must continue as we move forward to implement expanded central clearing of Treasury securities and to improve risk management.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Across these areas, progress has been enabled by a strengthened Council. When I took office, the Council&rsquo;s staff at Treasury had been cut to single digits, and the infrastructure supporting interagency coordination had been scaled back significantly. This meant we were less equipped to identify and respond to risks to the financial system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So we invested in the Council: increasing staff, creating more opportunities for agencies to come together, and developing new tools such as the analytic framework for financial stability risks, which we published last year. This strengthened Council has delivered, helping make our financial system more resilient and our economy stronger. It is crucial that it continue to do so for the benefit of the American people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me now turn to Sandra Lee, Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Council at Treasury, and Stefan Jacewitz, Assistant Vice President at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, to present the 2024 Annual Report.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The Working Group on Sterling Risk-Free Reference Rates, which is comprised of a diverse set of market participants, is working to assist in finalising the transition away from LIBOR.</span></p>
<div class="section-heading">
<h2 id="chapter-0">Minutes</h2>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-0">Introduction</h3>
<p>Following the cessation of most LIBOR settings at the end of 2021, the Working Group on Sterling Risk-Free Reference Rates (the &ldquo;Working Group&rdquo;) concluded at its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/minutes/2022/january/rfr-january-2022"><strong>January 2022 meeting</strong></a>&nbsp;that it had met its objective to &ldquo;catalyse a broad-based transition to SONIA across sterling derivative, loan and bond markets&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Following this meeting, the Working Group confirmed that all Sub-Groups and Task Forces &ndash; except for the Bond Market Sub-Group, Loan Enablers Task Force and Communications and Outreach Sub-Group &ndash; would close as the Working Group moved into 2022 in a new form, with new objectives, and with continued support from the Bank of England and FCA.</p>
<p>The new overall objective was to assist in finalising the transition away from LIBOR, via:</p>
<ol>
<li>Supporting the continued active transition of legacy contracts from synthetic sterling LIBOR to SONIA, and</li>
<li>Considering any implications of non-sterling LIBOR transition in UK markets.</li>
</ol>
<p>To aid transparency in its new form, the Working Group agreed that it would publish summaries of the meetings of its Sub-Groups and Task Forces. Please see below for summaries of recent meetings.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-1"><a id="_Hlk184019949"></a>The Bond Market Sub-Group (the &ldquo;BMSG&rdquo;):</h3>
<p><strong>Chair: Paul Richards, ICMA</strong></p>
<p>At the BMSG meeting on 3 September, the FCA and Bank of England briefed members on plans for the cessation of 1-, 3- and 6-month synthetic US dollar LIBOR on 30 September 2024.&nbsp; The main purpose of the meeting was to discuss preparations in the bond market for the cessation of synthetic US dollar LIBOR ahead of the FCA&rsquo;s proposed cessation date and, in particular, to invite BMSG members to communicate any remaining concerns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the meeting, BMSG members confirmed that they had no remaining concerns and that they would be fully prepared for the cessation of synthetic 1-, 3- and 6-month US dollar LIBOR on 30 September.</p>
<p>Subject to FCA confirmation that synthetic US dollar LIBOR will cease on 30 September, members agreed to close the BMSG following the last publication of those settings.</p>
<p>Following the BMSG meeting, the FCA&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/news-stories/remaining-synthetic-us-dollar-libor-settings-less-1-month-go" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">confirmed<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;on 5 September that synthetic US dollar LIBOR will cease as planned, and hence the BMSG was wound down on 30 September.</p>

<title>Finansinspektionen: AI Increasingly Common In The Financial Sector, But Risk Management Is Lagging Behind</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/finansinspektionen-ai-increasingly-common-in-the-financial-sector-but-risk-man/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/finansinspektionen-ai-increasingly-common-in-the-financial-sector-but-risk-man/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The new generative AI technology has spread rapidly and extensively throughout the Swedish financial sector. At the same time, the work to manage the risks accompanying the new technology is lagging behind. These are FI&rsquo;s findings following a survey of firms&rsquo; use of AI.</span></p>
<div class="editor-content">
<p>"We place high demands on the financial sector to know what risks could arise as the use of AI begins to increase. Financial firms need to ensure that they have the competence to understand and manage the risks," says Marie Jesperson, the head of FI's Innovation Center.</p>
<p>To better understand how the financial sector is using AI and the opportunities and risks this could entail, FI's Innovation Center conducted a survey in the autumn of 2024 on AI use at firms under FI's supervision.</p>
<h2>Majority use AI &ndash; few have adopted policies</h2>
<p>The survey shows that 84 per cent of the 234 firms that responded to FI's survey say that their employees use public generative AI tools such as Chat GPT, Copilot or Gemini.</p>
<p>AI use within the firm's own IT environments is less prevalent. Twenty-two per cent of the firms stay that they currently have AI systems in production or development, while 46 per cent of the firms are currently conducting experimental projects or pilot studies. AI is used widely and in several different parts of the financial sector, and the primarily benefits are reported to be to streamline the business, improve internal processes, and analyse large datasets.</p>
<p>While the assessment is that AI use is growing rapidly, primarily driven by the new generative AI technology, only 41 per cent of the firms that have AI in production say that they have a formally approved policy for their development and use of AI. When it comes to policies for employees' use of public generative AI tools, the guidelines lag even further behind.</p>
<h2>Many have started to prepare for new AI regulations</h2>
<p>The EU Regulation on artificial intelligence (the AI Regulation) entered into force in August 2024. It covers all sectors, including the financial sector. The majority of the provisions in the regulation go into effect in 2026.</p>
<p>The Regulation applies a risk-based approach, where AI systems are classified into different risk categories. Systems associated with unacceptable risk are forbidden, and systems classified as high risk are allowed if they meet certain requirements set forth in the regulation.</p>
<p>Of the firms using AI today, 91 per cent say that they have begun to prepare for the application of the AI Regulation or plan to do so in the next few months.</p>
<p>"AI introduces considerable opportunities for the industry to streamline its work. Firms now need to establish policies and procedures to ensure that the systems do not become vulnerable in conjunction with this," says Marie Jesperson.</p>

<p><span>The Bank of England chairs the London Foreign Exchange Joint Standing Committee (FXJSC) Legal Sub-Committee. The FXJSC is made up of market participants, infrastructure providers and the UK financial regulators.</span></p>
<p>Date of meeting: 17 September 2024</p>
<p>Time: 3pm &ndash; 4.30pm | Location: Bank of England, Threadneedle St, London, EC2R 8AH</p>
<p><section class="page-section">
<div class="section-heading">
<h2 id="chapter-0">Minutes</h2>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-0">Minute 1: Introduction</h3>
<p>The Chair (Sharon Blackman) opened the meeting. The Chair noted the apologies and the attendees.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-1">Minute 2: Minutes</h3>
<p>The minutes of the meeting of 18 June 2024 were approved.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-2">Minute 3: Global FX Committee (GFXC) Update (Natalie Lovell and Matthew Conway, Bank of England)</h3>
<p>The speakers gave a brief update on two of the Global FX Committee&rsquo;s key priorities.</p>
<p><strong>1. The 3-year review of the Global FX Code:</strong></p>
<p>The 3-year review of the FX Global Code is currently underway. To consider possible changes to the Code the GFXC established two working groups. One to consider FX Settlement and the other to consider FX Data.</p>
<p><strong>FX Settlement Risk Working Group update</strong></p>
<p>There are three areas of focus.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first is to strengthen&nbsp;<strong>Principle 35: Settlement Risk</strong>&nbsp;which includes the addition of a risk waterfall approach for managing FX Settlement Risk.</li>
<li>Secondly, updates have been made to<strong>&nbsp;Principle 50: Measuring, Monitoring, and Controlling Settlement Risk&nbsp;</strong>to make it clearer how Market Participants should measure, monitor and control FX Settlement Risk.</li>
<li>Lastly, there are proposed changes to&nbsp;<strong>Principle 51: Standard Settlement Instructions (SSIs).</strong>&nbsp;These proposed changes aim to discourage the use of multiple settlement instructions for the same counterparty, and for completeness the Working Group has proposed that a definition of SSI be added to the&nbsp;<strong>Code Glossary.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>FX Data Working Group update</strong></p>
<p>The changes proposed are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>enhance transparency around user-generated trade data on electronic trading venues.</li>
<li>provide more transparency on FX data/transactions under certain types of &ldquo;delegated execution&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p>The working group has proposed amendments to&nbsp;<strong>Principle 9 and 10: Execution</strong>&nbsp;and the Disclosure Cover Sheets.</p>
<p><strong>FX Global Code next steps:&nbsp;</strong>the updated version of the Code is due to be published by the end of the year.</p>
<p><strong>2. The semi-annual FX Settlement Survey:</strong></p>
<p>Matthew Conway gave an overview of the new global approach for collecting FX settlement data. It was noted that the October 2024 FX Settlement Survey round had been launched. A total of seven central banks had adopted the new approach for collecting FX Settlement data for the October round, ahead of the 2025 BIS Triennial Survey which would use the same Survey Template and Reporting Guidelines</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-3">Minute 4: ISDA update (Rick Sandilands and Jonathan Martin (International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA))</h3>
<p><strong>FX Definitions</strong></p>
<p>The speakers briefly explained the history of the FX and Currency Option Definitions (FX Definitions). These FX Definitions are jointly published with ISDA and EMTA and were published 1998, so are due to be reviewed and updated.</p>
<p>ISDA developed a plan for updating the FX Definitions, based on responses to an ISDA survey in 2023 of over 50 market participants, to understand how the current definitions can be improved, taking into account recent events and the evolution of FX markets since 1998.</p>
<p>Drafting of the updated FX Definitions will take place throughout 2024 and 2025, with publication expected end of November 2025. Market implementation of the updated FX Definitions will be in November 2027. This gives market participants and infrastructure providers 2 years to incorporate the changes into their systems and processes and aligns with Swift&rsquo;s release schedule.</p>
<p>The drafting workstreams are focussed on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disruption Events/Fallbacks overhaul</li>
<li>Adjustment for unexpected holidays</li>
<li>Digitisation/modernisation of the FX Definitions structure</li>
<li>FX Novation mechanics</li>
<li>EMTA and EMTA/SFEMC Template</li>
</ul>
<p>An Implementation steering committee has been set up to keep an eye on the drafting to make sure nothing is being proposed that could cause operational problems.</p>
<p><strong>Notices Hub</strong></p>
<p>The ISDA speakers then gave a Presentation on the proposed Notices Hub. The proposed ISDA Notices Hub is intended to be a robust, secure online platform to provide market participants with a faster, safer and more efficient method for delivering and receiving time-critical notices under ISDA and other Master Agreements. Market participants would be able to maintain control of their contractual position even when more traditional means of delivery prove difficult or impossible. The Notices Hub would include functionality to allow physical address details to be updated in all ISDAs with matched counterparties by single entry, plus periodic verification to reduce incidence of stale address details.</p>
<p>The Indicative timeline:</p>
<ul>
<li>Completed: High-level Legal Survey: surveyed 71 jurisdictions with 59 responses to date. They ran a commitment process where the respondents were asked for principles of support on a non-reliance basis, subject to protocol drafting and what the platform looks like.</li>
<li>Q3 &amp; Q4 2024: Commence build and draft protocol and bilateral documents.</li>
<li>Q1 &amp; Q2 2025: Complete build, finalise documents and finalise opinions.</li>
<li>Q2 2025: Launch Protocol pre-adherence period</li>
<li>Q3 2025: Notices Hub go-live/Protocol launch.</li>
</ul>

<title>The EBA Publishes Final Standards On The Specification Of Long And Short Positions Under The Derogations For Market And Counterparty Risks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published its final draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on the method for identifying the main risk driver and determining whether a transaction represents a long or a short position. These RTS are part of the Phase 1 deliverables of the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-publishes-roadmap-implementation-eu-banking-package"><span>EBA roadmap</span></a><span>&nbsp;on the implementation of the EU banking package in the area of market risk.</span></p>
<p>The proposed general method to identify the main risk drivers hinges on sensitivities defined under the market risk standardised approach (FRTB-SA) or on add-ons defined under the standardised approach for counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR). For the determination of the direction of the positions, the methodology is aligned with the one set out in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/activities/single-rulebook/regulatory-activities/market-counterparty-and-cva-risk/regulatory-technical-standards-standardised-approach-counterparty-credit-risk">RTS on SA-CCR</a>.</p>
<p>A simplified method has also been included, covering relatively simple instruments, such as fixed-rate bonds, floating-rate notes, stocks, forwards, futures, simple swaps and plain vanilla options.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<p>These draft RTS have been developed according to Article 94(10) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (Capital Requirements Regulation &ndash; CRR), as amended by the revised Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR3), which mandates the EBA to specify the method for identifying the main risk driver of a position and for determining whether a transaction represents a long or a short position as referred to in Art. 94(3), 273a(3) and 325a(2). In developing these draft RTS, the EBA has taken into consideration the method for determining whether a transaction is a long or short position in the primary risk driver or in the most material risk driver, developed for the RTS on SA-CCR in accordance with Art. 279a(3), point (b), of the CRR.</p>
<p>The CRR includes some derogations for the calculation of the capital requirements for market and counterparty credit risks, for small trading book business, derivative business or business subject to market risk. The CRR3 specifies that the size of the business shall be equal to the absolute value of the aggregated long position, summed with the absolute value of the aggregated short position. A position can be considered as long or short depending on how movements in its main risk driver affect the market value.</p>

<p>The 7<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;annual Energy Trading Enforcement Forum (ETEF), held on the 3 December 2024 in Ljubljana, brought together over 75 participants from the EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER), the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), energy National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs), and financial National Conduct Authorities (NCAs) to enhance regulatory cooperation in energy and financial markets.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Regulatory framework and cooperation</span></p>
<p>Regulatory oversight of potential market abuse of the trading in energy and financial products falls under two EU regulatory frameworks, namely the EU Regulation on Wholesale Energy Market Integrity and Transparency (<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsGCQEEBFMCAEwAAA1VHVYMBVcdCltQUBoMVFYBVgIFUQ9QVAgdVFAHWQAAA1YdBlgCUB0GCQFfGlddUAYZBlNWBFBSUgJVVwJURQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">REMIT</a>) and the Market Abuse Regulation (<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsGBgVXUlZXVkxfVABVHVZcUQQdUA5UUBoNBgMGAwMNVVUBBwYdVFAHWQAAA1YdBlgCUB0GCQFfGlddUAYZBlNWBFBSUgJVVwJURQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MAR</a>).</p>
<p>The ETEF is a key platform where energy and financial regulators and the two EU Agencies (ESMA and ACER) meet annually to share experiences on their supervisory activities and enforcement actions to better protect EU consumers and businesses from energy market abuse.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Revised REMIT, market abuse cases and Artificial Intelligence (AI) top the agenda</span></p>
<p>A key focus of the 7<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;annual ETEF discussions was on the enhanced REMIT regulatory framework.&nbsp; The&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtXUwcABwBQAkxYDgBVHVZYAgcdCw9UBxoFAQtSUFAGAVMDVVUdVFAHWQAAA1YdBlgCUB0GCQFfGlddUAYZBlNWBFBSUgJVVwJURQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">revised REMIT Regulation</a>&nbsp;(which came into effect on 7 May 2024) introduces&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsFBgNTUFYAWkwKBlBRHVYJB1AdC1pXVRpQVVZTDQMDAQdVUlAdVFAHWQAAA1YdBlgCUB0GCQFfGlddUAYZBlNWBFBSUgJVVwJURQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">new measures to better protect the EU citizens and businesses from energy market abuse</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>It brings a&nbsp;closer alignment&nbsp;of the EU definitions and provisions for transparency and integrity of energy markets with those in the financial markets.</li>
<li>It grants ACER new investigatory and enforcement powers in certain cross-border cases.</li>
<li>Furthermore, it calls for a reinforced cooperation between energy and financial regulators, strengthening their ability to detect, prevent, investigate and enforce the prohibition of market abuse in energy markets.</li>
</ul>
<p>This year&rsquo;s ETEF also consolidated the cooperation principles for market abuse cases which simultaneously fall under REMIT and MAR (i.e. cases involving wholesale energy products which are also financial instruments). Such cases need close cooperation to ensure effective enforcement among all national and European authorities involved.</p>
<p>The growing role of artificial intelligence (AI) in energy and financial markets&rsquo; trading was also a major topic of interest, together with the sharing of regulatory experience in detecting and investigating the most common types of market abuse.</p>

<title>FSB Sub-Saharan Africa Group Discusses Financial Scams And Fraud Prevention, And Crisis Preparedness And Resolution</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) Regional Consultative Group for Sub-Saharan Africa (RCG&nbsp;SSA) met on 6 December in Cape Town. The meeting was hosted by the South African Reserve Bank.</p>
<p>The meeting started with an overview of the FSB&rsquo;s work programme for 2025 and its planned contributions to South Africa&rsquo;s G20 Presidency. A key focus in 2025 will be on implementation of the FSB recommendations on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/07/fsb-finalises-global-regulatory-framework-for-crypto-asset-activities/">crypto-assets and global stablecoins&nbsp;</a>and on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/02/g20-roadmap-for-enhancing-cross-border-payments-priority-actions-for-achieving-the-g20-targets/">enhancing cross-border payments</a>&nbsp;globally.</p>
<p>Participants exchanged views on global and regional vulnerabilities in the financial system, including perspectives on the financial stability outlook. They noted that long-standing vulnerabilities remain, such as high debt levels in governments, corporates and households. Particular attention was devoted to the challenges regional authorities face in monitoring risks from non-bank financial intermediation. In that respect, members looked forward to the forthcoming FSB Global monitoring report on non-bank financial intermediation for 2024.</p>
<p>An important area of concern is the increasing number of financial scams and fraud cases worldwide. Participants explored the scope for cross-border cooperation, including through the FSB and other international organisations, to protect investors and consumers from malicious online activities, ensure the proper functioning of capital markets and promote financial stability. They shared experiences on preventive and enforcement measures implemented in response to these disruptions and discussed the role that artificial intelligence (AI) can play in fraud detection and prevention.</p>
<p>Finally, members discussed crisis preparedness and resolution planning for financial institutions in light of the growing interconnectedness within the financial system. Members noted the need to be prepared for failures of banks beyond globally systemic important banks, as noted in the FSB&rsquo;s recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/11/the-importance-of-resolution-planning-and-loss-absorbing-capacity-for-banks-systemic-in-failure-public-statement/">statement on the importance of resolution planning and loss-absorbing capacity for banks which may be systemically significant or critical if they fail</a>. Members further noted the increasing significance of regionally systemic banks and emphasised the need for African regulators to collaborate in crisis preparedness work. They also exchanged views on promoting cross-border cooperation and information sharing during crises, for example through crisis management groups, as set out in the FSB&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/04/key-attributes-of-effective-resolution-regimes-for-financial-institutions-revised-version-2024/">Key Attributes for Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions</a>.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h2>
<p>The FSB Regional Consultative Group for Sub-Saharan Africa is co-chaired by Lesetja Kganyago, Governor, South African Reserve Bank and Denny Kalyalya, Governor, Bank of Zambia. Membership includes financial authorities from Angola, Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa and Tanzania, as well as the Central Bank of West African States based in Senegal. Permanent observers include the Committee of Central Bank Governors of the Southern African Development Community, and the East African Community.</p>
<p>The FSB has six Regional Consultative Groups, established under the FSB Charter, to bring together financial authorities from FSB member and non-member countries to exchange views on vulnerabilities affecting financial systems and on initiatives to promote financial stability.<span class="fn"><a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/12/fsb-sub-saharan-africa-group-discusses-financial-scams-and-fraud-prevention-and-crisis-preparedness-and-resolution/#907af424-06c4-4b6a-91be-8afe250e2b78" id="907af424-06c4-4b6a-91be-8afe250e2b78-link">1</a></span>&nbsp;Typically, each Regional Consultative Group meets twice each year.</p>
<p>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. The FSB also conducts outreach with approximately 70 other jurisdictions through its six Regional Consultative Groups.</p>

<li><i>Same-store total retail sales (+5.7%) and transactions (+6.7%) grew during the busiest shopping week of the year</i></li>

</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.fiserv.com/" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Fiserv, Inc.</a>&nbsp;(NYSE: FI), a leading global provider of payments and financial services technology, has published a special report detailing consumer spending growth during the 2024 holiday shopping season.</p>
<p>The comprehensive analysis, which is derived from nearly 800 million transactions across millions of U.S. business locations, looks at consumer spending during the six-day period spanning November 27 through December 2. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fiserv.com/content/dam/fiserv-ent/final-files/marketing-collateral/documents-handouts-flyers/2024-thanksgiving-holiday-insights-special-report.pdf" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">2024 Thanksgiving Holiday Insights</a>&nbsp;report details shopping patterns across total retail, small business and payment types, and on popular holiday shopping dates, including Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the holiday week occurring later in the year in 2024, consumers feeling the crunch of a shortened shopping season spent feverishly to produce one of the strongest holiday spending weeks on record,&rdquo; said Prasanna Dhore, Chief Data Officer at Fiserv. &ldquo;The result was a big week, especially for small businesses, which saw holiday shoppers drive substantial sales growth throughout the week, including significant gains on Cyber Monday.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Total Retail</span></p>
<p>SpendTrend<span>&reg;</span>&nbsp;same-store sales data, measuring commerce activity across large, mid-sized, and small retailers, showed that total retail sales were up (+5.7%) compared to the same period in 2023. This overall growth was heavily influenced by increased transactions (+6.7%). Average tickets were essentially flat (-0.9%).</p>
<p>On Black Friday, total retail sales increased (+3.0%). Stronger growth followed on the Saturday after Thanksgiving (+6.7%) and Cyber Monday (+4.0%).</p>
<p>Brick-and-mortar purchases accounted for 58% of all retail sales, with sales up (+4.6%) and transactions growing (+3.0%). This in-store resurgence is a positive shift after previous years of weak performance during the holiday period.</p>
<p>Credit represented 64% of card spend at retail, compared to 35% for debit; but debit spending growth (+8.9%) outpaced credit spending growth (+4.1%).</p>
<p>At the category level:</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li>General Merchandise showed the highest growth in both spend (+13.5%) and transactions (+17.0%)</li>
<li>Building Materials/DIY<span>&nbsp;</span>benefitted from a spike on Black Friday, with substantial increases in sales (+17.4%) and transactions (+8.7%)</li>
<li>Furniture, Furnishings, Electronics, and Appliances had declines in spend (-1.9%) despite transactions growing (+6.2%)</li>
<li>Clothing saw a 2.0% increase in total retail spend and a small increase (+1.1%) in transactions</li>
<li>Sporting Goods, Hobby, etc<span>.&nbsp;</span>experienced a decline in total retail spend (-1.3%) but an increase in transactions (+4.9%), indicating more frequent, smaller purchases.</li>

<p><a href="https://www.fiserv.com/en/fiserv-small-business-index.html" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Fiserv Small Business Index<span>&reg;</span></a>&nbsp;data, measuring consumer spend at small retailers across the U.S., showed that small business retail sales grew (+11.9%) for Thanksgiving Week 2024. This growth was due to increased foot traffic (transactions up +9.3%) and assisted by average ticket size (+2.6%).</p>
<p>Small business retail saw consistent lift across all major shopping days, including Black Friday (+8.6%), the Saturday after Thanksgiving (+9.0%) and Cyber Monday (+13.0%), each of which outpaced total retail sales growth.</p>

<title>Vienna Stock Exchange: Midpoint Trading Goes Live</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/vienna-stock-exchange-midpoint-trading-goes-live/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/vienna-stock-exchange-midpoint-trading-goes-live/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Vienna Stock Exchange is expanding the functionality of the "Xetra<span>&reg;</span>&nbsp;T7" trading system and will enable midpoint trading from Monday, 9 December. Stocks can be traded on the Vienna Stock Exchange at a midpoint price between the best bid and ask limit. Midpoint orders are collected in a separate midpoint order book and executed as soon as supply and demand meet at this midpoint price. In addition, so-called "midpoint sweep orders" offer the possibility to first check for execution in the midpoint order book and &ndash; if not fully feasible &ndash; to immediately transfer them to the regular order book.</p>
<p>"By introducing midpoint trading, we are responding to increased demand and strengthening our core expertise in equities trading. The expanded service offers trading participants added value when pursuing their trading strategies at the most liquid trading venue for Austrian equities," explains Christoph Boschan, CEO of the Wiener B&ouml;rse.</p>
<p>Compared to trading venues that have already offered midpoint trading in Austrian equities, the Vienna Stock Exchange references its own order book, thereby significantly reducing the latency in data transmission and in the transfer of midpoint sweep orders to the regular order book. Trading via the midpoint order book allows larger orders to be executed without disclosing the discrete trading interest. As a result, price fluctuations due to increased supply or increased demand can be avoided. In addition, the implicit trading costs are reduced, as execution of the order is at the midpoint price and not at the opposite limits.</p>

<p><span><span>We are pleased to announce that&nbsp;</span><span>the Derivatives Service Bureau (DSB) has won &lsquo;Best Standards Solution for Data Management&rsquo; at the A-Team Data Management Insight Awards Europe 2024.&nbsp;</span><span>These awards recognise both established solution vendors and innovative newcomers providing leading data management solutions, services and consultancy to capital markets participants across Europe.<br /></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The DSB has been acknowledged for the successful&nbsp;</span><span>launch of the new global Unique Product Identifier (UPI) Service.&nbsp;</span><span>This achievement aligns with G20 commitments made post the financial crisis to reform the OTC derivatives market.&nbsp;</span><span>The UPI, developed by CPMI-IOSCO, based on Financial Stability Board (FSB) recommendations, has been established to streamline the global aggregation of OTC derivatives products and enhance the monitoring of systemic risk across global OTC derivatives markets.&nbsp;</span><span>This year, the US, Europe, UK, Australia and Singapore implemented regulations for counterparties to incorporate the UPI into their reporting workflows, driving global adoption and data harmonization.<br /></span></span></p>
<p><span>The DSB is a market utility fostering interoperability through the adoption and implementation of global, ISO standards, including the UPI, the International Securities Identification Number (ISIN), Classification of Financial Instruments (CFI) and Financial Instrument Short Name (FISN) for OTC derivatives.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>The commitment to advancing regulatory reform for OTC derivatives markets remains ongoing with Japan implementing UPI reporting on 7 April 2025, Canada on 25 July 2025 and Hong Kong on 29 September 2025. Korea and Saudi Arabia are also advancing preparations for the roll out of mandatory UPI reporting.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Emma Kalliomaki, Managing Director of ANNA and the DSB</span></strong><span>, said, &ldquo;2024 has been a significant year for the implementation of UPI reporting globally. The DSB is grateful to be awarded Best Standards Solution for Data Management, recognising the collaborative work between authorities, firms and the DSB to leverage and integrate international standards. We look forward to the continued work with all stakeholders to meet the evolving needs of the OTC derivatives markets&rdquo;.</span></span></p>

<title>Fair’s Fair: The Case For Prohibiting Unfair Trading Practices In Financial Services - Keynote Address By ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland At The Australasian Consumer Law Roundtable In Melbourne On 6 December 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fairs-fair-the-case-for-prohibiting-unfair-trading-practices-in-financial-serv/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fairs-fair-the-case-for-prohibiting-unfair-trading-practices-in-financial-serv/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul>
<li>The proposed Unfair Trading Practices prohibition is necessary to address the increasing gap between the fair outcomes that consumers expect and what the law can deliver.</li>
<li>However, the unfair practices of firms engaged in providing financial services will not be covered in the initial stage of these proposed reforms.</li>
<li>ASIC believes including financial services in these reforms is an opportunity to strengthen Australian consumer law at a time when consumers need its protections the most.</li>
</ul>
<p>I begin by acknowledging the Traditional Owners of the land on which we meet today, the Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung and Bunurong/ Boon Wurrung peoples of the Kulin nation and paying my respects to Elders past and present.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>As you heard yesterday from the ACCC, this year marks half a century since Australia introduced the&nbsp;<em>Trade Practices Act.</em></p>
<p>Half a century of national consumer law.</p>
<p>Half a century of rejecting the principle of&nbsp;<em>caveat emptor</em>&nbsp;&ndash; or &lsquo;let the buyer beware&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In bringing this bill before the parliament in 1974, the Minister for Manufacturing Industry, Kep Enderby, observed<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/fair-s-fair-the-case-for-prohibiting-unfair-trading-practices-in-financial-services/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>:</p>
<p>&lsquo;The untrained consumer is no match for the businessman who attempts to persuade the consumer to buy goods or services on terms and conditions suitable to the vendor. The consumer needs protection by the law and this bill will provide such protection.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Since then, consumer law has continued to evolve to meet the challenges of its day &ndash; including importantly through the enactment of the Australian Consumer Law (ACL) in 2011.</p>
<p>The Government&rsquo;s proposed Unfair Trading Practices prohibition is its next iteration.</p>
<p>This is a reform that ASIC &ndash; like the ACCC &ndash; supports.</p>
<p>This reform is necessary to crack down on practices that result in significant harm to consumers.</p>
<p>To address the increasing gap between the fair outcomes that consumers expect and what the law can deliver.</p>
<p>There is, however, one important gap in the reforms proposed in the recently released consultation paper.</p>
<p>The unfair practices of firms engaged in providing financial services will not be covered in the initial stage of these proposed reforms.</p>
<p>The consultation paper notes that changes in relation to financial services regulated by the ASIC Act will be considered after amendments to the ACL have been agreed in consultation with the states and territories.</p>
<p>Today I&rsquo;m going to make the case for extending the unfair trading prohibition to the ASIC Act at the same time as reforms to the ACL.</p>
<p>For treating financial services the same as other products and services.</p>
<p>For taking an economy-wide approach to this new area of consumer protection.</p>
<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>Before I do though, let me reflect on what&rsquo;s different about financial services.</p>
<p>I think there are three key points to make.</p>
<p>First, financial products &ndash; and the decisions we make about them &ndash; are inherently complex.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re intangible. They involve risk and uncertainty. And they&rsquo;re often made infrequently.</p>
<p>Financial firms know this. Some exploit this by making products and processes even more complicated.</p>
<p>Think about the length and complexity of the product disclosure statement (PDS) and target market determination (TMD) you&rsquo;ll receive with any financial product.</p>
<p>In contrast, many of the goods sold under the ACL come with no written terms and conditions.</p>
<p>Secondly, this complexity &ndash; and the information asymmetry it creates &ndash; exacerbates the inherent power imbalance between consumers and businesses.</p>
<p>Commissioner Kenneth Hayne highlighted this dynamic in his final report from the banking royal commission<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/fair-s-fair-the-case-for-prohibiting-unfair-trading-practices-in-financial-services/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>This power imbalance creates an environment in which consumers are more susceptible to unfair practices.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the harm that can be created by unfair trading practices in financial services is commonly far greater than in other areas of the economy.</p>
<p>The misconduct reported to ASIC sometimes involves people losing their entire retirement savings.</p>
<p>In other cases, it involves firms that prey upon people who are deeply indebted, exacerbating their disadvantage by charging exorbitant fees.</p>
<p>The economic and psychological impact of these practices on the consumers who fall victim to them is likely far greater than the impact of the examples canvassed in the consultation paper &ndash; such as drip pricing or subscription traps.</p>
<p>Put simply, the stakes are often a lot higher when consumers engage with the financial services system.</p>
<p>While noting these differences in relation to financial services, it&rsquo;s also worth noting that the changes in the broader economy that have prompted consideration of an unfair trading practices prohibition also apply in financial services.</p>
<p>The emergence of dark patterns is a key reason that is commonly advanced for introducing an unfair trading practices prohibition, as recognised in the consultation paper.</p>
<p>With the digitisation of financial services, dark patterns are becoming increasingly common.</p>
<p>These patterns distort, subvert, and undermine consumer choice. They make it deliberately difficult for consumers to access certain services, and all too easy to access others.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason why it takes just a few minutes online to sign-up for buy-now-pay-later, but you can&rsquo;t easily find the button to cancel your account.</p>
<p>This mirrors the earlier practices of credit card providers. In fact, in 2017, the then government introduced specific reforms to require credit card providers to provide online options for cancelling credit cards because some were failing to do so. But those reforms were limited to credit cards, and did not extend to other types of financial products.</p>
<p>The proposed unfair trading practices prohibition recognises the inherent unfairness of these types of practices. It will help level the playing field.</p>
<p>But the current proposal would apply to businesses trapping consumers into an unwanted subscription &ndash; but not to businesses making it hard for customers to switch to a better financial product.</p>
<p>Similarly, it would apply to dynamic pricing practices for airfares or concert tickets &ndash; but not for insurance.</p>
<p>Placed side by side, the gaps become clear.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we need to avoid creating a two-tiered system for the same types of manipulative conduct.</p>
<h2>The law as it stands</h2>
<p>In ASIC&rsquo;s view, we need a simple, consistent mechanism to combat this conduct, wherever it emerges.</p>
<p>As our Chair, Joe Longo, recently observed: &lsquo;simplicity equals enforceability&rsquo;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/fair-s-fair-the-case-for-prohibiting-unfair-trading-practices-in-financial-services/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Simplicity helps consumers understand their rights. It helps us get justice on their behalf.</p>
<p>In the absence of an unfair trading practices prohibition, ASIC must fall back on a complex range of provisions to address conduct that is manifestly unfair to consumers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a moment to reflect on the limitations of those provisions as tools against unfairness.</p>
<h2>Unconscionable conduct</h2>
<p>As other commentators on this issue have observed, the &lsquo;unconscionable conduct&rsquo; prohibition in the ASIC Act and Australian consumer law has proven to be an unreliable tool for regulators to use in response to unfair business practices.</p>
<p>While all unconscionable conduct is likely to be unfair, not all unfair conduct will be unconscionable.</p>
<p>Former Victorian court of appeal president, Justice Chris Maxwell described unconscionable conduct as &lsquo;unfamiliar and unintelligible to those it is intended to regulate&rsquo;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/fair-s-fair-the-case-for-prohibiting-unfair-trading-practices-in-financial-services/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The Redfern Legal Centre says it&rsquo;s the &lsquo;most difficult&rsquo; provision to prosecute or enforce<sup>5</sup>, despite involving the most &lsquo;egregious&rsquo; conduct<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/fair-s-fair-the-case-for-prohibiting-unfair-trading-practices-in-financial-services/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s experience in seeking to rely on the unconscionable conduct provisions reinforces these points.</p>
<p>You might remember our case several years ago against Mr Kobelt &ndash; the operator of a general store in remote South Australia.</p>
<p>He provided a system of book-up credit to his customers, most of whom were Aboriginal residents of the APY Lands. This allowed them to purchase goods and secondhand motor vehicles on credit.</p>
<p>His customers were required to provide him with their debit cards, PINs and details of their income.</p>
<p>He then withdrew all, or nearly all, of the customers&rsquo; money from their bank accounts on or around the day they were paid.</p>
<p>At his discretion Mr Kobelt would &ndash; for a fee &ndash; provide cash advances to enable his customers to shop at other stores.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the customers became &lsquo;tied&rsquo; to the store with the only option to purchase goods from the store that held their cards.</p>
<p>These practices would contravene a reasonable person&rsquo;s concept of fairness. But they were not found to be unconscionable under the existing law<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/fair-s-fair-the-case-for-prohibiting-unfair-trading-practices-in-financial-services/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>This is not an isolated case.</p>
<p>A few years ago, the Consumer Action Law Centre took on debt management firm J Daniels &amp; Associates (JDA)<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/fair-s-fair-the-case-for-prohibiting-unfair-trading-practices-in-financial-services/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>A vulnerable client had paid them substantial fees to &lsquo;save&rsquo; her home which was later foreclosed for a debt of less than $10,000.</p>
<p>This high-cost service was aggressively marketed to this client.</p>
<p>But the court found that JDA did not breach consumer laws in relation to its debt management, as it only promised to hold-off &lsquo;immediate&rsquo; repossession and provide &lsquo;some&rsquo; assistance in relation to mortgage distress.</p>
<p>The community expects ASIC to take action against exploitative business practices that cause harm.</p>
<p>But it is clear from these cases that the unconscionable conduct provisions, as interpreted by the courts, can&rsquo;t be relied on to help us meet these expectations.</p>
<h2>Other provisions</h2>
<p>Other legislative provisions available to ASIC also have significant limitations.</p>
<p>The design and distribution obligations (DDO) focus on particular aspects of design and distribution &ndash; and while they may in some cases lead to fairer practices, this is more a byproduct than a reliable effect.</p>
<p>The product intervention power must be tied to a product.</p>
<p>Protection from unfair contract terms is limited to terms of standard form contracts.</p>
<p>Finally, the requirements for credit and Australian financial services licensees to ensure that services are delivered efficiently, honestly, and fairly only apply to licensees, so can&rsquo;t be used to address unlicensed misconduct.</p>
<p>This is a very significant point, because the definition of financial services in the ASIC Act is effectively broader than the definitions in the Corporations Act and National Consumer Credit Protection Act. As a result, there are some business practices that are financial services under the ASIC Act but don&rsquo;t require a licence, because they don&rsquo;t fall within the narrower definitions in the Corporations Act or credit law.</p>
<p>These areas of unlicensed activity won&rsquo;t be covered by the proposed reforms, because products and services that fall within the broader definition of financial services in the ASIC Act are excluded from the scope of the ACL.</p>
<p>The sorts of business models that can exist in this lightly regulated zone include lending to small businesses and some forms of debt collection &ndash; both of which are commonly raised by consumer advocates with ASIC as areas of unfair practices that cause harm.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Blended business models</h2>
<p>Another key reason for alignment is that business practices don&rsquo;t always neatly fall neatly into &lsquo;financial&rsquo; or &lsquo;non-financial&rsquo; categories, as highlighted by a number of current areas of concern.</p>
<p>Recent media reporting has highlighted issues with high fees and commissions paid on strata insurance &ndash; and ultimately borne by owners of units in strata schemes.</p>
<p>These arrangements involve strata managers &ndash; who don&rsquo;t generally provide financial services &ndash; and insurance brokers &ndash; who do.</p>
<p>Consumer advocates have recently raised concerns about door-to-door sales of solar panels, with the purchase price financed by buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) schemes.</p>
<p>In these situations, the solar panel retailer would not generally be providing a financial service but once the BNPL reforms take effect, the BNPL business will be a credit provider.</p>
<p>And ASIC&rsquo;s work on cold calling practices in relation to superannuation has identified businesses that lure people through social media advertising or telemarketing into a &lsquo;superannuation review&rsquo;, which often involves convincing them to move from relatively well performing funds into high-risk investment schemes. While some of the businesses involved in this chain of conduct are likely to be providing financial advice, some argue that they are not.</p>
<p>A prohibition on unfair trading practices needs to be economy-wide, including financial services, in order to capture the full range of conduct in these examples.</p>
<p>And as a final note on emerging sources of potential harm, we need a wide-ranging prohibition to futureproof against new and emerging forms of misconduct &ndash; for example, biased credit scoring using opaque AI systems and black box algorithms that could cause consumer harm if left unchecked.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The fact that the discussion about an unfair trading practices prohibition has moved to this next stage makes this an exciting time for people who are committed to consumer protection.</p>
<p>This is our opportunity to strengthen Australian consumer law at a time when consumers need it most.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We rejected the notion of &lsquo;buyer beware&rsquo; half a century ago, yet our current regulation has created a system that consumers are expected to navigate at a marked disadvantage.</p>
<p>With new challenges, regulators need the right tools for the job. And it&rsquo;s clear to us that those tools include an economy-wide prohibition on unfair trading practices.</p>
<p>Thank you to Deakin and the Australasian Consumer Law Roundtable for having me here today.</p>
<p>I look forward to answering your questions.</p>

<title>Statement Of CFTC Commissioner Kristin N. Johnson On Future-Proofing Financial Markets: Assessing The Integration Of Artificial Intelligence In Global Derivatives Markets</title>

<div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item">
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Introduction</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Today, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC or Commission) issued a Staff Advisory to CFTC-Registered Entities and Registrants on the Use of Artificial Intelligence in CFTC-Regulated Markets (Staff Advisory) which reminds CFTC-regulated entities that their obligations to comply with Commission regulations are technology neutral, meaning these obligations apply broadly to market transactions and conduct without regard to the sophistication of underlying technology.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>During my term as a Commissioner and in the decade prior to my appointment, I have advocated for market and prudential regulators to have clear visibility into the diverse technologies that increasingly define the infrastructure of our markets. Working in partnership with market participants, we are able to enhance our ability to accomplish our mission of ensuring market stability and market integrity. Technological innovation will indisputably characterize the future of finance. The question for our Commission and other market and prudential regulators is how best to ensure that we integrate responsible innovation that reflects our regulatory values, protects customers, and preserves investors&rsquo; capital.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Well ahead of the development of the Staff Advisory, I began working with Congress, the Commission staff, market participants and public interest advocates to advance the discussion of AI integration in our markets. Today&rsquo;s Advisory marks an important step in continuing to advance that discussion.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>While I strongly support the Commission&rsquo;s efforts to advance inquiries regarding the integration of AI in our markets and to explore the need to introduce guardrails to mitigate the risks that AI technologies may present, I believe that there are some tangible steps that the Commission can take immediately to enhance the safety and benefits of incorporating AI in markets while minimizing the risks.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I have advocated for and repeat the call today for the creation of an AI Fraud Task Force, enhanced information gathering on the use and adoption of AI technologies by market participants, the development of an interagency task force among market and prudential regulators, and a formal policy of enhancing penalties for bad actors who use AI to lure vulnerable investors into handing over their hard-earned cash to fraudsters conjuring up deepfake investment schemes using easily and cheaply acquired or adapted generative AI technologies.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Staff Advisory</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The Staff Advisory encourages the development of responsible innovation and warns markets and market participants against AI washing as well as misunderstanding the importance of ensuring compliance. No matter the complexity or novelty of technology integrated into our market infrastructure, innovation is subject to compliance with the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) or other CFTC regulations.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>As I indicated in my statement released at the time of the Commission&rsquo;s Request for Comments on AI (AI RFC),</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>[t]he increasing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in nearly every sector of our economy and society has spurred a global debate regarding the promise and the peril of the assemblage of technologies described as AI. Registrants and other market participants are increasingly exploring and using AI and related technologies.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement120524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I commend the Commission&rsquo;s staff and my fellow Commissioners for taking steps to weigh and consider challenges presented by the use of a technology that our market participants have long employed for predictive analysis and important risk mitigation strategies, among other initiatives.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Throughout my career, I have carefully considered the implications of innovative technologies, such as AI, and their effect on financial markets. The Staff Advisory is an important step in developing a pathway for the Commission and our markets to consider emerging risks associated with generative AI and other innovative approaches that must be effectively stress tested to ensure global market integrity, market stability, and the Commission&rsquo;s efforts to carry out its statutory mandate. At the same time, it reminds regulated entities of their existing obligations with respect to the use of AI.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>As I previously noted, applications of AI in financial markets are only increasing&mdash;government regulators, self-regulatory organizations, and market participants are all adopting AI-based technologies and looking into additional applications for the future. This makes the work of the Commission in evaluating AI and providing guidance or oversight to applicable applications even more imperative.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Path Forward</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Over the course of my time as a Commissioner, I have worked to collaborate internally with my fellow Commissioners and Commission staff and across government agencies to encourage a thoughtful approach to evaluate the implications of integrating AI in our markets.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement120524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;I have encouraged the Commission to engage in a discourse with our regulated entities to better understand how our market participants are incorporating AI into their business models and market infrastructure. In connection with these efforts, I have advocated for a few key proposals to develop a robust regulatory framework for our markets. Each of these proposals is aimed at developing a principles-based framework that can remain applicable to AI and other emerging technologies as they continue to develop over time.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>Enhanced Supervision and Enforcement Resources</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>As our markets become more complex and reflect the incorporation of and reliance on novel technologies, the Commission must have the resources to effectively supervise more sophisticated markets. I believe that the Commission would benefit from increased resources dedicated to enabling several of the Divisions within the Commission to prepare for and meet the challenges of regulating innovative trading, clearing, and settlement technologies, among other changes to operational infrastructure that merits consideration. In addition, I would welcome an opportunity to work with our Division of Enforcement on developing an AI Fraud Task Force.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>Gathering Information</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I am pleased that the Staff Advisory considered the comments received in response to the Commission&rsquo;s AI RFC.&nbsp; I have encouraged an open dialogue among the Commission and Commission staff, domestic and foreign regulators, market participants, academics, and public interest advocates regarding the implications of integrating AI in global derivatives markets. The Staff Advisory is the latest step in what I hope will continue to be an ongoing discussion among each of these parties.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>Heightened Civil Monetary Penalties to Deter Fraudulent Actors</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>As noted above, I encourage the Commission to consider a CFTC Task forced focused on mitigating AI enabled misconduct. AI Fraud and manipulation threaten global derivatives markets and, as bad actors continue to develop more sophisticated threats using AI,</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement120524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;regulators must be prepared to enhance surveillance, monitoring, and penalties for violations of our regulations. I have encouraged enhanced penalties for bad actors who would use the powerful and important technologies described as AI to facilitate fraud or other illegal activity. Increasing civil monetary penalties against individuals and entities who misuse AI to engage in fraud or evade CFTC regulations will stymie the proliferation of misconduct.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Increased civil penalties may serve as a deterrent to misconduct and may help to ensure that markets use AI responsibly and in compliance with existing laws. The heightened penalties may be used to emphasize a zero-tolerance approach toward fraudulent activities, market manipulation, and other violations facilitated by the use of AI.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>Interagency Collaboration</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Finally, I believe it is important that regulators across financial markets within the United States and globally work in collaboration to establish effective regulatory approaches. Within the community of domestic market and prudential regulators, I have encouraged the creation of an inter-agency task force focused on understanding the implications of integrating more complex AI models into regulated markets. A collaborative approach would promote efficiency and consistency in AI regulation and ensure that regulations keep pace with technological advancements and emerging challenges.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Conclusion</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The Staff Advisory benefitted from the efforts of staff members and directors across the Commission, including staff and leadership from the Commission Divisions, including Division Directors for the Division of Clearing and Risk, Division of Data, Division of Market Oversight, and the Market Participants Division. The Staff Advisory released today is an important step towards strengthening the integrity, stability, and resilience of our markets.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<title>Statement Of CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam On The Staff Advisory Related To The Use Of Artificial Intelligence By CFTC-Registered Entities And Registrants</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-of-cftc-chairman-rostin-behnam-on-the-staff-advisory-related-to-the-us/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span><span><span><span>Today&rsquo;s staff advisory on the use of artificial intelligence by CFTC registered entities and registrants is the product of months long action by the staff AI task force</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/behnamstatement120524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;that I created to engage with market participants, AI technology providers, domestic and international regulators, and other stakeholders to understand existing and potential AI uses cases and risks in the derivatives markets. The advisory is also informed by public comment on staff&rsquo;s Request for Comment on the Use of Artificial Intelligence in CFTC-Regulated Markets.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/behnamstatement120524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Given the dynamic nature of artificial intelligence and the growing integration of AI in derivatives markets, the advisory is a measured first step to engage with the marketplace and ensure ongoing compliance with the Commodity Exchange Act and the CFTC&rsquo;s regulations. The advisory is emblematic of the CFTC&rsquo;s technology-neutral approach, which balances market integrity with responsible innovation in the derivatives markets. As firms may thread AI into the fabric of nearly every aspect of their operations, staff intends to monitor for any risks from AI that may merit policy or regulatory consideration. Staff encourages a continued dialogue with all stakeholders about the risks and benefits of AI use cases in the derivatives markets.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The advisory complements the internal transformation underway at the agency to build a forward-looking AI culture. Since becoming Chairman, the CFTC hired its first Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/behnamstatement120524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;to implement the agency&rsquo;s first enterprise-wide analytics and AI strategy to upskill staff and leverage data to optimize the agency&rsquo;s limited resources to better monitor risk, surveil for market integrity, examine for compliance, and enforce to deter unlawful trading behavior in our markets.&nbsp;This strategy aims to identify the highest return-on-investment projects for the agency to execute its mission. Our progress to date demonstrates a thorough and purposeful trajectory that is equally responsive and forward-looking in consideration of available technologies.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>I greatly appreciate the work of staff in the Division of Data, Division of Clearing and Risk, Division of Market Oversight, the Market Participants Division, and the Office of the General Counsel on today&rsquo;s staff advisory. I also greatly appreciate all of the effort underway in the Division of Data and input from the CFTC&rsquo;s data end users across the agency to drive our internal enhanced data analytics and AI transformation.</span></span></span></span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission&rsquo;s Divisions of Clearing and Risk, Data, Market Oversight, and Market Participants today issued a staff advisory on the use of artificial intelligence in CFTC-regulated markets by registered entities and registrants. The advisory reminds CFTC-regulated entities of their obligations under the Commodity Exchange Act and the CFTC&rsquo;s regulations as these entities begin to implement AI.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>CFTC staff is closely tracking the development of AI technology and AI&rsquo;s potential benefits and risks. Staff values its ongoing dialogue with CFTC-regulated entities and intends to monitor these entities&rsquo; use of AI as part of the agency&rsquo;s routine oversight activities. The advisory is informed, in part, by public comments received in response to the staff&rsquo;s January 25, 2024 Request for Comment on AI.

<title>SIFMA Economist Roundtable Survey Forecasts Continued Economic Growth, Rate Cuts, And Declining Inflation In 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sifma-economist-roundtable-survey-forecasts-continued-economic-growth-rate-cuts/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sifma-economist-roundtable-survey-forecasts-continued-economic-growth-rate-cuts/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) published the results of its Economic Advisory Roundtable biannual survey.</p>
<p>The Roundtable is comprised of the chief U.S. economists from over 20 global and regional financial institutions. The survey assesses the economic landscape and monetary policy and highlights expectations for 2.4% real GDP growth in 2024 and 1.9% in 2025. The majority of our economists expect three to five Federal Reserve rate cuts by the end of 2025, with a range of estimates for the aggregate number of cuts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we approach the end of 2024, our survey reveals the U.S. economy&rsquo;s extraordinary growth and projects continued strength into 2025,&rdquo; said Jay Bryson, Ph.D., Chair of the SIFMA Economist Roundtable and Managing Director and Chief Economist at Wells Fargo Securities. &ldquo;Nearly half of the panelists place the odds of recession in 2025 at less than 15%, while one-third predict a likelihood between 15% and 30%. The dispersion of forecasts for 2025 indicates some difference of views that may reflect policy uncertainty with the incoming administration. Overall, real GDP growth should remain solid, inflation should continue to recede, and the Federal Reserve will cut rates lower, signaling continued economic stability.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Key Takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Monetary Policy:&nbsp;</span>All our economists expect a rate cut at the December FOMC meeting with 90% forecasting a cut of 25 bps. The median forecaster looks for the midpoint of the target range to end 2025 at 3.560% (roughly 100 bps in cuts from current rate) and to end 2026 at 3.375% (a total of 125 bps in cuts from the current rate). Nearly 60% of our economists estimate the neutral nominal fed funds rate to be 3.0%-3.5%.</li>
<li><span>Inflation:</span>&nbsp;The median forecaster looks for core PCE inflation to end 2024 at 2.8% (year-over-year), which is unchanged from the last full survey in June 2024 and 0.1 pps higher than the September 2024 flash poll. In 2025, core PCE inflation is estimated to decrease to 2.4%, up 0.1 pps from the June survey. The top factors influencing forecasts for core inflation estimates are wage growth, growth in domestic demand, and monetary policy.</li>
<li><span>Economy:</span>&nbsp;The median economist forecasts real GDP will grow 2.4% in 2024; +0.8 pps from our last full survey in June 2024 and +0.3 pps from the September 2024 flash poll. For 2025, the median real GDP forecast is 1.9%, 0.1 pps lower from the June survey. Almost 50% of our economists put the probability of recession from 0% to 15%. The top factors impacting U.S. economic growth are the U.S. labor market, U.S. trade policy, and U.S. monetary policy. U.S. trade policy also shows up near the top in both upside and downside risks to the economy.</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) today announced the publication of a notice intended to provide clarity and guidance on how securities legislation applies to the use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems by market participants.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asc.ca/-/media/ASC-Documents-part-1/Regulatory-Instruments/2024/12/6194266-CSA-Staff-Notice-and-Consultation-11-348-AI-in-Capital-Markets.ashx">Staff Notice and Consultation 11-348</a>&nbsp;<em>Applicability of Canadian Securities Laws and the Use of Artificial Intelligence Systems in Capital Markets</em>&nbsp;also seeks stakeholder feedback through consultation questions on the evolving role of AI systems and the opportunities to tailor or modify current approaches to oversight and regulation in light of these advancements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rapid evolution of AI provides opportunities and challenges for Canadian capital markets,&rdquo; said Stan Magidson, Chair of the CSA and Chair and CEO of the Alberta Securities Commission. &ldquo;Our goal is to support responsible innovation that benefits investors and market participants, while addressing risks associated with the use of these systems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guidance in the notice addresses key considerations for registrants, reporting issuers, marketplaces and other market participants that may leverage AI systems. It highlights the importance of maintaining transparency, ensuring accountability and mitigating risks to foster a fair and efficient market environment. The guidance provided is based on existing securities laws and does not create new legal requirements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are committed to providing market participants with clarity on the responsible use of AI systems to ensure Canadian capital markets remain competitive and secure,&rdquo; said Grant Vingoe, CEO of the Ontario Securities Commission. &ldquo;This consultation is an important step in fostering trust and transparency as AI systems continue to reshape the capital markets landscape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The CSA invites responses to the consultation questions available on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/about/contact-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CSA members&rsquo; websites</a>. The comment period closes on March 31, 2025. Responses will play a critical role in informing future initiatives to refine the regulatory framework applicable to the use of AI systems in capital markets.</p>
<p>The CSA, the council of the securities regulators of Canada&rsquo;s provinces and territories, coordinates and harmonizes regulation for the Canadian capital markets.</p>

<title>Providing U.S. Regulatory Clarity For Digital Assets, Remarks Of CFTC Commissioner Caroline D. Pham Before The November 21 GMAC Meeting</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/providing-us-regulatory-clarity-for-digital-assets-remarks-of-cftc-commission/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/providing-us-regulatory-clarity-for-digital-assets-remarks-of-cftc-commission/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Opening Remarks</p>
<p>Good morning and thank you so much for joining today's meeting of the CFTC&rsquo;s Global Markets Advisory Committee (GMAC). Before we get to today's agenda, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the hard work that you all have put in, and to thank you for tackling some of the most challenging issues in our markets at a time when it seems that Washington may not be making much progress on regulatory clarity for new and emerging technology.</p>
<p><i>A Pragmatic Approach to Policymaking</i></p>
<p>Looking back, the GMAC has been particularly active, holding more meetings than any other CFTC advisory committee in the past year, and churning out 13 thoughtful and pragmatic recommendations to date on a wide range of matters, including U.S. Treasury market reform, repo and funding markets, money market funds, collateral management, capital and margin, exchange volatility controls, T+1 securities settlement and FX markets, central counterparty (CCP) resilience, streamlining trade reporting data, and a first-ever U.S. digital asset taxonomy. That's a significant body of work&mdash;by far the most of any CFTC advisory committee during the same timeframe ever. And of course, you're not done yet. This doesn't even include the many insightful presentations and discussions that have accompanied these meetings. I also recognize that for every meeting, countless hours are spent to prepare recommendations that ultimately help to inform policymakers and regulators both in the U.S. and across the world. As I've said many times, good policy is hard work, so I'm incredibly grateful that you've generously agreed to share your time, expertise, and resources with the CFTC.</p>
<p>One of the things that's really characterized the GMAC's success is that we've brought together a group of executives with real world practical experience who know how to get things done. Too often, getting things done can seem very challenging in Washington. I think that if this is a sign of what's to come, we have much to look forward to in the future. The GMAC demonstrates the benefits to government when we get together a group of dedicated experts and industry leaders who want to achieve solutions that actually work for our markets to make them better.</p>
<p>When I&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8703-23">relaunched the GMAC in 2023</a>,&nbsp;we set out to methodically take on some of the most significant issues facing global markets, and that's exactly what you've done. The GMAC embraced challenging topics, leveraged expertise, engaged in thoughtful debate, conducted transparent and public discussions, and once recommendations were workshopped and refined, it cast public votes. That is how the policymaking process should work.</p>
<p>Both your work&nbsp;<i>product</i>&nbsp;and your work&nbsp;<i>process</i>&nbsp;serve as guiding examples for this agency. It is my hope that the CFTC takes these approaches to heart. Public dialogue and expert input should be at the center of rulemaking efforts, not just an afterthought during a comment period after the ink is dry. A willingness to find common ground on emerging issues is how we stay competitive and innovative in an everchanging world.</p>
<p>This point is especially important when I think back on my own experience implementing Dodd-Frank. It's true that sometimes theory and Washington conventional wisdom don't always translate well to the real world and commercial operations of our market participants. That's why it was so important for me to make sure that in relaunching the GMAC, it was critical to enlist the experience and perspectives of practitioners from every aspect of our markets, from dealers and liquidity providers to asset managers, financial market infrastructures (FMI), service providers, and end users&mdash;all leading firms and market innovators in their respective fields.</p>
<p>Your insights help to inform and shape policies, often on issues where the government lacks the practical knowledge or political will to get it right without the help and partnership of the private sector. You all should be very proud of the GMAC&rsquo;s growing list of achievements. I am incredibly grateful once again for all of your contributions to date, and I know we&rsquo;ve got even more in the pipeline.</p>
<p><i>Recommendation on Expanding Use of Non-Cash Collateral Through Use of Distributed Ledger Technology</i></p>
<p>So, with that in mind, let&rsquo;s turn to today&rsquo;s agenda.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m very much looking forward to the presentation from the Digital Asset Markets Subcommittee on expanding use of non-cash collateral through use of distributed ledger technology. Leading this presentation will be&nbsp;Allison Parent of GFMA and Thomas Sullivan of Societe Generale.&nbsp;This discussion has already received significant public interest, so I expect this recommendation will garner much attention.</p>
<p>This recommendation builds on the GMAC&rsquo;s recent record of addressing collateral constraints to help improve liquidity and efficiency. In 2020, under then-Commissioner Dawn Stump&rsquo;s sponsorship, the GMAC issued an important&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8703-23">report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;making recommendations on improving the scope and implementation of the margin rules for uncleared swaps, including removing restrictions on eligibility of money market funds that engage in securities lending or repo or reverse repo transactions. The CFTC subsequently proposed and adopted many of the recommendations in that report. For example, in July 2023, the CFTC&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/2023/08/2023-16572a.pdf">proposed</a>&nbsp;additional reforms to its uncleared margin rules, including eliminating the restriction on eligible money market funds. I&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement072623d">strongly supported</a>&nbsp;these proposed amendments, as well as Commissioner Mersinger.&nbsp;The GMAC&rsquo;s Technical Issues Subcommittee subsequently&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement072623d">recommended</a>&nbsp;finalizing the amendments, which the GMAC advanced at its November 2023 meeting. Unfortunately, the CFTC has yet to finalize this rulemaking.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s imperative that the CFTC moves forward with its proposed amendments. These changes are not only common sense, but they also pave the way for greater efficiency that can be unlocked through tokenized money market funds as collateral, as outlined in today&rsquo;s recommendation.</p>
<p><i>Presentation and Update from Utility Tokens Workstream</i></p>
<p>Next, Chris Perkins of CoinFund will provide a presentation on the work to-date by the Utility Tokens workstream of the Digital Asset Markets Subcommittee on defining utility tokens and developing regulatory guidance for market participants. There&rsquo;s no doubt that innovators and creators are eager to incorporate the benefits of tokenization for not only financial assets, but also for non-financial assets. What is in doubt is whether they&rsquo;ll receive consistent, predictable treatment from regulators absent a clear foundational understanding of what these emerging assets are and how they can be used for real growth in the real economy and power the digital economy. Without such guidance, innovators seeking to develop the use cases for utility tokens are left to wander around in the dark and hope they don&rsquo;t inadvertently stumble into an enforcement action.</p>
<p>We need to change that. We need to deliver the needed clarity for digital assets that will empower American innovation with clear rules of the road and provide a path to registration or clear regulatory treatment that also ensures that there are safeguards in place. The CFTC can be a leader in this space, and the GMAC is already blazing the trail for us with its thoughtful workstreams. So, I look forward to an update on the progress on this front.</p>
<p><i>Conclusion</i></p>
<p>Finally, I want to again express my gratitude to the GMAC leadership team and all of our members for helping to make today&rsquo;s meeting possible. Thank you to Amy, Darcy, Sandy and Caroline in particular, as well as Allison, Tom, and Chris. I want to also acknowledge and thank my team: Harry Jung, the GMAC Designated Federal Officer, and Nicholas Elliot, the GMAC Alternate Designated Federal Officer, as well as Taylor Foy and Meghan Tente. Behind the scenes, and together with our talented and exceptional CFTC staff, they&rsquo;ve been working hard to make sure that the GMAC contributes to policymaking that is transparent, clear, and open to the public. Thank you.</p>
<p>Closing Remarks</p>
<p>The GMAC, with the practical experience of this group of executives and leaders, and the expertise and resources of their teams and firms, has once again shown us what can be accomplished when real world experience and common sense come to Washington and are brought together to develop good policy in an open and transparent manner with meaningful public engagement. I hope the GMAC's successful delivery of 14 recommendations in just over a year serves as a model for execution of policy objectives.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to the future, and I hope that next year, both the CFTC and SEC will act to reinstate the charter for the CFTC-SEC Joint Advisory Committee on Emerging Regulatory Issues, which has been dormant for the past decade. It would be a strong signal of a new U.S. regulatory approach that is collaborative and cooperative.</p>
<p>I also hope that the CFTC will continue to host staff roundtables which will further explore innovation in market structure, some of which has been discussed today&mdash;for example, 24/7 trading and the development of new ways to address both the settlement process and settlement assets, which would build upon the recommendation today regarding the tokenization of non-cash collateral.</p>
<p>All over the world, there have been successful and proven commercial use cases for tokenization of assets, such as digital government bond issuances in Europe and Asia, over $1.5 trillion notional volume in institutional repo and payments transactions on enterprise blockchain platforms, and more efficient collateral and treasury management. Now, we can finally begin to make progress on U.S. regulatory clarity for digital assets with today's GMAC recommendation on tokenized non-cash collateral. This marks a significant first step towards realizing these opportunities for our derivatives markets with exactly the same guardrails and protections in place. Embracing new technology does not mean compromising on market integrity.</p>
<p>I'm also excited by the progress of the Utility Tokens workstream and their extensive efforts on a regulatory solution for these key assets, which will help to unleash rapid innovation and growth in the digital economy.</p>
<p>I applaud again the leadership of the GMAC and the Digital Asset Markets Subcommittee and workstreams for promoting the competitiveness of our markets, and of the United States. Thank you again for your time.</p>

<title>CFTC: Federal Court Orders Defendant To Pay More Than $2 Million For Operating Commodity Pool Fraud Scheme</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-federal-court-orders-defendant-to-pay-more-than-2-million-for-operating-c/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-federal-court-orders-defendant-to-pay-more-than-2-million-for-operating-c/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas entered a consent order imposing permanent injunctive relief, civil monetary penalty, restitution, and equitable relief against&nbsp;<span>Marcus Todd Brisco</span>&nbsp;of Hawaii for his fraudulent solicitation and misappropriation of funds in connection with two commodity pools.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The consent order requires Brisco to pay a $350,000 civil monetary penalty and $1.65 million restitution to victims of his fraudulent scheme. The order also imposes permanent trading and registration bans, and a permanent injunction prohibiting Brisco from further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations, as charged.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The consent order stems from a CFTC complaint filed against eight defendants in January 2023. [See CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8665-23">8665-23</a>]. The court previously entered judgments or consent orders against the other defendants, and this consent order against Brisco resolves this action against all defendants.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Case Background</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The consent order finds Brisco operated two fraudulent commodity pools and solicited pool participants to deposit funds for trading leveraged or margined retail forex or retail commodity transactions but did not direct any of the funds to be traded as promised. From October 2020 to May 2022, Brisco operated his first commodity pool through his company Yas Castellum LLC (Yas 1). Brisco fraudulently solicited funds from at least 43 pool participants, who deposited more than $470,700 in the commodity pool. Rather than sending the funds to be traded, Brisco directed the funds to bank accounts controlled by another defendant, Tin Tran, and to a third-party entity.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In March 2022, the National Futures Association initiated an examination of Yas 1 and informed Brisco of serious concerns about his lack of oversight and control of investor funds. After Brisco repaid Yas 1&rsquo;s pool participants, he told the NFA he was ceasing operations and leaving the financial services industry. However, one month later Brisco launched his second commodity pool through a new company, Yas Castellum Financial LLC (Yas 2), which he failed to register with the CFTC as required. Brisco fraudulently solicited funds from at least 66 pool participants who deposited over $1.9 million to participate in the Yas 2 commodity pool. Brisco misappropriated the participant funds by paying himself nonexistent trading profits and directing funds to another bank account controlled by Tran. In total, Brisco failed to repay more than $1.6 million to Yas 2&rsquo;s pool participants.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The CFTC would like to thank the National Futures Association for its assistance with this matter.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<title>“Capital Markets, Competition, And The SEC”  Speech By Chair Gary Gensler</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/capital-markets-competition-and-the-sec-speech-by-chair-gary-gensler/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/capital-markets-competition-and-the-sec-speech-by-chair-gary-gensler/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Michael (Arnold, Chair of ABA Business Law Section&rsquo;s Federal Regulation of Securities Committee) for the kind introduction and for inviting me to speak for what may be my last public speaking gig while Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>Before getting into the meat of today&rsquo;s remarks, I want to say what a remarkable privilege it is to serve in this role. We live in a big, diverse country of 335 million people, all of whom benefit from the SEC. The agency, with authority over the $120 trillion capital markets, touches every part of our economy.</p>
<p>In such a big country, it goes without saying that others could do this job well, but I&rsquo;ve had the privilege of serving alongside nearly 5,000 dedicated SEC staff since April 2021. They are so deeply committed to the American public and making sure that markets work for investors and issuers.</p>
<p>As is customary, I&rsquo;d note my views are my own as Chair of the SEC, and I am not speaking on behalf of my fellow Commissioners or the staff.</p>
<p>Now I want to turn to the meat: the importance of capital markets, competition, and the SEC.</p>
<p><span>Capital Markets</span></p>
<p>First, the U.S. economy and, importantly, the public&mdash;both investors and issuers&mdash;benefit from our large, vibrant $120 trillion capital markets. They are part of our comparative advantage as a nation, undergirding the dollar&rsquo;s dominance<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-american-bar-association-120524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;and our role in the world.</p>
<p>We are the capital markets of choice for issuers and investors around the globe. At more than 40 percent of the world&rsquo;s capital markets, we punch above our weight class of just 24 percent of the world economy.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-american-bar-association-120524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Our capital markets are nearly five times larger than our combined $26 trillion banking<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-american-bar-association-120524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;and credit union sector.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-american-bar-association-120524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;Compared to other major economies, this ratio, and our significant reliance on the capital markets, is a distinguishing element of the United States. I believe this is a feature, not a bug.</p>
<p>Finance, at its core, is about the pricing and allocation of money and risk. The nonbank sector plays a critical role in that price discovery. Further, transparency and liquidity in the public capital markets provide a public good, leading to more efficient allocation and pricing of capital. Academic research has long documented that strong capital markets promote economic growth and may even provide greater resilience in crises.</p>
<p>A distinguishing and critical part of our economy is that debt capital markets facilitate 75 percent of debt financing of non-financial corporations. These markets are varied and deep, which benefits investors and borrowers. Compare this to Europe, the U.K., and Asia, where only 12-24 percent is raised in capital markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-american-bar-association-120524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Americans looking to purchase a home, a car, or have a credit card, also have long benefitted from the development of the nearly $14 trillion mortgage and asset securitization markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-american-bar-association-120524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Money market funds at nearly $7 trillion<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-american-bar-association-120524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;today generate higher returns on average and are more secure for savers and investors than bank deposits.</p>
<p>Further, well-regulated collective investment vehicles are among the great financial innovations of the last 90 years. At more than $30 trillion,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-american-bar-association-120524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;they provide everyday investors diversification and lower costs than buying individual stocks or bonds. As Jack Bogle aptly said: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look for the needle in the haystack. Just buy the haystack.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-american-bar-association-120524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say that the capital markets are not without risk. We shouldn&rsquo;t, though, paint with a broad brush. Not every risk is the same. In fact, the financial sector is about allocating and pricing risk, not eliminating it. It&rsquo;s important to focus on the activities that are more likely to contribute to fragility in the system.</p>
<p>On balance, our entire economy benefits from the breadth, depth, and liquidity of our capital markets.</p>
<p><span>Competition</span></p>
<p>My second main point is that robust competition is critical to the effective functioning of capital markets and maintaining America&rsquo;s leadership. The American public, whether sitting at kitchen or boardroom tables, benefit from competition in the capital markets, which lowers the cost of borrowing and raises returns on investments.</p>
<p>In essence, if we lower what economists call economic rents in the markets, that&rsquo;s good for folks borrowing and investing money. Investors get better returns. Issuers can raise money more efficiently. When market participants know that they can get a competitive price, they are more likely to invest in the primary market in the first place. Moreover, competition and efficiency allow prices to come closest to fundamental value, aiding price discovery and capital formation.</p>
<p>Efficiency and competition also promote greater depth of liquidity in the markets. As they say, liquidity begets liquidity.</p>
<p>The nonbank sector provides important alternatives and competition to the banking sector. The capital markets provide robust competition for those looking to borrow in both the commercial and consumer credit markets. Further, the nearly $30 trillion private funds market provides competition to the registered funds market and the public markets. This competition benefits investors, savers, borrowers, and issuers, as well as banks themselves.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-american-bar-association-120524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p>Since antiquity, though, finance has tended toward centralization and concentration&mdash;whether the Medici family back in the 15th century or J.P. Morgan a century ago. Thus, we must remain vigilant to areas where concentration and potential economic rents have built up or may do so in the future.</p>
<p><span>The SEC</span></p>
<p>Third, Congress understood these two main tenets: the importance of both capital markets and competition. They also understood the need for common-sense rules of the road that would lower risk and build trust.</p>
<p>When President Franklin Roosevelt and Congress enacted the securities laws in the 1930s, they had lived through the 1920s when hucksters, fraudsters, scam artists, and Ponzi-like schemers took advantage of investors. They learned what happens when unregulated markets were left on their own. Further, they understood the importance of competition to the functioning of capital markets.</p>
<p>One of the ways I think about this is through analogies to common-sense rules of the road for driving or a football game.</p>
<p>Over the years, I&rsquo;ve slept better knowing that when one of my three daughters borrows the car keys, that there are common-sense rules of the road to protect them. There are stop signs, traffic lights, and speed limits. There are prohibitions against drunk driving. I sleep better knowing there are also cops on the streets to enforce these rules and keep my daughters safe.</p>
<p>Common-sense rules of the road for driving help protect against risk but also promote economic activity.</p>
<p>Now, imagine what it would be like if the National Football League didn&rsquo;t have any rules of the road. Imagine if it didn&rsquo;t have referees. There would be mayhem on the field and injuries to players.</p>
<p>Common-sense rules for football not only protect the players, but also build confidence in the integrity of the game for fans. Thus, rules and refs help promote the business of the game.</p>
<p>This is just as true for the world of finance. Common-sense rules lower risk and build trust among the participants in the markets.</p>
<p>Congress has understood that technology and business models are forever changing. That&rsquo;s why over the last 90 years, Congress and multiple Presidents repeatedly enhanced regulation of the markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-american-bar-association-120524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s also why the SEC was set up with authority to update our rules for everchanging capital markets.</p>
<p>We at the SEC have a duty to investors and issuers alike to regularly update our rules to drive greater efficiency and resiliency in the markets&mdash;to continue to look for ways to lower cost and lower risk. As I&rsquo;m sure the athletes who competed in Paris would agree, even a gold medalist must keep training.</p>
<p><span>Updating the Rules of the Road</span></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why these last four years we&rsquo;ve been working to drive greater efficiency, which lowers cost. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve worked to drive greater resiliency, which lowers risk. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve worked to drive greater integrity, which builds trust.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done so in multiple areas, including market structure, disclosure, resiliency, corporate governance, and accounting and auditing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going say a few words about our market structure work in two of the most consequential markets, the Treasury and equity markets. We&rsquo;ve focused on the $28 trillion Treasury markets<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-american-bar-association-120524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;because not only they are the base of our capital markets, but there have been repeated jitters over the years.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-american-bar-association-120524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;We&rsquo;ve focused on the $60 trillion equity markets because they are the largest of our markets, more than half of U.S. households are invested in stocks directly or indirectly,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-american-bar-association-120524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;and there hadn&rsquo;t been an update in nearly 20 years.</p>
<p><i>Treasury Markets</i></p>
<p>The Treasury markets are integral to how the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy. They are how we, as a government and taxpayers, raise money. We are the issuer.</p>
<p>These markets have three relevant characteristics: deep participation of both bank and nonbank intermediaries, use of leverage, and repeated jitters.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen those jitters in the 1980s, the 2008 crisis, the 2020 dash-for-cash, and the regional bank crisis in March 2023.</p>
<p>Given the importance, leverage, interconnectedness, and repeated jitters of the Treasury markets, we embarked on key reforms with Secretary Janet Yellen&rsquo;s guidance and working with the Federal Reserve, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and Commodity Futures Trading Commission.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve broadened the scope of transactions required for central clearing.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-american-bar-association-120524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;Further, by March 2025, Treasury clearinghouses must separate proprietary margin from customer margin and further facilitate access to central clearing.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-american-bar-association-120524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>&nbsp;These reforms help promote anonymized all-to-all trading, improving competition and resiliency.</p>
<p>As part of implementing these reforms, last month the Commission and staff took important actions regarding various proposals of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation in furtherance of the goal to bring more competition and resiliency to the U.S. Treasury markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-american-bar-association-120524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></p>
<p><i>Equity Markets</i></p>
<p>Though the U.S. equity markets are the deepest, most liquid in the world, we can&rsquo;t take that leadership for granted. Comprehensive rules of the road for the national market system hadn&rsquo;t been updated in nearly two decades. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m proud that this fall we unanimously voted to update national market system rules.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-american-bar-association-120524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a>Your clients as well as everyday investors will benefit from more efficient equity markets where stocks can be quoted in narrower increments down to a half of a penny. They also will benefit from a separate rule we adopted unanimously to update information regarding brokers&rsquo; execution quality.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-american-bar-association-120524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a></p>
<p>Further, everyday investors now benefit from the shortening of the settlement cycle to one day.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-american-bar-association-120524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a>This ensures that investors who sell their stock on a Monday get their cash on a Tuesday. You don&rsquo;t have to wait until Wednesday.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-american-bar-association-120524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a></p>
<p>Markets though are forever evolving. Just this past month, the Commission approved an application for expanding trading hours to facilitate overnight trading on a national securities exchange.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-american-bar-association-120524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a>&nbsp;Such a development is just another reminder of the importance of our capital markets. It&rsquo;s a reminder of how competition fosters innovation in our capital markets. It&rsquo;s also a reminder, though, of how important it is to have common-sense rules of the road to promote markets. That&rsquo;s why I was glad that overnight trading on the exchange would only start after expanding transparency and providing additional investor protections.</p>
<p><span>Conclusion</span></p>
<p>My remarks today might seem to be an ode to the capital markets, competition, and the SEC. Well, that&rsquo;s because it is.</p>
<p>I think every American benefits from our unique combination of regulation, robust competition, and large, deep capital markets. As I&rsquo;ve said, though, the benefits of our capital markets are highly dependent on robust competition and regulation.</p>
<p>We need competition to lower costs, lower risks, promote innovation, and enhance access for issuers and investors.</p>
<p>We need well-regulated securities markets to promote trust. It&rsquo;s what brings investors and issuers to the market like fans to a football game. It&rsquo;s what underpins the world&rsquo;s largest capital markets. It&rsquo;s what has contributed to our nation&rsquo;s great economic success these last 90 years.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I have felt so privileged to lead this mission-driven agency these four years and do my part on behalf of the American public.</p>

<p>In 1996, Congress returned to competition. They mandated that in our rulemaking, the Commission must consider efficiency, competition, and capital formation, in addition to those earlier tenets of investor protection and the public interest. This new requirement applied to all of our foundational statutes and to rulemaking affecting all investors, issuers, and intermediaries.</p>

<title>CME Group Announces $2.1B Annual Variable Dividend And $3B Share Repurchase Program</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>CME Group, the world's leading derivatives marketplace, announced that its Board of Directors approved two initiatives to return capital to shareholders.</p>
<p>The Board declared the company's 2024 annual variable dividend, amounting to&nbsp;$5.80&nbsp;per share. The dividend is payable&nbsp;January 16, 2025, to shareholders of record on&nbsp;December 27, 2024, and totals approximately&nbsp;$2.1 billion.</p>
<p>In addition, the Board authorized a share repurchase program of up to&nbsp;$3 billion&nbsp;of CME Group Class A common stock, subject to market conditions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The combination of a flexible share repurchase program with our existing quarterly and annual variable dividend structure allows us to efficiently return capital and addresses the different interests and preferences of our diverse shareholder base," said&nbsp;CME Group&nbsp;Chairman and Chief Executive Officer&nbsp;
Terry Duffy.</p>
<p>Including today's announced variable dividend and the previously announced fourth-quarter 2024 dividend of&nbsp;$1.15&nbsp;per share to be paid in December, the total yield for&nbsp;CME Group&nbsp;dividends announced during 2024 is 4.9% based on the average closing stock price in 2024 to date, an 8% increase from dividends declared in 2023. The company will have paid a total of more than&nbsp;$28 billion&nbsp;in quarterly and variable dividends since adopting the annual variable dividend structure in the beginning of 2012.</p>
<p>CME Group&nbsp;intends to continue its variable dividend structure. However, beginning in 2026, the declaration and payment of the annual variable dividend will align with the first quarter regular dividend paid in&nbsp;March 2026&nbsp;rather than at the end of the calendar year.</p>
<p>The timing, prices, and sizes of stock purchases under the share repurchase plan will depend upon stock price, general market conditions, and other considerations. The share repurchase plan does not have an end date and does not obligate&nbsp;CME Group&nbsp;to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of shares of its Class A common stock.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>For the first time, ACER publishes its Country Sheets to present key metrics on retail electricity markets across EU Member States and Norway. These short 1-pagers provide insights into:</p>
<ul>
<li>key market facts;</li>
<li>consumer trends, including contract uptake and bill breakdown;</li>
<li>national progress towards 2030&rsquo;s decarbonisation targets, showing status of electric vehicles&rsquo; uptake (EVs), EV&rsquo;s charging stations, the installation of heat pumps and the share of final renewable energy consumption;</li>
<li>a high-level SWOT analysis to show strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of each market. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the key findings?</span></p>
<p>ACER finds that demand-side flexibility remains limited: the majority of consumers in most countries are on fixed-price contracts, hindering their active participation in electricity markets.</p>
<p>This is despite in many cases, the access to smart metering should enable the provision and uptake of more flexible contracts for both household and non-household consumers.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span><span>The Association of National Numbering Agencies (ANNA), a global association dedicated to the support of efficient capital markets through the use of widely embraced International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) standards, announced today that the National Numbering Agencies (NNAs) of&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Algeria, Botswana, El Salvador, Honduras, Jamaica, Macao, Maldives, Nicaragua,</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>United Arab Emirates</span></strong><span>&nbsp;(DIFC) and&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Zambia</span></strong><span>&nbsp;have transitioned from ANNA partners to become full members.</span></span></p>

<title>FSB Details Advances In Global Resolution Regimes And Unveils A List Of Insurers Subject To Resolution Planning Standards</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fsb-details-advances-in-global-resolution-regimes-and-unveils-a-list-of-insurers/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><span>List of insurers subject to resolution planning standards published in the FSB&rsquo;s Resolution Report, with thirteen insurers on this first annual list.</span></li>
<li><span>List of central counterparties (CCPs) that are systemically important in more than one jurisdiction has been expanded to fourteen from its last update in 2022, with the addition of ASX Clear (Futures) in Australia.</span></li>
<li><span>Resolution Report also outlines work the FSB is undertaking to address remaining lessons for the resolution framework from the 2023 bank failures.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) today published its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/12/2024-resolution-report-from-lessons-to-action-enhancing-resolution-preparedness/">2024 Resolution Report</a>. The report takes stock of the FSB resolution-related work of the past year as well as of the progress made by FSB members in implementing resolution reforms and enhancing resolvability across the banking, financial market infrastructure, and insurance sectors. It also sets out the FSB&rsquo;s 2025 priorities in the resolution area.</p>
<p>In 2024, the FSB focused on advancing the work to explore and address the lessons from the 2023 bank failures. This included work on public sector backstop funding mechanisms, operationalisation of bail-in, and assessing the impact of technological innovation on resolution processes. In the coming year, the FSB will continue to address these areas further and also explore practices of authorities using transfer tools in resolution (e.g. sales of asset portfolios); and promote cross-border cooperation and information sharing with authorities outside of Crisis Management Groups.</p>
<p>The FSB achieved important milestones advancing resolution framework development for other sectors of the financial system. The FSB finalised a new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/04/financial-resources-and-tools-for-central-counterparty-resolution/">global standard to support the orderly resolution of a CCP</a>. The standard aims to ensure that transparently calibrated resolution resources are available to achieve the orderly resolution of a CCP. In addition, ASX Clear (Futures) in Australia has been added to the list of CCPs that are systemically important in more than one jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The FSB is also publishing for the first time a list of insurers reported by FSB member authorities as being subject to resolution planning standards consistent with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/04/key-attributes-of-effective-resolution-regimes-for-financial-institutions-revised-version-2024/">FSB Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions</a>. In the coming year, the FSB will work on promoting consistency in the scope of application of resolution planning standards for insurers.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h2>
<p>The Resolution Report has been prepared by the FSB Resolution Steering Group (ReSG), which is the primary global forum for the development of global standards and guidance for resolution regimes, and for recovery and resolution planning for systemically important financial institutions. ReSG is chaired by Martin J. Gruenberg, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.</p>
<p>In December 2022, the FSB&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2019/11/fsb-welcomes-insurance-holistic-framework/">announced</a>&nbsp;that it would discontinue the annual identification of global systemically important insurers. It committed to publish annually a list of insurers reported by FSB member authorities as being subject to resolution planning standards consistent with the FSB&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/04/key-attributes-of-effective-resolution-regimes-for-financial-institutions-revised-version-2024/">Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions</a>. The FSB has been closely coordinating with the IAIS on its resolvability monitoring and annual public reporting on the insurance sector and will continue to do so.</p>
<p>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. The FSB also conducts outreach with approximately 70 other jurisdictions through its six Regional Consultative Groups.</p>
<p>The FSB is chaired by Klaas Knot, President of De Nederlandsche Bank. The FSB Secretariat is located in Basel, Switzerland and hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>

<title>Vienna Stock Exchange: Stock Market Taboo 2024: "AI Bubble" Caused Irritation</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/vienna-stock-exchange-stock-market-taboo-2024-ai-bubble-caused-irritation/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/vienna-stock-exchange-stock-market-taboo-2024-ai-bubble-caused-irritation/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Austrian capital and financial market community has decided: The stock market taboo word of 2024 is "AI bubble". The hype surrounding companies and stocks that are particularly associated with the technological change surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) continued unabated in 2024. However, the rapid price and value developments of tech companies that are particularly in the spotlight due to AI developments are also fueling debate. Investors, analysts and academics are equally concerned about whether the trend could ultimately end in a burst AI bubble.</p>
<p>"AI leads to investment processes that cost enormous sums of money, and there is no guarantee that these costs can be amortised. Such findings support the definition of the term 'bubble'," categorises asset manager Wolfgang Matejka. Manuel Schleifer, Senior Equity Market Strategist at Raiffeisen Bank International AG, adds: "The valuations of the broad market are at times at the heights of dotcom times. In contrast to those days, however, the well-known market participants are largely companies with extremely profitable and, above all, already existing business models. Expectations are high, but not out of thin air."</p>
<p>"Hypes like this attract not only a lot of attention but also a lot of money. If it seems too risky, private investors should remember the strategy that always works: investing regularly, over the long term and with global diversification. In the long term, equities are the safest and most profitable asset class, and you will automatically invest in these trends. Given the global weighting of AI stocks, not too little at the moment", says Christoph Boschan, CEO of the Vienna Stock Exchange.</p>
<h2>About the stock market taboo word</h2>
<p>Every year since 2017, the Vienna Stock Exchange has asked the domestic financial community to nominate the Austrian stock market taboo word of the year. The jury's decision is based primarily on the topicality, relevance and linguistic significance of the words. This year's eighth stock market taboo word follows last year's winner "stagflation", which replaced "excess profits tax" (2022). Before that, the "specter of inflation" (2021) was a stock market taboo word. In the years before that, "corona-related" (2020), "Brexit" (2019), "punitive tariffs" (2018) and "negative interest rates" (2017) prevailed.</p>

<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) today announced that two new payments solutions will be launched in mid-2025 to support the transition to e-payments for both corporate and retail cheque users<sup>1</sup>. These solutions will complement Singapore's existing suite of e-payment modes, including PayNow, FAST, GIRO and MEPS+. To allow corporates sufficient time to adopt these new solutions, MAS and ABS have also announced a one-year extension of the deadline to cease processing of corporate cheques.<br /><br /><span>New solutions to support cheque users in transitioning to e-payments<br /></span><br />2&nbsp;<span> </span>To provide greater convenience to corporates and individuals, ABS, in partnership with the Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs)<sup>2</sup>, will be launching the new EDP and EDP+ solutions<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;in mid-2025 to address the use cases of post-dated payments and transactions requiring greater certainty of payment respectively. Both EDP and EDP+ will be accessible via digital banking platforms, and will leverage PayNow to allow payers to identify payees conveniently when making payments via either solution. MAS encourages all cheque users to adopt these e-payment alternatives once they are made available.&nbsp;<br /><br /><span>Extended timeline for processing SGD corporate cheques<br /></span><br />3&nbsp;<span> </span>MAS and banks will extend the deadline to cease processing of corporate cheques by an additional year.<br /><br />4&nbsp;<span> </span>MAS had previously&nbsp;<a class="mas-link" href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2023/mas-announces-end-2025-timeline-to-eliminate-corporate-cheques"><span class="mas-link__text">announced&nbsp;</span></a>that corporate cheques would be eliminated and that all banks in Singapore would stop issuing new corporate cheque books in 2025. MAS and the banks have assessed that more time should be given to corporates to familiarise themselves with new and existing e-payment modes, as well as for corporates to shift from cheques to EDP and EDP+. In view of this, while banks will stop issuing new cheque books to corporates by 31 December 2025, the deadline to cease processing of corporate cheques will be extended to 31 December 2026.<br /><br />5&nbsp;<span> </span>Corporate cheque payees should present their cheques for clearing well before 31 December 2026, to ensure that their cheques can be processed before the deadline.<br /><br /><span>Public consultation on roadmap to sunset corporate cheques and transition plan for retail cheques<br /></span><br />6&nbsp;<span> </span>Retail cheques will continue to be available, along with cashier&rsquo;s orders and USD cheques for both corporate and retail customers.<br /><br />7&nbsp;<span> </span>Major retail banks in Singapore will continue to waive cheque service fees for seniors<sup>4</sup>.<br /><br />8&nbsp;<span> </span>Details on the transition plan from cheques to e-payments, as well as proposed initiatives that focus on addressing the needs and concerns of corporates and individuals, can be found in the&nbsp;<a class="mas-link" href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/publications/consultations/2024/consultation-paper-on-roadmap-to-sunset-corporate-cheques-and-transition-plan-for-retail-cheques"><span class="mas-link__text">public consultation paper</span></a>&nbsp;released today by MAS.

<ol>
<li><span style="font-size: 11px; background-color: initial;">Corporate cheques refer to cheques issued by body corporates, entities or businesses. Retail cheques refer to cheques issued by individuals.</span></li>
<li>hese banks are Citibank, DBS Bank, HSBC, Maybank, OCBC Singapore, Standard Chartered Bank and UOB.</li>
<li>The main difference between EDP and EDP+ lies in when funds are deducted from the payer&rsquo;s account. For EDP, funds are deducted upon presentment by the payee, while for EDP+, funds are deducted immediately upon issuance. For more details on EDP and EDP+, please refer to the&nbsp;<a class="mas-link" href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/publications/consultations/2024/consultation-paper-on-roadmap-to-sunset-corporate-cheques-and-transition-plan-for-retail-cheques" style="font-size: 11px; background-color: initial;"><span class="mas-link__text">consultation paper</span></a><span style="font-size: 11px; background-color: initial;">.</span></li>

<title>CFTC Releases FY 2024 Enforcement Results - Obtains Record-Setting $17.1 Billion In Monetary Relief, Sanctions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced record monetary relief of over $17.1 billion for fiscal year 2024. With the resolution of digital asset cases that resulted in the agency&rsquo;s largest recovery ever, this record amount included $2.6 billion in civil monetary penalties and $14.5 billion in disgorgement and restitution.</p>
<p>In FY 2024, the agency brought 58 new actions including precedent-setting digital asset commodities cases, its first actions addressing fraud in voluntary carbon credit markets, complex manipulation cases in various markets, and significant compliance cases &ndash; including its largest compliance case ever. The CFTC also continued to vigorously litigate pending actions, resulting in significant litigation victories and recoveries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The CFTC remains steadfast in its duties to protect&nbsp;customers and vigorously oversee CFTC-regulated markets critical to the health of the U.S. economy,&rdquo; Chairman Rostin Behnam said. &ldquo;Misconduct in our jurisdictional markets is rarely confined, especially as these boundaries are continually being redefined by disruptive technology. I commend our Division of Enforcement for remaining thoughtful and agile in its response to evolving markets and a growing pool of participants. Their dedication to holding accountable those who violate the Commodity Exchange Act is invaluable to the American public.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our actions in FY 2024 reflect our commitment to holding recidivist actors accountable, obtaining meaningful monetary relief and sanctions, and implementing robust remediation measures,&rdquo; said Director of Enforcement Ian McGinley. &ldquo;This was a year of large-scale, complex cases and settlements in both our traditional markets and in areas of increasing importance, such as voluntary carbon markets. We are committed to prioritizing strong, effective, and focused enforcement to deter future misconduct. I thank our division staff for their unwavering dedication this year; with their expertise and professionalism they are staunch defenders of our markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Enforcement Performance Highlights</p>
<p><i>Enforcement Advisory-October 2023</i></p>
<p>At the outset of FY 2024, the division issued an advisory &mdash; the Advisory Regarding Penalties, Monitors and Consultants, and Admissions in CFTC Enforcement Actions &mdash; providing enforcement staff guidance on enforcement resolution recommendations to the Commission.&nbsp;The advisory provides guidance on three areas: whether proposed civil monetary penalties are sufficient and at the level necessary to achieve general and specific deterrence, which determination includes consideration of respondent&rsquo;s recidivism; when the imposition of a corporate compliance monitor or consultant is appropriate and what the duties and responsibilities of monitors and consultants should be; and whether admissions should be recommended in a particular enforcement action. [Press Release&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8808-23">8808-23</a>]</p>
<p>The FY 2024 enforcement actions and litigation victories include the following:</p>
<p>Digital Asset Commodities</p>
<p>The CFTC continued to cement its reputation as a premier enforcement agency in the digital asset space. It secured record-breaking monetary sanctions and relief in FTX and Binance, charged Voyager&rsquo;s former CEO with commodity pool fraud, filed multiple actions involving decentralized finance, filed and settled charges with companies acting as intermediaries to digital asset exchanges, and brought a variety of other digital assets cases. For example, the Commission:</p>
<ul>
<li>Settled previously filed fraud claims against FTX and Alameda Research requiring them to pay $8.7 billion in restitution and $4 billion in disgorgement to further compensate victims for their losses. The $12.7 billion judgment is the largest recovery for victims and sanctions in CFTC history. The CFTC&rsquo;s litigation is continuing as to the other defendants in those cases, Samuel Bankman-Fried, FTX co-founder Gary Wang, Alameda co-CEO Caroline Ellison, and, in a separate action, FTX co-owner Nishad Singh. [Press&nbsp;Releases&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8638-22">8638-22</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">,</span>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8644-22">8644-22</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8669-23">8669-23</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8938-24">8938-24</a>]</li>
<li>Settled charges against Binance, Changpeng Zhao, its founder, and Samuel Lim, a former chief compliance officer, for operating an illegal digital asset derivatives exchange and &ndash; in a first-of-its-kind settlement &ndash; with willfully evading or attempting to evade provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations. The court imposed civil monetary penalties (CMP) against defendants: Zhao, $150 million; Lim, $1.5 million; and Binance, $1.35 billion and also ordered Binance to pay $1.35 billion in disgorgement.

<li>Charged Voyager&rsquo;s former CEO with commodity pool fraud and registration failures in connection with the bankruptcy of the Voyager digital asset platform and Voyager&rsquo;s operation of an unregistered commodity pool. This year, the federal district court denied the former CEO&rsquo;s motion to dismiss, holding in the CFTC&rsquo;s favor on numerous significant legal questions; the litigation is ongoing. [Press Release&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8805-23">8805-23</a>]</li>
<li>Won an order granting summary judgment on all counts finding defendants Seneca Ventures LLC, et al., fraudulently operated, in the manner of a Ponzi scheme, an illegal commodity pool that purportedly invested in digital assets, derivatives and other instruments; defendants also misappropriated funds through a carbon offset program. Defendants were ordered to pay more than $110.9 million in a CMP, $83.7 million in restitution and $36.9 million in disgorgement.

</ul>
<p>Manipulative and Deceptive Conduct, Disruptive Trading and False Reporting</p>
<p>The CFTC is focused on detecting, investigating, and prosecuting misconduct &mdash; fraud, manipulation, disruptive trading, and false reporting &mdash; that can undermine market integrity. The CFTC filed actions relating to this type of misconduct across markets for gasoline, fuel oil, agricultural commodities, such as cotton and oats, and voluntary carbon credits. In FY 2024, related actions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simultaneously filed and settled charges against CQC Impact Investors LLC, one of the largest voluntary carbon credit project developers in the world, and its former COO in connection with a fraudulent scheme reporting false and misleading data to at least one carbon credit registry, third-party reviewers, and others with the goal of obtaining carbon credits far beyond what CQC was entitled to receive and to increase the company&rsquo;s revenue by millions of dollars. The CFTC imposed a $1 million CMP. In October, the CFTC also filed a fraud complaint against CQC&rsquo;s former CEO. These marked the first-ever CFTC actions for fraud and false reports in the voluntary carbon credit market. [Press Release&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8994-24">8994-24</a>]</li>
<li>Simultaneously filed and settled charges against Trafigura Trading LLC for trading on misappropriated nonpublic information (physical and derivative gasoline transactions) and manipulation (fuel oil benchmark; Platts&rsquo; USGC HSFO Benchmark). The CFTC imposed a $55 million CMP. [Press Release&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8921-24">8921-24</a>]</li>
<li>Simultaneously filed and settled charges against energy trading company TotalEnergies Trading SA finding that, to benefit its derivatives positions, it manipulated the market for EBOB-linked futures contracts by affecting the benchmark price for physical EBOB, a type of refined automobile gasoline used primarily in Europe, that is published by the London-based price-reporting service Argus by selling physical EBOB at below market prices. The CFTC imposed a $48 million CMP. [Press Release&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8953-24">8953-24</a>]</li>
</ul>
<p>Reporting, Risk Management, Adequate Compliance Programs and Business Practices</p>
<p>The CFTC&rsquo;s enforcement program helps to ensure registrants and registered entities comply with recordkeeping and reporting requirements; adopt and implement proper risk management processes; maintain adequate compliance programs; and engage in appropriate business practices. In FY 2024, related actions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simultaneously filed and settled charges against J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, a registered swap dealer and FCM, for failing to diligently supervise its business as a CFTC registrant resulting in its failure to capture billions of orders in its surveillance systems.

Morgan&rsquo;s policies, procedures, and controls relating to trade surveillance. [Press Release&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8914-24">8914-24</a>]</li>
<li>Simultaneously filed and settled charges against registered swap dealer The Toronto Dominion Bank for the bank&rsquo;s lack of effective oversight and failure to supervise its electronic communications system, resulting in the failure to surveil certain communications for hundreds of its swap dealer personnel over a five-year period.

<li>Simultaneously filed and settled charges against CFTC registrants, including swap dealers and introducing brokers (IB), for recordkeeping and/or supervision violations, finding they failed to stop their employees, including senior-level staff, from using unapproved communication methods for a number of years.

</ul>
<p>Protecting Customers</p>
<p>Since its inception, the CFTC has focused on protecting customers in commodity and derivatives markets from fraud and other abuse. Many of the matters above involved important customer protection elements. In addition, below are other CFTC actions that protected the public, including significant litigation victories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Charged Traders Domain FX Ltd., doing business as The Traders Domain, et al., alleging 16 defendants individually, and at times working together, made material fraudulent representations to their customers and misappropriated customer funds in a $283 million multi-layered Ponzi scheme to solicit funds for trading leveraged or margined retail commodity transactions, specifically gold-to-U.S. dollar pairs as well as assorted other commodities, through pooled and individual accounts. [Press Release&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8997-24">8997-24</a>]</li>
<li>Charged defendants who claimed to operate an online platform that allowed customers to buy and sell cattle. The defendants allegedly solicited, accepted, and used customer funds to pay other customers in the nature of a Ponzi scheme. The defendants also allegedly received more than $161 million from over 2,000 victims in at least 14 states. [Press Release&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8911-24">8911-24</a>]</li>
<li>Simultaneously filed and settled charges for failure to register as a commodity trading advisor against a self-employed consultant to farmers, who while primarily providing services generally related to activities associated with physical crop-related activities also provided his clients hedging advice relating to their crop production using commodity futures. [Press Release&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8950-24">8950-24</a>]</li>
<li>Simultaneously filed and settled charges against a registered FCM that failed to have adequate policies and procedures governing the emergency handling of accounts and did not exercise sufficient oversight over its employees&rsquo; handling of accounts in response to a statutory restraining order issued in a CFTC civil enforcement action charging fraud. These failures resulted in positions in the accounts remaining open for several days after the SRO was served, during which time the FCM lost more than $200,000. [Press Release&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8973-24">8973-24</a>]</li>

[Press release&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8992-24">8992-24</a>].</li>
</ul>
<p>Misconduct Involving Confidential Information</p>
<p>Illegal use of confidential information can significantly undermine market integrity and harm customers in the CFTC&rsquo;s markets. As noted above in discussing anti-manipulation enforcement, the CFTC filed and settled an enforcement action against Trafigura Trading LLC finding it both misappropriated nonpublic information and manipulated a fuel oil benchmark. [Press Release&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8921-24">8921-24</a>] The CFTC filed the following additional actions related to misconduct involving confidential information:</p>
<ul>

The CFTC imposed a $61 million CMP and ordered Freepoint to comply with its undertaking to pay $30.5 million in disgorgement. [Press Release<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8834-23">&nbsp;8834-23</a>].</li>
<li>Filed charges against an associated person of an IB, who misappropriated nonpublic information from an IB client and tipped that information to a third-party, who then traded based on this information and shared the trading profits with the AP. [Press release&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8979-24">8979-24</a>] The CFTC previously filed a complaint against the tippee and entered an order against the IB for their roles in the scheme.

</ul>
<p>Trade Practice Violations</p>
<p>In addition to disruptive trading, which includes spoofing, the CFTC also investigates and prosecutes other trade practice violations that may adversely affect the integrity of the markets, such as violations involving wash trades, fictitious trades, and position limits. The CFTC achieved the following results in this program area:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simultaneously filed and settled charges against Merrill Lynch Commodities Inc. for exceeding the federal and ICE Futures U.S. position limits in contracts that reference natural gas futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange and for swap dealer supervision and position-limit monitoring failures.

</ul>
<p><i>Surveillance and Enforcement Data Analytics Office</i></p>
<p>Because of the increasingly important role of data analytics in the CFTC&rsquo;s enforcement program, this year the Division of Enforcement created a new Surveillance and Enforcement Data Analytics Office to enhance the division&rsquo;s surveillance and analytic capabilities. The office places the division&rsquo;s existing forensic economist and market surveillance capabilities into one office, an office that can scrutinize markets to detect misconduct, analyze complex matters, and support the division&rsquo;s investigations and litigations with sophisticated financial, economic, and data analysis. That structure also includes a new section that focuses on developing analytic tools and programs to enhance the investigative analytic, proactive detection, and surveillance capabilities of the division.</p>
<p><i>Cooperation with Criminal and Regulatory Authorities</i></p>
<p>The CFTC&rsquo;s enforcement program focuses on collaborative relationships with self-regulatory organizations, and state, federal, and international authorities, including achieving efficiencies through referrals, to meet its enforcement objectives. The parallel enforcement program showcases how the CFTC can most effectively protect markets when working together with colleagues in the enforcement and regulatory community.</p>
<p>Specifically, the CFTC believes a robust combination of criminal prosecution and regulatory enforcement is critical to deterring violators, punishing misconduct, preserving market integrity, and protecting market participants. An example is the settlement as to liability&nbsp;of a joint enforcement action filed by the CFTC and 30 state securities regulatory agencies that are members of the North American Securities Administrators Association charging a precious metals dealer and its owner for orchestrating a $68 million fraudulent nationwide scheme targeting elderly persons. [Press Release&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8489-22">8489-22</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8812-23">8812-23</a>]</p>
<p><i>Whistleblower Program</i></p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whistleblower.gov/">Whistleblower Program</a>&nbsp;continues to demonstrate its importance to the CFTC&rsquo;s enforcement program as reflected in the leads generated, successful enforcement actions, and whistleblower awards.&nbsp;The CFTC issued the most awards on record for any fiscal year, and, in another annual record, the Whistleblower Office received&nbsp;over 1,700 whistleblower tips.</p>
<p>Many different types of whistleblowers received awards this year, including victims, witnesses, insiders, market participants, employees, and compliance professionals.&nbsp;The CFTC granted 15 applications, totaling over $42 million in award payments. Enforcement actions associated with these awards resulted in monetary relief of approximately $162 million collected. Since making its first award in 2014, the CFTC has issued 53 orders granting nearly $390 million in award payments to whistleblowers. Enforcement actions associated with all program awards have resulted in monetary relief of over $3.2 billion.</p>
<p><em>An addendum to these results includes a table summary of the 58 new actions taken and a list of all FY 2024 actions including actions involving digital asset-related conduct.</em></p>

<title>Canadian Securities Regulators Publish Summary Of 2024 Systemic Risk Survey Results</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) today published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/resources/csa-surveys/2024-csa-systemic-risk-survey-2/">a summary of the results</a>&nbsp;from its third annual systemic risk survey. The results of this survey provide the CSA with important information on market participants&rsquo; views about the stability of the Canadian financial system.<br /><br />The survey was completed by 536 Canadian portfolio managers and investment dealers between October 10 and November 4, 2024. Overall, respondents indicated that they were less concerned about Canadian financial stability than last year. In addition, concern about the level of interest rates fell sharply in this year&rsquo;s survey and was no longer the top concern for market participants. A likely key factor to this change was the recent and expected reductions in interest rates. Their main concerns at the time of the survey were household debt, cyber vulnerabilities, the geopolitical environment, and the housing market.<br /><br />&ldquo;It's encouraging to see the results from our third systemic risk survey, which indicates a positive view of financial stability in the Canadian capital markets,&rdquo; said Stan Magidson, CSA Chair and Chair and CEO of the Alberta Securities Commission. &ldquo;We would also like to acknowledge the industry for their participation. With year-over-year growth in survey participation, we are able to gather critical information on changing risk perceptions in this new interest rate environment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To read more about the survey and key findings, please visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/resources/csa-surveys/2024-csa-systemic-risk-survey-2/">CSA website</a>.</p>

<title>BC Securities Commission Debuts Updated Investment Caution List To Protect British Columbians</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bc-securities-commission-debuts-updated-investment-caution-list-to-protect-briti/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bc-securities-commission-debuts-updated-investment-caution-list-to-protect-briti/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The BC Securities Commission (BCSC) has launched an updated&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/enforcement/early-intervention/investment-caution-list">Investment Caution List</a>&nbsp;(ICL) as part of its intensified efforts to protect the public and combat the escalating threat of online investment fraud.</p>
<p>The list, which is constantly being updated, warns British Columbians about companies and individuals that may pose a risk to the public and that may be located in B.C. or accept B.C. residents as customers. Names are added to the list when they display one or more of the following characteristics:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>They are not registered to provide investment services or investment opportunities&nbsp;</li>
<li>They are promoting investments that show signs of fraud&nbsp;</li>
<li>They impersonate legitimate, authorized firms, or use names similar to such firms.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>As online investment fraud &ndash; often originating from outside Canada &ndash; has exploded in frequency, the BCSC expanded its criteria for including entities on the ICL. The list now includes any known aliases of entries and features clearer, plain-language explanations and information like the &ldquo;red flags&rdquo; of fraudulent investment schemes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If one of the names on the list tries to sell you an investment or asks for money, immediately report it to the BCSC,&rdquo; said Doug Muir, the BCSC&rsquo;s Director of Enforcement. &ldquo;There is a risk of losing your entire investment, and the sooner we know about it, the better the chance that we can protect others from falling for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to taking complaints from the public, the BCSC provides investors with resources about how to protect themselves from investment fraud and help verify whether an individual or company is authorized to do business with B.C. residents.</p>
<p>The ICL is just one of the tools that the BCSC uses to disrupt online investment fraud. Other measures include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requesting the removal of suspicious websites and achieving 66 removals this year</li>
<li>Collaborating with other regulators and law enforcement agencies &ndash; in Canada and abroad &ndash; on joint efforts to protect investors and deter fraudsters from exploiting British Columbians</li>
<li>Working with the private sector on innovative ways to leverage their knowledge and expertise to reduce victimization</li>
<li>Communicating with registered crypto trading platforms and financial institutions on how to prevent harm to their clients</li>
<li>Alerting payment processors that they could be unknowingly handling proceeds of investment fraud</li>
<li>Issuing investor alerts about recently surfaced schemes that may pose a new, imminent risk to the public</li>
<li>Providing information through our investor education website, InvestRight.org, so people have the knowledge they need to identify and avoid online investment fraud, including specific scams involving artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Last year, British Columbians reported losses of&nbsp;$46.4 million&nbsp;from online investment scams to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (CAFC) &ndash; twice as much as the previous year. The real cost is likely much higher because the CAFC estimates that only five per cent of fraud victims report such incidents to authorities.</p>

<title>EBA Proposes Criteria To Appoint A Central Contact Point For Crypto-Asset Service Providers To Strengthen The Fight Against Money-Laundering And Terrorism Financing In Host Member States</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/eba-proposes-criteria-to-appoint-a-central-contact-point-for-crypto-asset-servic/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/eba-proposes-criteria-to-appoint-a-central-contact-point-for-crypto-asset-servic/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today launched a public consultation on draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) specifying the criteria according to which crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) should appoint a central contact point to ensure compliance with local anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) obligations of the host Member State. This consultation runs until 4 February 2025.</span></p>
<p>CASPs can provide services in other Member States through establishments other than branches. Once established, CASPs have to comply with local AML/CFT obligations, even if their establishments are not &lsquo;obliged entities&rsquo; themselves. This can make the AML/CFT supervision of services provided through these establishments difficult.</p>
<p>To address this, the draft RTS sets out the criteria for determining the circumstances in which the appointment of a central contact point is appropriate, as well as the functions of those central contact points. Since the same considerations apply to electronic money issuers (EMI) and payment service providers (PSPs) as they do to CASPs, the EBA proposes to retain the structure and approach set out in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/1108 and extend existing provisions to CASPs (leaving the provisions that apply to EMIs and PSPs unchanged), while also introducing new provisions for CASPs where this is necessary in light of their business model and operation.</p>
<h4>Consultation process</h4>
<p>Comments to the consultation paper can be sent by clicking on the "send your comments" button on the EBA's consultation page. The deadline for the submission of comments is 4 February 2025.</p>
<p>The EBA will hold a virtual public hearing on the consultation paper on 16 January 2024 from 15:00 to 17:00 Paris time. The EBA invites interested stakeholders to register using this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/public-hearing-draft-regulatory-technical-standards-amending-commission-delegated-regulation-eu">link</a>&nbsp;by 3 January 2023 at 16:00 CET. The dial-in details will be communicated to those who have registered for the meeting.</p>
<p>All contributions received will be published following the end of the consultation unless requested otherwise.</p>
<h4>Legal basis, background</h4>
<p>Article 45(10) of Directive (EU) 2015/849 requires the EBA to develop RTS setting out the criteria for determining the circumstances in which the appointment of a central contact point is appropriate, and the functions of the central contact points.</p>
<p>A first version of such draft regulatory standards was issued in 2017. This Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/1108 was published in the Official Journal of the EU in 2018. The scope was limited to EMIs and PSPs.</p>
<p>Regulation (EU) 2023/1113 on information accompanying transfers of funds and certain crypto-assets applies from 30 December 2024. It amends Directive (EU) 2015/849, inter alia by extending its scope to crypto-asset service providers. Consequently, Article 45(9) of this Directive extends provisions that Member States may require EMIs and PSPs established on their territory in forms other than a branch, and whose head office is situated in another Member State, to appoint a CCP point in their territory to CASPs. This means that the EBA has to update the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/1108.</p>

<title>US Federal Agencies Issue Statement On Elder Financial Exploitation</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-federal-agencies-issue-statement-on-elder-financial-exploitation/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-federal-agencies-issue-statement-on-elder-financial-exploitation/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Five federal financial regulatory agencies, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), and state financial regulators issued a statement today to provide supervised institutions with examples of risk management and other practices that may be effective in combatting elder financial exploitation.</p>
<p>Older adults who experience financial exploitation can lose their life savings and financial security and face other harm. A FinCEN financial trend analysis of Bank Secrecy Act reports over a one-year period ending in June 2023 found that about $27 billion in reported suspicious activity was linked to elder financial exploitation.</p>
<p>Banks, credit unions, and other supervised institutions play an important role in combatting elder financial exploitation and supporting their customers who experience these crimes. The statement provides examples of risk management and other practices that supervised institutions may use to help identify, prevent, and respond to elder financial exploitation, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developing effective governance and oversight, including policies and practices to protect account holders and the institution</li>
<li>Training employees on recognizing and responding to elder financial exploitation</li>
<li>Using transaction holds and disbursement delays, as appropriate, and consistent with applicable law</li>
<li>Establishing a trusted contact designation process for account holders</li>
<li>Filing suspicious activity reports to FinCEN in a timely manner</li>
<li>Reporting suspected elder financial exploitation to law enforcement, Adult Protective Services, and other appropriate entities</li>
<li>Providing financial records to appropriate authorities where consistent with applicable law</li>
<li>Engaging with elder fraud prevention and response networks</li>
<li>Increasing awareness through consumer outreach</li>

<title>US Treasury Exposes Money Laundering Network Using Digital Assets To Evade Sanctions - OFAC And Foreign Partners Disrupt The TGR Group, An International Illicit Finance Network That Enables Russian Elites To Circumvent U.S. And International Sanctions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, the Department of the Treasury&rsquo;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is sanctioning five individuals and four entities that are associated with or leverage the TGR Group, a sprawling international network of businesses and employees that have facilitated significant sanctions circumvention on behalf of Russian elites. This action also identifies a Wyoming-based entity that is owned 50 percent or more by a sanctioned individual. Today&rsquo;s action continues the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/11/joint-statement-by-the-g7-announcing-further-economic-costs-on-russia/">G7 commitment</a>&nbsp;to hold accountable parties that evade or offset the impact of international sanctions, including by using digital assets, and to impose costs on illicit actors that use digital assets to enhance and transfer their wealth.&nbsp;<a class="external">These designations are the result of a collaborative effort with the United Kingdom&rsquo;s (UK) National Crime Agency, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) government, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Through the TGR Group, Russian elites sought to exploit digital assets&mdash;in particular U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins&mdash;to evade U.S. and international sanctions, further enriching themselves and the Kremlin,&rdquo; said Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley T. Smith, &ldquo;The United States, alongside our allies and partners, remains committed to disrupting any effort by Russia to use digital assets or other illicit financial schemes to accrue, store, and transfer their ill-gotten gains."</p>
<h3>the tgr group: enabler of sanctions evasion for Russian ELITES</h3>
<p>With touchpoints around the world, the TGR Group is an extensive sanctions evasion and money laundering network that works to obfuscate the illicit activities of its clients, including through the use digital assets, such as stablecoins like Tether (USDT). Controlled by Ukrainian national George Rossi, the networkprovides a range of services to place, layer, and integrate illicit financial schemes into the global financial system. These include: the laundering of funds associated with sanctioned entities; providing an unregistered service to exchange cash and cryptocurrency; the receipt of cash and making the value available to clients in the form of cryptocurrency; providing a pre-paid credit card service; and, obfuscating the source of funds to allow high-net worth Russian nationals to purchase property in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>To support their illicit&nbsp;activities, the TGR Group has leveraged other illicit actors, such as the Smart Group, led by Russian money launderer Ekaterina Zhdanova (Zhdanova). On November&nbsp;3, 2023, OFAC&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1874">designated</a>&nbsp;Zhdanova,&nbsp;a Russian national, pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 14024, for operating or having operated in the financial services sector of the Russian Federation economy by laundering and moving funds using digital assets on behalf of Russian elites.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>key members of AN international money laundering network</h3>
<p><span>George Rossi</span>&nbsp;(Rossi), a Ukrainian national who was born in Russia, is believed to be in overall control of the TGR Group. Rossi is the founder of TGR Partners and is the non-executive director at TGR Corporate Concierge LTD, both entities that are also being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024. Rossi also controls a TGR Group-related company that leveraged OFAC-sanctioned Russian cryptocurrency exchange, Garantex OU, to process USDT transactions after its date of designation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Elena Chirkinyan</span>&nbsp;(Chirkinyan), a Russian national, is a direct subordinate to Rossi and is considered a decision maker within the TGR Group. Chirkinyan is also a partner at TGR Partners and the Chief Executive Officer of TGR Corporate Concierge LTD. Additionally, Chirkinyan is the manager of TGR DWC-LLC, an entity designated pursuant to E.O. 14024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2023, Chirkinyan was involved in obfuscating the transfer of funds out of Russia, most likely to support the activities of a UK-sanctioned Russian-language media organization in the United Kingdom. These funds originated from RT (formerly known as Russia Today). On September 13, 2024, the Department of State&nbsp;<a href="https://www.state.gov/alerting-the-world-to-rts-global-covert-activities/">designated</a>&nbsp;Autonomous Non Profit Organization TV-Novosti, a federally funded Russian organization that controls the RT media channel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Separately, Chirkinyan coordinated with Zhdanova (via her moniker @monalisa7) to obfuscate the source of Russian client funds to purchase real estate property in the United Kingdom. Chirkinyan and other TGR Group members also arranged cash handovers in which USDT was sent to a cryptocurrency address controlled by Zhdanova, and in return cash was received by the TGR Group.</p>
<p><span>Andrejs Bradens</span>&nbsp;(Bradens), a Latvian national, is associated with multiple TGR Group companies, including Pullman Global Solutions LLC (Pullman Global) and TGR Corporate Concierge LTD. Pullman Global is a Wyoming-based entity that is owned by Bradens.</p>
<p><span>TGR Partners</span>&nbsp;is a Moscow, Russia-based entity that provides financial services such as asset management, cryptocurrency trading, foreign exchange market payments, and concierge services. TGR Partners maintains locations in Russia, the UK, and other parts of Europe and Asia. Rossi is the founder of TGR Partners and Chirkinyan is a partner at TGR Partners.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>TGR Corporate Concierge LTD&nbsp;</span>is a UK-based entity that is owned and directed by Bradens.&nbsp; Chirkinyan is the Chief Executive Officer of TGR Corporate Concierge LTD.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>TGR DWC-LLC</span>&nbsp;is a UAE-based entity that is managed by Chirkinyan. TGR DWC-LLC provided&nbsp;concierge services that may enable clients to obfuscate their sources of wealth and purchase high-value property.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Siam Expert Trading Company Limited</span>&nbsp;(Siam Expert) is a Thailand-based entity. Siam Expert has facilitated the export of electronic components to Russia. Siam Expert is also associated with Bradens.</p>
<p><span>Pullman Global Solutions LLC&nbsp;</span>(<span>Pullman Global</span>)<span>&nbsp;is a Wyoming-based entity that is owned by Bradens.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>George Rossi, Elena Chirkinyan, Andrejs Bradens,&nbsp;</span>and&nbsp;TGR Partners are being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the financial services sector of the Russian Federation economy.</p>
<p>TGR Corporate Concierge LTD is being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being owned or controlled by, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Bradens, an individual whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TGR DWC-LLC is being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being owned or controlled by, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Elena Chirkinyan, an individual whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Siam Expert is being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the technology sector of the Russian Federation economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Pullman Global&nbsp;is being identified&nbsp;</span>for being owned in the aggregate, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more by Andrejs Bradens, whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>affiliates of Sanctioned ekaterina zhadanova</h3>
<p><span>Khadzi-Murat Dalgatovich Magomedov&nbsp;</span>(Magomedov), a Russian national, and Zhdanova regularly coordinated to facilitate bulk cash and cryptocurrency money laundering transactions internationally. Magomedov and Zhdanova also coordinated a bulk cash hand-over in the United Kingdom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On multiple occasions, Magomedov brokered money laundering transactions for which Zhdanova fulfilled and received a commission fee. To facilitate their activities, the pair arranged for international bulk cash deliveries and the conversion of bulk currency into cryptocurrency for clients. Zhdanova and Magomedov likely used TGR Corporate Concierge LTD to facilitate invoice payments, monetary transfers and/or cash for USDT transactions. Certain transactions were also likely facilitated by TGR Partners, located in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p><span>Nikita Vladimirovich Krasnov</span>, a Russian national, worked closely with Zhdanova as a key money laundering partner. As part of their scheme, Krasnov would arrange for intermediaries to deliver and convert bulk cash into cryptocurrency which would be deposited into cryptocurrency wallets in Zhdanova&rsquo;s name. Among other laundering methods, Krasnov and Zhdanova used a luxury watch company to facilitate trade-based money laundering. Krasnov is associated with the alias &ldquo;acescom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Khadzi-Murat Dalgatovich Magomedov and Nikita Vladimirovich Krasnov are being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, Ekaterina Zhdanova, an individual whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024.</p>
<h3>SANCTIONS IMPLICATIONS</h3>
<p>As a result of today&rsquo;s action, all property and interests in property of the blocked persons described above that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC. In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. Unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt, OFAC&rsquo;s regulations generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons. U.S. persons must comply with OFAC regulations, including all U.S. citizens and permanent resident aliens regardless of where they are located, all persons within the United States, and all U.S.- incorporated entities and their foreign branches. Non-U.S. persons are also subject to certain OFAC prohibitions. For example, non-U.S. persons are prohibited from causing or conspiring to cause U.S. persons to wittingly or unwittingly violate U.S. sanctions, as well as engaging in conduct that evades U.S. sanctions.</p>
<p>U.S. persons may face civil or criminal penalties for violations of E.O. 14024.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-31/subtitle-B/chapter-V/part-501/appendix-Appendix%20A%20to%20Part%20501">OFAC&rsquo;s&nbsp;Economic Sanctions Enforcement Guidelines&nbsp;</a>provide more information regarding OFAC&rsquo;s enforcement of U.S. sanctions, including the factors that OFAC generally considers when determining an appropriate response to an apparent violation.</p>
<p>In addition, financial institutions and other persons that engage in certain transactions or activities with the sanctioned entities and individuals may expose themselves to sanctions or be subject to an enforcement action. The prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any designated person, or the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC&rsquo;s ability to designate and add persons to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) List, but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law. The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior. For information concerning the process for seeking removal from an OFAC list, including the SDN List, please refer to&nbsp;<a href="https://ofac.treasury.gov/faqs/897">OFAC&rsquo;s Frequently Asked Question 897 here</a>. For detailed information on the process to submit a request for&nbsp;<a href="https://ofac.treasury.gov/specially-designated-nationals-list-sdn-list/filing-a-petition-for-removal-from-an-ofac-list">removal from an OFAC sanctions list, please click here</a>.</p>

<p>The global economy is projected to remain resilient despite significant challenges, according to the OECD&rsquo;s latest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/oecd-economic-outlook-volume-2024-issue-2_d8814e8b-en.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Economic Outlook"><span><i>Economic Outlook</i></span></a>. The Outlook projects global GDP growth of 3.3% in 2025, up from 3.2% in 2024, and 3.3% in 2026.</p>
<p>Inflation in the OECD is expected to ease further, from 5.4% in 2024 to 3.8% in 2025 and 3.0% in 2026, supported by the still restrictive stance of monetary policy in most countries. Headline inflation has already returned to central bank targets in nearly half of the advanced economies and close to 60% of emerging market economies.</p>

<p><b>Chris Concannon, CEO of MarketAxess, commented:</b></p>
<p>&ldquo;We delivered total ADV of $45 billion in November, an increase of 56% from the prior year, driven by a rebound in U.S. Treasury ADV. In credit, record emerging markets ADV, which increased 15%, and record municipal bond ADV helped offset lower U.S. high-yield activity driven by lower credit spread volatility. We recently launched our block trading solution, and we are experiencing positive client engagement in the emerging markets hard currency market. 21 dealers and 26 long-only clients were active with the average trade size executed over $4 million notional. We have also enhanced our portfolio trading functionality to include benchmark trading and a record 76% of portfolio trading volume was executed on X-Pro. We believe both of these initiatives are critical to growing our market share in U.S. credit in the coming quarters.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>General Notes Regarding the Data Presented</b></p>
<p>Reported MarketAxess volume in all product categories includes only fully electronic trading volume. MarketAxess trading volumes and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&ldquo;FINRA&rdquo;) Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (&ldquo;TRACE&rdquo;) reported volumes are available on the Company&rsquo;s website at&nbsp;<a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.marketaxess.com%2Fvolume&amp;esheet=54161563&amp;newsitemid=20241203025005&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=investor.marketaxess.com%2Fvolume&amp;index=1&amp;md5=16c19fccae684034553a2c961f3ef7e7" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">investor.marketaxess.com/volume</a>.</p>
<p>For periods beginning with January 2024, the Company has made changes to the market volume data used to calculate estimated market share for Municipal and U.S. Government Bonds. For Municipal Bonds, the Company previously used estimates, derived from data issued by the Municipal Securities Rule Making Board (&ldquo;MSRB&rdquo;), including estimates for new issuance, commercial paper and variable-rate trading activity, and excluded these volumes from the estimated market volume data. While the Company still uses estimates, the new methodology for identifying and excluding these volumes from the market volume data is now based on MSRB &ldquo;flags&rdquo; to identify new issuance, commercial paper, and variable-rate volumes. For U.S. Government Bonds, the previous data source for estimated market volumes was the Federal Reserve Bank&rsquo;s Reported Primary Dealer U.S. Treasury Bond Trading Volumes, which was reported on a one-week lag. The new source for U.S. Government Bond trading volumes is FINRA&rsquo;s U.S. Treasury TRACE data. The Company believes that the refined methodology used for Municipal Bonds, and the new data source for U.S. Government Bonds, provides more accurate measures of estimated market volumes and estimated market share. Prior comparable periods have been recast retrospectively for both Municipal and U.S. Government Bonds to conform to the updated presentation of the data. The new estimated market volume data is also available on the Company&rsquo;s website at&nbsp;<a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.marketaxess.com%2Fvolume&amp;esheet=54161563&amp;newsitemid=20241203025005&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=investor.marketaxess.com%2Fvolume&amp;index=2&amp;md5=15b5e3ab7fb18e522fb137e8a4c5bfa7" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">investor.marketaxess.com/volume</a>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><b><span>KEY POINTS</span></b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>SET launches standardized CISA testing centers in partnership with alliance universities in Thailand&rsquo;s northern, northeastern and southern regions.</b></li>
<li><b>The initiative jumpstarts investment analysis careers for university students and aspiring talents amid growing regional investor base.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>SET Senior Executive Vice President Soraphol Tulayasathien highlighted that regional economic growth has spurred investor base expansion in provincial areas, driving demand for financial and investment analysis professionals. Responding to this growth, SET has formed strategic partnerships with Khon Kaen University, Chiang Mai University, and Prince of Songkla University to establish regional testing centers for the Certified Investment and Securities Analyst (CISA) program. This pioneering initiative aims to broaden career pathway for university students and aspiring analysts across the regions by making certification examination more accessible and traveling cost reduction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;SET and its partners have built a legacy of capital market talent development since 2005, producing more than 2,600 CISA professionals who are instrumental in meeting the sophisticated demands of an expanding investor base through segment-tailored investment solutions offered by the stock exchange. In this dynamic environment, talented professionals stand as the driving force behind the sustainable growth of Thailand&rsquo;s capital market and economy,&rdquo; said Soraphol.</p>
<p>The CISA program sets the professional standard for capital market professional careers through its two-tier structure of Foundation Knowledge level (AISA certificate) and Advanced Knowledge level (CISA certificate) &mdash; credentials that constitute SEC-recognized qualifications for investment analyst and fund manager license applications. CISA examinations are conducted at designated testing centers, all operating under standardized protocols established by SET.

<title>Decision By The Nasdaq Stockholm Disciplinary Committee Regarding Flexion Mobile Plc</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/decision-by-the-nasdaq-stockholm-disciplinary-committee-regarding-flexion-mobile/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/decision-by-the-nasdaq-stockholm-disciplinary-committee-regarding-flexion-mobile/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Disciplinary Committee of Nasdaq Stockholm (the &ldquo;Exchange&rdquo;) has found that Flexion Mobile Plc (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) has breached the rules of Nasdaq First North Growth Market (the &ldquo;Rulebook&rdquo;) and therefore ordered the Company to pay a fine of seven annual fees, corresponding to an amount of SEK 2,143,071.</p>
<p>The Disciplinary Committee notes that it is undisputed that the Company has violated the Rulebook on three occasions, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Company did not disclose its annual financial report for 2022 on time.</li>
<li>The Company did not disclose its annual financial report for 2023 on time.</li>
<li>The Company did not properly disclose insider information when its update for the fourth quarter of 2023 and results video presentation were published prematurely.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Disciplinary Committee considers the violations to be serious and of a nature that would normally lead to delisting. The Disciplinary Committee notes that it is undisputed that the violations were at least partly due to reasons beyond the Company's control. According to the Committee, the circumstances are not such that they absolve the Company from responsibility, but they justify that the penalty is instead determined to be a fine. In view of the fact that the Company, despite warnings from the Exchange, has committed repeated violations of the Regulations, two of which are of a similar nature, and the significant delay regarding the publication of the Company's annual financial report for 2022, the Disciplinary Committee sets the fine at seven annual fees.</p>
<p>The Disciplinary Committee&rsquo;s decision is available at:</p>

<title>FSB Plenary Meets In Hong Kong</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fsb-plenary-meets-in-hong-kong/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fsb-plenary-meets-in-hong-kong/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) Plenary met yesterday and today in Hong Kong. Members discussed the outlook for global financial stability, including issues of particular relevance to emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs). The Plenary also reviewed policy work in several areas, including climate-related financial risks, crypto-assets and global stablecoins, cross-border payments, and non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI).</p>
<p>Members also agreed on the FSB&rsquo;s work programme for 2025, confirmed the extension of Klaas Knot&rsquo;s term as FSB Chair until 1 July 2025, and discussed the process for selection of a new FSB Chair.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><span>Financial stability outlook</span></h4>
<p>Long-standing vulnerabilities in the financial system remain. The global economy and financial system continue to be affected by economic and financial conditions, policy uncertainty, and geopolitical tensions. Globally, asset valuations remain elevated, while the heightened market volatility in early August suggests they are susceptible to further shocks.</p>
<p>Members discussed a number of issues, including the combination of high private and public debt and large bank holdings of domestic government bonds in some jurisdictions, which may lead to greater transmission of shocks between sovereigns and banks. Changing investor expectations about interest rates or geopolitical tensions could also spark market and capital flow volatility. Members also discussed recent developments in crypto-asset markets and global stablecoins, and the FSB&rsquo;s work in this area.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><span>Climate-related financial risks</span></h4>
<p>The FSB supports international coordination of work to address financial risks from climate change through its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2021/07/fsb-roadmap-for-addressing-climate-related-financial-risks/">Roadmap for Addressing Climate-related Financial Risks</a>. The Plenary discussed progress in the four areas of the Roadmap as well as EMDE-specific climate vulnerabilities and ways to help address those vulnerabilities. Members stressed the importance of continued external engagement and coordination with international bodies on climate-related financial risks. The FSB will issue its next report on progress with the Roadmap in mid-2025.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><span>Cross-border payments</span></h4>
<p>In October 2022, the FSB published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2022/10/g20-roadmap-for-enhancing-cross-border-payments-priorities-for-the-next-phase-of-work/">prioritisation plan</a>&nbsp;and engagement model for taking the G20 Roadmap for Enhancing Cross-Border Payments forward.&nbsp;It followed up, in 2023, by setting out priority actions for achieving the G20 goals for cheaper, faster, more transparent, and more accessible cross-border payments. While more than half of the priority actions have been completed, the FSB&rsquo;s latest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/10/annual-progress-report-on-meeting-the-targets-for-cross-border-payments-2024-report-on-key-performance-indicators/">Key Performance Indicators report</a>&nbsp;suggests that the work done so far is not yet sufficient and that further efforts are needed to improve the user experience across all payments market segments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Plenary discussed ongoing legal, regulatory, and supervisory challenges and measures to address them, including the finalisation of the FSB&rsquo;s recommendations to promote greater alignment and interoperability in data frameworks that apply to cross-border payments, and recommendations to strengthen the consistency in the regulation and supervision of banks and non-banks in their provision of cross-border payments services. The group discussed measures to promote their implementation, within and beyond the G20.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><span>Non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI)</span></h4>
<p>The FSB is continuing its substantial&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/07/enhancing-the-resilience-of-non-bank-financial-intermediation-progress-report-4/">work programme to enhance the resilience of NBFI</a>. As part of this, the FSB will shortly publish its final policy recommendations on measures to enhance liquidity preparedness of non-bank market participants for margin and collateral calls and will be launching a consultation on proposed policy recommendations to monitor and address financial stability risks from NBFI leverage. Data issues are hampering efforts to further improve the ability of authorities to effectively assess vulnerabilities stemming from the non-bank sector and to calibrate appropriate policies. The Plenary agreed to steps for how to overcome these challenges.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><span>Implementation of resolution reforms</span></h4>
<p>Members discussed progress in addressing the lessons learnt for resolution from the 2023 banking turmoil and key resolution work priorities for 2025. The Plenary agreed on the list of insurers subject to the resolution planning standards of the FSB&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/work-of-the-fsb/market-and-institutional-resilience/post-2008-financial-crisis-reforms/effective-resolution-regimes-and-policies/key-attributes-of-effective-resolution-regimes-for-financial-institutions/">Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions</a>.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><span>FSB work programme</span></h4>
<p>The Plenary discussed the FSB&rsquo;s work programme for 2025, including deliverables to South Africa&rsquo;s G20 Presidency. In addition to advancing work on NBFI, crypto-assets and global stablecoins, artificial intelligence, cyber and operational resilience, cross-border payments, climate-related financial risks, and resolution, members stressed the importance of policy implementation and the role the FSB could take in promoting this. The finalised work programme will be published in early 2025.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h2>
<p>The FSB Chair is selected from representatives on the Plenary and appointed by the Plenary for a term of three years renewable once.

<title>ASIC Signals Ongoing Work To Maximise Benefits Of The Reportable Situations Regime</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-signals-ongoing-work-to-maximise-benefits-of-the-reportable-situations-regi/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-signals-ongoing-work-to-maximise-benefits-of-the-reportable-situations-regi/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The reportable situations regime is a key component of the financial services and credit regulatory frameworks. ASIC expects all licensees, regardless of size, to have robust systems and processes in place to ensure timely detection and reporting of non-compliance.</p>
<p>These expectations were highlighted in recent legal proceedings filed by ASIC against United Super Pty Ltd (United Super), the trustee of Cbus, for systemic claims handling failures and for failing to lodge a reportable situation within the required 30 days (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-251mr-asic-sues-cbus-alleging-systemic-claims-handling-failures/" title="24-251MR ASIC sues Cbus alleging systemic claims handling failures">24-251MR</a>).</p>
<p>ASIC Commissioner Kate O&rsquo;Rourke said compliance with the reportable situations regime, which requires licensees to promptly identify, fix and report their own problems, can help lift industry standards and in turn improve consumer outcomes.&nbsp;At the same time, the reports submitted help ASIC to detect emerging issues and non-compliant behaviour early and take action where appropriate.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have undertaken extensive work to strengthen the operation of the reportable situations regime since the introduction of the October 2021 reforms, and ensuring that the objectives of the regime are met remains a priority area of work for us in 2024-25,&rsquo; Commissioner O&rsquo;Rourke said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As part of this, we will consult with stakeholders on options for future granular reporting to provide even deeper insights, ahead of our fourth annual publication of reportable situations data in Q3 2025.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In addition, we will do further work next year to consider how best to ensure ASIC receives the reports that have the most intelligence value to us, while managing the burden on industry from reporting. We will also undertake a range of work on a sector-by-sector basis to monitor and uplift compliance with the regime, and consider enforcement action where necessary.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As part of its efforts to further uplift compliance with the regime, ASIC has today published insights, key questions and a set of best practice examples for licensees to reflect on and inform changes to better meet their obligations under the regime.</p>
<p>&lsquo;These insights are informed by a recent review of licensees who had not lodged a reportable situation, or who had lodged very few,&rsquo; Ms O&rsquo;Rourke said.</p>
<p>The review found areas for improvement in how licensees identified incidents and breaches, and in their broader incident management and compliance and oversight arrangements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have set out a range of prompts alongside our findings to help not just the review sample, but all licensees to strengthen their practices in critical areas,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We call on licensees to assess their own arrangements against the findings and prioritise where improvements may be required.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>ASIC is obliged to report annually on information that is provided under the reportable situations regime, which it did on 31 October 2024, for the third year.</p>
<p>The reports published since the commencement of the regime have not named licensees nor refer to the nature or number of reports lodged by specific licensees. ASIC will be consulting with stakeholders in 2025 about potential changes to this approach for future publications.</p>
<p>Since reforms to the reportable situations regime were introduced in 2021:</p>
<ul>
<li>ASIC updated Regulatory Guide 78&nbsp;<em>Breach reporting by AFS licensees and credit licensees</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/regulatory-guides/rg-78-breach-reporting-by-afs-licensees-and-credit-licensees/" title="RG 78 Breach reporting by AFS licensees and credit licensees">RG 78</a>) in April 2023 to improve the operation of the regime, including for example, clarifying when licensees can group reports.</li>
<li>ASIC announced relief in October 2023 (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/news-items/asic-extends-reportable-situations-relief-and-personal-advice-record-keeping-requirements/" title="ASIC extends reportable situations relief and personal advice record keeping requirements">extended in September 2024</a>) to manage the reporting burden on licensees. Together with updated guidance, the relief contributed to a 27% reduction in year-on-year reporting volumes.</li>
<li>ASIC introduced a machine-to-machine interface for high-volume reporters to lodge their reports more efficiently with ASIC.</li>

<title>ASIC Invites Feedback On Proposed Updates To Digital Asset Guidance</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-invites-feedback-on-proposed-updates-to-digital-asset-guidance/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-invites-feedback-on-proposed-updates-to-digital-asset-guidance/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC today released Consultation paper 381&nbsp;<em>Updates to INFO 225: Digital Assets: Financial Products and Services</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/consultations/cp-381-updates-to-info-225-digital-assets-financial-products-and-services/" title="CP 381 Updates to INFO 225: Digital assets: Financial products and services">CP 381</a>) outlining proposals to update Information Sheet 225<em>&nbsp;Crypto Assets&nbsp;</em>(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/digital-transformation/crypto-assets/" title="Crypto-assets">INFO 225</a>).</p>
<p>To provide greater clarity about the current law, ASIC has proposed a range of updates to INFO 225, including adding 13 practical examples of how the current financial product definitions apply to digital assets and related products.</p>
<p>ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland said, &lsquo;We want to promote the growth of responsible financial innovation while ensuring consumer protection. A well-regulated financial system benefits everyone in the community as it supports consumer confidence, market integrity and facilitates competition and innovation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Australia&rsquo;s financial services regulatory regime is broad and technology neutral. Many digital assets and related products are financial products under the current law. Stakeholders have been calling for greater clarity and in response, we are releasing our draft updated guidance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We encourage all stakeholders to engage with the consultation process. We recognise that industry will need some time to consider and act on our updated guidance, so we are also consulting on a proposed transitional approach.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Generally, ASIC&rsquo;s existing approach to financial services licences will apply to digital assets. For example, whether an applicant is proposing to deal in traditional securities or securities based on a digital asset platform, the same licensing regime applies.</p>
<p>CP 381 seeks feedback on:</p>
<ul>
<li>ASIC&rsquo;s updated guidance in INFO 225, including the worked examples,</li>
<li>the application of the existing Australian Financial Services (AFS) licence processes, ASIC guidance and standard conditions to digital asset businesses,</li>
<li>practical licensing issues for wrapped tokens and &lsquo;stablecoins&rsquo;, issues arising from the potential transition to the Government&rsquo;s proposed digital asset platform and payment stablecoins regimes, and consideration of potential regulatory relief, and</li>
<li>a potential class &lsquo;no action&rsquo; position for digital asset businesses that are in the process of applying for or varying an AFS licence, Australian Markets Licence or Clearing and Settlement Facility licence.</li>
</ul>
<p>ASIC seeks the feedback on the proposed updated INFO 225 and the issues raised in CP 381 by 5pm on 28 February 2025. Details on responding can be found in the consultation paper.</p>
<p>ASIC intends to publish a final version of the updated INFO 225 in mid-2025, after considering feedback received through the consultation process.</p>
<p>ASIC will continue to use its full range of regulatory and enforcement tools, such as guidance, licensing, compliance and enforcement action, to protect consumers and uphold market integrity in the digital asset sector.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>CP 381 consultation package is aimed at all firms involved in digital assets, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>existing financial services and financial markets businesses, including those exploring the application of blockchain technology to existing financial products and real-world assets (e.g. tokenisation),</li>
<li>new digital asset businesses,</li>
<li>brokers and intermediaries,</li>
<li>professional advisers to the above businesses.</li>
</ul>
<p>ASIC first published INFO 225 in September 2017, with updates made in 2018, 2019 and 2021.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s position continues to be that many digital assets are financial products under the current law.</p>
<p>CP 381 is aligned to and supportive of the Government&rsquo;s broader work in relation to the proposed payment services reform and digital asset facility reforms.</p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority Encouraged By First Climate Statements</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-encouraged-by-first-climate-statements/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-encouraged-by-first-climate-statements/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; has today published its Climate-Related Disclosures insights report from the first set of entities that were required to file climate statements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA reviewed 70 climate statements that were prepared by climate reporting entities (CREs) for reporting periods ended between December 2023 and March 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA&rsquo;s review looked at compliance with the disclosure requirements in the External Reporting Board&rsquo;s Aotearoa New Zealand Climate Standards and the legislative requirements under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013. The purpose of the report is to provide timely and useful feedback for climate reporting entities to improve disclosure in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FMA Head of Audit, Financial Reporting and Climate Related Disclosures, Jacco Moison said: &ldquo;We are pleased with the efforts that CREs have made to prepare and lodge their first set of mandatory climate statements under the CRD regime. Climate reporting entities have put in an enormous effort to ensure their first mandatory climate statements were prepared on time. We acknowledge that some have faced challenges, including obtaining reliable data, incurring higher-than expected costs and deciding how to make disclosures in the absence of guidance on certain topics.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below is a sample of the key insights from the report. See the full report for more details.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Information disclosed&nbsp;</p>
<p>CREs need to strike the right balance on the amount of information disclosed. Disclosing too much may risk obscuring material information for primary users, while disclosing too little may result in material information being omitted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA found instances where climate statements included substantial detail about certain processes or included information that may not have been relevant or specific to the CRE itself. It also observed climate statements that may have omitted disclosures required by Climate Standards. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA has recommended CREs carefully consider both their own facts and circumstances, as well as the nature and characteristics of their primary users, to ensure they only disclose material information in relation to each disclosure required by the Climate Standards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fairly present disclosures&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Climate Standards require that climate statements are presented fairly. The FMA found that some entities presented information that may have over emphasised positive news or impacts at the expense of a balanced representation. Some disclosed information that was difficult to understand or incomplete.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Explain the how&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disclosures across the governance, risk management and strategy thematic areas require CREs to explain how processes are undertaken. Others require disclosure of how these processes or matters are embedded across an organization. In some instances, the FMA observed entities simply disclosing that a process takes place or that it is connected to other part of their business without providing any explanation about what is involved in that process or the nature and extent of the connection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next steps&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA intends to continue its educative and constructive approach to the monitoring of climate statements. Two webinars will be held with the sector this month as well as further engagements in the new year to discuss the report&rsquo;s findings. &nbsp;</p>

<title>US Federal Bank Regulatory Agencies Seek Further Comment On Interagency Effort To Reduce Regulatory Burden</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The federal bank regulatory agencies today announced their third notice requesting comment to reduce regulatory burden. The Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996 requires the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council and federal bank regulatory agencies to review their regulations at least once every 10 years to identify outdated or otherwise unnecessary regulatory requirements for their supervised institutions.</p>
<p>To facilitate this review, the agencies divided their regulations into 12 categories and are now soliciting comments on their regulations for three categories: Rules of Procedure, Safety and Soundness, and Securities. The public has 90 days from publication in the&nbsp;<em>Federal Register&nbsp;</em>to comment on the relevant regulations.</p>
<p>The agencies will request comment on regulations in the remaining categories in 2025, asking the public to identify the regulations they believe are outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome.</p>
<p>The agencies will hold a series of outreach meetings where interested parties may comment on applicable regulatory requirements directly to the agencies. Information about the outreach meetings will be publicized as details are finalized.</p>

<p>The ITS on investment firms reporting and disclosures foresee that investment firms could opt to report the same information &ndash; as set out in the COREP templates &ndash; as credit institutions. Formally, the alignment with the reporting by credit institutions was achieved by adding cross-references to the applicable&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/activities/single-rulebook/regulatory-activities/supervisory-reporting/implementing-technical-standards-supervisory-reporting-changes-related-crr3crd6-step-1">ITS on Supervisory reporting by credit institutions</a>. Following the amendments introduced in the CRR3, it was necessary to update the references included in the ITS for reporting of investment firms.</p>
<h4>Next steps</h4>
<p>In December 2024, the EBA will publish a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/risk-and-data-analysis/reporting-frameworks/reporting-framework-40">technical package</a>, which includes the data point modelling (DPM), validation rules and taxonomy, that shall be used by investment firms to submit this supervisory reporting information to supervisors.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<p>The EBA has developed these draft ITS according to Article 54(3) and Article 49(2) of&nbsp; the IFR - (EU) 2019/2033 - &nbsp;which mandate the EBA to develop a reporting framework and a disclosure requirements for investment firms.</p>
<p>The Investment Firms Prudential Package consists of the Directive (EU) 2019/2034 and the Regulation (EU) 2019/2033, which were published in the Official Journal on 5 December 2019 and establish a new prudential framework for investment firms authorised under MIFID.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Jason, and thank you for the opportunity to speak here in Detroit today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20241203a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;This visit has allowed me to see the many encouraging signs in this region: growth here in downtown; the area's famously hard-working labor force; and the gritty Detroit Lions, with 11 wins this season and counting. The nation has taken notice. But, truly, one of my favorite parts of serving as a Governor on the Federal Reserve Board is visiting communities across the country and hearing directly from the families, workers, and businesses we serve.</p>
<p>I am also glad to have the chance to speak with you near the end of the year. I think it is an appropriate time to look back and assess how the U.S. economy has developed over the course of 2024. I will also share with you my outlook and offer my views on U.S. monetary policy.</p>
<p>I will start by saying that I view the economy as being in a good position after making significant progress in recent years toward our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. The labor market remains solid, and inflation appears to be on a sustainable path to our 2 percent goal, even if there have been some bumps along the way, as I will discuss later.</p>
<p>Reaching this point for the economy was far from assured, especially if you reflect on the pandemic disruptions of nearly five years ago. Even the more recent performance of the economy, at least on the surface, has been surprising to many forecasters. Economic growth remained solid, while inflation moderated from its recent peak without the painful job losses that have often accompanied past efforts to counter high inflation.</p>
<p>Heading into this year, that was not necessarily the forecast of many observers, who were expecting a notable deceleration of economic activity. For example, the Blue Chip Economic Indicators in December 2023 expected 1.3 percent GDP growth for all of 2024. More recent estimates show the economy is on track to grow at almost twice that rate this year.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20241203a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a></p>
<p>So how does one interpret these positive, if somewhat unexpected, results? For me, I turned to looking at not just the realities around me and listening to people around the country, but also to my background as an academic researcher who uses an evidence-based approach to recognize two very important developments that have shaped the economy this year: growth in the labor force stemming from an increase in immigration, and a surge in productivity. I have been closely monitoring these developments and discussing them for more than a year.</p>
<p><strong>Assessing the Economy Entering 2024</strong><br />Entering this year, I took notice of several peculiar puzzles that seemed to be playing out in the economy. In terms of overall growth, I noticed a significant divergence between two important measures of output: gross domestic product, or GDP, and gross domestic income, or GDI. While, over time, these two gauges should move together, they appeared to be out of sync heading into this year. The GDI data suggested rather anemic growth, averaging about 1 percent a quarter in 2023, contrary to very strong GDP readings of more than 2.5 percent. The two measures of output had contrasting implications for productivity growth.</p>
<p>There was a second puzzle in the labor market. Many forecasters expected that the labor market would remain somewhat tight this year, as rebalancing in the labor market had already attracted a large fraction of the available working-age population: The labor force participation of prime-age workers had reached levels not seen since the late 1990s. However, upon closer examination, I saw a more mixed picture.</p>
<p>On the one hand, payroll gains, while slowing, were still averaging a very robust pace of more than 200,000 jobs per month. Data from that time suggest that workers were easily able to find jobs, and measures of layoffs were low by historical standards. In fact, in certain industries, such as health care as well as leisure and hospitality, employment had not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels. That raised questions about whether the supply of workers for those fields could keep pace with demand.</p>
<p>But, on the other hand, the unemployment rate was flat instead of declining. This was puzzling considering a robust pace of payroll gains and the assumption that labor supply was constrained. And the two most important labor market surveys sent somewhat divergent signals. The payroll survey of employers showed hiring was abnormally above the gain recorded by the survey of households. Was the economy expanding at a robust pace, as indicated by the payroll survey? Or was it slowing more, as suggested by the household survey?</p>
<p>In considering these questions, I interpreted the strong pace of payrolls from the establishment survey and the cooling of various measures of resource utilization as a signal that perhaps the official population estimates were understated to the downside. Starting at the end of 2023, I asked, what if substantial increases in the labor force due to the arrival of workers from other countries had not yet been picked up in Census estimates?</p>
<p>We had seen something similar before. In the late 1990s, official measures of the population were substantially revised up due to mismeasured immigration. During this period, establishment and household counts of workers also significantly diverged.</p>
<p>And a third puzzle, with inflation, also warrants attention. Inflation had steadily progressed toward the FOMC's target during 2023, perhaps faster than some economists expected. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index eased from a peak of 7.2 percent in June 2022 to about 3 percent at the end of 2023, measured on a 12-month basis. When excluding volatile food and energy prices, core inflation similarly eased from a peak of 5.6 percent in February 2022 to 3 percent at the end of last year. Wage growth measures were consistent with inflation declining.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Developments This Year</strong><br />At the turn of the new year, new data and other economic developments appeared to cloud the picture further. An uptick in consumer spending and overall economic activity in the fourth quarter of 2023 as well as a stretch of above-trend hiring gave a signal of unexpected strength to start the year. Adding to the puzzling figures, core inflation rose 0.5 percent in January, a notable acceleration from an average monthly increase of 0.15 percent in the previous quarter. Stronger-than-expected economic activity, faster hiring, and a reacceleration of prices gave some economists pause: Was this a temporary acceleration, or a more sustained reheating of the economy? I viewed it as likely temporary, as it turned out to be.</p>
<p>My view has always been that progress in the fight against inflation has to be judged from trends, not from a data release or two. I also anticipated that the process of bringing down inflation was likely to be sometimes bumpy. However, I viewed the elevated inflation readings as partly stemming from seasonal and one-off factors not fully accounted for in the data. In addition, price changes in some categories are difficult to measure, as I have described in previous speeches.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20241203a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;That is particularly true for certain services categories for which direct sources of prices are not available; for example, the cost of living in an owner-occupied home or costs associated with certain financial transactions. And, as I have also discussed, the slow adjustment in workers' wages and relative prices may have contributed to bumps on the road to disinflation. Indeed, by the second quarter of the year, it became clear that the earlier firmer inflation figures were indeed temporary. Inflation stepped back down to average monthly increases of less than 0.2 percent. A factor in that was a cooling labor market, which I will discuss in a moment. With the labor market less tight, wage growth leveled off, and that in turn allowed prices for labor-intensive services to moderate.</p>
<p>There was another important development early this year: Estimates of population growth were revised substantially higher, according to a Congressional Budget Office report.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20241203a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;The report showed about 6 million additional immigrants than were included in official estimates. Those workers added to the supply of labor, which had rebounded early in the pandemic recovery at a time when the unemployment rate was trending near half-century lows.</p>
<p>That information was consistent with my hypothesis that the strength in the economy was in part due to a larger-than-estimated labor force, or what economists call a positive supply shock. You may be more familiar with negative shocks, like the pandemic causing constrained supply chains. But the increase of workers was a positive shock and is notable because the underlying demographics of the U.S. heading into the pandemic were consistent with a slow-growing population and lower labor force participation, and that dynamic got worse as the pandemic generated excess retirements and a fall in immigration.</p>
<p>In terms of the labor market, I anticipated that after several months of strong job growth at the turn of the year, the labor market would cool significantly. And, indeed, by the middle of this year, the process of the labor market normalizing was taking shape. Payroll gains declined from an average pace of 260,000 in the first quarter to less than 200,000 in the second. Reports on the labor market included unusually large downward revisions to previous gains, and the unemployment rate moved higher, from 3.7 percent in January to 4.1 percent in June. At this point, other economists quickly shifted from worrying about a labor market that might be too hot early in the year to one that might be cooling too quickly. As a Fed policymaker, I had to consider if this movement was consistent with our mandate for maximum employment.</p>
<p>Even with the easing in the labor market, consumer spending and overall economic activity continued to show solid growth. The combination of strong spending data and a cooling labor market was confounding. In thinking about this, I examined the productivity data that I follow closely and did not see the type of productivity growth I would have expected based on several other observations of the economy.</p>
<p>For example, new business formation had surged in the post-pandemic period. It has been shown that newer firms foster innovation and boost productivity growth. Business formation has remained elevated, from which I infer that the boost to productivity growth is not just a one-time phenomenon. Also, in the post-pandemic period, workers switched jobs at much higher rates than typical. This likely led to better matches where workers can find more productive uses of their skills. In some cases, immigrants filled job openings for which employers traditionally struggle to attract workers. Therefore, immigration can also contribute to improvements in job matches in specific but key sectors. As the economy reopened from the pandemic, many firms also invested in technology to substitute for workers, who were in short supply, which should support productivity gains. Emerging technologies, most notably artificial intelligence, may also be starting to contribute to enhanced productivity.</p>
<p>Therefore, my speculation was that higher productivity was a possible explanation for the unusual combination of strong economic output, a cooling labor market, and declining inflation&mdash;even if it was not apparent in the quarterly data.</p>
<p>That hunch was confirmed in September, when annual revisions to important economic data showed that economic activity and productivity growth had been stronger than previously estimated. The new figures indicated an average annual rate of productivity growth of 1.9 percent since 2020, notably higher than the approximate 1.4 percent annual rate in the five years before the pandemic. So that reveals our second positive shock: American workers have been more productive in recent years. This is a hugely important development because it increases the productive capacity of the economy and allows more rapid economic growth without overheating. What's more, revisions resulted in much better aligned GDP and GDI measures, and the two measures now also had much more aligned implications for productivity.</p>
<p>In summary, the surprising and largely desirable outcomes for the economy in 2024 are easier to understand once we solve the puzzles I discussed. My thorough assessment of a wide range of data sources revealed that an unusual combination of reports over the past year were gradually resolved once we understood the two positive supply shocks I discussed: growth in the labor force due to an increase in immigration, and higher productivity growth.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Outlook</strong><br />The data we have received in recent weeks have been consistent with the economic forces I described earlier. Real GDP increased at a 2.8 percent annual rate in the third quarter. The latest readings of retail sales have been strong. If household demand remains resilient, that would support growth in the fourth quarter and into next year.</p>
<p>Monthly payroll gains have eased from earlier in the year, consistent with a gradual cooling of the labor market. It was difficult to draw a clear signal from the most recent jobs report, due to significant effects from hurricanes and labor strikes. I look forward to reviewing additional labor data on Friday. The unemployment rate, at 4.1 percent in October, is near the level I judge as roughly consistent with our maximum-employment mandate. After rising earlier this year, the rate has stabilized, though this was partly due to some withdrawals from the labor force. That bears watching moving forward.</p>
<p>The trend in immigration slowed in the second half of this year, and there is reason to expect immigration flows could further slow. I will closely monitor this data.</p>
<p>Inflation readings released last week show that overall PCE prices rose 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in October, and core PCE prices increased 2.8 percent. I still view those readings, as of now, as consistent with inflation on a path to return to our 2 percent goal, and I am encouraged that inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored. But they also show the job is not yet done. Housing services inflation, in particular, remains elevated. And while global inputs to inflation have been mostly modest in recent months, it is difficult to predict future pressures.</p>
<p>I have observed that the trade policy uncertainty index has risen in recent months, likely reflecting risks of changes in trade policy.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20241203a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;Of course, the incoming Administration and Congress have not enacted any policies yet, so it is too early to make judgements. Studying the specifics, when they come out, will be important, as trade policy may affect productivity and prices. I will make assessments about what the net effects of any policy changes will be on prices or employment and how the balance between the two legs of our mandate will be affected.</p>
<p><strong>Outlook for Monetary Policy</strong><br />Given how the economy has developed this year, most notably the continuation of disinflation and a modest cooling in the labor market, I see the Fed's dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability as being roughly in balance. In light of the progress toward our goals, my colleagues and I on the FOMC judged it appropriate to lower our policy rate in September and again last month. These actions were steps toward removing restraint, as we are in the process of moving policy toward a more neutral setting.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, it is important to emphasize that policy is not on a preset course. I will make decisions meeting by meeting and carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. While I have gained more confidence that the two positive supply shocks I described have helped create the solid economic conditions that are currently in place, I will vigilantly monitor for incoming risks or negative supply shocks that may undo the progress that we have achieved in reducing inflation. I view our current policy setting as well positioned to deal with any uncertainties we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time, and I look forward to your questions.</p>

<title>Bank Of England: Once More Unto The Breach - Speech By Philippe Lintern, Given At FX Markets Europe</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="hero-paragraph"><span class="hero">
<p>In this speech, Philippe Lintern reflects on the lessons learnt from the history of the FX market. He discusses the upcoming review of the FX Global Code and the importance for market-wide adoption of the updated Code. He also highlights the need for action to mitigate FX settlement risk.</p>

<h2>Speech</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>&lsquo;Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;<br />Or close the wall up with our English dead!<br />In peace there's nothing so becomes a man,<br />As modest stillness and humility;<br />But when the blast of war blows in our ears,<br />Then imitate the action of the tiger&rsquo;</p>
<p>This speech from Shakespeare&rsquo;s Henry V seems apt to describe the history of the Foreign Exchange (FX) market. The FX market as we know it, was born from a crisis, namely the collapse of the Bretton Woods System in 1971 and the end of the dollar peg for many currencies. Thereafter, the FX market has prevailed over many crises, interspersed by calmer times.</p>
<p>The story of FX is one of huge success. The FX market has grown hand in hand with the global economy and has become the largest and most liquid market in the world, with over $7.5 trillion of FX turnover every day<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/december/philippe-lintern-speech-at-fx-markets-europe-on-global-fx-code#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;(see Chart 1). London remains the heart of this market, representing close to 40% of the global turnover<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/december/philippe-lintern-speech-at-fx-markets-europe-on-global-fx-code#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[2]</a></sup>. The FX market underpins the global economy by enabling the international flow of goods, services, and capital. It provides the infrastructure for households, businesses, and financial market participants to transact across international markets confidently, efficiently, and at fair market prices.</p>

</ul>
<p>The Board of Directors of BME Scaleup has approved the incorporation of&nbsp;<span>Alquiler Seguro Asset Market SOCIMI</span>&nbsp;on 5 December, once all the documentation submitted by the company has been analysed and studied and a favourable evaluation report has been issued by the Market Coordination and Incorporations Committee.</p>
<p>The company's Board of Directors has taken as a reference for the start of the share trading a price of 13.8 euros per share, taking into account the valuation report carried out by an independent expert, which implies a total valuation of the company of 5 million euros.</p>

This market, which offers the necessary transparency to investors and simplifies incorporation requirements for companies, is also open to other types of companies such as SMEs, SOCIMIs or family businesses seeking a first contact with the capital markets.</p>
<p>Among the advantages of BME Scaleup for companies are its ability to boost growth with funds for financing, obtain greater prestige and brand visibility, the possibility of expanding their investor base, the boost to inorganic growth and greater ease of attracting and retaining talent.</p>
<p>To be listed on this market, a company must be a public limited company, have a board of directors, be accompanied by an adviser registered with the market and publish audited annual accounts. A liquidity provider and a minimum free float are not required.</p>

<title>Purdue University/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer: Farmer Sentiment Following The U.S. Election Reaches Highest Levels Since May 2021</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/purdue-universitycme-group-ag-economy-barometer-farmer-sentiment-following-the/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/purdue-universitycme-group-ag-economy-barometer-farmer-sentiment-following-the/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Farmer sentiment jumped again in November, with the&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4314335-1&amp;h=3195169144&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fageconomybarometer%2F&amp;a=Purdue+University%2FCME+Group+Ag+Economy+Barometer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Purdue University/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer</a>&nbsp;climbing 30 points to a reading of 145. This marked the highest level of farmer optimism since&nbsp;May 2021, driven by considerable gains in both the Current Conditions and Future Expectations indices. The Future Expectations Index saw the largest jump, rising 37 points to 161, while the Current Conditions Index increased 18 points to 113.</p>
<p>The November sentiment boost reflects growing optimism about a more favorable regulatory and tax environment for agriculture following the&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;election. This month's survey was conducted from&nbsp;Nov. 11-15, 2024.</p>
<p>In November's survey, farmers reported a notably more positive outlook for their operations and the broader agricultural economy. The percentage of producers expecting their farm's financial performance to improve over the next year climbed to 33%, up from 19% in October. Optimism about the&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;agricultural sector also surged, with 34% of farmers anticipating good times financially in the next 12 months, more than double October's 15%.</p>
<p>Looking ahead five years, over half of November's respondents (52%) predicted widespread prosperity for&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;agriculture, a noticeable increase from 34% the previous month. This growing confidence was also reflected in farmers' investment plans, as 22% reported that it's a good time for large capital investments, compared to 15% in October.</p>
<p>Farmers' improved sentiment also carried over to their investment outlook, as the Farm Capital Investment Index rose 13 points in November to a reading of 55 &mdash; the highest level since&nbsp;May 2021. The change in investment sentiment was partly driven by expectations of stronger financial performance in 2025 compared to 2024. For the second consecutive month, the percentage of producers expecting better financial conditions in the year ahead increased, climbing to 25% in November from 16% in October. This positive shift drove the Farm Financial Performance Index up to 106, marking a 16-point increase from October and a substantial 38-point jump since September.</p>
<p>Following the improvements in the short-term and long-term farmland value indices in October's survey, both indices saw modest declines in November. The Short-Term Farmland Value Expectations Index dropped by 5 points, while the Long-Term Farmland Value Expectations Index decreased by 3 points. Despite these small decreases, the indices remained relatively strong, with the short-term index at 115 and the long-term index at 156.</p>
<p>To gain insight into how farmers' sentiment might align with potential policy shifts following a change in presidential administrations, barometer surveys included several policy-related questions before and after the 2020 and 2024 elections.</p>
<p>In the wake of the 2024 election, farmers' views on environmental regulations experienced a sharp reversal. In October, 41% of respondents anticipated a more restrictive regulatory environment over the next five years, while only 10% expected less restrictive regulations. However, the November survey saw a dramatic shift, with just 9% of surveyed farmers expecting stricter regulations and 55% predicting a more favorable, less restrictive regulatory landscape.</p>
<p>There was a modest shift from October to&nbsp;November 2024&nbsp;when asked about tax expectations, but a notable contrast with responses following the 2020 election. In&nbsp;November 2024, more than half (55%) of respondents expected income tax rates to remain unchanged, compared to just 25% in 2020. Similarly, 57% of respondents in the November survey anticipated estate tax rates to stay the same over the next five years, a large increase from 28% in&nbsp;November 2020.</p>
<p>"While optimism is up, farmers are also expressing concerns about the potential risks to agricultural trade, with many fearing that a trade war could significantly impact&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;exports," said&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4314335-1&amp;h=1800396035&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fageconomybarometer%2Fteam%2Fjim-mintert%2F&amp;a=James+Mintert" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">
James Mintert</a>, the barometer's principal investigator and director of&nbsp;Purdue University's&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4314335-1&amp;h=711896574&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fhome%2F&amp;a=Center+for+Commercial+Agriculture" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Center for Commercial Agriculture</a>.</p>
<p>Forty-two percent of November's survey respondents indicated they believe it is "likely" or "very likely" that&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;agriculture could face a "trade war," potentially leading to a significant decline in agricultural exports.</p>
<p>"As we move into 2025, farmers' outlook for agriculture remains positive, but they are closely monitoring the evolving political landscape and its potential impact on both policy and international trade," Mintert said.</p>

<li><b>At the latest edition of the Salone dei Pagamenti, Fabrick once again outlined integration pathways for a new world of services that aim to foster the development of new models.&nbsp; </b></li>
<li><b>With its cutting-edge vision and comprehensive platform, Fabrick is among the selected entities in the Call for Proposal by Milan Hub of the Bank of Italy.&nbsp;</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Embedded Finance consolidates its position as a <b>key enabler of innovation, capable of driving value across the entire supply chain</b>, benefitting businesses in all sectors as well as their end customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This crucial role and the potential Embedded Finance can unlock in various fields were discussed at the workshop titled <b><i>"Embedded Finance as a Driver of Cross-Industry Innovation"</i></b><i>,</i> organised by <a href="https://www.fabrick.com/it-it/">Fabrick</a><a href="https://www.fabrick.com/it-it/">,</a> a company operating internationally in Open Finance, at the recently concluded <b>Salone dei Pagamenti</b> in Milan. Following its previous focus on Embedded Finance as an <b>emerging trend</b>, particularly its impact on payment integration in the evolution of services and customer experience, Fabrick this year presented concrete use cases from Luca Corti, Country Manager at Mastercard, Francesco Cosciotti, CFO of Toyota Financial Services, and Paolo Zaccardi, CEO and Co-Founder of Fabrick. These use cases provided valuable insights and sparked further discussion on the topic. <b>Paolo Zaccardi, CEO and Co-founder of Fabrick,</b> said: <i>&ldquo;Embedded Finance today represents the intersection of customers&rsquo; growing demand for simple, seamless, and integrated experiences and companies&rsquo; need to innovate by streamlining internal processes. Through our Open Finance platform, we support corporates across all sectors in simplifying and optimising payment processes, enabling the easy integration of new solutions and services in a modular way. The use of artificial intelligence and predictive models also allows us to analyse data and create increasingly personalised and enriched experiences for the end customer.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Thanks to <b>Embedded Finance</b>, companies in any sector can integrate financial services into their offerings and provide payment, banking, and insurance services without the need to build proprietary financial infrastructure or obtain regulatory approvals. This simplifies complex processes both internally and externally, creating an ecosystem of value-added services around payments.</p>
<p><b>Embedded Finance</b> therefore serves as both a growth driver and a <b>catalyst for innovation</b>. <b>Fabrick</b> has supported companies across various industries, including automotive, logistics, energy, and utilities, in integrating financial services into their value chains, creating more personalised and fluid experiences while ensuring continuity across multiple channels. Customers can choose the most suitable payment method while accessing a range of additional services designed to enrich and simplify the overall experience.</p>
<p>In this context, <b>Fabrick</b> and <b>Toyota Financial Services</b> have launched a collaboration in the <b>&lsquo;FinMobility&rsquo;</b> sector, aiming to create value from all payment and information flows within mobility ecosystems. Through the "Check IBAN" solution, innovative energy operators simplify the customer onboarding process, while companies like <b>Sorgenia</b> and <b>Iren Luce Gas e Servizi</b> are using transactional data analysis tools to optimise credit scoring. The logistics sector is also seeing innovation and <b>Fabrick</b> has partnered with a leading European distributor of products and services in its sector to streamline B2B collection processes.</p>
<p>Fabrick's forward-thinking vision of this key Open Finance trend is increasingly validated by reputable figures.</p>

<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed settled charges against Houston-based biotherapeutics company Kiromic BioPharma, Inc., its former CEO, Maurizio Chiriva-Internati, and its former chief financial officer, Tony Tontat, for failing to disclose material information about Kiromic&rsquo;s two cancer fighting drug candidates before, during, and after a July 2021 follow-on public offering that raised $40 million. Kiromic and Tontat have agreed to settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges in separate administrative proceedings and Chiriva has agreed to settle the charges in federal district court. Kiromic was not ordered to pay a civil penalty in light of its self-reporting, cooperation, and remediation, and Chiriva and Tontat agreed to pay civil penalties of $125,000 and $20,000, respectively, to settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These resolutions strike the right balance between holding Kiromic&rsquo;s then-two most senior officers responsible for Kiromic&rsquo;s disclosure failures while also crediting Kiromic for its voluntary self-report, remediation, proactively instituting remedial measures, and providing meaningful cooperation to the staff,&rdquo; said Eric Werner, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Fort Worth Regional Office.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order against Kiromic, the company raised $40 million in a public offering on July 2, 2021, for the purpose of funding the prospective clinical trials for its two cancer fighting drug candidates, the ALEXIS-PRO-1 and the ALEXIS-ISO-1. However, the SEC&rsquo;s order found that two weeks before the public offering, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) notified Kiromic that it had placed the drug candidates on clinical hold&mdash;an FDA order to delay the proposed clinical investigations. The SEC&rsquo;s order also found that Kiromic did not disclose the FDA clinical holds in its SEC filings, investor roadshow calls, or during due diligence calls leading up to the offering, despite the fact that Kiromic disclosed the hypothetical risk of a clinical hold and the potential negative consequences on Kiromic&rsquo;s business. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, Kiromic consented to the SEC&rsquo;s order, which requires Kiromic to cease and desist from committing or causing future violations of the antifraud, reporting, and disclosure controls provisions of the federal securities laws.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint against Chiriva, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, alleges that Chiriva learned about the FDA clinical holds for the ALEXIS-PRO-1 and the ALEXIS-ISO-1 on June 16 and 17, 2021, respectively. The complaint alleges that Chiriva reviewed, signed, and contributed content to a report filed with the SEC on June 25, 2021, and signed and certified another report filed with the SEC on August 13, 2021, both of which failed to disclose the FDA clinical holds. The complaint also alleges that three days before Kiromic&rsquo;s offering, Chiriva participated in roadshow calls with investors and did not correct misstatements by another Kiromic officer about the status of the FDA review by disclosing the FDA&rsquo;s clinical holds. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s allegations, Chiriva has agreed to settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges by consenting to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud, reporting, certification, and disclosure controls provisions of the federal securities laws, to be barred for three years from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and to the civil penalty referenced above. The settlement is subject to court approval.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order against Tontat, after the July 2021 public offering, Tontat received and reviewed detailed letters from the FDA explaining the FDA&rsquo;s decision for issuing the June 16 and 17, 2021 clinical holds. The order also found that, despite acknowledging that the FDA communications were material and warranted disclosure, Tontat signed and certified Kiromic&rsquo;s August 13, 2021, Form 10-Q that failed to disclose the clinical holds. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, Tontat consented to the SEC&rsquo;s order, which requires him to cease and desist from committing or causing future violations of the reporting and certification provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay the civil penalty referenced above.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Kendrack Lewis of the SEC&rsquo;s Fort Worth Regional Office, under the supervision of Samantha S. Martin and B. David Fraser. The SEC&rsquo;s litigation will be led by Jennifer Reece and supervised by Keefe Bernstein.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Equity revenue declined globally by 6% due to a 14% drop in fees year-over-year.

<title>ASEAN Taxonomy Board (ATB) Conducts Workshop On The ASEAN Taxonomy For Sustainable Finance (ASEAN Taxonomy) In Hanoi, Vietnam And Announces Forthcoming Public Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) &amp; Use Cases In Response To Stakeholder Consultation Feedback</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asean-taxonomy-board-atb-conducts-workshop-on-the-asean-taxonomy-for-sustainab/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asean-taxonomy-board-atb-conducts-workshop-on-the-asean-taxonomy-for-sustainab/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The ATB, with the support of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) held an ASEAN Taxonomy Hybrid Socialisation Workshop in Hanoi, Viet Nam on 2-3 December 2024. Hosted by the State Securities Commission of Viet Nam, the event also incorporated a session on governance, stewardship and sustainability organised by the ASEAN Capital Markets Forum (ACMF), which is one of the sectoral bodies that make up the ATB.</p>
<p>The event kicked-off with a panel session on &ldquo;Pathways to Developing a Sustainable Finance Taxonomy&rdquo;, featuring developers of national taxonomies that have been developed or are under development from Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam. This was followed by an indepth workshop on how to apply the Foundation Framework and Plus Standard of the ASEAN Taxonomy conducted by the ATB, Sustainable Finance Institute Asia and DNV. On Day 2, a panel comprising ASEAN capital market regulators and institutional investors examined the role of institutional investors in driving the sustainability agenda among corporates through stewardship codes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The ATB hopes to conduct more of such workshops to enhance awareness and implementation of the ASEAN Taxonomy. Such efforts are in line with feedback and suggestions received from the targeted stakeholder consultation on the ASEAN Taxonomy Version 3 which was held from July to October 2024.</p>
<p>The ATB is encouraged by the positive responses from stakeholders, with most of the feedback received pertaining to suggestions on improving clarity in definitions and usability of the ASEAN Taxonomy Version 3, and heightening awareness and capacity building related to the implementation of the Taxonomy. Given the proliferation of taxonomies and guidances, stakeholders highlighted the need for mutual recognition and international credibility of taxonomies through interoperability and equivalence. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Stakeholders shared on the need for tools to help implementation of the Taxonomy. In response to this need, the ATB has taken the initiative of producing a Public FAQ document, addressing common pertinent questions relating to the ASEAN Taxonomy. It is the ATB&rsquo;s hope that this Public FAQ will assist in the understanding, socialisation, and uptake of the ASEAN Taxonomy.&nbsp; In addition to the Public FAQ, the ATB is also developing new Use Cases for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises using the Foundation Framework of the ASEAN Taxonomy, as useful points of reference to ease further adoption and utilisation of the ASEAN Taxonomy. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus far, the ASEAN Taxonomy has seen several encouraging examples of utilisation, which were also verified by Second Party Opinion providers. Bangkok Expressway and Metro Plc used the ASEAN Taxonomy Transportation &amp; Storage as well as DNSH Criteria, in their issuance of sustainability finance instruments via a Sustainable Financing Framework in September 2024. The Provincial Electric Authority (PEA), a Thai State Utility Operator had also referenced the ASEAN Taxonomy Energy and DNSH Criteria in their issuance of Sustainability Bonds in August 2024.</p>
<p>Moving forward, the ATB will continue to explore more market-facing activities to encourage and facilitate the use and usability of the ASEAN Taxonomy, and by extension, further the development of the sustainable finance ecosystem in the region. <b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>CHAIR&nbsp; </b></p>
<p>ASEAN Taxonomy Board</p>
<p align="left"><b><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span> </i></b><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><i>The ASEAN Taxonomy serves as a principal reference point in ASEAN to orientate capital flows and funding towards sustainable activities and investments.&nbsp; </i></p>
<p><i>The ASEAN Taxonomy is a collaborative initiative</i><i> that has been jointly launched by the ASEAN Capital Markets Forum (ACMF), the ASEAN Insurance Regulators Meeting (AIRM), the ASEAN Senior Level Committee on Financial Integration (SLC), and the ASEAN Working Committee on Capital Market Development (WC-CMD). This follows previous sustainable finance initiatives by the ASEAN sectoral bodies, such as the ASEAN Green, Social and Sustainability Bond Standards and the ASEAN Sustainable Banking Principles.&nbsp; </i></p>
<p><i>The ASEAN Taxonomy represents the collective commitment of ASEAN Member States (AMS) in transitioning towards a sustainable region. The ASEAN Taxonomy will be the overarching guide for all AMS, complementing their respective national sustainability initiatives and serving as ASEAN&rsquo;s common language for sustainable finance. It is a multi-tiered taxonomy that will take into account ASEAN&rsquo;s needs, as well as international aspirations and goals. We believe that such a multi-tiered ASEAN Taxonomy is inclusive and will be beneficial to all AMS, and facilitate an orderly and effective transition towards a sustainable ASEAN. </i></p>
<p><i>The ATB was set up in 2021 under the auspices of the ASEAN Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors&rsquo; Meeting (AFMGM) and is jointly driven by the ACMF, AIRM, SLC and the WC-CMD. Its establishment is a response to the call at the 6th AFMGM to work towards: </i></p>
<p align="left"><i>&ldquo;&hellip;.furthering a cohesive sustainable finance agenda cutting across banking, capital markets and insurance areas at the ASEAN Finance Ministers&rsquo; Meeting and AFMGM respectively, with greater coordination amongst the relevant ASEAN working committees.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><i>The importance of a common taxonomy for ASEAN was identified in the ACMF&rsquo;s Roadmap for ASEAN </i></p>
<p><i>Sustainable Capital Markets, the SLC&rsquo;s Report on The Roles of ASEAN Central Banks in Managing Climate and Environment-related Risks and the WC-CMD&rsquo;s Report on Promoting Sustainable Finance in ASEAN. </i></p>
<p><i>The current Board comprises representatives from all 10 ASEAN Member States, as follows: </i></p>
<ul>
<li><b><i>Brunei Darussalam Central Bank (Chair) </i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (Vice-Chair) </i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Monetary Authority of Singapore&nbsp; </i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Non-Bank Financial Services Authority of Cambodia </i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Financial Services Authority of Indonesia </i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Bank of the Lao PDR </i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Bank Negara Malaysia </i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Securities Commission Malaysia </i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Ministry of Planning and Finance of Myanmar </i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Securities and Exchange Commission Philippines </i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Bank of Thailand </i></b></li>
<li><b><i>The Securities and Exchange Commission, Thailand&nbsp; </i></b></li>
<li><b><i>State Securities Commission of Viet Nam </i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Insurance Regulator of Cambodia </i></b></li>
</ul>
<p><i>The Sustainable Finance Institute Asia (SFIA) provides support as host of the ATB.&nbsp;</i></p>

<p><span><span><span>Every LEI links to a verified company identity record held in the Global LEI Index, an open, globally recognized data bank that is free for all to access. Each LEI record contains key reference information registered by local authoritative sources to enable the clear and unique identification of legal entities globally. The new 'linking' initiative adds a dedicated URL to the LEI records of entities registered by KVK, providing direct access to the official registry data and associated information products on the KVK website.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The initiative stands to significantly streamline Know Your Customer (KYC), Know Your Supplier (KYS) checks and other due diligence obligations, as&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" name="_Hlk183770869">an organization's registry data on the KVK website is now immediately available to any counterparty across the world via the Global LEI Index.</a>&nbsp;This removes the requirement for global data users to initially confirm KVK as the relevant registration authority, identify and navigate to the correct website, translate into local language, and then manually search for an organization using its business registration number.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" name="_Hlk183771079">Local businesses in the Netherlands subsequently stand to benefit from increased discoverability and identifiability globally. This is particularly beneficial for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) looking to expand into new markets.</a></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Alexandre Kech, CEO, GLEIF, comments: "Business registries play a crucial role in promoting transparency across the global economy but finding and effectively corroborating information about local organizations&mdash;particularly SMEs&mdash;can prove challenging. By simplifying access to authoritative information about businesses in the Netherlands, our collaboration with KVK is promoting increased trust and transparency across the broader economy. This marks an important step forward and reflects wider opportunities for business registries across the world to leverage the LEI as a central data connector."</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Cindy Lourens, Director of Registers, KVK, comments: "This new initiative is a simple, elegant solution that promises to help global data users more effectively connect the dots. Any business registered in the Netherlands can now use their LEI as a 'global passport' to help facilitate cross-border payments, transactions and trade, with the confidence that their organization is instantly discoverable, and that key reference information is immediately available to any counterparty across the world."</span></span></span></p>

<title>TP ICAP And AWS Announce Major Strategic Collaboration</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li><b><i>Amazon Web Services to collaborate with TP ICAP to accelerate development of Fusion, TP ICAP&rsquo;s market-leading electronic platform.</i></b></li>
<li><b><i>TP ICAP and Amazon Web Services to co-develop sustainability trading solutions.</i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Amazon Web Services to apply its expertise to establish TP ICAP AI and Innovation Lab.</i></b></li>
</ul>
<p>TP ICAP Group (LON: TCAP) (TP ICAP), a world-leading provider of financial markets infrastructure and data solutions, and Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), today announced a major agreement to streamline and scale TP ICAP&rsquo;s technology infrastructure.</p>
<p>A key focus of this multifaceted agreement is to accelerate the development of Fusion, TP ICAP&rsquo;s flagship digital platform.&nbsp;Fusion, a cloud-based platform, is designed to enhance TP ICAP&rsquo;s ability to serve clients throughout the transaction lifecycle.</p>
<p>The collaboration with AWS will involve 45 highly skilled AWS Professional Services engineers working alongside TP ICAP&rsquo;s technology teams to co-develop the Fusion platform. Utilising data analytics and generative AI to enhance developers&rsquo; productivity, this agreement aims to more than halve new product development times, enhance scalability, and nearly double TP ICAP&rsquo;s IT workload on AWS Cloud to more than 80%.</p>
<p>Additionally, AWS will work with TP ICAP to reinforce its leadership in energy and commodities brokerage. Focusing on the energy transition, TP ICAP and AWS will explore opportunities to co-develop innovative, sustainability-focused trading solutions, and support Amazon&rsquo;s suppliers in creating decarbonisation plans, aligning with Amazon&rsquo;s net-zero carbon ambition by 2040.</p>
<p>AWS will also help TP ICAP establish an AI and Innovation Lab to accelerate and scale AI-driven solutions. This lab will build on TP ICAP&rsquo;s successful projects to date, like automating regulatory governance reviews with Amazon Bedrock and creating a Chatbot to automate client engagement analysis and generate actionable insights.</p>
<p><b>Nicolas Breteau, Group CEO, TP ICAP,</b>&nbsp;said: &ldquo;This strategic collaboration with AWS positions TP ICAP as a leader in digital transformation within our industry. We will be able to develop new functionality, faster, to enhance our electronic platform, Fusion. And by equipping our teams with AI expertise and tools, we will further strengthen our ability to develop new solutions, execute at scale, and better serve our clients.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Tanuja Randery, VP &amp; Managing Director AWS EMEA</b>, said: &ldquo;We are excited to embark on this transformative journey with TP ICAP.&nbsp;TP ICAP&rsquo;s &ldquo;All in on Cloud&rdquo; strategy aims to migrate&nbsp;over 80% of its technology infrastructure to AWS by the end of 2026. This will reduce TP ICAP&rsquo;s reliance on physical data centres and legacy systems, delivering millions in annual savings and cutting carbon emissions. And with the establishment of its AI and Innovation Lab, TP ICAP is also investing in training, equipping its workforce with capabilities and skills in developing advanced AI-driven solutions.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Scott Mullins, Managing Director, Financial Services at AWS</b>, said: "Leveraging AWS generative AI capabilities like Amazon Bedrock, TP ICAP will be able to rapidly deliver innovative services, gain predictive insights, increase productivity, and better respond to customer needs. This collaboration underscores AWS's leadership in wholesale markets and our ability to deliver secure, compliant, and AI-enabled solutions that drive tangible business value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This new seven-year strategic collaboration agreement builds on the proven decade-long working relationship between TP ICAP and AWS.</p>

<p><span>The collaboration between Kaizen and RegGenome will support the digitisation of regulation where both parties will work together to provide fast and efficient access to a vast array of global regulatory rules, jurisdictions and taxonomies on the Single Rulebook platform. By combining Single Rulebook&rsquo;s front end user interface with RegGenome&rsquo;s AI powered regulatory data and information structures, the firms will provide clients with a new standard of regulatory intelligence and change management.</span></p>
<p><span>Many financial institutions operate across multiple locations and global regulatory jurisdictions. Today&rsquo;s announcement means that firms will be able to navigate and respond quickly to the complex landscape of regulatory change and divergence more easily and efficiently.</span></p>
<p><span>In early 2025, Single Rulebook clients will be able to access regulatory content covering all major global financial markets. This includes coverage of US federal regulators and agencies, European national law and global G20 members.</span></p>
<p><span>In addition to core financial services regulations, Single Rulebook users will also be able to investigate emerging compliance requirements for cryptocurrency, cyber security and digital operational resilience.</span></p>
<p><span>Mark Johnston, CEO, RegGenome commented: &ldquo;We are delighted to announce our strategic partnership with Kaizen's Single Rulebook. This collaboration will make RegGenome's comprehensive structured regulatory data available through Single Rulebook's innovative platform.

<p><span>Chris Dingley, CEO, Single Rulebook said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited to announce our partnership with RegGenome today. Working with RegGenome&rsquo;s AI solution for regulatory data and information means that we will be able to expand the Single Rulebook platform and content rapidly for our clients, continuing and enhancing our efforts to support them with the burden of managing global regulation.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>RegGenome processes global regulation using artificial intelligence (AI) to transform what is human-readable into machine-readable and machine-consumable data.&nbsp;It is part of the Regulatory Genome Project (RGP), a public-private initiative between the University of Cambridge, Judge Business School, and RegGenome. RGP aims to build and review a set of open-access regulatory information structures, known as the Cambridge Regulatory Genome (CRG), and make available a global repository of aggregated, structured regulatory data. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Single Rulebook is Kaizen&rsquo;s digital solution for searching and navigating global regulation. The platform helps firms manage regulatory change with front end functionality such as rule maps, labels and annotations which can be pinned to regulatory rules and shared across global organisations.</span></p>

<title>ASIC Flags Key Observations From Inaugural IDR Data Publication</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-flags-key-observations-from-inaugural-idr-data-publication/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-flags-key-observations-from-inaugural-idr-data-publication/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC has released its first publication of industry-wide data reported under the internal dispute resolution (IDR) data reporting framework.</p>
<p>Under the IDR framework, most licensed financial firms are required to report IDR data to ASIC on a six-monthly basis. This inaugural industry-wide report is a key milestone in the implementation of the framework. Publishing IDR data promotes transparency by sharing valuable information with consumers while also helping to drive improvements in IDR practices.</p>
<p>Key observations from the over 4.7 million complaints reported by financial firms of all types for the period 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>General insurance products were subject to the most complaints (33% of all complaints), followed by credit products (22%) and deposit-taking products (15%)</li>
<li>most complaints were about service (45%), followed by charges (22%) and transactions (11%)</li>
<li>most outcomes involved an explanation or apology only, or no remedy (43%), followed by a service-based remedy (39%) and a monetary remedy (13%)</li>
<li>over three-quarters of all complaints were resolved within one day, and</li>
<li>623,555 complaints resulted in a monetary remedy, collectively totalling over $375 million.</li>
</ul>
<p>While ASIC does not verify that financial firms&rsquo; self-reported data accurately reflects their underlying complaints handling, we found variations in the volume of complaints reported by comparable firms and gaps in the IDR data that indicate the data reported to ASIC may not fully reflect the complaints received by some firms. As a result, ASIC is concerned that some firms are not reporting IDR data as accurately as is possible.</p>
<p>Moreover, 5,035 firms declared no complaints to report for the full year period. This number is higher than ASIC expected.</p>
<p>ASIC will assess compliance with the reporting requirements by reviewing firms that make a nil submission against other datasets, including reports of misconduct, reportable situations and data from the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA).</p>
<p>ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland said it is important for firms to foster a positive complaints management culture, including a focus on gathering accurate data, adding that firms should reflect on the detailed requirements and practical guidance outlined in ASIC&rsquo;s IDR data reporting handbook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gaps we&rsquo;ve identified suggest there may be inconsistent IDR reporting practices across the industry,&rdquo; said Commissioner Kirkland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While there may be reasonable explanations for some of these variances, we encourage firms to carefully review our report and guidance to assist in reporting complete and accurate IDR data. Starting from next year, we&rsquo;ll be publishing data about complaints received by individual firms. It is crucial that firms act now to address any gaps in IDR reporting processes, because we will publish the data as it is reported to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Commissioner Kirkland said ASIC is closely examining the standard of IDR reporting and undertaking a range of activities to strengthen compliance with the regime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where we become aware of problems, we will engage with firms to understand the causes, and whether they stem from deficiencies in the firm&rsquo;s underlying IDR processes or in IDR data reporting,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our ongoing analysis of the IDR data will also inform our other regulatory activities, so industry can expect to hear more from ASIC on this issue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ahead of publishing firm-level data, ASIC will consult on our approach to contextualising and presenting the data.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>As the first step in the financial dispute resolution framework, IDR plays a vital role in providing remedies and protections for consumers. ASIC is responsible for overseeing the effective operation of the dispute resolution system, which includes setting the standards and requirements for financial firms&rsquo; IDR processes.</p>
<p>Since 5 October 2021 financial firms have been required to record all complaints received through their IDR processes. All financial firms began reporting this IDR data to ASIC for the first time from 1 January 2024.</p>
<p>The IDR data reporting framework is the culmination of many years of work with industry to record, improve and standardise the quality of dispute resolution data. In 2025, ASIC will publish firm-level IDR data. This will enable the public to compare the IDR data reported by individual firms.</p>
<p>Collecting, and ultimately publishing, internal dispute resolution data provides greater public visibility of where consumers may be having difficulties. It provides ASIC with an important data set to assist with regulatory decision making and will drive firms to improve IDR practices. The obligation on financial firms to submit IDR data to ASIC is ongoing every six months. ASIC will continue to engage with firms on meeting this requirement.</p>
<p>Financial firms can get more information on the requirements from ASIC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/dispute-resolution/internal-dispute-resolution-data-reporting/" title="Internal dispute resolution data reporting">IDR data reporting page</a>, which includes frequently asked questions.</p>

<title>Cut Or Skip? Federal Reseve Governor Christopher J. Waller At "Building A Better Fed Framework," American Institute For Economic Research Monetary Conference, Washington, D.C.</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Lydia, and thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today. I thought I might use my time with you to address the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) ongoing effort to return inflation to our 2 percent target while keeping the labor market and the economy strong.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20241202a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>After significant progress in reducing inflation and evident moderation in the labor market, in September the Committee judged that the time had come to begin easing monetary policy toward a more neutral setting to limit the risk of unduly weakening the labor market as progress continues toward 2 percent inflation. After reducing the policy rate 75 basis points since our September meeting, I believe that monetary policy is still restrictive and putting downward pressure on inflation without creating undesirable weakness in the labor market. I expect rate cuts to continue over the next year until we approach a more neutral setting of the policy rate.</p>
<p>But recent data have raised the possibility that progress on inflation may be stalling at a level meaningfully above 2 percent. This risk has raised concerns that the FOMC should consider holding the policy rate constant at our upcoming meeting to collect more information about the future path of inflation and the economy. Based on the economic data in hand today and forecasts that show that inflation will continue on its downward path to 2 percent over the medium term, at present I lean toward supporting a cut to the policy rate at our December meeting. But that decision will depend on whether data that we will receive before then surprises to the upside and alters my forecast for the path of inflation.</p>
<p>Let me turn to the economic outlook. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at a strong annual pace of 2.8 percent in the third quarter of 2024, and indications are that growth in the fourth quarter will be a bit slower. An average of private sectors forecasts predicts 2.2 percent, while based on fairly limited data so far, the Atlanta Fed&rsquo;s GDPNow model currently predicts 3.2 percent.</p>
<p>On the consumer side of the economy, real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) increased 0.1 percent in October after a 0.5 percent rise in September. Given the recent volatility in these numbers, I won't read too much into the monthly swing. The modest increase in October might partially reflect some payback to the stronger growth in September. Overall, household balance sheets continue to be in generally good shape, and this position should help maintain spending going forward.</p>
<p>On the business side of the economy, the S&amp;P Global U.S. manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) rose slightly in November but still stands at a level indicating a slight deterioration in overall business conditions among manufacturers for the fifth straight month. Today's Institute for Supply Management manufacturing survey had a similar leaning. These readings are consistent with industrial production data for manufacturing remaining flat, as it has been for the past several months.</p>
<p>But these aggregate data mask quite different performances for interest-sensitive sectors and other businesses not so affected by rates. In the spring of 2022, when the FOMC began raising interest rates, production by more interest rate&ndash;sensitive manufacturers, such as business equipment, grew at about the same rate as production by less rate-sensitive manufacturers. But starting around the middle of 2023, when the policy rate hit its peak, those stories diverged, and production by interest-sensitive manufacturing declined, while other manufacturing rose, driving a sizable gap between the two types of industries. This divergence is an indication to me that, even after the Committee cut rates 75 basis points, restrictive policy is working the way it is intended to, affecting production in sectors where rates matter. It is also a reminder that there is still some distance to go in reducing the policy rate to neutral. As that occurs, I expect the gap between the two types of industries will narrow. As for the service sector, which is the larger share of business activity, the November S&amp;P Global U.S. PMI continued to increase, extending the strong momentum for services over the past year or two.</p>
<p>While the picture for economic activity is pretty clear right now across the major data that we look at, things aren't as clear in recent data on the labor market. As expected, the October employment report showed very little increase in the number of jobs, but likely because of the temporary effects of the recent hurricanes and the strike at Boeing, which also affected businesses serving Boeing and its workers. The strike is over, and it is likely that most of the job losses from the hurricane have reversed. So I do expect a rebound in payroll data in the November employment report that is due out later this week, but it may take more time for the full swings in the payroll data to fully wash out.</p>
<p>For that reason, I am leaning on other metrics to reveal what is really going on in the labor market. And when I look at a broader range of data, it tells a fairly consistent story over the past year about moderating demand relative to supply, consistent with continued progress toward 2 percent inflation and without an undesirable weakening in the labor market.</p>
<p>The unemployment rate started 2024 at 3.7 percent and climbed gradually, briefly hitting 4.3 percent before falling back down to 4.1 percent in September and October. While that is still quite low in historical terms, it indicates a labor market significantly looser than we saw from the middle of 2022 to the middle of 2023, when unemployment was close to 3.5 percent and fast wage growth contributed to high inflation. Other data sharpen this image of a looser but still-strong labor market. The share of workers voluntarily quitting their jobs, an indication of tightness in the labor market, has trended down to levels lower than before the pandemic. The number of job openings continues to gradually fall, another sign of moderating demand relative to supply, but the number of layoffs is still low, consistent with a healthy labor market.</p>
<p>Growth in wages and other forms of compensation has moderated at the same time that labor productivity has grown strongly. This story is very different than a couple of years ago when, for example, average hourly wages grew at an annual rate above 5 percent in 2022, at the same time that the productivity of workers was declining. This double whammy put significant upward pressure on inflation. But over the second and third quarters of 2024, average hourly wages have grown at less than a 4 percent annual rate, while productivity has grown around 2 percent. The math is pretty simple&mdash;4 percent wage growth minus the 2 percent gain from higher productivity tells you that wage growth is consistent with bringing inflation down to 2 percent.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20241202a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a></p>
<p>While I am pleased at how well the labor market has held up under restrictive monetary policy, I am less pleased about what the data have been telling us the past couple of months about inflation. After making a lot of progress over the past year and a half, the recent data indicate that progress may be stalling. Inflation based on the Commerce Department's measure of prices for PCE rose more than expected in September and October and so did "core" PCE inflation, which excludes more volatile food and energy prices and is a better guide to future inflation. Three-month annualized core PCE inflation has risen over the past two months, while six-month annualized inflation has made only a small improvement. These rates now stand at 2.8 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively. These recent readings have contributed to 12-month core PCE inflation of 2.8 percent in October.</p>
<p>If we compare components of core inflation this October with last October, we see 12-month housing services inflation has softened and goods inflation has moved to slight deflation, but there has been an increase in nonmarket core services excluding housing. Overall, I feel like an MMA fighter who keeps getting inflation in a choke hold, waiting for it to tap out yet it keeps slipping out of my grasp at the last minute. But let me assure you that submission is inevitable&mdash;inflation isn't getting out of the octagon.</p>
<p>While the recent increase and the level of inflation raise concerns that it may be getting stuck above the FOMC's 2 percent goal, let me emphasize that this is a risk but not a certainty. I take the recent inflation data seriously, but we saw a similar uptick in inflation a year ago that was followed by a continued decline, so I also don't want to overreact. And I expect housing services inflation to continue to moderate and I do not take much signal from the elevated inflation for other non-market services.</p>
<p>Now let me turn to the implications for monetary policy based on my assessment of the underlying economic outlook. While some near-term aspects of the outlook may be a little unclear, something that is clear is the direction for monetary policy and our policy rate over the medium term, which is down. This downward trajectory reflects the fact that the level of aggregate demand in the economy, relative to supply, has moderated significantly over the past year&mdash;it is plainly visible in the data on spending and the labor market. Inflation over that time is also significantly lower, so it makes sense to be moving policy rates toward a more neutral setting.</p>
<p>And there is a ways to go. In September, the median of the projections of FOMC participants was that the federal funds rate would be 3.4 percent at the end of next year, which is about 100 basis points lower than it is today. That number can and probably will change over time, but whatever the destination, there will be a variety of ways to get there, with the speed and timing of cuts determined by economic conditions we encounter on the way.</p>
<p>The motivation for continuing to cut the policy rate at the FOMC's next meeting begins with how restrictive the current setting is. After we cut by 75 basis points, I believe the evidence is strong that policy continues to be significantly restrictive and that cutting again will only mean that we aren't pressing on the brake pedal quite as hard. Although monthly core inflation has flattened out in recent months, there is no indication that the pace of price increases for key service categories such as housing and nonmarket services should remain at their current levels or increase. Another factor that supports a further rate cut is that the labor market appears to finally be in balance, and we should aim to keep it that way.</p>
<p>Conversely, based on what we know today, one could argue that there is a case for skipping a rate cut at the next meeting. Monthly readings on inflation have moved up noticeably recently, and we don't know whether this uptick in inflation will persist, or reverse, as we saw a year ago. Due to strikes and hurricanes, recent labor market data are giving us a cloudy view of the true state of the labor market that won't be clearer for a couple of months. As a result, one could advocate for not changing the policy rate at our upcoming meeting and adjusting our policy stance in a measured way going forward. In fact, if policymakers' estimates of the target range at the end of next year are close to correct, then the Committee will most likely be skipping rate cuts multiple times on the way to that destination.</p>
<p>In deciding which of these two approaches to take at the FOMC's next meeting, I will be watching additional data very closely. Tomorrow, we get the Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. On Friday, we get the employment report, which, as I noted, may have misleading payroll data. Then next week, we get consumer and producer price indexes for November, which will allow a good estimate of PCE inflation for the month. Finally, on the first day of the FOMC meeting, we receive retail sales data for November that will give us an idea of how consumer spending is holding up.</p>
<p>All of that information will help me decide whether to cut or skip. As of today, I am leaning toward continuing the work we have started in returning monetary policy to a more neutral setting. Policy is still restrictive enough that an additional cut at our next meeting will not dramatically change the stance of monetary policy and allow ample scope to later slow the pace of rate cuts, if needed, to maintain progress toward our inflation target. That said, if the data we receive between today and the next meeting surprise in a way that suggests our forecasts of slowing inflation and a moderating but still-solid economy are wrong, then I will be supportive of holding the policy rate constant. I will be watching the incoming data closely over the next couple weeks to help me make my decision as to what path to take.</p>

<p><a name="fn1"></a>1. The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn2"></a>2. A similar story holds true if one looks at growth in labor productivity and hourly compensation from the Productivity and Cost release. Here the wedge between the two series has narrowed over this time period.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 27<sup>th</sup> Annual African Securities Exchanges Association (ASEA or the Association) Conference was hosted by Botswana Stock Exchange (BSE) from November 27<sup>th</sup> -29th, 2024 at the Royal Area Conference</p>
<p>Center in Gaborone Botswana. The theme of this year&rsquo;s Conference was <b>Fostering Transformation in Capital Markets Through Innovation</b>; a timely topic that sought to reemphasis the importance innovation in deepening and reshaping the capital market landscape on the continent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 27<sup>th</sup> edition of the ASEA Conference attracted more than 250 delegates from Africa, Middle East, the United States of America and Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>While making his opening remarks, the President of the Association, Mr. Pierre Celestin Rwabukumba urged the players in the African financial markets to make a deliberate effort to highlight tremendous potential there is in harnessing new ideas, digital technologies, and creative solutions to elevate African exchanges. &ldquo;<i>Over the next few days, we will address key areas for growth&mdash;from enhancing regulatory environments to advancing sustainable finance and integrating new technologies&mdash;to drive the transformative change that Africa&rsquo;s markets require&rdquo;</i>; he noted.</p>
<p>The opening ceremony of the Conference was officiated by the Vice President of the Republic of Botswana &amp; Minister of Finance, Hon. Ndaba Gaolatlhe, who commended the efforts of ASEA in in forging with its democratization agenda with more inclusiveness and reemphasized on the importance of leadership in shaping a prosperous future for Africa.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also in attendance was Mrs. Emily Mburu-Ndoria, whose keynote address on trade and digitalization aligned seamlessly with our strategic objectives.&nbsp; She also insisted on the private sector being a major component for economic development of the continent under Agenda 2063 and more so the capital markets. Therefore, the private sector was called upon to assume its role as engine of growth and development in the fight against poverty; she noted.</p>
<p>Ms. Neo Mooki, the Chairperson of the BSE pointed out that some key determinants in strengthening the African financial markets would include promotion of financial literacy and entrenching the belief that the success of the continent is indeed achievable and feasible. &ldquo;Let us focus on critical issues such as transparency, efficiency and attracting investments to Africa, breaking technologies shaping our future beyond conference halls&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Conference was preceded by a two-day Capacity building Seminar on the African Exchanges Linkage Project, the &ldquo;AELP&rdquo;, a landmark initiative designed to promote cross-border trading of securities across Africa. The AELP represents an ambitious step forward in linking African capital markets, enhancing liquidity, and enabling investors to access opportunities across borders with greater ease.&nbsp;</p>
