<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority Encouraged By First Climate Statements</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana TƒÅtai Hokohoko &ndash; has today published its Climate-Related Disclosures insights report from the first set of entities that were required to file climate statements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA reviewed 70 climate statements that were prepared by climate reporting entities (CREs) for reporting periods ended between December 2023 and March 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA&rsquo;s review looked at compliance with the disclosure requirements in the External Reporting Board&rsquo;s Aotearoa New Zealand Climate Standards and the legislative requirements under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013. The purpose of the report is to provide timely and useful feedback for climate reporting entities to improve disclosure in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FMA Head of Audit, Financial Reporting and Climate Related Disclosures, Jacco Moison said: &ldquo;We are pleased with the efforts that CREs have made to prepare and lodge their first set of mandatory climate statements under the CRD regime. Climate reporting entities have put in an enormous effort to ensure their first mandatory climate statements were prepared on time. We acknowledge that some have faced challenges, including obtaining reliable data, incurring higher-than expected costs and deciding how to make disclosures in the absence of guidance on certain topics.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below is a sample of the key insights from the report. See the full report for more details.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Information disclosed&nbsp;</p>
<p>CREs need to strike the right balance on the amount of information disclosed. Disclosing too much may risk obscuring material information for primary users, while disclosing too little may result in material information being omitted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA found instances where climate statements included substantial detail about certain processes or included information that may not have been relevant or specific to the CRE itself. It also observed climate statements that may have omitted disclosures required by Climate Standards. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA has recommended CREs carefully consider both their own facts and circumstances, as well as the nature and characteristics of their primary users, to ensure they only disclose material information in relation to each disclosure required by the Climate Standards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fairly present disclosures&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Climate Standards require that climate statements are presented fairly. The FMA found that some entities presented information that may have over emphasised positive news or impacts at the expense of a balanced representation. Some disclosed information that was difficult to understand or incomplete.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Explain the how&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disclosures across the governance, risk management and strategy thematic areas require CREs to explain how processes are undertaken. Others require disclosure of how these processes or matters are embedded across an organization. In some instances, the FMA observed entities simply disclosing that a process takes place or that it is connected to other part of their business without providing any explanation about what is involved in that process or the nature and extent of the connection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next steps&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA intends to continue its educative and constructive approach to the monitoring of climate statements. Two webinars will be held with the sector this month as well as further engagements in the new year to discuss the report&rsquo;s findings. &nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>The federal bank regulatory agencies today announced their third notice requesting comment to reduce regulatory burden. The Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996 requires the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council and federal bank regulatory agencies to review their regulations at least once every 10 years to identify outdated or otherwise unnecessary regulatory requirements for their supervised institutions.</p>
<p>To facilitate this review, the agencies divided their regulations into 12 categories and are now soliciting comments on their regulations for three categories: Rules of Procedure, Safety and Soundness, and Securities. The public has 90 days from publication in the&nbsp;<em>Federal Register&nbsp;</em>to comment on the relevant regulations.</p>
<p>The agencies will request comment on regulations in the remaining categories in 2025, asking the public to identify the regulations they believe are outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome.</p>
<p>The agencies will hold a series of outreach meetings where interested parties may comment on applicable regulatory requirements directly to the agencies. Information about the outreach meetings will be publicized as details are finalized.</p>

<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<ul>
<li><em>The reporting framework for investment firms is amended to comply with the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR3) and to align with the changes included in the Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) on supervisory reporting for credit institutions.</em></li>
<li><em>The amendments cover supervisory reporting requirements on counterparty credit risk, market risk (K-NPR) and credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today amendments to its final draft ITS on the supervisory reporting and disclosures of investment firms.</span></p>
<p>The ITS on investment firms reporting and disclosures foresee that investment firms could opt to report the same information &ndash; as set out in the COREP templates &ndash; as credit institutions. Formally, the alignment with the reporting by credit institutions was achieved by adding cross-references to the applicable&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/activities/single-rulebook/regulatory-activities/supervisory-reporting/implementing-technical-standards-supervisory-reporting-changes-related-crr3crd6-step-1">ITS on Supervisory reporting by credit institutions</a>. Following the amendments introduced in the CRR3, it was necessary to update the references included in the ITS for reporting of investment firms.</p>
<h4>Next steps</h4>
<p>In December 2024, the EBA will publish a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/risk-and-data-analysis/reporting-frameworks/reporting-framework-40">technical package</a>, which includes the data point modelling (DPM), validation rules and taxonomy, that shall be used by investment firms to submit this supervisory reporting information to supervisors.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<p>The EBA has developed these draft ITS according to Article 54(3) and Article 49(2) of&nbsp; the IFR - (EU) 2019/2033 - &nbsp;which mandate the EBA to develop a reporting framework and a disclosure requirements for investment firms.</p>
<p>The Investment Firms Prudential Package consists of the Directive (EU) 2019/2034 and the Regulation (EU) 2019/2033, which were published in the Official Journal on 5 December 2019 and establish a new prudential framework for investment firms authorised under MIFID.</p>

<title>A Year In Review: A Tale of Two Supply Shocks, Federal Reserve Governor Adriana D. Kugler, At The Detroit Economic Club, Detroit, Michigan</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Jason, and thank you for the opportunity to speak here in Detroit today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20241203a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;This visit has allowed me to see the many encouraging signs in this region: growth here in downtown; the area's famously hard-working labor force; and the gritty Detroit Lions, with 11 wins this season and counting. The nation has taken notice. But, truly, one of my favorite parts of serving as a Governor on the Federal Reserve Board is visiting communities across the country and hearing directly from the families, workers, and businesses we serve.</p>
<p>I am also glad to have the chance to speak with you near the end of the year. I think it is an appropriate time to look back and assess how the U.S. economy has developed over the course of 2024. I will also share with you my outlook and offer my views on U.S. monetary policy.</p>
<p>I will start by saying that I view the economy as being in a good position after making significant progress in recent years toward our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. The labor market remains solid, and inflation appears to be on a sustainable path to our 2 percent goal, even if there have been some bumps along the way, as I will discuss later.</p>
<p>Reaching this point for the economy was far from assured, especially if you reflect on the pandemic disruptions of nearly five years ago. Even the more recent performance of the economy, at least on the surface, has been surprising to many forecasters. Economic growth remained solid, while inflation moderated from its recent peak without the painful job losses that have often accompanied past efforts to counter high inflation.</p>
<p>Heading into this year, that was not necessarily the forecast of many observers, who were expecting a notable deceleration of economic activity. For example, the Blue Chip Economic Indicators in December 2023 expected 1.3 percent GDP growth for all of 2024. More recent estimates show the economy is on track to grow at almost twice that rate this year.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20241203a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a></p>
<p>So how does one interpret these positive, if somewhat unexpected, results? For me, I turned to looking at not just the realities around me and listening to people around the country, but also to my background as an academic researcher who uses an evidence-based approach to recognize two very important developments that have shaped the economy this year: growth in the labor force stemming from an increase in immigration, and a surge in productivity. I have been closely monitoring these developments and discussing them for more than a year.</p>
<p><strong>Assessing the Economy Entering 2024</strong><br />Entering this year, I took notice of several peculiar puzzles that seemed to be playing out in the economy. In terms of overall growth, I noticed a significant divergence between two important measures of output: gross domestic product, or GDP, and gross domestic income, or GDI. While, over time, these two gauges should move together, they appeared to be out of sync heading into this year. The GDI data suggested rather anemic growth, averaging about 1 percent a quarter in 2023, contrary to very strong GDP readings of more than 2.5 percent. The two measures of output had contrasting implications for productivity growth.</p>
<p>There was a second puzzle in the labor market. Many forecasters expected that the labor market would remain somewhat tight this year, as rebalancing in the labor market had already attracted a large fraction of the available working-age population: The labor force participation of prime-age workers had reached levels not seen since the late 1990s. However, upon closer examination, I saw a more mixed picture.</p>
<p>On the one hand, payroll gains, while slowing, were still averaging a very robust pace of more than 200,000 jobs per month. Data from that time suggest that workers were easily able to find jobs, and measures of layoffs were low by historical standards. In fact, in certain industries, such as health care as well as leisure and hospitality, employment had not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels. That raised questions about whether the supply of workers for those fields could keep pace with demand.</p>
<p>But, on the other hand, the unemployment rate was flat instead of declining. This was puzzling considering a robust pace of payroll gains and the assumption that labor supply was constrained. And the two most important labor market surveys sent somewhat divergent signals. The payroll survey of employers showed hiring was abnormally above the gain recorded by the survey of households. Was the economy expanding at a robust pace, as indicated by the payroll survey? Or was it slowing more, as suggested by the household survey?</p>
<p>In considering these questions, I interpreted the strong pace of payrolls from the establishment survey and the cooling of various measures of resource utilization as a signal that perhaps the official population estimates were understated to the downside. Starting at the end of 2023, I asked, what if substantial increases in the labor force due to the arrival of workers from other countries had not yet been picked up in Census estimates?</p>
<p>We had seen something similar before. In the late 1990s, official measures of the population were substantially revised up due to mismeasured immigration. During this period, establishment and household counts of workers also significantly diverged.</p>
<p>And a third puzzle, with inflation, also warrants attention. Inflation had steadily progressed toward the FOMC's target during 2023, perhaps faster than some economists expected. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index eased from a peak of 7.2 percent in June 2022 to about 3 percent at the end of 2023, measured on a 12-month basis. When excluding volatile food and energy prices, core inflation similarly eased from a peak of 5.6 percent in February 2022 to 3 percent at the end of last year. Wage growth measures were consistent with inflation declining.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Developments This Year</strong><br />At the turn of the new year, new data and other economic developments appeared to cloud the picture further. An uptick in consumer spending and overall economic activity in the fourth quarter of 2023 as well as a stretch of above-trend hiring gave a signal of unexpected strength to start the year. Adding to the puzzling figures, core inflation rose 0.5 percent in January, a notable acceleration from an average monthly increase of 0.15 percent in the previous quarter. Stronger-than-expected economic activity, faster hiring, and a reacceleration of prices gave some economists pause: Was this a temporary acceleration, or a more sustained reheating of the economy? I viewed it as likely temporary, as it turned out to be.</p>
<p>My view has always been that progress in the fight against inflation has to be judged from trends, not from a data release or two. I also anticipated that the process of bringing down inflation was likely to be sometimes bumpy. However, I viewed the elevated inflation readings as partly stemming from seasonal and one-off factors not fully accounted for in the data. In addition, price changes in some categories are difficult to measure, as I have described in previous speeches.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20241203a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;That is particularly true for certain services categories for which direct sources of prices are not available; for example, the cost of living in an owner-occupied home or costs associated with certain financial transactions. And, as I have also discussed, the slow adjustment in workers' wages and relative prices may have contributed to bumps on the road to disinflation. Indeed, by the second quarter of the year, it became clear that the earlier firmer inflation figures were indeed temporary. Inflation stepped back down to average monthly increases of less than 0.2 percent. A factor in that was a cooling labor market, which I will discuss in a moment. With the labor market less tight, wage growth leveled off, and that in turn allowed prices for labor-intensive services to moderate.</p>
<p>There was another important development early this year: Estimates of population growth were revised substantially higher, according to a Congressional Budget Office report.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20241203a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;The report showed about 6 million additional immigrants than were included in official estimates. Those workers added to the supply of labor, which had rebounded early in the pandemic recovery at a time when the unemployment rate was trending near half-century lows.</p>
<p>That information was consistent with my hypothesis that the strength in the economy was in part due to a larger-than-estimated labor force, or what economists call a positive supply shock. You may be more familiar with negative shocks, like the pandemic causing constrained supply chains. But the increase of workers was a positive shock and is notable because the underlying demographics of the U.S. heading into the pandemic were consistent with a slow-growing population and lower labor force participation, and that dynamic got worse as the pandemic generated excess retirements and a fall in immigration.</p>
<p>In terms of the labor market, I anticipated that after several months of strong job growth at the turn of the year, the labor market would cool significantly. And, indeed, by the middle of this year, the process of the labor market normalizing was taking shape. Payroll gains declined from an average pace of 260,000 in the first quarter to less than 200,000 in the second. Reports on the labor market included unusually large downward revisions to previous gains, and the unemployment rate moved higher, from 3.7 percent in January to 4.1 percent in June. At this point, other economists quickly shifted from worrying about a labor market that might be too hot early in the year to one that might be cooling too quickly. As a Fed policymaker, I had to consider if this movement was consistent with our mandate for maximum employment.</p>
<p>Even with the easing in the labor market, consumer spending and overall economic activity continued to show solid growth. The combination of strong spending data and a cooling labor market was confounding. In thinking about this, I examined the productivity data that I follow closely and did not see the type of productivity growth I would have expected based on several other observations of the economy.</p>
<p>For example, new business formation had surged in the post-pandemic period. It has been shown that newer firms foster innovation and boost productivity growth. Business formation has remained elevated, from which I infer that the boost to productivity growth is not just a one-time phenomenon. Also, in the post-pandemic period, workers switched jobs at much higher rates than typical. This likely led to better matches where workers can find more productive uses of their skills. In some cases, immigrants filled job openings for which employers traditionally struggle to attract workers. Therefore, immigration can also contribute to improvements in job matches in specific but key sectors. As the economy reopened from the pandemic, many firms also invested in technology to substitute for workers, who were in short supply, which should support productivity gains. Emerging technologies, most notably artificial intelligence, may also be starting to contribute to enhanced productivity.</p>
<p>Therefore, my speculation was that higher productivity was a possible explanation for the unusual combination of strong economic output, a cooling labor market, and declining inflation&mdash;even if it was not apparent in the quarterly data.</p>
<p>That hunch was confirmed in September, when annual revisions to important economic data showed that economic activity and productivity growth had been stronger than previously estimated. The new figures indicated an average annual rate of productivity growth of 1.9 percent since 2020, notably higher than the approximate 1.4 percent annual rate in the five years before the pandemic. So that reveals our second positive shock: American workers have been more productive in recent years. This is a hugely important development because it increases the productive capacity of the economy and allows more rapid economic growth without overheating. What's more, revisions resulted in much better aligned GDP and GDI measures, and the two measures now also had much more aligned implications for productivity.</p>
<p>In summary, the surprising and largely desirable outcomes for the economy in 2024 are easier to understand once we solve the puzzles I discussed. My thorough assessment of a wide range of data sources revealed that an unusual combination of reports over the past year were gradually resolved once we understood the two positive supply shocks I discussed: growth in the labor force due to an increase in immigration, and higher productivity growth.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Outlook</strong><br />The data we have received in recent weeks have been consistent with the economic forces I described earlier. Real GDP increased at a 2.8 percent annual rate in the third quarter. The latest readings of retail sales have been strong. If household demand remains resilient, that would support growth in the fourth quarter and into next year.</p>
<p>Monthly payroll gains have eased from earlier in the year, consistent with a gradual cooling of the labor market. It was difficult to draw a clear signal from the most recent jobs report, due to significant effects from hurricanes and labor strikes. I look forward to reviewing additional labor data on Friday. The unemployment rate, at 4.1 percent in October, is near the level I judge as roughly consistent with our maximum-employment mandate. After rising earlier this year, the rate has stabilized, though this was partly due to some withdrawals from the labor force. That bears watching moving forward.</p>
<p>The trend in immigration slowed in the second half of this year, and there is reason to expect immigration flows could further slow. I will closely monitor this data.</p>
<p>Inflation readings released last week show that overall PCE prices rose 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in October, and core PCE prices increased 2.8 percent. I still view those readings, as of now, as consistent with inflation on a path to return to our 2 percent goal, and I am encouraged that inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored. But they also show the job is not yet done. Housing services inflation, in particular, remains elevated. And while global inputs to inflation have been mostly modest in recent months, it is difficult to predict future pressures.</p>
<p>I have observed that the trade policy uncertainty index has risen in recent months, likely reflecting risks of changes in trade policy.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20241203a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;Of course, the incoming Administration and Congress have not enacted any policies yet, so it is too early to make judgements. Studying the specifics, when they come out, will be important, as trade policy may affect productivity and prices. I will make assessments about what the net effects of any policy changes will be on prices or employment and how the balance between the two legs of our mandate will be affected.</p>
<p><strong>Outlook for Monetary Policy</strong><br />Given how the economy has developed this year, most notably the continuation of disinflation and a modest cooling in the labor market, I see the Fed's dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability as being roughly in balance. In light of the progress toward our goals, my colleagues and I on the FOMC judged it appropriate to lower our policy rate in September and again last month. These actions were steps toward removing restraint, as we are in the process of moving policy toward a more neutral setting.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, it is important to emphasize that policy is not on a preset course. I will make decisions meeting by meeting and carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. While I have gained more confidence that the two positive supply shocks I described have helped create the solid economic conditions that are currently in place, I will vigilantly monitor for incoming risks or negative supply shocks that may undo the progress that we have achieved in reducing inflation. I view our current policy setting as well positioned to deal with any uncertainties we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time, and I look forward to your questions.</p>

<h2>Speech</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>&lsquo;Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;<br />Or close the wall up with our English dead!<br />In peace there's nothing so becomes a man,<br />As modest stillness and humility;<br />But when the blast of war blows in our ears,<br />Then imitate the action of the tiger&rsquo;</p>
<p>This speech from Shakespeare&rsquo;s Henry V seems apt to describe the history of the Foreign Exchange (FX) market. The FX market as we know it, was born from a crisis, namely the collapse of the Bretton Woods System in 1971 and the end of the dollar peg for many currencies. Thereafter, the FX market has prevailed over many crises, interspersed by calmer times.</p>
<p>The story of FX is one of huge success. The FX market has grown hand in hand with the global economy and has become the largest and most liquid market in the world, with over $7.5 trillion of FX turnover every day<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/december/philippe-lintern-speech-at-fx-markets-europe-on-global-fx-code#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;(see Chart 1). London remains the heart of this market, representing close to 40% of the global turnover<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/december/philippe-lintern-speech-at-fx-markets-europe-on-global-fx-code#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[2]</a></sup>. The FX market underpins the global economy by enabling the international flow of goods, services, and capital. It provides the infrastructure for households, businesses, and financial market participants to transact across international markets confidently, efficiently, and at fair market prices.</p>

<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/alquiler-seguro-joins-bme-scaleup-on-december-5/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/alquiler-seguro-joins-bme-scaleup-on-december-5/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li><span>The company, which is the twentieth to enter the market, starts with a valuation of EUR 5 million.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The Board of Directors of BME Scaleup has approved the incorporation of&nbsp;<span>Alquiler Seguro Asset Market SOCIMI</span>&nbsp;on 5 December, once all the documentation submitted by the company has been analysed and studied and a favourable evaluation report has been issued by the Market Coordination and Incorporations Committee.</p>
<p>The company's Board of Directors has taken as a reference for the start of the share trading a price of 13.8 euros per share, taking into account the valuation report carried out by an independent expert, which implies a total valuation of the company of 5 million euros.</p>
<p>The trading code of the company is &lsquo;<span>SCASM</span>&rsquo;. The company's Registered Advisor is&nbsp;<span>VGM Advisory Partners</span>.</p>
<p><span>Alquiler Seguro Asset Market SOCIMI</span>&nbsp;is a SOCIMI promoted by Alquiler Seguro that is focused on the management of dispersed affordable rental housing with the aim of offering accessible housing solutions and contributing to the modernisation and professionalisation of the rental sector.</p>
<p>The Initial Market Access Document for the&nbsp;<span>Alquiler Seguro Asset Market SOCIMI</span>&nbsp;is available on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bolsasymercados.es/MTF_Equity/bme-scaleup/ing/Home.aspx">BME Scaleup website</a>, where you can find all the information about the company and its business.</p>

<title>Purdue University/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer: Farmer Sentiment Following The U.S. Election Reaches Highest Levels Since May 2021</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Farmer sentiment jumped again in November, with the&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4314335-1&amp;h=3195169144&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fageconomybarometer%2F&amp;a=Purdue+University%2FCME+Group+Ag+Economy+Barometer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Purdue University/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer</a>&nbsp;climbing 30 points to a reading of 145. This marked the highest level of farmer optimism since&nbsp;May 2021, driven by considerable gains in both the Current Conditions and Future Expectations indices. The Future Expectations Index saw the largest jump, rising 37 points to 161, while the Current Conditions Index increased 18 points to 113.</p>
<p>The November sentiment boost reflects growing optimism about a more favorable regulatory and tax environment for agriculture following the&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;election. This month's survey was conducted from&nbsp;Nov. 11-15, 2024.</p>
<p>In November's survey, farmers reported a notably more positive outlook for their operations and the broader agricultural economy. The percentage of producers expecting their farm's financial performance to improve over the next year climbed to 33%, up from 19% in October. Optimism about the&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;agricultural sector also surged, with 34% of farmers anticipating good times financially in the next 12 months, more than double October's 15%.</p>
<p>Looking ahead five years, over half of November's respondents (52%) predicted widespread prosperity for&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;agriculture, a noticeable increase from 34% the previous month. This growing confidence was also reflected in farmers' investment plans, as 22% reported that it's a good time for large capital investments, compared to 15% in October.</p>
<p>Farmers' improved sentiment also carried over to their investment outlook, as the Farm Capital Investment Index rose 13 points in November to a reading of 55 &mdash; the highest level since&nbsp;May 2021. The change in investment sentiment was partly driven by expectations of stronger financial performance in 2025 compared to 2024. For the second consecutive month, the percentage of producers expecting better financial conditions in the year ahead increased, climbing to 25% in November from 16% in October. This positive shift drove the Farm Financial Performance Index up to 106, marking a 16-point increase from October and a substantial 38-point jump since September.</p>
<p>Following the improvements in the short-term and long-term farmland value indices in October's survey, both indices saw modest declines in November. The Short-Term Farmland Value Expectations Index dropped by 5 points, while the Long-Term Farmland Value Expectations Index decreased by 3 points. Despite these small decreases, the indices remained relatively strong, with the short-term index at 115 and the long-term index at 156.</p>
<p>To gain insight into how farmers' sentiment might align with potential policy shifts following a change in presidential administrations, barometer surveys included several policy-related questions before and after the 2020 and 2024 elections.</p>
<p>In the wake of the 2024 election, farmers' views on environmental regulations experienced a sharp reversal. In October, 41% of respondents anticipated a more restrictive regulatory environment over the next five years, while only 10% expected less restrictive regulations. However, the November survey saw a dramatic shift, with just 9% of surveyed farmers expecting stricter regulations and 55% predicting a more favorable, less restrictive regulatory landscape.</p>
<p>There was a modest shift from October to&nbsp;November 2024&nbsp;when asked about tax expectations, but a notable contrast with responses following the 2020 election. In&nbsp;November 2024, more than half (55%) of respondents expected income tax rates to remain unchanged, compared to just 25% in 2020. Similarly, 57% of respondents in the November survey anticipated estate tax rates to stay the same over the next five years, a large increase from 28% in&nbsp;November 2020.</p>
<p>"While optimism is up, farmers are also expressing concerns about the potential risks to agricultural trade, with many fearing that a trade war could significantly impact&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;exports," said&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4314335-1&amp;h=1800396035&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fageconomybarometer%2Fteam%2Fjim-mintert%2F&amp;a=James+Mintert" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">
James Mintert</a>, the barometer's principal investigator and director of&nbsp;Purdue University's&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4314335-1&amp;h=711896574&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fhome%2F&amp;a=Center+for+Commercial+Agriculture" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Center for Commercial Agriculture</a>.</p>
<p>Forty-two percent of November's survey respondents indicated they believe it is "likely" or "very likely" that&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;agriculture could face a "trade war," potentially leading to a significant decline in agricultural exports.</p>
<p>"As we move into 2025, farmers' outlook for agriculture remains positive, but they are closely monitoring the evolving political landscape and its potential impact on both policy and international trade," Mintert said.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>At the latest edition of the Salone dei Pagamenti, Fabrick once again outlined integration pathways for a new world of services that aim to foster the development of new models.&nbsp; </b></li>
<li><b>With its cutting-edge vision and comprehensive platform, Fabrick is among the selected entities in the Call for Proposal by Milan Hub of the Bank of Italy.&nbsp;</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Embedded Finance consolidates its position as a <b>key enabler of innovation, capable of driving value across the entire supply chain</b>, benefitting businesses in all sectors as well as their end customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This crucial role and the potential Embedded Finance can unlock in various fields were discussed at the workshop titled <b><i>"Embedded Finance as a Driver of Cross-Industry Innovation"</i></b><i>,</i> organised by <a href="https://www.fabrick.com/it-it/">Fabrick</a><a href="https://www.fabrick.com/it-it/">,</a> a company operating internationally in Open Finance, at the recently concluded <b>Salone dei Pagamenti</b> in Milan. Following its previous focus on Embedded Finance as an <b>emerging trend</b>, particularly its impact on payment integration in the evolution of services and customer experience, Fabrick this year presented concrete use cases from Luca Corti, Country Manager at Mastercard, Francesco Cosciotti, CFO of Toyota Financial Services, and Paolo Zaccardi, CEO and Co-Founder of Fabrick. These use cases provided valuable insights and sparked further discussion on the topic. <b>Paolo Zaccardi, CEO and Co-founder of Fabrick,</b> said: <i>&ldquo;Embedded Finance today represents the intersection of customers&rsquo; growing demand for simple, seamless, and integrated experiences and companies&rsquo; need to innovate by streamlining internal processes. Through our Open Finance platform, we support corporates across all sectors in simplifying and optimising payment processes, enabling the easy integration of new solutions and services in a modular way. The use of artificial intelligence and predictive models also allows us to analyse data and create increasingly personalised and enriched experiences for the end customer.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Thanks to <b>Embedded Finance</b>, companies in any sector can integrate financial services into their offerings and provide payment, banking, and insurance services without the need to build proprietary financial infrastructure or obtain regulatory approvals. This simplifies complex processes both internally and externally, creating an ecosystem of value-added services around payments.</p>
<p><b>Embedded Finance</b> therefore serves as both a growth driver and a <b>catalyst for innovation</b>. <b>Fabrick</b> has supported companies across various industries, including automotive, logistics, energy, and utilities, in integrating financial services into their value chains, creating more personalised and fluid experiences while ensuring continuity across multiple channels. Customers can choose the most suitable payment method while accessing a range of additional services designed to enrich and simplify the overall experience.</p>
<p>In this context, <b>Fabrick</b> and <b>Toyota Financial Services</b> have launched a collaboration in the <b>&lsquo;FinMobility&rsquo;</b> sector, aiming to create value from all payment and information flows within mobility ecosystems. Through the "Check IBAN" solution, innovative energy operators simplify the customer onboarding process, while companies like <b>Sorgenia</b> and <b>Iren Luce Gas e Servizi</b> are using transactional data analysis tools to optimise credit scoring. The logistics sector is also seeing innovation and <b>Fabrick</b> has partnered with a leading European distributor of products and services in its sector to streamline B2B collection processes.</p>
<p>Fabrick's forward-thinking vision of this key Open Finance trend is increasingly validated by reputable figures.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Kiromic Biopharma And Two Former C-Suite Executives With Misleading Investors About Status Of FDA Reviews - SEC Declines To Impose Civil Penalties Against Company Due To Its Self-Reporting, Remediation, And Cooperation</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-charges-kiromic-biopharma-and-two-former-c-suite-executives-with-misleading/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-charges-kiromic-biopharma-and-two-former-c-suite-executives-with-misleading/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed settled charges against Houston-based biotherapeutics company Kiromic BioPharma, Inc., its former CEO, Maurizio Chiriva-Internati, and its former chief financial officer, Tony Tontat, for failing to disclose material information about Kiromic&rsquo;s two cancer fighting drug candidates before, during, and after a July 2021 follow-on public offering that raised $40 million. Kiromic and Tontat have agreed to settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges in separate administrative proceedings and Chiriva has agreed to settle the charges in federal district court. Kiromic was not ordered to pay a civil penalty in light of its self-reporting, cooperation, and remediation, and Chiriva and Tontat agreed to pay civil penalties of $125,000 and $20,000, respectively, to settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These resolutions strike the right balance between holding Kiromic&rsquo;s then-two most senior officers responsible for Kiromic&rsquo;s disclosure failures while also crediting Kiromic for its voluntary self-report, remediation, proactively instituting remedial measures, and providing meaningful cooperation to the staff,&rdquo; said Eric Werner, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Fort Worth Regional Office.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order against Kiromic, the company raised $40 million in a public offering on July 2, 2021, for the purpose of funding the prospective clinical trials for its two cancer fighting drug candidates, the ALEXIS-PRO-1 and the ALEXIS-ISO-1. However, the SEC&rsquo;s order found that two weeks before the public offering, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) notified Kiromic that it had placed the drug candidates on clinical hold&mdash;an FDA order to delay the proposed clinical investigations. The SEC&rsquo;s order also found that Kiromic did not disclose the FDA clinical holds in its SEC filings, investor roadshow calls, or during due diligence calls leading up to the offering, despite the fact that Kiromic disclosed the hypothetical risk of a clinical hold and the potential negative consequences on Kiromic&rsquo;s business. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, Kiromic consented to the SEC&rsquo;s order, which requires Kiromic to cease and desist from committing or causing future violations of the antifraud, reporting, and disclosure controls provisions of the federal securities laws.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint against Chiriva, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, alleges that Chiriva learned about the FDA clinical holds for the ALEXIS-PRO-1 and the ALEXIS-ISO-1 on June 16 and 17, 2021, respectively. The complaint alleges that Chiriva reviewed, signed, and contributed content to a report filed with the SEC on June 25, 2021, and signed and certified another report filed with the SEC on August 13, 2021, both of which failed to disclose the FDA clinical holds. The complaint also alleges that three days before Kiromic&rsquo;s offering, Chiriva participated in roadshow calls with investors and did not correct misstatements by another Kiromic officer about the status of the FDA review by disclosing the FDA&rsquo;s clinical holds. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s allegations, Chiriva has agreed to settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges by consenting to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud, reporting, certification, and disclosure controls provisions of the federal securities laws, to be barred for three years from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and to the civil penalty referenced above. The settlement is subject to court approval.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order against Tontat, after the July 2021 public offering, Tontat received and reviewed detailed letters from the FDA explaining the FDA&rsquo;s decision for issuing the June 16 and 17, 2021 clinical holds. The order also found that, despite acknowledging that the FDA communications were material and warranted disclosure, Tontat signed and certified Kiromic&rsquo;s August 13, 2021, Form 10-Q that failed to disclose the clinical holds. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, Tontat consented to the SEC&rsquo;s order, which requires him to cease and desist from committing or causing future violations of the reporting and certification provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay the civil penalty referenced above.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Kendrack Lewis of the SEC&rsquo;s Fort Worth Regional Office, under the supervision of Samantha S. Martin and B. David Fraser. The SEC&rsquo;s litigation will be led by Jennifer Reece and supervised by Keefe Bernstein.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>The global securities finance industry generated $779 million in revenue for lenders in November 2024, according to DataLend, the market data service of fintech EquiLend. The figure represents a slight 0.3% decrease from the $781 million generated in November 2023.</span></p>

<title>ASEAN Taxonomy Board (ATB) Conducts Workshop On The ASEAN Taxonomy For Sustainable Finance (ASEAN Taxonomy) In Hanoi, Vietnam And Announces Forthcoming Public Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) &amp; Use Cases In Response To Stakeholder Consultation Feedback</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asean-taxonomy-board-atb-conducts-workshop-on-the-asean-taxonomy-for-sustainab/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asean-taxonomy-board-atb-conducts-workshop-on-the-asean-taxonomy-for-sustainab/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The ATB, with the support of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) held an ASEAN Taxonomy Hybrid Socialisation Workshop in Hanoi, Viet Nam on 2-3 December 2024. Hosted by the State Securities Commission of Viet Nam, the event also incorporated a session on governance, stewardship and sustainability organised by the ASEAN Capital Markets Forum (ACMF), which is one of the sectoral bodies that make up the ATB.</p>
<p>The event kicked-off with a panel session on &ldquo;Pathways to Developing a Sustainable Finance Taxonomy&rdquo;, featuring developers of national taxonomies that have been developed or are under development from Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam. This was followed by an indepth workshop on how to apply the Foundation Framework and Plus Standard of the ASEAN Taxonomy conducted by the ATB, Sustainable Finance Institute Asia and DNV. On Day 2, a panel comprising ASEAN capital market regulators and institutional investors examined the role of institutional investors in driving the sustainability agenda among corporates through stewardship codes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The ATB hopes to conduct more of such workshops to enhance awareness and implementation of the ASEAN Taxonomy. Such efforts are in line with feedback and suggestions received from the targeted stakeholder consultation on the ASEAN Taxonomy Version 3 which was held from July to October 2024.</p>
<p>The ATB is encouraged by the positive responses from stakeholders, with most of the feedback received pertaining to suggestions on improving clarity in definitions and usability of the ASEAN Taxonomy Version 3, and heightening awareness and capacity building related to the implementation of the Taxonomy. Given the proliferation of taxonomies and guidances, stakeholders highlighted the need for mutual recognition and international credibility of taxonomies through interoperability and equivalence. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Stakeholders shared on the need for tools to help implementation of the Taxonomy. In response to this need, the ATB has taken the initiative of producing a Public FAQ document, addressing common pertinent questions relating to the ASEAN Taxonomy. It is the ATB&rsquo;s hope that this Public FAQ will assist in the understanding, socialisation, and uptake of the ASEAN Taxonomy.&nbsp; In addition to the Public FAQ, the ATB is also developing new Use Cases for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises using the Foundation Framework of the ASEAN Taxonomy, as useful points of reference to ease further adoption and utilisation of the ASEAN Taxonomy. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus far, the ASEAN Taxonomy has seen several encouraging examples of utilisation, which were also verified by Second Party Opinion providers. Bangkok Expressway and Metro Plc used the ASEAN Taxonomy Transportation &amp; Storage as well as DNSH Criteria, in their issuance of sustainability finance instruments via a Sustainable Financing Framework in September 2024. The Provincial Electric Authority (PEA), a Thai State Utility Operator had also referenced the ASEAN Taxonomy Energy and DNSH Criteria in their issuance of Sustainability Bonds in August 2024.</p>
<p>Moving forward, the ATB will continue to explore more market-facing activities to encourage and facilitate the use and usability of the ASEAN Taxonomy, and by extension, further the development of the sustainable finance ecosystem in the region. <b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>CHAIR&nbsp; </b></p>
<p>ASEAN Taxonomy Board</p>
<p align="left"><b><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span> </i></b><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><i>The ASEAN Taxonomy serves as a principal reference point in ASEAN to orientate capital flows and funding towards sustainable activities and investments.&nbsp; </i></p>
<p><i>The ASEAN Taxonomy is a collaborative initiative</i><i> that has been jointly launched by the ASEAN Capital Markets Forum (ACMF), the ASEAN Insurance Regulators Meeting (AIRM), the ASEAN Senior Level Committee on Financial Integration (SLC), and the ASEAN Working Committee on Capital Market Development (WC-CMD). This follows previous sustainable finance initiatives by the ASEAN sectoral bodies, such as the ASEAN Green, Social and Sustainability Bond Standards and the ASEAN Sustainable Banking Principles.&nbsp; </i></p>
<p><i>The ASEAN Taxonomy represents the collective commitment of ASEAN Member States (AMS) in transitioning towards a sustainable region. The ASEAN Taxonomy will be the overarching guide for all AMS, complementing their respective national sustainability initiatives and serving as ASEAN&rsquo;s common language for sustainable finance. It is a multi-tiered taxonomy that will take into account ASEAN&rsquo;s needs, as well as international aspirations and goals. We believe that such a multi-tiered ASEAN Taxonomy is inclusive and will be beneficial to all AMS, and facilitate an orderly and effective transition towards a sustainable ASEAN. </i></p>
<p><i>The ATB was set up in 2021 under the auspices of the ASEAN Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors&rsquo; Meeting (AFMGM) and is jointly driven by the ACMF, AIRM, SLC and the WC-CMD. Its establishment is a response to the call at the 6th AFMGM to work towards: </i></p>
<p align="left"><i>&ldquo;&hellip;.furthering a cohesive sustainable finance agenda cutting across banking, capital markets and insurance areas at the ASEAN Finance Ministers&rsquo; Meeting and AFMGM respectively, with greater coordination amongst the relevant ASEAN working committees.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><i>The importance of a common taxonomy for ASEAN was identified in the ACMF&rsquo;s Roadmap for ASEAN </i></p>
<p><i>Sustainable Capital Markets, the SLC&rsquo;s Report on The Roles of ASEAN Central Banks in Managing Climate and Environment-related Risks and the WC-CMD&rsquo;s Report on Promoting Sustainable Finance in ASEAN. </i></p>
<p><i>The current Board comprises representatives from all 10 ASEAN Member States, as follows: </i></p>
<ul>
<li><b><i>Brunei Darussalam Central Bank (Chair) </i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (Vice-Chair) </i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Monetary Authority of Singapore&nbsp; </i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Non-Bank Financial Services Authority of Cambodia </i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Financial Services Authority of Indonesia </i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Bank of the Lao PDR </i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Bank Negara Malaysia </i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Securities Commission Malaysia </i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Ministry of Planning and Finance of Myanmar </i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Securities and Exchange Commission Philippines </i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Bank of Thailand </i></b></li>
<li><b><i>The Securities and Exchange Commission, Thailand&nbsp; </i></b></li>
<li><b><i>State Securities Commission of Viet Nam </i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Insurance Regulator of Cambodia </i></b></li>
</ul>
<p><i>The Sustainable Finance Institute Asia (SFIA) provides support as host of the ATB.&nbsp;</i></p>

<p><span><span><span>Every LEI links to a verified company identity record held in the Global LEI Index, an open, globally recognized data bank that is free for all to access. Each LEI record contains key reference information registered by local authoritative sources to enable the clear and unique identification of legal entities globally. The new 'linking' initiative adds a dedicated URL to the LEI records of entities registered by KVK, providing direct access to the official registry data and associated information products on the KVK website.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The initiative stands to significantly streamline Know Your Customer (KYC), Know Your Supplier (KYS) checks and other due diligence obligations, as&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" name="_Hlk183770869">an organization's registry data on the KVK website is now immediately available to any counterparty across the world via the Global LEI Index.</a>&nbsp;This removes the requirement for global data users to initially confirm KVK as the relevant registration authority, identify and navigate to the correct website, translate into local language, and then manually search for an organization using its business registration number.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" name="_Hlk183771079">Local businesses in the Netherlands subsequently stand to benefit from increased discoverability and identifiability globally. This is particularly beneficial for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) looking to expand into new markets.</a></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Alexandre Kech, CEO, GLEIF, comments: "Business registries play a crucial role in promoting transparency across the global economy but finding and effectively corroborating information about local organizations&mdash;particularly SMEs&mdash;can prove challenging. By simplifying access to authoritative information about businesses in the Netherlands, our collaboration with KVK is promoting increased trust and transparency across the broader economy. This marks an important step forward and reflects wider opportunities for business registries across the world to leverage the LEI as a central data connector."</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Cindy Lourens, Director of Registers, KVK, comments: "This new initiative is a simple, elegant solution that promises to help global data users more effectively connect the dots. Any business registered in the Netherlands can now use their LEI as a 'global passport' to help facilitate cross-border payments, transactions and trade, with the confidence that their organization is instantly discoverable, and that key reference information is immediately available to any counterparty across the world."</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
<li><b><i>Amazon Web Services to collaborate with TP ICAP to accelerate development of Fusion, TP ICAP&rsquo;s market-leading electronic platform.</i></b></li>
<li><b><i>TP ICAP and Amazon Web Services to co-develop sustainability trading solutions.</i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Amazon Web Services to apply its expertise to establish TP ICAP AI and Innovation Lab.</i></b></li>
</ul>
<p>TP ICAP Group (LON: TCAP) (TP ICAP), a world-leading provider of financial markets infrastructure and data solutions, and Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), today announced a major agreement to streamline and scale TP ICAP&rsquo;s technology infrastructure.</p>
<p>A key focus of this multifaceted agreement is to accelerate the development of Fusion, TP ICAP&rsquo;s flagship digital platform.&nbsp;Fusion, a cloud-based platform, is designed to enhance TP ICAP&rsquo;s ability to serve clients throughout the transaction lifecycle.</p>
<p>The collaboration with AWS will involve 45 highly skilled AWS Professional Services engineers working alongside TP ICAP&rsquo;s technology teams to co-develop the Fusion platform. Utilising data analytics and generative AI to enhance developers&rsquo; productivity, this agreement aims to more than halve new product development times, enhance scalability, and nearly double TP ICAP&rsquo;s IT workload on AWS Cloud to more than 80%.</p>
<p>Additionally, AWS will work with TP ICAP to reinforce its leadership in energy and commodities brokerage. Focusing on the energy transition, TP ICAP and AWS will explore opportunities to co-develop innovative, sustainability-focused trading solutions, and support Amazon&rsquo;s suppliers in creating decarbonisation plans, aligning with Amazon&rsquo;s net-zero carbon ambition by 2040.</p>
<p>AWS will also help TP ICAP establish an AI and Innovation Lab to accelerate and scale AI-driven solutions. This lab will build on TP ICAP&rsquo;s successful projects to date, like automating regulatory governance reviews with Amazon Bedrock and creating a Chatbot to automate client engagement analysis and generate actionable insights.</p>
<p><b>Nicolas Breteau, Group CEO, TP ICAP,</b>&nbsp;said: &ldquo;This strategic collaboration with AWS positions TP ICAP as a leader in digital transformation within our industry. We will be able to develop new functionality, faster, to enhance our electronic platform, Fusion. And by equipping our teams with AI expertise and tools, we will further strengthen our ability to develop new solutions, execute at scale, and better serve our clients.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Tanuja Randery, VP &amp; Managing Director AWS EMEA</b>, said: &ldquo;We are excited to embark on this transformative journey with TP ICAP.&nbsp;TP ICAP&rsquo;s &ldquo;All in on Cloud&rdquo; strategy aims to migrate&nbsp;over 80% of its technology infrastructure to AWS by the end of 2026. This will reduce TP ICAP&rsquo;s reliance on physical data centres and legacy systems, delivering millions in annual savings and cutting carbon emissions. And with the establishment of its AI and Innovation Lab, TP ICAP is also investing in training, equipping its workforce with capabilities and skills in developing advanced AI-driven solutions.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Scott Mullins, Managing Director, Financial Services at AWS</b>, said: "Leveraging AWS generative AI capabilities like Amazon Bedrock, TP ICAP will be able to rapidly deliver innovative services, gain predictive insights, increase productivity, and better respond to customer needs. This collaboration underscores AWS's leadership in wholesale markets and our ability to deliver secure, compliant, and AI-enabled solutions that drive tangible business value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This new seven-year strategic collaboration agreement builds on the proven decade-long working relationship between TP ICAP and AWS.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Kaizen, a leading provider of regulatory compliance solutions for global financial institutions, announced today that it has entered into a&nbsp;</span><span>strategic partnership with RegGenome, a UK based provider of global financial regulatory data, to use artificial intelligence (AI) to vastly expand the coverage and content of Kaizen&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="http://tracking.kaizenreporting.com/tracking/click?d=6YgN0DFQukPrBk1uG7SxtPzb156RffA2dmhSMbf8JfRCVUBoLpR54c-aT5Sdiq---SHNNk1yKmgeocMc-PLMsm90RUJILWG_SFd10BiDb-KgUnZ8OUzlLdoJIaKMocT9K-6hCPFhP2ycQmeIOjZrsMVP3uoRnKJTUbeMe3rVqVRDjk8BVFgEdQQ2dWGMffzA8Q2" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Single Rulebook</a>&nbsp;platform including new jurisdictions and regulatory domains.</span></p>
<p><span>The collaboration between Kaizen and RegGenome will support the digitisation of regulation where both parties will work together to provide fast and efficient access to a vast array of global regulatory rules, jurisdictions and taxonomies on the Single Rulebook platform. By combining Single Rulebook&rsquo;s front end user interface with RegGenome&rsquo;s AI powered regulatory data and information structures, the firms will provide clients with a new standard of regulatory intelligence and change management.</span></p>
<p><span>Many financial institutions operate across multiple locations and global regulatory jurisdictions. Today&rsquo;s announcement means that firms will be able to navigate and respond quickly to the complex landscape of regulatory change and divergence more easily and efficiently.</span></p>
<p><span>In early 2025, Single Rulebook clients will be able to access regulatory content covering all major global financial markets. This includes coverage of US federal regulators and agencies, European national law and global G20 members.</span></p>
<p><span>In addition to core financial services regulations, Single Rulebook users will also be able to investigate emerging compliance requirements for cryptocurrency, cyber security and digital operational resilience.</span></p>
<p><span>Mark Johnston, CEO, RegGenome commented: &ldquo;We are delighted to announce our strategic partnership with Kaizen's Single Rulebook. This collaboration will make RegGenome's comprehensive structured regulatory data available through Single Rulebook's innovative platform. By combining our extensive regulatory content with Single Rulebook's advanced search and analytics capabilities, we're enabling financial institutions to better navigate the complex regulatory landscape.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Chris Dingley, CEO, Single Rulebook said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited to announce our partnership with RegGenome today. Working with RegGenome&rsquo;s AI solution for regulatory data and information means that we will be able to expand the Single Rulebook platform and content rapidly for our clients, continuing and enhancing our efforts to support them with the burden of managing global regulation.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>RegGenome processes global regulation using artificial intelligence (AI) to transform what is human-readable into machine-readable and machine-consumable data.&nbsp;It is part of the Regulatory Genome Project (RGP), a public-private initiative between the University of Cambridge, Judge Business School, and RegGenome. RGP aims to build and review a set of open-access regulatory information structures, known as the Cambridge Regulatory Genome (CRG), and make available a global repository of aggregated, structured regulatory data. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Single Rulebook is Kaizen&rsquo;s digital solution for searching and navigating global regulation. The platform helps firms manage regulatory change with front end functionality such as rule maps, labels and annotations which can be pinned to regulatory rules and shared across global organisations.</span></p>

<title>ASIC Flags Key Observations From Inaugural IDR Data Publication</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-flags-key-observations-from-inaugural-idr-data-publication/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-flags-key-observations-from-inaugural-idr-data-publication/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC has released its first publication of industry-wide data reported under the internal dispute resolution (IDR) data reporting framework.</p>
<p>Under the IDR framework, most licensed financial firms are required to report IDR data to ASIC on a six-monthly basis. This inaugural industry-wide report is a key milestone in the implementation of the framework. Publishing IDR data promotes transparency by sharing valuable information with consumers while also helping to drive improvements in IDR practices.</p>
<p>Key observations from the over 4.7 million complaints reported by financial firms of all types for the period 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>General insurance products were subject to the most complaints (33% of all complaints), followed by credit products (22%) and deposit-taking products (15%)</li>
<li>most complaints were about service (45%), followed by charges (22%) and transactions (11%)</li>
<li>most outcomes involved an explanation or apology only, or no remedy (43%), followed by a service-based remedy (39%) and a monetary remedy (13%)</li>
<li>over three-quarters of all complaints were resolved within one day, and</li>
<li>623,555 complaints resulted in a monetary remedy, collectively totalling over $375 million.</li>
</ul>
<p>While ASIC does not verify that financial firms&rsquo; self-reported data accurately reflects their underlying complaints handling, we found variations in the volume of complaints reported by comparable firms and gaps in the IDR data that indicate the data reported to ASIC may not fully reflect the complaints received by some firms. As a result, ASIC is concerned that some firms are not reporting IDR data as accurately as is possible.</p>
<p>Moreover, 5,035 firms declared no complaints to report for the full year period. This number is higher than ASIC expected.</p>
<p>ASIC will assess compliance with the reporting requirements by reviewing firms that make a nil submission against other datasets, including reports of misconduct, reportable situations and data from the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA).</p>
<p>ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland said it is important for firms to foster a positive complaints management culture, including a focus on gathering accurate data, adding that firms should reflect on the detailed requirements and practical guidance outlined in ASIC&rsquo;s IDR data reporting handbook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gaps we&rsquo;ve identified suggest there may be inconsistent IDR reporting practices across the industry,&rdquo; said Commissioner Kirkland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While there may be reasonable explanations for some of these variances, we encourage firms to carefully review our report and guidance to assist in reporting complete and accurate IDR data. Starting from next year, we&rsquo;ll be publishing data about complaints received by individual firms. It is crucial that firms act now to address any gaps in IDR reporting processes, because we will publish the data as it is reported to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Commissioner Kirkland said ASIC is closely examining the standard of IDR reporting and undertaking a range of activities to strengthen compliance with the regime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where we become aware of problems, we will engage with firms to understand the causes, and whether they stem from deficiencies in the firm&rsquo;s underlying IDR processes or in IDR data reporting,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our ongoing analysis of the IDR data will also inform our other regulatory activities, so industry can expect to hear more from ASIC on this issue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ahead of publishing firm-level data, ASIC will consult on our approach to contextualising and presenting the data.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>As the first step in the financial dispute resolution framework, IDR plays a vital role in providing remedies and protections for consumers. ASIC is responsible for overseeing the effective operation of the dispute resolution system, which includes setting the standards and requirements for financial firms&rsquo; IDR processes.</p>
<p>Since 5 October 2021 financial firms have been required to record all complaints received through their IDR processes. All financial firms began reporting this IDR data to ASIC for the first time from 1 January 2024.</p>
<p>The IDR data reporting framework is the culmination of many years of work with industry to record, improve and standardise the quality of dispute resolution data. In 2025, ASIC will publish firm-level IDR data. This will enable the public to compare the IDR data reported by individual firms.</p>
<p>Collecting, and ultimately publishing, internal dispute resolution data provides greater public visibility of where consumers may be having difficulties. It provides ASIC with an important data set to assist with regulatory decision making and will drive firms to improve IDR practices. The obligation on financial firms to submit IDR data to ASIC is ongoing every six months. ASIC will continue to engage with firms on meeting this requirement.</p>
<p>Financial firms can get more information on the requirements from ASIC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/dispute-resolution/internal-dispute-resolution-data-reporting/" title="Internal dispute resolution data reporting">IDR data reporting page</a>, which includes frequently asked questions.</p>

<title>Cut Or Skip? Federal Reseve Governor Christopher J. Waller At "Building A Better Fed Framework," American Institute For Economic Research Monetary Conference, Washington, D.C.</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Lydia, and thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today. I thought I might use my time with you to address the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) ongoing effort to return inflation to our 2 percent target while keeping the labor market and the economy strong.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20241202a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>After significant progress in reducing inflation and evident moderation in the labor market, in September the Committee judged that the time had come to begin easing monetary policy toward a more neutral setting to limit the risk of unduly weakening the labor market as progress continues toward 2 percent inflation. After reducing the policy rate 75 basis points since our September meeting, I believe that monetary policy is still restrictive and putting downward pressure on inflation without creating undesirable weakness in the labor market. I expect rate cuts to continue over the next year until we approach a more neutral setting of the policy rate.</p>
<p>But recent data have raised the possibility that progress on inflation may be stalling at a level meaningfully above 2 percent. This risk has raised concerns that the FOMC should consider holding the policy rate constant at our upcoming meeting to collect more information about the future path of inflation and the economy. Based on the economic data in hand today and forecasts that show that inflation will continue on its downward path to 2 percent over the medium term, at present I lean toward supporting a cut to the policy rate at our December meeting. But that decision will depend on whether data that we will receive before then surprises to the upside and alters my forecast for the path of inflation.</p>
<p>Let me turn to the economic outlook. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at a strong annual pace of 2.8 percent in the third quarter of 2024, and indications are that growth in the fourth quarter will be a bit slower. An average of private sectors forecasts predicts 2.2 percent, while based on fairly limited data so far, the Atlanta Fed&rsquo;s GDPNow model currently predicts 3.2 percent.</p>
<p>On the consumer side of the economy, real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) increased 0.1 percent in October after a 0.5 percent rise in September. Given the recent volatility in these numbers, I won't read too much into the monthly swing. The modest increase in October might partially reflect some payback to the stronger growth in September. Overall, household balance sheets continue to be in generally good shape, and this position should help maintain spending going forward.</p>
<p>On the business side of the economy, the S&amp;P Global U.S. manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) rose slightly in November but still stands at a level indicating a slight deterioration in overall business conditions among manufacturers for the fifth straight month. Today's Institute for Supply Management manufacturing survey had a similar leaning. These readings are consistent with industrial production data for manufacturing remaining flat, as it has been for the past several months.</p>
<p>But these aggregate data mask quite different performances for interest-sensitive sectors and other businesses not so affected by rates. In the spring of 2022, when the FOMC began raising interest rates, production by more interest rate&ndash;sensitive manufacturers, such as business equipment, grew at about the same rate as production by less rate-sensitive manufacturers. But starting around the middle of 2023, when the policy rate hit its peak, those stories diverged, and production by interest-sensitive manufacturing declined, while other manufacturing rose, driving a sizable gap between the two types of industries. This divergence is an indication to me that, even after the Committee cut rates 75 basis points, restrictive policy is working the way it is intended to, affecting production in sectors where rates matter. It is also a reminder that there is still some distance to go in reducing the policy rate to neutral. As that occurs, I expect the gap between the two types of industries will narrow. As for the service sector, which is the larger share of business activity, the November S&amp;P Global U.S. PMI continued to increase, extending the strong momentum for services over the past year or two.</p>
<p>While the picture for economic activity is pretty clear right now across the major data that we look at, things aren't as clear in recent data on the labor market. As expected, the October employment report showed very little increase in the number of jobs, but likely because of the temporary effects of the recent hurricanes and the strike at Boeing, which also affected businesses serving Boeing and its workers. The strike is over, and it is likely that most of the job losses from the hurricane have reversed. So I do expect a rebound in payroll data in the November employment report that is due out later this week, but it may take more time for the full swings in the payroll data to fully wash out.</p>
<p>For that reason, I am leaning on other metrics to reveal what is really going on in the labor market. And when I look at a broader range of data, it tells a fairly consistent story over the past year about moderating demand relative to supply, consistent with continued progress toward 2 percent inflation and without an undesirable weakening in the labor market.</p>
<p>The unemployment rate started 2024 at 3.7 percent and climbed gradually, briefly hitting 4.3 percent before falling back down to 4.1 percent in September and October. While that is still quite low in historical terms, it indicates a labor market significantly looser than we saw from the middle of 2022 to the middle of 2023, when unemployment was close to 3.5 percent and fast wage growth contributed to high inflation. Other data sharpen this image of a looser but still-strong labor market. The share of workers voluntarily quitting their jobs, an indication of tightness in the labor market, has trended down to levels lower than before the pandemic. The number of job openings continues to gradually fall, another sign of moderating demand relative to supply, but the number of layoffs is still low, consistent with a healthy labor market.</p>
<p>Growth in wages and other forms of compensation has moderated at the same time that labor productivity has grown strongly. This story is very different than a couple of years ago when, for example, average hourly wages grew at an annual rate above 5 percent in 2022, at the same time that the productivity of workers was declining. This double whammy put significant upward pressure on inflation. But over the second and third quarters of 2024, average hourly wages have grown at less than a 4 percent annual rate, while productivity has grown around 2 percent. The math is pretty simple&mdash;4 percent wage growth minus the 2 percent gain from higher productivity tells you that wage growth is consistent with bringing inflation down to 2 percent.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20241202a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a></p>
<p>While I am pleased at how well the labor market has held up under restrictive monetary policy, I am less pleased about what the data have been telling us the past couple of months about inflation. After making a lot of progress over the past year and a half, the recent data indicate that progress may be stalling. Inflation based on the Commerce Department's measure of prices for PCE rose more than expected in September and October and so did "core" PCE inflation, which excludes more volatile food and energy prices and is a better guide to future inflation. Three-month annualized core PCE inflation has risen over the past two months, while six-month annualized inflation has made only a small improvement. These rates now stand at 2.8 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively. These recent readings have contributed to 12-month core PCE inflation of 2.8 percent in October.</p>
<p>If we compare components of core inflation this October with last October, we see 12-month housing services inflation has softened and goods inflation has moved to slight deflation, but there has been an increase in nonmarket core services excluding housing. Overall, I feel like an MMA fighter who keeps getting inflation in a choke hold, waiting for it to tap out yet it keeps slipping out of my grasp at the last minute. But let me assure you that submission is inevitable&mdash;inflation isn't getting out of the octagon.</p>
<p>While the recent increase and the level of inflation raise concerns that it may be getting stuck above the FOMC's 2 percent goal, let me emphasize that this is a risk but not a certainty. I take the recent inflation data seriously, but we saw a similar uptick in inflation a year ago that was followed by a continued decline, so I also don't want to overreact. And I expect housing services inflation to continue to moderate and I do not take much signal from the elevated inflation for other non-market services.</p>
<p>Now let me turn to the implications for monetary policy based on my assessment of the underlying economic outlook. While some near-term aspects of the outlook may be a little unclear, something that is clear is the direction for monetary policy and our policy rate over the medium term, which is down. This downward trajectory reflects the fact that the level of aggregate demand in the economy, relative to supply, has moderated significantly over the past year&mdash;it is plainly visible in the data on spending and the labor market. Inflation over that time is also significantly lower, so it makes sense to be moving policy rates toward a more neutral setting.</p>
<p>And there is a ways to go. In September, the median of the projections of FOMC participants was that the federal funds rate would be 3.4 percent at the end of next year, which is about 100 basis points lower than it is today. That number can and probably will change over time, but whatever the destination, there will be a variety of ways to get there, with the speed and timing of cuts determined by economic conditions we encounter on the way.</p>
<p>The motivation for continuing to cut the policy rate at the FOMC's next meeting begins with how restrictive the current setting is. After we cut by 75 basis points, I believe the evidence is strong that policy continues to be significantly restrictive and that cutting again will only mean that we aren't pressing on the brake pedal quite as hard. Although monthly core inflation has flattened out in recent months, there is no indication that the pace of price increases for key service categories such as housing and nonmarket services should remain at their current levels or increase. Another factor that supports a further rate cut is that the labor market appears to finally be in balance, and we should aim to keep it that way.</p>
<p>Conversely, based on what we know today, one could argue that there is a case for skipping a rate cut at the next meeting. Monthly readings on inflation have moved up noticeably recently, and we don't know whether this uptick in inflation will persist, or reverse, as we saw a year ago. Due to strikes and hurricanes, recent labor market data are giving us a cloudy view of the true state of the labor market that won't be clearer for a couple of months. As a result, one could advocate for not changing the policy rate at our upcoming meeting and adjusting our policy stance in a measured way going forward. In fact, if policymakers' estimates of the target range at the end of next year are close to correct, then the Committee will most likely be skipping rate cuts multiple times on the way to that destination.</p>
<p>In deciding which of these two approaches to take at the FOMC's next meeting, I will be watching additional data very closely. Tomorrow, we get the Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. On Friday, we get the employment report, which, as I noted, may have misleading payroll data. Then next week, we get consumer and producer price indexes for November, which will allow a good estimate of PCE inflation for the month. Finally, on the first day of the FOMC meeting, we receive retail sales data for November that will give us an idea of how consumer spending is holding up.</p>
<p>All of that information will help me decide whether to cut or skip. As of today, I am leaning toward continuing the work we have started in returning monetary policy to a more neutral setting. Policy is still restrictive enough that an additional cut at our next meeting will not dramatically change the stance of monetary policy and allow ample scope to later slow the pace of rate cuts, if needed, to maintain progress toward our inflation target. That said, if the data we receive between today and the next meeting surprise in a way that suggests our forecasts of slowing inflation and a moderating but still-solid economy are wrong, then I will be supportive of holding the policy rate constant. I will be watching the incoming data closely over the next couple weeks to help me make my decision as to what path to take.</p>

<p><a name="fn1"></a>1. The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn2"></a>2. A similar story holds true if one looks at growth in labor productivity and hourly compensation from the Productivity and Cost release. Here the wedge between the two series has narrowed over this time period.&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The 27<sup>th</sup> Annual African Securities Exchanges Association (ASEA or the Association) Conference was hosted by Botswana Stock Exchange (BSE) from November 27<sup>th</sup> -29th, 2024 at the Royal Area Conference</p>
<p>Center in Gaborone Botswana. The theme of this year&rsquo;s Conference was <b>Fostering Transformation in Capital Markets Through Innovation</b>; a timely topic that sought to reemphasis the importance innovation in deepening and reshaping the capital market landscape on the continent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 27<sup>th</sup> edition of the ASEA Conference attracted more than 250 delegates from Africa, Middle East, the United States of America and Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>While making his opening remarks, the President of the Association, Mr. Pierre Celestin Rwabukumba urged the players in the African financial markets to make a deliberate effort to highlight tremendous potential there is in harnessing new ideas, digital technologies, and creative solutions to elevate African exchanges. &ldquo;<i>Over the next few days, we will address key areas for growth&mdash;from enhancing regulatory environments to advancing sustainable finance and integrating new technologies&mdash;to drive the transformative change that Africa&rsquo;s markets require&rdquo;</i>; he noted.</p>
<p>The opening ceremony of the Conference was officiated by the Vice President of the Republic of Botswana &amp; Minister of Finance, Hon. Ndaba Gaolatlhe, who commended the efforts of ASEA in in forging with its democratization agenda with more inclusiveness and reemphasized on the importance of leadership in shaping a prosperous future for Africa.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also in attendance was Mrs. Emily Mburu-Ndoria, whose keynote address on trade and digitalization aligned seamlessly with our strategic objectives.&nbsp; She also insisted on the private sector being a major component for economic development of the continent under Agenda 2063 and more so the capital markets. Therefore, the private sector was called upon to assume its role as engine of growth and development in the fight against poverty; she noted.</p>
<p>Ms. Neo Mooki, the Chairperson of the BSE pointed out that some key determinants in strengthening the African financial markets would include promotion of financial literacy and entrenching the belief that the success of the continent is indeed achievable and feasible. &ldquo;Let us focus on critical issues such as transparency, efficiency and attracting investments to Africa, breaking technologies shaping our future beyond conference halls&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Conference was preceded by a two-day Capacity building Seminar on the African Exchanges Linkage Project, the &ldquo;AELP&rdquo;, a landmark initiative designed to promote cross-border trading of securities across Africa. The AELP represents an ambitious step forward in linking African capital markets, enhancing liquidity, and enabling investors to access opportunities across borders with greater ease.&nbsp;</p>
