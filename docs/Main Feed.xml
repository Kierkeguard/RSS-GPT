<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Quincy Data, powered by McKay Brothers, and NovaSparks, the leading field programmable gate array (FPGA) market data company, have worked together to add the support of the Quincy Extreme Data (QED) Feed to NovaTick<sup>TM</sup>.</p>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NovaTick<sup>TM</sup> is NovaSparks&rsquo; ultra-low latency ticker-plant based on a powerful FPGA matrix architecture. It handles the high-performance requirements of electronic trading platforms with the speed and determinism that only FPGAs can bring. NovaTick<sup>TM</sup> converts the QED feed into NovaSparks&rsquo; normalized wire format in 400ns and can also provide the QED wireless market data through its software C++ Application Programming Interface (API), NSMDA, or its hardware API, NovaLink<sup>TM</sup>. Arbitration between the QED wireless feed and the QED fiber feed can also be added in front of the feed handler in NovaTick<sup><sup>TM</sup></sup> to provide a reliable normalized stream of market data.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The vast majority of our customers are trading across geographies and asset classes. Often, they rely on wireless services to transport market data at the fastest speed. This collaboration will not only simplify their trading architecture, but it will also give them an opportunity to further reduce the overall latency of market data sent abroad via wireless services. The addition of the QED feed brings our global feed total to 75, confirming our leading position among all the FPGA-centric market data solutions providers. This puts us in a unique position to offer unparalleled service,&rdquo; said Luc Burgun, NovaSparks&rsquo; chief executive officer and president.</p>
<p>"Today, FPGA technology is an essential component of any high-speed trading infrastructure. FPGAs are able to handle very large market data bursts while maintaining a deterministic latency profile. The Quincy Extreme Data service distributes a normalized feed of select market data sourced from financial exchanges globally to many points of presence (PoPs) in the U.S., Europe, India, and Asia. We welcome NovaSparks into our ecosystem. This new solution will give all NovaSparks customers a very efficient way to use market data from our wireless service directly into their trading platforms," says St&eacute;phane Tyc, Quincy Data co-founder.</p>
<p>NovaTick&rsquo;s pure FPGA processing architecture is incredibly fast and deterministic, yielding one to two orders of magnitude faster than traditional software solutions. NovaSparks&rsquo; pure-FPGA feed handlers have a normalized output format across markets, enabling NovaSparks customers to integrate new feeds with minimum effort.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Support of the QED feed by NovaTick<sup>TM</sup> allows us to benefit from the tight integration we already have between NovaTick<sup>TM</sup> and our trading platform," says Alain Katchouni, Managing Director, Head of ETF and Electronic Trading at National Bank Financial Inc.,<b> </b>one of Canada's six systemically important banks. "This new addition simplifies and accelerates our trading environment when we use Quincy Extreme Data service,&rdquo; added Katchouni.</p>

Rothschild &amp; Co went ahead from occupying the sixth position by value in 2022 to top the chart in 2023. Involvement in two billion-dollar deals* including a mega deal valued more than $10 billion was pivotal for it in leading the chart by value.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>In the October 2023 Monetary Policy Statement (MPS), MAS maintained the rate of appreciation of the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER) policy band, with no change to the width of the band or level at which it was centred. Since then, the S$NEER has strengthened in line with the appreciating policy band</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Chart 1</span></span><span><br /><span>S$ Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (S$NEER)</span></span></span></p>
<p><img alt="S$NEER chart for Monetary Policy Statement January 2024" height="364px" src="https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/mas-media-library/news/monetary-policy-statements/2024/mps_chart_2024_01.jpg?h=364px&amp;w=563px&amp;hash=9190C1A48ABF3665B0F75D67DC412922" width="563px" />&nbsp;</p>
<h2>GROWTH BACKDROP</h2>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Economic activity in Singapore&rsquo;s major trading partners was resilient in the last quarter of 2023. In the near term, global growth is expected to be impacted by the lagged effects of elevated interest rates in the advanced economies. However, global final demand should pick up later this year, as lower inflation sustains private consumption expenditure, and monetary policy settings in the major economies turn more supportive. This outlook is subject to uncertainties, particularly stemming from ongoing geopolitical conflicts which could precipitate negative global supply and demand shocks.</span></p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>MTI&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Advance Estimat</em>es show that growth in the Singapore economy picked up to 1.7% on a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis in the last quarter of 2023, from 1.3% in Q3 and an average of &minus;0.1% in the first half of the year. This strengthening in momentum was mainly attributable to the external-facing sectors. For 2023 as a whole, the Singapore economy is estimated to have expanded by 1.2%.</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prospects for the Singapore economy should continue to improve in 2024, with GDP growth projected to come in between 1&ndash;3%. The recovery in the manufacturing and financial sectors should be supported by the turnaround in the electronics cycle and anticipated easing in global interest rates, respectively, even as growth in the domestic-oriented sectors further normalises towards pre-pandemic rates. Consequently, the slightly negative output gap in 2023 will narrow in the second half of 2024.</span></p>
<h2>INFLATION OUTLOOK</h2>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS Core Inflation<span>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/monetary-policy-statements/2024/mas-monetary-policy-statement-29jan24#1">[1]</a></span>&nbsp;</span>continued to decline in year-on-year terms in Q4 2023, though by less than expected. Inflation for food and retail goods moderated, offsetting firmer electricity &amp; gas inflation. Travel-related services inflation, which is largely determined by conditions in tourism markets abroad, was stronger as hotel room rates and package tour prices saw steep increases. For 2023 as a whole, MAS Core Inflation came in at 4.2%, slightly higher than the 4.1% in 2022. However, excluding the impact of the GST increase, core inflation would have fallen by an estimated 0.6%-point in 2023 compared to 2022.</p>

<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>CPI-All Items inflation likewise edged down in Q4 2023 from the preceding quarter. Accommodation inflation eased as the supply of completed housing units increased. This helped to offset rising private transport inflation amid higher petrol prices. CPI-All Items inflation averaged 4.8% in 2023, down from 6.1% in the preceding year.</span></p>
<p>7.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span>MAS Core Inflation is expected to rise in the current quarter due in part to the one-off impact of the 1%-point hike in the GST from January this year, as well as the increase in the carbon tax. Water prices will rise from Q2 this year amid increases in production costs. Inflation for certain services components, including public transport and healthcare, could also stay elevated as less frequently-adjusted prices rise to catch up with higher cost levels.</span></p>
<p>8.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Setting aside the transitory impact of the GST increase, core inflation is forecast to decline gradually over 2024. Lower imported costs and a slower pace of domestic cost increases should underpin the moderating trend in inflation. Global energy and food commodity prices have fallen and are expected to remain broadly stable, while imported costs of most intermediate and final goods should be tempered by favourable global supply conditions. On the domestic front, wage growth should ease this year&nbsp;</span><span>as labour market tightness dissipates</span><span>, while productivity is also projected to pick up. Consequently, unit labour costs will rise at a slower pace.</span></p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>MAS Core Inflation is projected to slow to an average of 2.5&ndash;3.5% for 2024 as a whole, unchanged from the October 2023 MPS. Excluding the impact of the increase in the GST rate this year, core inflation is forecast at 1.5&ndash;2.5%.</span></p>
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Amid the declines in COE premiums since November and the larger COE supply this year compared to 2023, CPI-All Items inflation in 2024 is now forecast to be lower at 2.5&ndash;3.5%, down from the previous range of 3&ndash;4%. Excluding the effects of the increase in the GST rate, headline inflation is forecast at 1.5&ndash;2.5%.</span></p>
<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Both upside and downside risks to the inflation outlook remain. Shocks to global food and energy prices or domestic labour costs could bring about additional inflationary pressures. However, an unexpected weakening in the global economy could induce a faster easing of cost and price pressures.</span></p>
<h2>MONETARY POLICY</h2>
<p><span>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;Barring any further global shocks, the Singapore economy is expected to strengthen in 2024, with growth becoming more broad-based. MAS Core Inflation is likely to remain elevated in the earlier part of the year, but should decline gradually and step down by Q4, before falling further next year.</span></p>
<p><span>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, current monetary policy settings remain appropriate. The sustained appreciation of the policy band will continue to dampen imported inflation and curb domestic cost pressures, thus ensuring medium-term price stability.</span></p>
<p><span>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span><span>MAS will therefore maintain the prevailing rate of appreciation of the S$NEER policy band. There will be no change to its width and the level at which it is centred.</span></span>&nbsp;MAS will closely monitor global and domestic economic developments, and remain vigilant to risks to inflation and growth.</span></p>

<title>China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) Bans Securities Lending During Restricted Periods</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/china-securities-regulatory-commission-csrc-bans-securities-lending-during-res/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/china-securities-regulatory-commission-csrc-bans-securities-lending-during-res/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In an effort to stabilize the country's stock markets, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has announced the suspension of lending restricted shares, effective from Monday. This move comes after recent sharp falls in the market and is part of a series of supportive policies implemented by Beijing.</p>
<p>Restricted shares, which are subject to limits on sale, are often offered to company employees or certain investors. However, they can be lent for trading purposes, putting additional pressure on markets during a downward trend.</p>
<p>The CSRC's decision aims to promote fairness and reasonableness, reduce the efficiency of securities lending, and level the playing field for investors. The regulator also intends to crack down on illegal activities that exploit securities lending to reduce holdings and cash out.</p>
<p>To further regulate the market, the CSRC will also limit the efficiency of securities lending in the securities refinancing market starting March 18.</p>
<p>Although the blue-chip CSI300 Index has seen some recovery, China's stock market continues to struggle. As a result, small Chinese investors are seeking alternatives to the domestic economy, driving up premiums on global index funds.</p>
<p>China's economy grew slightly above the government's target in 2023, but the recovery has been inconsistent. December data revealed weak consumption and a significant decline in home prices, indicating a deep crisis in the property market.</p>
<p>To align with the CSRC's measures, both the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges will suspend securities lending by strategic investors during lockup periods starting January 29.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), announced today her intention to appoint Ms. Ashlene van der Colff as Director of the Office of Internal Audit (OIA). Ms. van der Colff will succeed Ms. Nancy Onyango and is expected to take up her appointment on March 4, 2024.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am pleased to announce the appointment of Ashlene van der Colff as Director of the Office of Internal Audit,&rdquo; Ms. Georgieva said. &ldquo;I have informed the Executive Board of my intention to proceed with this appointment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ms. van der Colff, a South African national, brings to the Fund more than 22 years of collective experience in internal and external audit, risk management, operations, human resources, and information technology. For the past four years, she has been Chief Audit Executive of FirstRand Group&mdash;one of the largest financial services institutions in Africa&mdash;where she spearheaded the Group&rsquo;s internal audit functions across its businesses in Africa and the United Kingdom, and sites in India, Mauritius, and the United States.</p>
<p>Prior to the FirstRand Group, Ms. van der Colff was Chief Operating Officer for Momentum Metropolitan Holdings Group (MMH), an insurance and investment firm. She held other key positions at MMH over a four-year period, beginning in 2016 as Chief Audit Executive where she set the strategic direction for internal audit functions across MMH entities in Africa.</p>
<p>Before joining MMH, Ms. van der Colff served for two years at the South Africa-based Liberty Holdings Limited as Divisional Director of Operations. Ms. van der Colff began her career in 2003 at KPMG&rsquo;s Cape Town office and became an Audit Partner within five years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ashlene joins the Fund at a critical time when our member countries are facing ever-evolving shocks and risks. With her deep expertise in financial risk management and reputation as a strategic thinker and strong people manager, I am confident that she will provide excellent leadership to OIA and uphold its high standards,&rdquo; added Ms. Georgieva.</p>
<p>Ms. van der Colff holds an honors degree in financial accounting, commerce, and a bachelor degree in social sciences, as well as post-graduate diplomas in financial accounting and tax laws from the University of Cape Town. She is also a Chartered Accountant, a member of the Institute of Internal Auditors of South Africa, and was an accredited audit partner to the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.</p>
