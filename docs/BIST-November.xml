I am joined today by Deputy Chair Sarah Court, and fellow Commissioners Kate O&rsquo;Rourke, Alan Kirkland and Simone Constant, as well as Greg Yanco, Chief Executive Officer, Chris Savundra in his new role of Executive Director, Enforcement and Compliance, Calissa Aldridge, Executive Director, Markets and Peter Dunlop, our Chief Financial Officer.</p>
<p>We appreciate the Committee&rsquo;s interest in the topics you have provided us ahead of this hearing, and I&rsquo;ll make a few short remarks in relation to some of these.</p>
<h2>ASIC&rsquo;s enforcement</h2>
<p>You asked us for an update on our enforcement work.</p>
<p>ASIC has had some important regulatory firsts in recent months, including the first win in a&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-173mr-asic-s-first-greenwashing-case-results-in-landmark-11-3-million-penalty-for-mercer/#:~:text=In%20a%20landmark%20case%20for,of%20its%20superannuation%20investment%20options." title="24-173MR ASIC&rsquo;s first greenwashing case results in landmark $11.3 million penalty for Mercer">greenwashing civil penalty action</a>, the first infringement notice issued to a market operator, and our first civil action against the ASX. We are taking strong action against market manipulation. We laid charges in an&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-161mr-charges-laid-in-alleged-telegram-pump-and-dump-conspiracy-following-asic-investigation/?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj91LuT3I-JAxVWXWwGHZGaHz8QFnoECBcQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fasic.gov.au%2Fabout-asic%2Fnews-centre%2Ffind-a-media-release%2F2024-releases%2F24-161mr-charges-laid-in-alleged-telegram-pump-and-dump-conspiracy-following-asic-investigation%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw1pouAXw_PYxN3lLKoRQYaS&amp;opi=89978449" title="24-161MR Charges laid in alleged Telegram &lsquo;pump and dump&rsquo; conspiracy following ASIC investigation">alleged &lsquo;pump and dump&rsquo; conspiracy</a>&nbsp;that used the messaging platform Telegram, with the defendants facing a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment and a fine of over $1 million. During our investigation ASIC took the unprecedented step of posting messages in the Telegram chat room to warn traders they may be breaking the law by seeking to organise stock price manipulation.</p>
<p>And we are pursuing large corporations. In September, ASIC&rsquo;s action resulted in&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2023-releases/23-260mr-anz-penalised-15-million-for-misleading-customers-about-available-funds/" title="23-260MR ANZ penalised $15 million for misleading customers about available funds">ANZ being ordered to pay a $15 million penalty for misleading customers</a>&nbsp;about funds being available for withdrawal without incurring fees. Last month the Full Federal Court dismissed ANZ&rsquo;s appeal against the judgment, and upheld the original finding that that ANZ breached continuous disclosure laws when undertaking a $2.5 billion institutional share placement in 2015.</p>
<p>Following an ASIC investigation, the&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-211mr-macquarie-bank-fined-a-record-4-995m-for-serious-market-gatekeeper-failure/#:~:text=Following%20an%20ASIC%20investigation%2C%20the,ever%20imposed%20by%20the%20MDP." title="24-211MR Macquarie Bank fined a record $4.995m for serious market gatekeeper failure">Markets Disciplinary Panel (MDP) issued Macquarie Bank a record $4.995 million</a>&nbsp;fine for its failure to prevent suspicious orders being placed on the electricity futures market.</p>
<p>Last week we commenced court proceedings alleging&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-234mr-asic-alleges-qbe-misled-customers-over-pricing-discounts/" title="24-234MR ASIC alleges QBE misled customers over pricing discounts">QBE Insurance Limited misled its customers</a>&nbsp;about the value of discounts offered on certain general insurance products.</p>
<p>And on Wednesday we commenced&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-243mr-asic-sues-oak-capital-alleging-unconscionable-conduct-designed-to-avoid-the-national-credit-code/?altTemplate=betanewsroom" title="24-243MR ASIC sues Oak Capital alleging unconscionable conduct designed to avoid the National Credit Code">proceedings against Oak Capital, for conduct we argue was unconscionable</a>&nbsp;and designed to avoid consumer protections under the National Credit Code.</p>
<p>ASIC has more enforcement action due over the coming months targeting behaviour that has been detrimental to customers and the market.</p>
<h2>Update on ASIC investigation in relation to ANZ&rsquo;s role in AOFM bonds</h2>
<p>Since February 2024, ASIC has been investigating suspected contraventions by ANZ in its role as joint lead manager and risk manager on an issuance of $14 billion 10-year Australian government Treasury Bonds conducted on 19 April 2023 by the Australian Office of Financial Management. Our investigation is continuing.</p>
<p>We recognise the investigation continues to attract significant public and media interest. To preserve the integrity of the investigation, it is not appropriate to provide ongoing commentary on the investigation.</p>
<p>Our investigation concerns suspected market manipulation and contraventions of a number of provisions of the ASIC Act and the Corporations Act. In August 2024, we expanded our investigation to include suspected contraventions relating to errors in ANZ&rsquo;s reporting of secondary bond market turnover data to the AOFM.</p>
<p>We are giving this investigation the highest priority given the seriousness of the alleged misconduct and the potential for the alleged conduct to impact the interest payments of the Commonwealth on the bonds issued and therefore Australian taxpayers.</p>
<p>As we have said previously, we expect to form an internal view in the first quarter of 2025 about the suspected contraventions and whether any enforcement action should be taken.</p>
<h2>Our AI work</h2>
<p>In addition to the information provided in our submission, this week we released a report on our review of&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-798-beware-the-gap-governance-arrangements-in-the-face-of-ai-innovation/" title="REP 798 Beware the gap: Governance arrangements in the face of AI innovation">AI use by retail financial services and credit providers</a>, where we found the maturity of governance and risk management practices is not keeping up with the nature and scale of AI use.</p>
<p>It is clear that work needs to be done - and quickly - to ensure governance is adequate for the potential surge in consumer-facing AI.</p>
<h2>ASX CHESS replacement</h2>
<p>We continue to focus on our ASX supervision. We have reflected on our supervisory approach and have carefully considered the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations in its April 2024 Report on its inquiry into CHESS Replacement. We are enhancing our capability and expertise on technology delivery, change programs, and our overall supervisory expertise.</p>
<p>In our submission to the Committee, we noted ASX has changed the status of the CHESS replacement project from green to amber. ASX reported that this is due to delays in the product acceptance testing and the data platform build for CHESS replacement.</p>
<p>It is critical that risks are actively identified by ASX, managed and tracked, and appropriately escalated. It is important that ASX&rsquo;s risk culture requires and supports the transparent identification, reporting and escalation of risks. The replacement of CHESS is ultimately the responsibility of ASX.</p>
<p>ASIC has taken short term steps to enhance our monitoring of the CHESS replacement project, and ASIC and the RBA are closely monitoring ASX&rsquo;s governance arrangements for the CHESS Replacement program to ensure ASX manages the risks associated with the implementation.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, in August we commenced proceedings in the&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-177mr-asic-sues-asx-for-alleged-misleading-statements/" title="24-177MR ASIC sues ASX for alleged misleading statements">Federal Court against ASX for allegedly making misleading statements related to the CHESS replacement project</a>. ASX&rsquo;s statements go to the heart of trust in the integrity of our markets. When these fall short, the consequences in the market can be wide-ranging.</p>
<p>ASIC will not hesitate to take further regulatory action, including the use of our new powers under both the FMI reforms legislation and competition in clearing and settlement legislation, to hold ASX accountable for the CHESS replacement project and meeting stakeholder and community expectations.</p>
<h2>Quality of audit</h2>
<p>In addition to the information in our submission, this week we published our&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-240mr-asic-releases-fy-2023-24-financial-reporting-and-audit-report-and-launches-auditor-independence-surveillance/?altTemplate=betanewsroom" title="24-240MR ASIC releases FY 2023&ndash;24 financial reporting and audit report and launches auditor independence surveillance">annual integrated report on financial reporting and audit surveillance</a>. Our review identified improvements needed across audit approaches and financial reporting, resulting in financial adjustments of $1.88 billion and outlined ASIC&rsquo;s audit-related enforcement outcomes.</p>
<p>We recognise this committee&rsquo;s work and recommendations concerning auditing profession&rsquo;s approach to conflicts of interest. We are continuing to evolve our approach to this work. This week ASIC wrote to almost 3000 registered company auditors and the CEOs of six large auditing firms advising that we are commencing a review into auditors&rsquo; adherence with independence and conflict of interest obligations under the Corporations Act.</p>
<p>You can expect we will use our compulsory information-gathering powers where we identify an issue. It may also extend to seeking information about the systems and controls relied upon in audit engagements to ensure compliance with independence and conflicts of interest requirements.</p>
<h2>Public and private markets</h2>
<p>As a modern, confident, and ambitious regulator, we work proactively to identify and respond to developments that could affect the integrity of this system, or impact consumers and investors. Our efforts have ensured Australia has remained one of the cleanest listed equity markets in the world for the past decade, where Australian companies can do business with certainty, and Australians can be confident to invest.</p>
<p>As this Committee would know, public listings have been on the decline. At the same time, private markets globally have experienced significant growth. There are estimates that global private capital assets under management are over USD$14&nbsp;trillion &ndash; triple a decade ago. This is an estimate as there are gaps in the data to size and monitor this sector. Australian private capital funds have also experienced significant growth and are becoming an increasingly important source of funding for our economy. Major superannuation funds have over 20% of their assets invested privately.</p>
<p>This year we have been leading a conversation with market participants about the role of public and private markets. The Commission has been involved in a range of panels and roundtables recently, examining the changing dynamic between public and private markets, including the growth of superannuation, to ensure they continue to deliver good outcomes for consumers and support the efficiency of our capital markets. I would be happy to discuss these in further detail.</p>
<p>In coming weeks, we will release a discussion paper, along with ASIC-commissioned research which explores the current state of Australia&rsquo;s financial markets.</p>
<h2>ASIC&rsquo;s transformation journey</h2>
<p>Last week at a separate hearing I reflected on ASIC&rsquo;s journey of growth and transformation across the past three years, including the most significant organisational redesign of the agency in 15 years.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s transformation as an agency has continued to deliver results, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>enhanced collaboration across teams with quicker times for matters to progress to enforcement and compliance action</li>
<li>improved data analytics and surveillance capabilities, underpinned by our long-term approach to becoming a leading, digitally enabled and data-informed regulator, and</li>
<li>strengthened engagement with external stakeholders to listen to their views and set clear expectations of those we regulate.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will have seen our recent announcements about key appointments to our senior executive leadership team. Following an international search, Peter Soros will be joining ASIC in November as Executive Director Regulation and Supervision. And as you would have noted from the introductions, Chris Savundra has been appointed to the role of Executive Director Enforcement and Compliance, effective from Monday this week.</p>
<p>We will continue to focus on ASIC&rsquo;s transformation, including a strong focus on backing our dedicated people, and investing in data, systems and technology.</p>
<p>I am optimistic about ASIC&rsquo;s future. Our renewed Executive Leadership Team and focus on building a strong culture will set the agency up to evolve and respond to new challenges in our operating environment and to the threats and harms that emerge.</p>
<p>We look forward to answering the Committee&rsquo;s questions.</p>

<title>JP Morgan Affiliates To Pay $151 Million To Resolve SEC Enforcement Actions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> enforcement actions, SEC, JP Morgan, violations, penalties
Summary: JP Morgan affiliates charged by SEC for misleading disclosures, fiduciary duty breach, and prohibited transactions, leading to penalties and voluntary payments. <br><br> <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (JPMS) and J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc. (JPMIM) &ndash; both affiliates of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JP Morgan) &ndash; in five separate enforcement actions for failures including misleading disclosures to investors, breach of fiduciary duty, prohibited joint transactions and principal trades, and failures to make recommendations in the best interest of customers.</p>
<p>Without admitting or denying the findings in the SEC&rsquo;s orders, the two affiliates agreed to pay more than $151 million in combined civil penalties and voluntary payments to investors to resolve four of the &shy;actions. The SEC did not impose a penalty in one of the actions, taken against JPMS, because JPMS cooperated in the investigation and undertook remedial measures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;JP Morgan&rsquo;s conduct across multiple business lines violated various laws designed to protect investors from the risks of self-dealing and conflicts of interest,&rdquo; said Sanjay Wadhwa, Acting Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;With today&rsquo;s settlements, which include multiple self-reports and large voluntary payments to harmed investors, JP Morgan is being held accountable for its regulatory failures.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Conduit Private Funds Action (JPMS)</span></p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that JPMS made misleading disclosures to brokerage customers who invested in its &ldquo;Conduit&rdquo; private funds products, which pooled customer money and invested it in private equity or hedge funds that would later distribute to the Conduit private funds shares of companies that went public. The order finds that, contrary to the disclosures, a JP Morgan affiliate exercised complete discretion over when to sell and the number of shares to be sold. As a result, investors were subject to market risk, and the value of certain shares declined significantly as JP Morgan took months to sell the shares. As part of the resolution of this enforcement action, JPMS agreed to make a voluntary payment of $90 million to more than 1,500 Conduit investor accounts and to pay a civil penalty of $10 million, which will also be distributed to Conduit investors.</p>
<p>In addition to imposing the civil penalty, the SEC&rsquo;s order finds that JPMS violated Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act and imposes a cease-and-desist order and a censure. The order notes that JPMS, through counsel, self-reported to SEC staff that certain investors had complained as a result of the failure to promptly sell certain shares. The investigation was conducted by Ming Ming Yang, David Zetlin-Jones, Brian Fitzpatrick, and Lee A. Greenwood of the Asset Management Unit.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Portfolio Management Program Action (JPMS)</span></p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that, between July 2017 and October 2024, JPMS failed to fully and fairly disclose the financial incentive it and some of its financial advisors had when they recommended JPMS&rsquo;s own Portfolio Management Program over third-party managed advisory programs offered by JPMS. During the relevant period, assets under management in the program&rsquo;s strategies grew from approximately $10.5 billion to more than $30 billion.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that JPMS violated Sections 206(2) and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-7 thereunder and imposes a cease-and-desist order, censure, and a $45 million penalty. The investigation was conducted by Jessica Neiterman, Marie DeBonis, John Farinacci, Virginia M. Rosado Desilets, and Brianna Ripa of the Asset Management Unit with assistance from trial attorney Rua Kelly of the Boston Regional Office.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Clone Mutual Funds Action (JPMS)</span></p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that, between June 2020 and July 2022, JPMS recommended certain mutual fund products, called Clone Mutual Funds, to its retail brokerage customers when materially less expensive ETF products that offered the same investment portfolios were available. According to the order, when recommending the Clone Mutual Funds, JPMS and its registered representatives failed to consider these cost differences and failed to have a reasonable basis to believe that their recommendations were in the best interest of the customers. The order finds that approximately 10,500 customers made approximately 17,500 purchases of the Clone Mutual Funds during this period based on JPMS&rsquo;s recommendations.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that JPMS violated Regulation Best Interest and imposes a cease-and-desist order and a censure. The SEC did not impose a civil penalty because JPMS promptly self-reported the issue to SEC staff, conducted an internal investigation, provided substantial cooperation, and, among other remedial measures, voluntarily repaid impacted customers approximately $15.2 million. The investigation was conducted by Emmy E. Rush and Steven G. Rawlings of the New York Regional Office, with the assistance of Mr. Farinacci.</p>
<p><span>Joint Transactions Action (JPMIM)</span></p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that, in March 2020, JPMIM caused $4.3 billion in prohibited joint transactions, which advantaged an affiliated foreign money market fund for which it served as the delegated portfolio manager over three U.S. money market mutual funds it advised.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that JPMIM caused violations of Section 17(d) of the Investment Company Act and Rule 17d-1 thereunder and imposes a cease-and-desist order and a $5 million civil penalty. The investigation was conducted by Salvatore Massa, Brian Kudon, Mr. Fitzpatrick, and Mr. Greenwood of the Asset Management Unit.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Principal Trades Action (JPMIM)</span></p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that, between July 2019 and March 2021, JPMIM engaged in or caused 65 prohibited principal trades with a combined notional value of approximately $8.2 billion. Principal trades are generally prohibited to avoid undisclosed conflicts of interest unless certain conditions are met or the SEC provides exemptive relief. The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that, to conduct these trades, a JPMIM portfolio manager directed an unaffiliated broker-dealer to buy commercial paper or short-term fixed income securities from JPMS, which JPMIM then purchased on behalf of one of its clients.<a name="_Hlk174345426"></a></p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that JPMIM caused JPMS to violate Section 17(a)(1) of the Investment Company Act, violated Sections 206(3) and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-7 thereunder, and caused certain clients to violate Rule 38a-1 of the Investment Company Act.&nbsp;The order imposes a cease-and-desist order, a censure, and a $1 million civil penalty. The order notes that, upon learning about the principal trades, JPMIM notified the SEC staff and promptly provided documents, communications, and other information on a voluntary basis. The investigation was conducted by Mr. Massa, Mr. Kudon, Mr. Fitzpatrick, and Mr. Greenwood of the Asset Management Unit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Conduit Private Funds, Portfolio Management Program, Joint Transactions, and Principal Trades actions were supervised by Andrew Dean and Corey Schuster, Co-Chiefs of the Asset Management Unit. The Clone Mutual Funds action was supervised by Sheldon L. Pollock, Associate Regional Director in the New York Regional Office.</p>

<title>Report On U.S. Portfolio Holdings Of Foreign Securities At Year-End 2023</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/report-on-us-portfolio-holdings-of-foreign-securities-at-year-end-2023/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/report-on-us-portfolio-holdings-of-foreign-securities-at-year-end-2023/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>The findings from the annual survey of U.S. portfolio holdings of foreign securities at year-end 2023 were released today and posted on the Treasury web site at <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/data/treasury-international-capital-tic-system/tic-forms-instructions/us-claims-on-foreigners-from-holdings-of-foreign-securities" title="https://home.treasury.gov/data/treasury-international-capital-tic-system/tic-forms-instructions/us-claims-on-foreigners-from-holdings-of-foreign-securities">https://home.treasury.gov/data/treasury-international-capital-tic-system/tic-forms-instructions/us-claims-on-foreigners-from-holdings-of-foreign-securities</a></p>
<p>The survey was undertaken jointly by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A complementary survey measuring foreign portfolio holdings of U.S. securities also occurs annually.&nbsp;Data from the most recent such survey, which reports on securities held at end-June 2024, are being processed.&nbsp;Preliminary results are expected to be reported on February 28, 2025.</p>
<h3>Overall Results</h3>
<p>This survey measured the value of U.S. portfolio holdings of foreign securities at year-end 2023 as approximately $15.3 trillion, with $11.5 trillion held in foreign equity, $3.4 trillion held in foreign long-term debt securities (original term-to-maturity in excess of one year), and $0.4 trillion held in foreign short-term debt securities.&nbsp;The previous such survey, conducted as of year-end 2022, measured U.S. holdings of approximately $14.0 trillion, with $10.3 trillion held in foreign equity, $3.3 trillion held in foreign long-term debt securities, and $0.4 trillion held in foreign short-term debt securities.&nbsp; The increase in U.S. holdings in 2023 was mainly in equity (see Table 1).</p>
<p>U.S. portfolio holdings of foreign securities by country at the end of 2023 were the largest for the Cayman Islands ($2.7 trillion), followed by the United Kingdom ($1.5 trillion), Canada ($1.4 trillion), and Japan ($1.2 trillion) (see Table 2).&nbsp; These four countries attracted 44 percent of total U.S. portfolio investment, the same as the previous year.<br />This survey is part of the International Monetary Fund&rsquo;s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey, an effort to improve the measurement of portfolio asset holdings.</p>

<title>CFTC Warns Of Potential Dangers For Messaging App Users</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-warns-of-potential-dangers-for-messaging-app-users/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-warns-of-potential-dangers-for-messaging-app-users/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission&rsquo;s Office of Customer Education and Outreach today released a customer advisory alerting messaging app users to beware of schemes to defraud them of assets, specifically crypto assets.</p>
<p>Fraudsters are exploiting the default settings of commonly used messaging apps, telephone networks, and mobile devices to lure users into crypto&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/beware_virtual_currency_pump_dump.html">pump-and-dump schemes</a>&nbsp;and other scams.</p>
<p>The customer advisory,<i>&nbsp;Use Caution Responding to Messaging Apps</i>, informs users of the default settings of WhatsApp, Telegram, and other popular messaging apps that allow scammers to add random or targeted phone numbers to group chats that are used for fraudulent activity. Similarly, default SMS text settings on smart phones allow for a greater number of spam texts that can result in fraud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People who use these apps may not be familiar with the risks and frauds commonly associated with crypto assets,&rdquo; said Melanie Devoe, director of the CFTC&rsquo;s Office of Customer Education and Outreach. &ldquo;Receiving a&nbsp;group message promising 300% or 1,000% returns with zero risk or getting in on a supposed crypto opportunity, can be enticing, but it is best to not engage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The customer advisory, provides easy actions app users should take if they receive a message from an unfamiliar person or number saying &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve been added to a messaging app&rsquo;s group chat&rdquo;:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not reply.</li>
<li>Delete the messages or group discussions, block the senders and send text messages to junk or forward it to&nbsp;7726 (SPAM).</li>
<li>Change your privacy settings to protect your information and reduce future spam.</li>
<li>Most apps, mobile carriers and devices provide ways to restrict who may contact you or block specific numbers. Check each messaging apps&rsquo; settings. Next, check your carrier&rsquo;s account app settings, and your device settings. Many major carriers also offer free SMS spam-blocking or call filtering apps that can be added to your phone.</li>
</ul>
<p>About the Office of Customer Education and Outreach</p>
<p>OCEO is dedicated to helping customers protect themselves from fraud or violations of the Commodity Exchange Act through the research and development of effective financial education materials and initiatives. OCEO engages in outreach and education to retail investors. The office also frequently partners with federal and state regulators as well as consumer protection groups. The CFTC&rsquo;s full repository of customer education materials can be found at:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect">cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect</a>.</p>
<p><i>Customer Advisory: Use Caution Responding to Messaging Apps is available in full below and&nbsp;</i><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/MessagingApps.html"><i>HERE</i></a><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p align="center"><i>###</i></p>
<p>Customer Advisory: Use Caution Responding to Messaging Apps</p>
<p>Fraudsters are contacting potential victims on their phones to try to lure them into cryptocurrency scams with promises of guaranteed returns. Spot the fraud by remembering all trades involve a risk of loss. Be suspicious of any messages you receive via WhatsApp, Telegram, SnapChat, WeChat, SMS texts, or other apps that promise guaranteed oversized returns. If you receive a suspicious message:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not reply.</li>
<li>Delete the messages or group discussions and block the senders. Send text messages to junk.</li>
<li>Review your privacy settings to protect your information and reduce future spam.</li>
</ul>
<p>Deception in the Palm of Your Hand</p>
<p>By default, messaging apps allow anyone with your phone number to call or add you to a discussion group. Scammers use this vulnerability to add random or targeted phone numbers to WhatsApp groups or Telegram chats. You might see a message that you&rsquo;ve been added to a group, then other messages follow. They might talk about trading crypto futures with leverage, &ldquo;cooperative trading projects&rdquo; (also called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/digitalassetfrauds">pump-and-dump schemes</a>), 100, 500, 1,000 percent profits,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/AITradingBots.html">advanced artificial intelligence</a>, can&rsquo;t-miss investment&nbsp;<i>programs</i>, or other supposed opportunities. You might also see testimonials from other group members. It&rsquo;s all fake, lies designed to steal your money.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t Talk to Strangers</p>
<p><i>Stranger danger&nbsp;</i>applies to your mobile device too. Responding or complaining confirms to scammers that your number is active and will only lead to more fraud attempts. The same is true for answering unknown callers. Scammers sometimes use robocalls to identify working numbers.</p>
<p>Caller ID can be easily faked. If you don&rsquo;t recognize the phone number, or message sender, do not respond. If you receive an urgent message about a financial account, or from law enforcement,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/Beware_Imposters">the CFTC</a>, or other government agencies, visit the entity&rsquo;s official website and confirm the message with customer service staff. Do not use phone numbers or links provided in the message.</p>
<p>You should only trade futures with regulated individuals and firms that follow strict qualification, supervision, and customer protection requirements. Learn more about registration at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/check">cftc.gov/check</a>. Taking financial advice from unregistered, random people online or trading with unregistered companies that don&rsquo;t have a physical presence in the United States substantially increase your fraud risk.</p>
<p>Tighten your Security</p>
<p>Most apps let you adjust your privacy settings to only allow your contacts or specific numbers to message you or see your personal information, including your picture, location, and activity status. Check and adjust your settings in each app you use. Delete unwanted groups, block the admins, and report the groups and admins to the platform.</p>
<p>For SMS and phone messages, check your carrier&rsquo;s apps and account settings. Most major carriers offer free SMS spam and call blockers. Next, adjust phone and message settings on your device, including blocking unwanted callers or silencing spam calls. Activate options to filter unknown senders and junk. If you have the option to &ldquo;delete and report junk,&rdquo; use it. If not, forward unwanted messages to 7726 (SPAM). Both options help filter and block bad actors systemwide.</p>
