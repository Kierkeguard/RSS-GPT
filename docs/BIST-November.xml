<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p><span style="font-size: 11px;">Good afternoon.</span></p>
<p>Thank you, Emma, for that kind introduction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an honour to attend this year&rsquo;s Tokenisation Summit. I&rsquo;d like to congratulate City and Financial Global for bringing us together here today. You&rsquo;ve produced an exciting agenda and impressive cast list, across both industry and the regulatory communities.</p>
<p>It was with a great sense of responsibility that I accepted the Prime Minister&rsquo;s offer to become Economic Secretary to the Treasury following the general election in July.</p>
<p>Because as the Chancellor said last week, the financial services sector is the jewel in the crown of our economy. It is at the centre of our economic vision, and our plan for economic growth.</p>
<p>One of this sector&rsquo;s biggest strengths has always been its willingness to embrace innovation.</p>
<p>This summit is proof that that spirit of innovation is alive and well. And it&rsquo;s arguably more important now than ever before.</p>
<p>If we are to maintain the UK&rsquo;s position as a leading financial services hub, we need to lean in to the emerging and disruptive technologies that could change our industry dramatically in the coming years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll focus today on just one of those &ndash; namely, distributed ledger technology &hellip;</p>
<p>The transformative potential of DLT is clear, whether you are talking about cryptoassets &ndash; and I will cover our approach to regulating those later &ndash; or how it might revolutionize traditional markets through tokenisation and the development of other digital assets.</p>
<p>I know it will take time for it to become clear exactly how the sector can make the most of the capabilities this technology provides.</p>
<p>And I want to say at the outset that actively supporting that process is a priority for me in this role&hellip; &nbsp;as we seek to find the right balance between giving firms regulatory certainty, while ensuring the sector has the space and flexibility to develop the solutions that will have the most impact.</p>
<h3 id="digital-assets">DIGITAL ASSETS</h3>
<p>Let me talk a little about the work we are already doing, starting with digital assets.</p>
<p>In January of this year, my party published its &lsquo;Financing Growth&rsquo; paper, setting out what our plans for financial services would be in office.</p>
<p>This included our ambition to make the UK a global hub for securities tokenisation, through initiatives such as exploring UK sovereign debt issuance using DLT, and taking forward financial market infrastructure sandboxes.</p>
<p>And since the election, I am pleased to say we have made progress on both fronts.</p>
<p>On 30 September, the Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority jointly opened the Digital Securities Sandbox. This pioneering initiative will help the sector to adopt DLT across our capital markets, and is the product of effective collaboration between industry, government and the regulators.</p>
<p>By making temporary modifications to legislation and regulator rules, the sandbox enables participating firms to innovate: creating entirely novel platforms through which securities can be created, traded, and settled on distributed ledgers. Transactions in the sandbox are real transactions, conducted in a live environment, with close monitoring by the regulators.</p>
<p>The Digital Securities Sandbox is a fantastic example of what we can achieve when government, regulators and industry work together. I hope participation in it will encourage and foster greater innovation amongst firms looking to use DLT across our capital markets.</p>
<p>Last week, the Chancellor announced, in her Mansion House speech, that the government will issue a Digital Gilt Instrument, referred to as &lsquo;DIGIT&rsquo;. &nbsp;as I set out to Parliament, this pilot issuance will take place in the Digital Securities Sandbox. This pilot will allow the government to explore first-hand the benefits that DLT could bring to the debt issuance process, as well as stimulating the wider development of DLT platforms and infrastructures across UK capital markets.</p>
<p>This is a hugely significant milestone, one which demonstrates our support for DLT innovation and signifies that the UK intends to lead the world in digital assets adoption.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to engaging the sector on what technology options are available to facilitate such an issuance.</p>
<p>The Sandbox and DIGIT complement other work happening to support this agenda, including the Digital Assets Bill the government has introduced into Parliament, that clarifies the law around property in relation to digital assets, and the great work underway to look at innovation in areas such as funds, being taken forward by the Technology Working Group established by the Asset Management Taskforce.</p>
<h3 id="the-big-picture">THE BIG PICTURE</h3>
<p>But, of course, we can&rsquo;t talk about tokenisation without also talking about cryptoassets &ndash;</p>
<p>After all, it was through cryptoassets that the potential for widespread application of blockchain technology was proven.</p>
<p>And it is clear that cryptoassets are here to stay. The number of people that own crypto is rising year-on-year, in the UK and globally. And of course, in the last couple of weeks developments in the US have led to a big surge in cryptoasset markets.</p>
<p>But it is important that we don&rsquo;t see traditional financial services and cryptoassets as two wholly separate islands with no means of crossing between.</p>
<p>If we are truly going to get this right in the UK, we must recognise that is not simply a case of financial firms lifting the technology developed through crypto and applying it to their own purposes.</p>
<p>Rather, we should understand that traditional finance and cryptoassets have the potential to play an integrated role in each other&rsquo;s future, to their mutual advantage.</p>
<p>To give one example, the tokenisation of securities could facilitate so called &lsquo;atomic settlement&rsquo; where payment for a security and its transfer of ownership happen simultaneously.</p>
<p>However, realisation of this in its most efficient form requires a settlement instrument that also runs on the blockchain.</p>
<p>Today the only meaningful proposition for such a settlement function is stablecoins. However, in future this role could also potentially be fulfilled in future by tokenised versions of central bank or even commercial bank money.</p>
<p>Which brings me on to the government&rsquo;s plans for regulating cryptoassets, including stablecoin, in the UK.</p>
<h3 id="cryptoasset-regulation">CRYPTOASSET REGULATION</h3>
<p>I know that firms with an interest in the future regulatory treatment of cryptoassets have been eager for news.</p>
<p>And I thank you for your patience.</p>
<p>In October of last year, the Treasury published detailed proposals for the financial services regulation of cryptoassets in the UK.</p>
<p>Those proposals included the creation of various new regulated activities for cryptoassets, such as operating a cryptoasset trading platform, as well as associated regimes for both admissions to trading and market abuse.</p>
<p>I can confirm that those proposals still stand, and that the government intends to implement them in full.</p>
<p>At the point when those proposals were published last year, the Treasury also set out details for the treatment of fiat-referenced stablecoins as a distinct asset class.</p>
<p>This included a new regulated activity for issuance of stablecoins in the UK, as well as safeguarding requirements in line with the custody of other cryptoassets.</p>
<p>The proposals also included making changes to UK payments regulations to ensure consumers had adequate protections when using stablecoins for retail payments.</p>
<p>The approach for regulating stablecoin was developed in the context of propositions that stood to scale very quickly in the retail space.</p>
<p>And so, the UK responded to this, much like other jurisdictions did.</p>
<p>However, that &lsquo;big bang&rsquo; moment in retail payments did not come, and the market has continued to evolve in a more organic way.</p>
<p>How stablecoin will best make its mark in the future remains a live question, and there are potential opportunities on both the retail and the wholesale side.</p>
<p>I said earlier that it was critical to get the balance right between regulatory certainty so firms can invest in the UK, but also provide sufficient space for innovation.</p>
<p>That means not regulating innovative propositions such that they become restricted to specific use-cases, when the market might find further, equally valid use-cases in future.</p>
<p>So, with this in mind &ndash;</p>
<p>The government intends to proceed with the new regulated activities for stablecoin, which will be implemented to the same timetable as the rest of the regulatory regime for cryptoassets. Doing everything in a single phase is simpler, and it just makes more sense.</p>
<p>The regulated activity for stablecoin issuance will ensure that the Financial Conduct Authority can properly manage stablecoin specific risks, most notably those associated with management of the backing assets.</p>
<p>This approach also ensures the UK is in line with the recommendations of expert international bodies such as the Financial Stability Board.</p>
<p>However, the government does not intend to bring stablecoin into UK payments regulation at this time. Such an approach would place additional regulatory burdens on certain stablecoin activities in a way that would not be proportionate based on the current use cases.</p>
<p>Please be assured that whilst it has seemed quiet, work has not stopped over recent months,</p>
<p>And we aim to engage firms on draft legal provisions for the cryptoasset regime including stablecoins as early as possible next year.</p>
<p>Finally, I know that uncertainty over whether cryptoasset staking services constitute a Collective Investment Scheme under financial services law has impacted the provision of these services in the UK.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make sense for staking services to have this treatment,</p>
<p>So I can confirm that the Government intends to proceed with removing this legal uncertainty accordingly.</p>
<p>The heavy lifting has been done, so we&rsquo;re full steam ahead on this now.</p>
<p>To be clear, that doesn&rsquo;t mean there aren&rsquo;t risks to consumers from these services.</p>
<p>However, they are better accounted for within the forthcoming cryptoasset regulatory regime,</p>
<p>And in the meantime, existing regulatory requirements should apply where appropriate, as they do for other cryptoasset services &ndash; for example requirements to ensure financial promotions are fair, clear, and not misleading.</p>
<p>In conclusion, thank you again to City and Financial Global for organising this fantastic summit and for inviting me here today to speak to you all.</p>
<p>If we are going to truly unlock the best of what tokenisation, blockchain technology, and cryptoassets have to offer in the UK,</p>
<p>Then we need to tie the threads together properly.</p>
<p>That means recognising and facilitating the opportunities for traditional markets and cryptoassets to succeed to their mutual benefit.</p>
<p>It also means ensuring a coherent joined-up approach across UK authorities, so that firms have the certainty to invest and grow, as well as the space and flexibility to innovate.</p>
<p>I hope that, together, we can successfully harness the full potential on offer for the UK in this regard, in contribution to the broader growth and success of the economy.</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing the outcomes of today&rsquo;s summit and to further engagement with you all.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>IOSCO conducted a targeted implementation review (the&nbsp;<strong>Review</strong>) of five Selected Principles, Principle 9, 12, 14, 15, and 16 that aim to address excessive commodity market volatility, over-the-counter (<strong>OTC</strong>) derivatives transparency and orderly functioning of the commodity derivatives markets. IOSCO views that an appropriate implementation of the Selected Principles would help mitigate the impact of external factors which may disrupt commodity markets, as recently experienced.</p>
<p>The Report sets out IOSCO&rsquo;s recommendations to its members for improving the implementation of specific elements of the Selected Principles, as well as the intention to conduct further work in the OTC markets area.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Fine</strong>, Chair of the IOSCO Committee on Derivatives (Committee 7), said:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;The need to enhance the resilience of the commodities market remains a priority for regulators globally. The recommendations included in this report can help IOSCO members to implement the Principles and enhance the resilience of their markets&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>IOSCO continues to follow the evolution of Post Trade Risk Reduction Services (PTRRS). While PTRRS provide certain clear benefits, such as the reduction of risk and improved efficiency, the offering and increased use of PTRRS may also present challenges for over-the-counter (OTC) market participants. These include risks relating to control and governance around algorithms, fair treatment of participants, data protection, legal certainty, and operational resilience.</p>
<p>The Final Report on Post Trade Risk Reduction Services highlights potential policy considerations and risks associated with using and offering of PTRRS and presents seven sound practices in this area as guidance to IOSCO members and regulated users of PTRRS.</p>
<p>The seven sound practices cover the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transparency, governance, comprehensibility and fairness of the algorithm;</li>
<li>Operational risk;</li>
<li>Data integrity and security and regulatory data;</li>
<li>Legal certainty;</li>
<li>Considerations of potential counterparty risk by IOSCO members and PTRRS users;</li>
<li>Market concentration and competition;</li>
<li>Standardization and predictability of runs and file formats.</li>
</ul>
<p>The sound practices are designed to improve and complement existing market practices.</p>
<p>The Final Report reflects the results of the public consultation launched on 26 January 2024<sup>(6)</sup>&nbsp;which received valuable feedback from stakeholders</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Fine</strong>, Chair of the IOSCO Committee on Derivatives (Committee 7), said:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;The use of PTRRS continue to grow, as market participants try to improve the efficiency in the way they use OTC derivatives. These Good Practices are a set of important tools which will help mitigate the potential risks identified in our analysis.&rdquo;</em></p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Fines Barclays £40 Million</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has fined Barclays &pound;40 million in total for its failure to disclose certain arrangements with Qatari entities in 2008.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p><span>This follows Barclays' decision to withdraw its referral of the FCA's planned action to the Upper Tribunal. The action was based on findings which included that Barclays' conduct in its October 2008 capital raising was reckless and lacked integrity - the FCA's earlier press release is linked in the notes below. The FCA notes Barclays&rsquo; statement on this matter.</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA first issued warning notices against Barclays in 2013. The case was paused pending criminal proceedings brought by the Serious Fraud Office. It was restarted following the dismissal of proceedings against Barclays and the acquittal of the other parties.</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA published decision notices setting out its case against Barclays in October 2022 and Barclays chose to refer the case to the Upper Tribunal, which is independent from the FCA and hears appeals against enforcement cases. The FCA had previously decided to impose a fine of &pound;50 million in total.</span></p>
<p><span>The events in 2008 were of national importance as banks sought emergency recapitalisation. The FCA has a primary objective to ensure market integrity. Banks should treat their obligations to the market and shareholders seriously.</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA welcomes the decision by Barclays to withdraw the reference of this case to the Upper Tribunal. The FCA recognises that this case concerns disclosure decisions made in the context of very large and complex capital raisings that took place many years ago under considerable market pressure.</span></p>
<p><span>Steve Smart, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA said:</span></p>
<p><span>'Barclays' misconduct was serious and meant investors did not have all the information they should have had. However, the events took place over 16 years ago and we recognise that Barclays is a very different organisation today, having implemented change across the business.</span></p>
<p>'<span>It is important that listed firms provide investors with the information they need.'</span></p>
<h2><span>Background</span></h2>

<li><span>Final notices:</span><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/final-notices/barclays-plc-2024.pdf" title="barclays-plc-2024.pdf"><span>&nbsp;Barclays plc</span></a><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/final-notices/barclays-bank-plc-2024.pdf" title="barclays-bank-plc-2024.pdf"><span>Barclays Bank plc</span></a></li>

<li><span>None of the current Barclays Board or senior management were involved in the events described in the Final Notices. The most recent executive leadership, with the support of the current Barclays Board, has made significant progress in implementing changes to Barclays' systems and controls.</span></li>

<ul>
<li>The total market capitalization of the Equities Market at the end of the third quarter of 2024 was RUB 53.61 trln. Fees from the Equities Market grew by 10.3% on the back of a similar increase in trading volumes, which gained 10.7%. Over 3.8 million clients were active every month during the quarter.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Fees and commissions from the Bond Market grew 24.7% on the back of an increase in trading volumes (excluding overnight bonds) of 19.5%, which was largely driven by the elevated primary market activity. The effective fee improved due to a higher share of primary market in total trading volumes. Primary market trading volumes (excluding overnight bonds) went up 37.1%, while the secondary trading volumes increased by just 1.5%. The supply of floating-rate issues propped up the primary market. However, floating-rate bonds have a lower trading velocity in the secondary market compared to fixed-rate bonds. Secondary trading of OFZs was down 26.4%; other bonds&rsquo; volumes were up 39.6%.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Money Market fee income improved by 18.1% while trading volumes added 28.5%. The discrepancy between fees and volumes was mainly attributable to the increase of less marginable non-CCP repo and deposit segments&rsquo; share in the volumes&rsquo; mix. The effective fee was also negatively affected by the decrease in average overall on-exchange repo terms. The GCC repo segment benefits from the rising demand for Russian-law money market ETFs. More than 1 million clients have already invested in Russian-law money market ETFs.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Fee income from the Depository and Settlement Services was down 3.6%. Average value of assets under custody grew by 3.7%. The discrepancy between growth rates of fee income and assets on deposit is the result of business lines beyond safekeeping, primarily clearing and collateral management services, which reflect repo operations at the NSD. These two lines demonstrated negative performance, which was only partially compensated by the increase in safekeeping fee income.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Derivatives Market fees grew by 16.6%, trading volumes barely changed, adding just 0.9%. The volumes&rsquo; mix changed towards higher value-added derivative contracts on commodities and equities, which had a positive effect on the effective fee. Specifically, commodity derivatives&rsquo; volumes surged by 85.2%. The volumes of single-stock contracts improved by 28.1%. On the other hand, FX derivative contracts decreased by 31.8% in trading volumes.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Information sales decreased by 42.1%. Sales of software and technical services were up by 10.6% because of a rise in demand for these products. Listing and other services increased by 23.2% as activity on the primary bond and equities markets remained strong during the quarter. Finuslugi revenues improved by 71.1% to RUB 780.7 mln with deposit segment performing particularly well. Other fee income grew by 121.8% on the back of the NCC tariff model update related to precious metals market as well as launch of new products.</li>

<p>(Excerpt)</p>
<p>(Friday, November ８, 2024, 11:43&nbsp;am to 11:57&nbsp;am)</p>
<dl><dt>Q.</dt><dd>
<p>I will ask you about the arrest of a former employee of Nomura Securities, Co., Ltd. on suspicion of attempted robbery and murder and arson. Regarding this case, there is a suspicion that the suspect had talked about an investment scheme to the husband and wife victims and had them prepare a large amount of money in advance. What do you think of such malicious intentions taking advantage of the status as an employee of a securities company? If there is any policy for Financial Services Agency(FSA)&rsquo;s&nbsp; measures against the company, could you also explain that?</p>
</dd><dt class="ans">A.</dt><dd>
<p>I may have said this earlier, but I will refrain from making any comments on individual cases. However, I know that Nomura Securities, Co., Ltd. published its responses to the case you mentioned on November 6, and that specific measures are described therein.<br />I think it important for the company to implement those measures with surety, and the FSA will closely watch and confirm that process.</p>
</dd></dl><dl><dt>Q.</dt><dd>
<p>One more thing regarding Nomura Securities, Co. Ltd. Is it correct that the FSA has issued an order to request reporting to the company?</p>
</dd><dt class="ans">A.</dt><dd>
<p>I have not made any comments specifically regarding the FSA's responses to individual cases.</p>

<title>Artificial Intelligence In The Financial System, Federal Reserve Governor Michelle W. Bowman,At The 27th Annual Symposium On Building The Financial System Of The 21st Century: An Agenda For Japan And The United States, Washington, D.C.</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/artificial-intelligence-in-the-financial-system-federal-reserve-governor-michel/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/artificial-intelligence-in-the-financial-system-federal-reserve-governor-michel/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-8">
<p>Discussions of artificial intelligence (AI) inevitably center on two main points: risks and benefits.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241122a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;Both of these can be frustratingly vague and amorphous. Proponents of AI project its widespread adoption will be as momentous as the industrial age&mdash;radically improving efficiency, increasing labor productivity, and changing the world economy. Skeptics largely focus on the risks, noting that it may introduce new and unpredictable variables into the economy and the financial system, including new forms of cyber-risk and fraud.</p>
<p>It would be impossible to predict what the future holds for AI, or how its use and impact will evolve over time. But as the technology continues to mature, as new use cases evolve, and it is rolled out more broadly, we will almost certainly be surprised by how it is ultimately used.</p>
<p>Looking at the financial industry-specific implications of AI, it is helpful to consider not only how it may change the financial system, but also how regulatory frameworks should respond to this emerging technology. Are the existing frameworks sufficient? If not, how can regulators best balance the risks AI may pose to bank safety and soundness and financial stability with the need to allow for continued innovation?</p>
<p>Broader availability of generative AI and large language models have created headlines and spiking stock prices, but the financial services sector has been using AI for some time.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241122a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;Over time, it has become clear that AI's impact could be far-reaching, particularly as the technology becomes more efficient, new sources of data become available, and as AI technology becomes more affordable.</p>
<p><strong>Do We Need a Definition of AI?</strong><br />Before discussing the implications of AI and regulatory policy approaches, we should ask whether we need a definition of AI. As it has advanced, the number and variety of definitions used to define AI have expanded.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241122a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;Some definitions focus on the algorithms&mdash;like the use of machines to learn and reason in a way that simulates human intelligence. Others focus on the outputs&mdash;the ability to perform complex tasks normally done by humans. In 2021, an interagency request for information from federal banking regulators, including the Federal Reserve, sought comment on banks' use of AI, but notably avoided using any single definition. Instead, this request listed a few possible use cases, features, and forms. These included the use of structured and unstructured data; the use of alternative data sources; voice recognition and natural language processing; the algorithmic identification of patterns and correlations in training data to generate predictions or categorizations; and "dynamic updating," where an algorithm has the capacity to update without human intervention.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241122a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a></p>
<p>While each definition of AI may serve its own purpose in the context of how it is used, any single narrow definition can be criticized. A more generic definition runs the risk of oversimplifying the range of activities, use cases, and underlying technology. A definition that captures the variability of AI technology in a more granular way runs the risk of being unwieldy in its length, and obsolete in the short-term as new forms and use cases emerge.</p>
<p>Within this definitional question&mdash;of whether and how you define AI&mdash;lies a more important policy question: Specifically, for what purpose is a definition required? In the context of the financial system, the definition of AI may help to delineate how the regulatory system addresses it and establishes the parameters for how it can be used by regulated institutions. Other specific contexts could also be included, like third-party service providers that support banks or other financial services providers, or use by regulators in support of their mandates.</p>
<p>A definition helps regulators and regulated institutions understand the activities that are subject to rules and requirements by defining the scope. While this definitional question is important to establish clarity about the scope of what constitutes AI, it can also distract us from a more important point&mdash;what is the appropriate policy framework to address the introduction and ongoing use of AI in the financial system?</p>
<p>I have no strong feelings about the ideal or optimal definition of AI, and some version of the many definitions floating around are probably adequate for our purposes. At a minimum though, a definition must establish clear parameters about what types of activities and tools are covered. But before leaving the topic, I want to offer a cautionary note. A broad definition of AI arguably captures a wider range of activity and has a longer "lifespan" before it becomes outmoded, and potentially never becomes outdated. But a broad definition also carries the risk of a broad&mdash;and undifferentiated&mdash;policy response. This vast variability in AI's uses defies a simple, granular definition, but also suggests that we cannot adopt a one-size-fits-all approach as we consider the future role of AI in the financial system.</p>
<p><strong>Innovation and Competitiveness</strong><br />Knowing that the technology and use of AI continues to evolve leads to the question of how it should be viewed by regulators, particularly in light of the need for innovation and the effect on competition.</p>
<p><strong>Innovation</strong><br />AI tools have the potential to substantially enhance the financial industry. In my view, the regulatory system should promote these improvements in a way that is consistent with applicable law and appropriate banking practices.</p>
<p>One of the most common current use cases is in reviewing and summarizing unstructured data. This can include enlisting AI to summarize a single report or to aggregate information from different sources on the same or related topics. The AI "output" in these cases may not directly produce any real-world action, but it provides information in a more usable way to assist a human. AI use cases like this may present opportunities to improve operational efficiency, without introducing substantial new risk into business processes. In some ways, the joining of AI outputs with a human acting as a "filter" or "reality check" can capture efficiency gains and control for some AI risks. Similarly, AI can act as a "filter" or "reality check" on analysis produced by humans, checking for potential errors or biases.</p>
<p>AI tools may also be leveraged to fight fraud. One such use is in combatting check fraud, which has become more prevalent in the banking industry over the last several years. In a recent report, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network noted that from February to August of 2023, there were over 15,000 reports received related to check fraud, associated with more than $688 million in transactions (including both actual and attempted fraud).<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241122a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;The growth in check fraud over the past several years has caused significant harm not only to banks and the perceived safety of the banking system but also to consumers who are the victims of fraudulent activity. The regulatory response to help address this growing problem has unfortunately been slow, lacking in coordination, and generally ineffective.</p>
<p>Could AI tools offer a more effective way for banks to fight against this growing fraud trend? We already have some evidence that AI tools are powerful in fighting fraud. The U.S. Treasury Department recently announced that fraud detection tools, including machine learning AI, had resulted in fraud prevention and recovery totaling over $4 billion in fiscal year 2024, including $1 billion in recovery related to identification of Treasury check fraud.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241122a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;While the nature of the fraud may be different in these cases, we should recognize that AI can be a strong anti-fraud tool and provide significant benefits for affected bank customers.</p>
<p>If our regulatory environment is not receptive to the use of AI in these circumstances customers are the ones who suffer. AI will not completely "solve" the problem of fraud&mdash;particularly as fraudsters develop more sophisticated ways to exploit this technology. But it could be important if the regulatory framework provides reasonable parameters for its use.</p>
<p>Another often-discussed use case for AI in financial services is in expanding the availability of credit. AI is not the first technology with potential to expand access to credit for the "un-" or "underbanked." We have long viewed alternative data as a potential opportunity for some consumers, like those with poor or no credit history but with sufficient cash flow to support loan repayment.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241122a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a></p>
<p>AI could be used to further expand this access, as financial entities mine more data sets and refine their understanding of creditworthiness. Of course, we also know that using AI in this context&mdash;in a way that has more direct impact on credit decisions affecting individual customers&mdash;also presents more substantial legal compliance challenges than other AI use cases.</p>
<p>AI also has promise to improve public sector operations, including in regulatory agencies. As I have often noted, the data relied on to inform the Federal Open Market Committee decision-making process often is subject to revisions after-the-fact, requiring caution when relying on the data to inform monetary policy.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241122a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;Perhaps the broader use of AI could act as a check on data reliability, particularly for uncertain or frequently revised economic data, improving the quality of the data that monetary policymakers rely on for decision-making. Additional data as a reliability check or expanded data resources informed by AI could improve the FOMC's monetary policymaking by validating and improving the data on which policymakers rely.</p>
<p>While these use cases present only a subset of the possibilities for the financial system, they illustrate the breadth of potential benefits and risks of adopting an overly cautious approach that chills innovation in the banking system. Over-regulation of AI can itself present risks by preventing the realization of benefits of improved efficiency, lower operational costs, and better fraud prevention and customer service.</p>
<p><strong>Effect on Competition</strong><br />The regulatory approach and framework can also promote competition in the development and use of AI tools in the financial system.</p>
<p>An overly conservative regulatory approach can skew the competitive landscape by pushing activities outside of the regulated banking system or preventing the use of AI altogether. Inertia often causes regulators to reflexively prefer known practices and existing technology over process change and innovation. The banking sector often suffers from this regulatory skepticism, which can ultimately harm the competitiveness of the U.S. banking sector.</p>
<p>In the United States, we often think about the financial system based on the regulatory "perimeter." We view institutions within the scope of federal banking regulation (banks and their affiliates) as being "in the perimeter," while entities that operate under other regulatory frameworks (including money transmitters licensed under state law) are "outside the perimeter." Of course, the global financial system includes institutions that operate on a cross-border basis, and tools and approaches often permeate throughout the financial system once they have been deployed successfully in some other part of the system. But we know that the regulatory perimeter is permeable, and there is always the risk that activity pushed outside the perimeter can transmit risk back into the system even as the activities garner less scrutiny and regulation than banks. Put differently, the overly conservative approach may present only a fa&ccedil;ade of safety, masking underlying risks to the financial system and those who rely on it.</p>
<p>Of course, there are risks to being overly permissive in the AI regulatory approach. As with any rapidly evolving technology, supervision of its use should be nimble. Its users must make sufficient risk-management and compliance investments to conduct activities in a safe and sound manner, and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. While the banking system has generally been cautious and deliberate in its AI development and rollout, others have not. When left improperly managed and unmonitored, it can result in unintended outcomes and customer harm. For example, certain generative AI models have been known to generate nonsensical or inaccurate outputs, sometimes called "hallucinations." In some cases, AI hallucinations have not involved significant harm, for example when discovered in a testing environment without customer-facing implications.</p>
<p><strong>The Sufficiency of Existing Regulatory Tools</strong><br />While helpful to acknowledge the risks of over-regulation and under-regulation, we must understand our currently regulatory stance&mdash;what tools do we have to promote AI's benefits while helping to mitigate the risks? To address this topic, we should widen the lens to consider our approach to innovation broadly. Supporting innovation in the financial system can and should apply to the introduction and use of AI.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241122a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a></p>
<p>When we consider AI risks, many of these are already well-covered by existing frameworks. For example, AI often depends on external parties&mdash;cloud computing providers, licensed generative AI technologies, and core service providers&mdash;to operate. AI can also pose model risks in the banking context, with associated data management and governance concerns. AI can also impact a bank's cyber-resiliency as AI-related fraud tools become more widespread and more anti-fraud tools become available.</p>
<p>While AI may be on the frontier of technology, it does not operate outside the existing legal and regulatory framework. AI is not exempt from current legal and regulatory requirements, nor is its use exempt from scrutiny. This is particularly true with AI; its use must comply with current laws and regulations, including fair lending, cyber security, data privacy, third-party risk management, and copyright. And when AI is deployed in a bank, an even broader set of requirements may apply depending on the use case.</p>
<p>Regulators are often playing "catch-up" with banks at the forefront of innovation. As a result, they often suffer from significant disadvantages in terms of understanding how the technology works, understanding the uses of AI within financial institutions, and keeping up-to-date with the latest AI developments. Of course, further compounding this challenge is that much of the work in AI innovation occurs far outside the banking system, including in the development and testing of generative AI models and in compiling the data sources on which to train the models.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges&mdash;and the understandable regulatory instinct to limit its use in the financial system&mdash;we must avoid this temptation. A few general principles should govern a coherent regulatory approach, which are the same principles that I apply to innovation generally.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241122a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a></p>
<p>First, we must understand AI before we consider whether and how to change our regulatory approach. With respect to various internal use cases, the Board has published a compliance program that governs artificial intelligence.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241122a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;One of the foundational elements for a successful approach to AI, and one mentioned in this plan, is the development and acquisition of staff expertise.</p>
<p>Many banks have increased AI adoption to an expanding number of use cases. As this technology becomes more widely adopted throughout the financial system, it is critical that we have a coherent and rational policy approach. That starts with our ability to understand the technology, including both the algorithms underlying its use and the possible implications&mdash;both good and bad&mdash;for banks and their customers.</p>
<p>In suggesting that we grow our understanding and staff expertise as a baseline, I acknowledge that this has been, and is likely to remain, a challenge. The Federal Reserve and other banking regulators compete for the same limited pool of talent as private industry. But we must prioritize improving our understanding and capacity as this technology continues to become more widely adopted.</p>
<p>Second, we must have an openness to the adoption of AI. We need to have a receptivity to the use of this technology and know that successful adoption requires communication and transparency between regulated firms and regulators. One approach regulators can use to reframe questions around AI (and innovation generally) is to adopt a posture that I think of as technology agnosticism.</p>
<p>We should avoid fixating on the technology, and instead focus on the risks presented by different use cases. These risks may be influenced by a number of factors, including the scope and consequences of the use case, the underlying data relied on, and the capability of a firm to appropriately manage these risks. Putting activities together may be a helpful way to get a sense of broad trends (for example, the speed of AI adoption in the industry), but is inefficient as a way to address regulatory concerns (like safety and soundness, and financial stability). This may seem like an obvious point, but at times regulators have fallen prey to overbroad categorizations, treating a diverse set of activities as uniformly and equally risky.</p>
<p>This approach allows us to be risk-focused, much like we try to do with other forms of supervision, moderating intensity for low-risk activities, and increasing the intensity for higher-risk ones.</p>
<p>Of course, regulatory agencies do not operate in a vacuum, so we must also ask what type of coordination we need to ensure that we promote safe and sound adoption of AI, and address broader financial stability risks, both domestically and internationally. As a threshold matter, we need coordination both within each agency and among domestic regulators that play a role in the supervision and regulation of the financial system, which requires an environment of open sharing of information.</p>
<p>A posture of openness to AI requires caution when adding to the body of regulation. Specifically, I think we need a gap analysis to determine if there are regulatory gaps or blind spots that could require additional regulation and whether the current framework is fit for purpose. Fundamentally though, the variability in the technology will almost certainly require a degree of flexibility in regulatory approach.</p>
<p><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong><br />Before closing, I want to thank the organizers of this event for the invitation to address you this evening, and to thank the many speakers and participants who have contributed to the symposium.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence has tremendous potential to reshape the financial services industry and the broader world economy. While I have suggested in my remarks that we need not rush to regulate, it is important that we continue to monitor developments in AI and their real-world effects. In the long run, AI has the potential to impact many aspects of the Fed's work, from our role in supervising the payment system, to the important work we do promoting the safe and sound operation of banks and financial stability. AI may also play a growing role in monetary policy discussions, as the introduction of AI tools alter labor markets, affecting productivity and potentially the natural rate of unemployment and the natural rate of interest.</p>
<p>But as we engage in ongoing monitoring&mdash;and expand our understanding of AI technology and how it fits within the bank regulatory framework&mdash;I think it is important to preserve the ability of banks to innovate and allow the banking system to realize the benefits of this new technology.</p>

<title>SEC Announces Enforcement Results For Fiscal Year 2024 - Commission Saw Market Participants Respond To Its Efforts To Promote Culture Of Proactive Compliance</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-announces-enforcement-results-for-fiscal-year-2024-commission-saw-market-p/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-announces-enforcement-results-for-fiscal-year-2024-commission-saw-market-p/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it filed 583 total enforcement actions in fiscal year 2024 while obtaining orders for $8.2 billion in financial remedies, the highest amount in SEC history.</p>
<p>The 583 enforcement actions represent a 26 percent decline in total enforcement actions compared to fiscal year 2023. Of those cases, the Commission filed 431 &ldquo;stand-alone&rdquo; actions, which was 14 percent less than in the prior fiscal year; 93 &ldquo;follow-on" administrative proceedings seeking to bar or suspend individuals from certain functions in the securities markets based on criminal convictions, civil injunctions, or other orders, which was 43 percent less than the prior fiscal year; and 59 actions against issuers who were allegedly delinquent in making required filings with the SEC, which represented a decrease of 51 percent.</p>
<p>The $8.2 billion in financial remedies consisted of $6.1 billion in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, also the highest amount on record, and $2.1 billion in civil penalties, the second-highest amount on record. Approximately 56 percent of the $8.2 billion financial remedies ordered is attributable to a monetary judgment obtained following the SEC&rsquo;s jury trial win against Terraform Labs and Do Kwon, who were charged with one of the largest securities frauds in U.S. history.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Division of Enforcement is a steadfast cop on the beat, following the facts and the law wherever they lead to hold wrongdoers accountable,&rdquo; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. &ldquo;As demonstrated by this year&rsquo;s results, the Division helps promote the integrity of our capital markets to benefit investors and issuers alike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fiscal year 2024, the Division continued to vigorously enforce the federal securities laws by recommending to the Commission high-impact enforcement actions addressing noncompliance throughout the securities industry and resulting in robust financial remedies,&rdquo; said Sanjay Wadhwa, Acting Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;At the same time, market participants across the spectrum &ndash; from public companies to major broker-dealers and advisory firms &ndash; stepped up efforts to self-report, remediate, and meaningfully cooperate with our investigations, answering our call to foster a culture of compliance. What our numbers do not reflect, however, are countless investigations that may not have resulted in an enforcement action for evidentiary or other reasons, or where we declined to pursue an enforcement action, but that shined a spotlight on potentially problematic conduct and caused responsible market participants to cease engaging in it. All of this adds up to protecting innumerable investors and promoting trust in our capital markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The varied enforcement actions recommended by the Division in fiscal year 2024 demonstrate the Division keeping pace with emerging threats presented by misstatements regarding artificial intelligence, fraudsters using social media to perpetuate relationship scams, and more, while maintaining its focus on evergreen investor risks such as material misstatements, deficient internal controls, and major gatekeeper failures,&rdquo; said Sam Waldon, Acting Deputy Director of the Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;I could not be prouder of the dedicated and talented staff of the Division of Enforcement who work tirelessly to hold wrongdoers accountable, promote compliance, and help promote investor trust in the markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition, in fiscal year 2024, the SEC obtained orders barring 124 individuals from serving as officers and directors of public companies, the second-highest number of such bars obtained in a decade.</p>
<p>In fiscal year 2024, the SEC distributed $345 million to harmed investors, marking more than $2.7 billion returned to investors since the start of fiscal year 2021. The SEC also received 45,130 tips, complaints, and referrals in fiscal year 2024, the most ever received in one year, including more than 24,000 whistleblower tips, more than 14,000 of which were submitted by two individuals. The SEC issued whistleblower awards totaling $255 million.</p>
<p><span>Crediting Market Participants Who Practice Proactive Compliance</span></p>
<p>In fiscal year 2024, market participants including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/admin/2024/34-100934.pdf">public companies</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/admin/2024/ia-6719.pdf">investment advisers</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/admin/2024/34-101143.pdf">broker-dealers</a>&nbsp;self-reported or remediated securities law violations or otherwise cooperated meaningfully with the Division&rsquo;s investigations, answering the Division&rsquo;s call to practice a culture of proactive compliance. This included matters involving a range of alleged violations, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/admin/2024/34-100934.pdf">material misstatements</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/admin/2024/34-99483.pdf">fraud</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/admin/2024/34-101143.pdf">recordkeeping violations</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/admin/2024/34-100365.pdf">controls failures related to cybersecurity</a>.</p>
<p>In response, the Division recommended, and the Commission approved, resolutions imposing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-144">reduced civil penalties</a>&nbsp;or even&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/admin/2024/34-100934.pdf">no civil penalties,</a>&nbsp;including in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/admin/2024/34-101493.pdf">cases involving very large firms.</a></p>
<p><span>Proactive Initiatives Addressing Widespread Noncompliance</span></p>
<p>To help promote investor trust in the securities market, the Division continued and commenced a number of proactive initiatives to address issues of widespread noncompliance, including the following:</p>
<p><span>Off-Channel Communications</span></p>
<p>The Division continued its initiative to ensure that regulated entities, including broker-dealers, investment advisers, and credit ratings agencies, comply with the recordkeeping requirements of the federal securities laws. Compliance with those requirements is essential to investor protection and well-functioning markets. In fiscal year 2024, the Commission brought&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/wadhwa-remarks-securities-enforcement-forum-110624#_ftnref4">recordkeeping cases</a>&nbsp;resulting in more than $600 million in civil penalties against more than 70 firms, including the Commission&rsquo;s first cases charging&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-132">recordkeeping violations against municipal advisors</a>. Since December 2021, the initiative has resulted in charges against more than 100 firms and more than $2 billion in penalties.</p>
<p><span>Marketing Rule</span></p>
<p>The Enforcement Division&rsquo;s ongoing initiative investigating non-compliance with the Marketing Rule resulted in settled charges against more than a dozen investment advisers. The firms were charged for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-46">advertising hypothetical performance</a>&nbsp;to the general public without adopting and implementing policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that the hypothetical performance was relevant to the likely financial situation and investment objectives of the advertisement&rsquo;s intended audience; using untrue or unsubstantiated statements of material fact and/or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-121">testimonials, endorsements, or third-party ratings</a>&nbsp;that lacked required disclosures; and advertising&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/admin/2024/ia-6628.pdf">misleading performance</a>&nbsp;that was not fair and balanced.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Whistleblower Protection Cases</span></p>
<p>In fiscal year 2024, the Division recommended, and the Commission authorized, a series of settled enforcement actions to address violations of the Dodd-Frank whistleblower protection rule, which prohibits market participants from taking any action to impede would-be whistleblowers from contacting the SEC, including where firms purported to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/admin/2024/34-99344.pdf">limit customers&rsquo; ability to voluntarily contact the SEC</a>&nbsp;or required employees to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-118">waive the right to a possible whistleblower monetary award</a>. The actions included an $18 million civil penalty against J.P. Morgan, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/admin/2024/34-99344.pdf">largest penalty</a>&nbsp;on record for a standalone violation of the whistleblower protection rule.</p>
<p><span>Disclosures of Holdings and Transactions by Insiders and Investment Managers</span></p>
<p>The federal securities laws require certain insiders and market participants to disclose their securities holdings and transactions. Compliance with those laws is essential for investors to make informed investment decisions.</p>
<p>In fiscal year 2024, the SEC announced&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-148">settled charges against more than two dozen entities and individuals</a>&nbsp;for failures to timely report information about their holdings and transactions in public company stock or for contributing to filing failures by their officers and directors. The SEC also settled&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-135">charges against 11 institutional investment managers</a>&nbsp;for failing to disclose certain securities holdings in reports they were required to file because they have discretion over more than $100 million in certain securities. &nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Robust Financial Remedies</span></p>
<p>In fiscal year 2024, the Division&rsquo;s investigations led to orders imposing robust financial remedies in litigated and settled matters.</p>
<p>For example, after a jury verdict&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-statement-040424">finding Terraform Labs and founder Do Kwon liable</a>&nbsp;for fraud, defendants&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/terraform-labs-pte-ltd-do-hyeong-kwon-final-judgment.pdf">agreed to a final judgment ordering them to pay more than $4.5 billion</a>&nbsp;in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties, the highest remedies ever obtained by the SEC following a trial.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission filed settled charges with strong financial remedies against:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-6">Morgan Stanley</a>&nbsp;for a multi-year fraud involving the disclosure of confidential information about the sale of large quantities of stock known as &ldquo;block trades.&rdquo; &nbsp;The firm agreed to pay approximately $166 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and an $83 million civil penalty to resolve the SEC&rsquo;s charges;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/administrative-proceedings/33-11302-s">FirstEnergy Corp.</a>&nbsp;for a multi-year political corruption scheme in which FirstEnergy and affiliates made payments to an entity controlled by a state legislator in exchange for official action benefitting FirstEnergy. FirstEnergy agreed to a pay a $100 million civil penalty to resolve the SEC&rsquo;s charges;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-4">SAP</a>&nbsp;for violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act arising out of bribery schemes in South Africa, Malawi, Kenya, Tanzania, Ghana, Indonesia, and Azerbaijan. The company agreed to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of more than $98 million to resolve the SEC&rsquo;s charges. Up to $59 million will be offset by payments from SAP to the South African government in connection with its parallel investigations into the same conduct; and</li>
<li><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-140">Advisory firm Macquarie</a>&nbsp;for overvaluing approximately 4,900 largely illiquid collateralized mortgage obligations held in 20 advisory accounts and for executing hundreds of cross trades between advisory clients that favored certain clients over others. The firm agreed to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $9.8 million and a $70 million civil penalty to resolve the SEC&rsquo;s charges.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Major Fraud</span></p>
<p>In fiscal year 2024, the Division continued to focus on holding individuals and entities accountable for preying on investors.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Division&rsquo;s investigations led to charges alleging frauds ranging from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-25928">Ponzi schemes targeting specific communities</a>&nbsp;to billion dollar frauds with thousands of victims;</li>
<li>The SEC charged Xue Lee (aka Sam Lee) and Brenda Chunga (aka Bitcoin Beautee) for their involvement in an allegedly&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-11">fraudulent crypto asset pyramid scheme known as HyperFund</a>&nbsp;that raised more than $1.7 billion from investors worldwide;</li>
<li>The SEC charged&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-95">Cynthia and Eddy Petion and their company, NovaTech Ltd.</a>, for allegedly operating a fraudulent scheme that raised more than $650 million in crypto assets from more than 200,000 investors worldwide;</li>
<li>The SEC charged&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023-245">five unregistered brokers and their companies</a>&nbsp;in connection with an alleged pre-IPO fraud scheme that raised at least $528 million from more than 4,000 investors around the world; and</li>
<li>The SEC charged&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-92">Abraham Shafi</a>, the founder and former CEO of Get Together Inc., a privately held social media startup known as &ldquo;IRL,&rdquo; for raising approximately $170 million from investors by allegedly fraudulently portraying IRL as a viral social media platform that organically attracted the vast majority of its purported 12 million users.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Emerging Technologies and Emerging Risks</span></p>
<p>Fiscal year 2024 saw heightened investor risk from emerging technologies and cybersecurity incidents and from market participants using social media to exploit elevated investor interest in emerging investment products and strategies. The Division kept pace, investigating noncompliance and false or misleading disclosures involving artificial intelligence, social media, cybersecurity, crypto, and more.</p>
<p><em>Artificial Intelligence</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The SEC charged&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-26083">QZ Asset Management</a>&nbsp;for allegedly falsely claiming that it would use its proprietary AI-based technology to help generate extraordinary weekly returns while promising &ldquo;100%&rdquo; protection for client funds; and</li>
<li>The SEC settled charges against investment advisers&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-36">Delphia and Global Predictions</a>&nbsp;with making false and misleading statements about their purported use of AI in their investment process.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Relationship Investment Scams</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The SEC&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-134">charged multiple entities and individuals</a>&nbsp;in connection with two relationship investment scams involving fake crypto asset trading platforms NanoBit and CoinW6. The SEC&rsquo;s two complaints allege that the defendants solicited investors via social media apps, lied to them to gain their trust and confidence, and then stole their money. These charges are the SEC&rsquo;s first enforcement actions alleging these types of scams.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Cybersecurity</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The SEC settled charges against&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-63">The Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. and nine wholly owned subsidiaries</a>, including the New York Stock Exchange, for failing to timely inform the SEC of a cyber intrusion as required by Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity;</li>
<li>The SEC settled charges against transfer agent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-101">Equiniti Trust Company LLC</a>, formerly known as American Stock Transfer &amp; Trust Company LLC, for failures to ensure that client securities and funds were protected against theft or misuse, which led to losses of millions of dollars in client funds; and</li>
<li>The SEC settled charges against&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-75">R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons</a>&nbsp;for disclosure and internal control failures relating to cybersecurity incidents.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Crypto</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The SEC settled charges against&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-82">Silvergate Capital</a>&nbsp;for false and misleading disclosures to investors about the strength of the Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering (BSA/AML) compliance program and the monitoring of crypto customers, including FTX, by its wholly owned subsidiary, Silvergate Bank; and</li>

</ul>
<p><span>Individual Accountability</span></p>
<p>Charging individuals for securities law violations, where appropriate, is essential for accountability and deterrence and for enhancing public trust in the markets. Fiscal year 2024 enforcement actions against individuals included the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Following a jury verdict&nbsp;finding&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-statement-040424">Terraform Labs and founder Do Kwon</a>&nbsp;liable&nbsp;for fraud, Do Kwon&nbsp;agreed to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/terraform-labs-pte-ltd-do-hyeong-kwon-final-judgment.pdf">final judgment</a>&nbsp;ordering him to pay financial remedies of more than $200 million and imposing an officer and director bar.&nbsp;</li>

<li>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-64">CEO of&nbsp;formerly registered investment adviser Mass Ave</a>&nbsp;settled charges arising out of false and&nbsp;misleading statements about Mass Ave&rsquo;s flagship fund.&nbsp;To settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges, the&nbsp;CEO,&nbsp;who is also the chief investment officer and portfolio manager at MassAve, agreed to pay a $250,000 civil penalty and was suspended for 12 months from industry-related work.</li>
<li>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-6">former head of Morgan Stanley&rsquo;s equity syndicate desk</a>&nbsp;settled charges connected to&nbsp;a&nbsp;multi-year fraud involving the disclosure of confidential information&nbsp;about the sale of large quantities of stock known as &ldquo;block trades.&rdquo;&nbsp;As part of the resolution, the former head agreed to an order requiring him to pay a $250,000 civil penalty and imposing associational, penny stock, and supervisory bars.</li>
<li>The SEC permanently suspended Benjamin Borgers, the managing partner of audit firm BF Borgers from appearing and practicing as an accountant before the Commission as part of a resolution of an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-51">alleged fraud affecting hundreds of SEC filings</a>.

They also agreed to pay civil penalties of $175,000 and $85,000, respectively; and</li>
<li>The SEC charged now-defunct digital pharmacy startup Medly Health&rsquo;s former CEO, former CFO, and former head of RX Operations with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-128">fraudulently overstating Medly&rsquo;s revenue</a>&nbsp;in connection with capital raising efforts that netted the company more than $170 million.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Gatekeepers</span></p>
<p>In fiscal year 2024, the Division investigated wide-ranging violations by gatekeepers, resulting in, among other actions, the above-mentioned charges against audit firm BF Borgers for a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-51">massive fraud</a>&nbsp;affecting more than 1,500 SEC filings &ndash; one of the largest ever wholesale failures by a gatekeeper &ndash; and settled charges against audit firm Prager Metis for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-133">hundreds of auditor independence violations</a>.</p>
<p><span>Public Company Misstatements</span></p>
<p>It is foundational to the proper operation of the securities markets that public companies provide materially accurate information to investors. In fiscal year 2024, the Division investigated misstatements by public companies leading to a number of enforcement actions, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Settled charges against&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-151">Cassava Sciences</a>&nbsp;for misleading statements about the results of a Phase 2 clinical trial for its purported therapeutic for the treatment of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease;</li>
<li>Settled charges against&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-94">Ideanomics</a>&nbsp;for misleading statements about the company&rsquo;s financial performance; and</li>
<li>Charges against former executives of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-131">Kubient</a>&nbsp;for their alleged roles in a scheme in which the company allegedly overstated and misrepresented its revenue in connection with public stock offerings.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Market Abuse/Safeguarding Material Nonpublic Information</span></p>
<p>The Division investigated market abuse and potential abuse of material nonpublic information (MNPI) in fiscal year 2024, including by using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-153">advanced data analytics and technology</a>. The Division&rsquo;s investigations resulted in enforcement actions addressing a range of violations, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Settled charges against&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-6">Morgan Stanley and the former head of its equity syndicate desk</a>&nbsp;with a multi-year fraud involving the disclosure of confidential information about the sale of large quantities of stock known as &ldquo;block trades;&rdquo;</li>
<li>Settled charges against&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/enforce/ia-6514-s">several</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-106">investment</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-158">advisers</a>&nbsp;for failing to establish, maintain, or enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent the misuse of MNPI;</li>
<li>Charges against former investment adviser representatives for conducting multi-year&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-26135">cherry-picking schemes</a>&nbsp;that allegedly defrauded their clients out of millions of dollars;</li>
<li>Charges against a U.K. citizen for allegedly&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-26141">hacking into the computer systems of public companies</a>&nbsp;to obtain material nonpublic information and using that information to make millions of dollars in illicit profits;</li>
<li>Charges against three individuals for allegedly perpetrating a multi-year&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-25967">$2 million &ldquo;free-riding&rdquo; scheme</a>, which is when a brokerage customer buys and sells securities without having the funds to pay for the trading; and&nbsp;</li>
<li>Settled&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-40">insider trading charges against a founder and former chair of a public company</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Investment Professionals</span></p>
<p>Market integrity requires investment professionals to meet their legal and professional obligations. In fiscal year 2024, the SEC brought several enforcement actions against investment professionals for alleged fraud and other securities law violations. Illustrative examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Settled charges against registered investment adviser&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-140">Macquarie for overvaluing approximately 4,900 largely illiquid collateralized mortgage obligations</a>&nbsp;held in 20 advisory accounts;</li>
<li>Settled charges against formerly registered investment adviser&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-64">Mass Ave Global for making false and misleading statements</a>&nbsp;to investors concerning its flagship opportunity fund&rsquo;s holdings and exposures;</li>
<li>An alleged&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-25917">$35 million fraud by real estate investment company ArciTerra</a>&nbsp;and its CEO; and</li>
<li>Settled charges against registered investment adviser&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-9">Aon Investments for misleading its client, the Pennsylvania Public School Employees&rsquo; Retirement System,</a>&nbsp;about the reason for a discrepancy between two different calculations of PSERS&rsquo;s investment returns.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Trial Highlights</span></p>
<p>The Division of Enforcement conducted five trials in federal district court in fiscal year 2024 and obtained favorable verdicts in each of them, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Division tried its first-ever crypto-related trial in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023-32">SEC v. Terraform Labs,</a>&nbsp;where the SEC charged the defendants with orchestrating a multi-billion-dollar crypto asset securities fraud involving crypto assets offered and sold as securities. &nbsp;&nbsp;Following a motion for summary judgment victory reaffirming the Commission&rsquo;s authority over crypto assets offered and sold as securities, a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-statement-040424">jury found Terraform Labs and founder Do Kwon liable</a>&nbsp;for fraud after less than two hours of deliberations following a nine-day trial. Following the verdict, the defendants&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-73">agreed to pay more than $4.5 billion</a>&nbsp;in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties; and</li>
<li>After an eight-day trial in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-25970">SEC v. Panuwat</a>, the jury found the defendant liable for insider trading in the first trial based on alleged insider trading in a peer company. The SEC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-25170">complaint alleged</a>&nbsp;that Panuwat used nonpublic information about an impending announcement of Pfizer Inc.&rsquo;s acquisition of his then-employer, Medivation, Inc., to trade in another correlated stock ahead of the news for his own enrichment. Rather than buying the securities of Medivation, Panuwat used the confidential information to purchase short-term, out-of-the-money call options of another comparable public company, Incyte Corporation.</li>

<title>Federal Reserve Announces College Fed Challenge Winners</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/federal-reserve-announces-college-fed-challenge-winners-4/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Princeton University won the 21st annual national&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/educational-tools/fedchallenge.htm">College Fed Challenge</a>&nbsp;on Friday, a team competition that encourages undergraduate students to learn about the U.S. economy, monetary policymaking, and the role of the Federal Reserve System. Teams analyze economic and financial conditions and formulate a monetary policy recommendation, modeling the Federal Open Market Committee. The team, from Princeton, New Jersey, represented the Philadelphia District and included Bracklinn Williams, Daniel Sozanski, Eleanor Clemans-Cope, Elliot Lee, William Neumann, Bijaan Noormohamed (alternate), and Manuel Garcia San Millan (alternate). The team's advisers were Alan Blinder, Carolyn Wilkins, and William Dudley.</p>
<p>This year's College Fed Challenge included&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/educational-tools/college-fed-challenge-participants.htm">119 schools</a>&nbsp;from across the nation. Each submitted video presentations or participated in local competitions last month. Eighteen semi-finalist teams then participated in question-and-answer sessions held earlier this month, and six finalists were selected to determine the winners. The other national finalists were Harvard College in second place and University of Virginia in third place. Teams with honorable mentions include University of Michigan, Pace University, and University of Miami.</p>
<p>"Fed Challenge gives undergraduate students a chance to learn about the Fed and monetary policy," said Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell. "Fed policymakers carefully consider incoming economic data and work together to determine the best policy to pursue our dual mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability. Through the Fed Challenge experience, students go through similar deliberations and gain a better understanding of the economy and the Fed's role in it."</p>
<p>Teams were evaluated on their economic analysis, responses to the judges' questions, teamwork, and presentations. The judges for the final round were Lisheng Su, lead risk management specialist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago; Brian Doyle, deputy director of the Board's Division of International Finance; and Robert Tetlow, a senior adviser in the Board's Division of Monetary Affairs.</p>
<p><em>Note: On November 22, 2024, Princeton University&rsquo;s alternate team members were added to the press release.</em></p>

<title>Federal Reserve Announces Additional Information About The Periodic Review Of Its Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, And Communications</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/federal-reserve-announces-additional-information-about-the-periodic-review-of-it/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Federal Reserve on Friday announced additional information about the periodic review of its monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications&mdash;the framework it uses to pursue its congressionally-assigned goals of maximum employment and price stability.</p>
<p>The review is focused on two specific areas: the Federal Open Market Committee's Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which articulates the Committee's approach to monetary policy; and the Committee's policy communications tools. The Committee's two percent longer-run inflation goal will not be a focus of the review.</p>
<p>"We are open to new ideas and critical feedback and will take onboard lessons from the last five years and adapt our approach where appropriate to best serve the American people, to whom we are accountable," said Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell.</p>
<p>Like the review that concluded in 2020, the upcoming review will include outreach and public events with a wide range of parties. As part of the outreach effort, the Federal Reserve Board will host a research conference on May 15-16, 2025, with speakers and panelists from outside the Federal Reserve System.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve will continue to host&nbsp;<em>Fed Listens</em>&nbsp;public events around the country, and discussions among Federal Reserve policymakers will begin with the January 28-29, 2025, FOMC meeting.</p>
<p>At the end of the process, policymakers will assess the information and perspectives gathered during the review and report their findings. The Fed's first review began in 2019 and concluded in summer 2020.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Jaime Liz&aacute;rraga has been such a dedicated public servant focused on the interests of working families for more than three decades. I&rsquo;ve had the privilege of working with Jaime multiple times: here at the SEC, previously when we both worked on needed reforms coming out of the 2008 financial crisis, and all the way back when we first met working together at the US Department of Treasury. In each phase of his career, he has been steadfastly focused on elevating the interest of everyday Americans. At the SEC, he has been an excellent partner in our work to protect investors, facilitate capital formation, and ensure markets work for investors and issuers alike.</p>
<p>Jaime has been a wonderful colleague but more than that, a friend. I wish Kelly, Jaime, and their entire family the very best.</p>

<title>SIFMA Statement On Issuance Of Revised No-Action Relief For SEC Rule 15c2-11</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sifma-statement-on-issuance-of-revised-no-action-relief-for-sec-rule-15c2-11/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sifma-statement-on-issuance-of-revised-no-action-relief-for-sec-rule-15c2-11/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>SIFMA today issued the following statement from president and CEO Kenneth E. Bentsen, Jr. on the issuance of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/investment/no-action/fixed-income-rule-15c2-11-no-action-letter-finra-112224.pdf" target="_blank">revised no-action relief</a>&nbsp;for SEC Rule 15c2-11:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Extending the 15c2-11 no-action relief is the right outcome and we commend the SEC for taking this approach.&nbsp; SIFMA has long held that rules need to be fit for purpose and designed thoughtfully.&nbsp; In this case, an equity-markets focused rule was ill-suited for application to the very different fixed income markets, and if the current no action relief that has allowed fixed income markets to continue to function effectively were to expire, these markets would have seen material disruption and investors would have been harmed through a reduction in liquidity and price transparency.&nbsp; If this rule is to be applied to fixed income markets, it needs to be revised through a public notice and comment process so that the Commission can design a rule that both protects investors and promotes, rather than impairs, the ability of fixed income markets to fund the consumer, business, and other credit creation that fuels our economy.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Cboe To Launch The First Cash-Settled Options Product Related To Spot Bitcoin, Beginning Monday, December 2</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cboe-to-launch-the-first-cash-settled-options-product-related-to-spot-bitcoin-b/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cboe-to-launch-the-first-cash-settled-options-product-related-to-spot-bitcoin-b/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul type="disc">
<li>The first cash-settled index options related to the price of spot&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Options are based on the new Cboe&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;U.S. ETF Index, designed to reflect the performance of spot&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;ETFs listed on U.S. exchanges</li>
<li>Options on standard and mini index, as well as FLEX options contracts, available at launch</li>
<li>Provides exposure to spot&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;price movements through options, expanding investor access to&nbsp;<span>crypto</span>&nbsp;derivatives</li>
</ul>
<p>Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe: CBOE), the world's leading derivatives and securities exchange network, today announced plans to launch the first cash-settled index options related to the price of spot&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;beginning Monday, December 2. Exclusively listed and traded on Cboe Options Exchange, these options will be SEC-regulated and based on the new Cboe&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;U.S. ETF Index (Ticker: CBTX).</p>
<p>The Cboe&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;U.S. ETF Index, jointly developed by Cboe Labs and Cboe Global Indices, is the market's first U.S. spot&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;ETF index. This modified market cap-weighted index is designed to track the performance of a basket of spot&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;ETFs listed in the U.S. Moreover, it is designed to correlate to the price of spot&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>, making it a representative measure of the asset.</p>
<p>Options on the Cboe&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;U.S. ETF Index will allow market participants to gain exposure to spot&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;ETFs &ndash; and indirectly to&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;itself &ndash; enabling them to capitalize on price movements, manage risk, and express their market views. These index options will be cash-settled, meaning positions are closed in cash at expiration, removing the complexities of physically delivering&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;ETFs. In addition to cash settlement, these index options will offer European-style exercise, meaning they are exercisable only on the expiration date, eliminating the risks of early assignment.</p>
<p>Alongside options on the standard-sized index, Cboe plans to offer Cboe Mini&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;U.S. ETF Index options<sup><sup>1</sup></sup>&nbsp;(Ticker: MBTX) at launch. At 1/10<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;the notional value of the standard options, these mini options aim to offer greater granularity and flexibility in managing basis risk as well as appeal to portfolios of varying sizes. Cboe also plans to offer cash-settled FLEX options on both the Cboe&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;U.S. ETF Index and the Cboe Mini&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;U.S. ETF Index, allowing traders to customize key contract terms such as exercise price, exercise style, and expiration date &ndash; potentially enabling traders to hold larger positions than typically allowed for using standard options contracts.</p>
<p>"Our new suite of options on the Cboe&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;U.S. ETF Index offers a timely and compelling solution for traders to efficiently gain exposure to spot&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>," said Rob Hocking, Global Head of Product Innovation at Cboe. "We expect the unique benefits of cash-settlement, combined with the availability of various index sizes and FLEX options, will give customers more flexibility in their trading strategies. Our index options offer a unique value proposition that we believe will appeal to both institutional participants and retail traders alike, who are looking to capitalize on or hedge against&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>'s price movements without directly holding the asset."</p>
<p>Cboe's new suite of options on the Cboe&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;U.S. ETF Index will further expand its digital assets derivatives offerings, which already include cash-settled&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;and Ether margin futures listed and traded on Cboe Digital Exchange that are expected to transition to Cboe Futures Exchange in the first half of 2025, pending regulatory review. In addition, Cboe's BZX Equities Exchange is a leading venue for spot U.S.&nbsp;<span>crypto</span>&nbsp;ETFs, listing the majority market share of spot&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;ETFs and spot Ether ETFs available for trading in the U.S.</p>
<p>Adam Inzirillo, Global Head of Data and Access Solutions at Cboe, said: "This latest initiative showcases the strength of Cboe's exchange ecosystem &ndash; from listing and trading spot&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;ETFs on our U.S. equities exchange, to generating data that drives index creation, and now launching innovative tradable products like Cboe&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;U.S. ETF Index Options. Our ability to leverage the full breadth of our platform to continually bring new solutions to market is a key differentiator for Cboe and a major benefit to our customers."</p>

<p>Yesterday evening, the Austrian financial community came together again for the annual Wiener B&ouml;rse Punsch. In the course of the evening, the Vienna Stock Exchange welcomed over 600 guests to the courtyard of the Palais Caprara-Geym&uuml;ller in a pre-Christmas atmosphere &ndash; it was the 22<span>nd</span>&nbsp;edition of the event. Traditional is also the charitable character of the event: regionally produced natural soaps were sold, the packaging of which was designed by people with disabilities under the guidance of the inclusion agency&nbsp;<a href="https://voifesch.com/ueber-uns/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">&ldquo;VOI fesch&rdquo;</a>. The entire revenue from the sale of the soaps went to the integrative education programme&nbsp;<a href="https://www.start-stipendium.at/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">&ldquo;START&rdquo;</a>. In addition, CEO Christoph Boschan and CFO Andrea Herrmann presented a cheque for EUR 10,000 to the educational project on behalf of the Vienna Stock Exchange.</p>

<title>ESMA Responds To The European Commission Consultation On Non-Bank Financial Intermediation (NBFI)</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor sent today its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-11/ESMA50-43599798-9960_ESMA_response_to_the_Macroprudential_review_consultation.pdf">response</a>&nbsp;to the European Commission (EC) consultation on assessing the adequacy of macroprudential policies for NBFI.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify">In its response to the consultation, ESMA makes key proposals in several areas, as follows:&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>Liquidity Management:&nbsp;</span>ESMA recognises the progress made with the revised Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities (UCITS) and the Alternative Investment Fund Manager (AIFM) Directives. This is especially the case with the provisions on liquidity management tools.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify">ESMA however still considers that there is a need to address some remaining issues concerning liquidity mismatches in open-ended funds (OEFs). In particular, competent authorities could require funds that invest in assets that are not liquid to be structured as closed-ended funds. This is why ESMA fully supports the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/12/revised-policy-recommendations-to-address-structural-vulnerabilities-from-liquidity-mismatch-in-open-ended-funds/">Recommendation of the Financial Stability Board</a>&nbsp;related to the classification of OEFs based on asset liquidity and calls for appropriate efforts to ensure the convergent and consistent application of these recommendations in the EU.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>Money Market Fund Regulation (MMF) Review:</span>&nbsp;ESMA reiterates its position on the necessity to complete the reform of the MMF Regulation, considering the vulnerabilities identified in its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/esma34-49-437_finalreportmmfreview.pdf">Opinion</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>Supervision and Data:</span>&nbsp;ESMA proposes to progress towards data driven supervision, first by harmonising the framework to analyse risks posed by investment funds (especially regarding liquidity risks), and second by developing an EU system-wide stress test across NBFI and the banking sector. These proposals imply having comprehensive and good quality data to assess financial stability risks. Supervisors also need enhanced data sharing, ensuring that ESMA and other authorities have all required information and avoiding unnecessary burden on reporting market participants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>Coordination:</span>&nbsp;ESMA suggests enhancing coordination between competent authorities by the creation of a formal reciprocation mechanism for leverage limits under the AIFMD. This mechanism would make national measures more effective by guarding against the potential for regulatory fragmentation or arbitrage across the EU. In addition, ESMA calls for the EC to consider granting ESMA the formal power to request the implementation of stricter macroprudential requirements by one or multiple national competent authorities, in order to address risks at EU-level.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Background</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify">On 22 May 2024, the EC launched a targeted consultation aimed at assessing the adequacy of macroprudential policies for NBFI, as a response to major events in recent years and the related financial stability concerns that have emerged.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Next Steps</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify">ESMA stands ready to further collaborate with the Commission on any of the proposals made in its response.&nbsp;</p>

<title>SEC: UPS To Pay $45 Million Penalty For Improperly Valuing Business Unit</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against United Parcel Service Inc. for materially misrepresenting its earnings because it failed to follow generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in valuing one of its worst performing businesses.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, UPS determined in 2019 that UPS Freight, a business unit that transported less-than-truckload shipments, was likely to sell for no more than about $650 million. GAAP required UPS to use the price it would receive to sell Freight in calculating whether it needed to write-down the value of the goodwill it had assigned to the business unit on its balance sheet. UPS&rsquo;s own analysis indicated that nearly $500 million of goodwill it had associated with Freight was impaired. Rather than use that analysis, however, UPS relied on an outside consultant&rsquo;s valuation of Freight without giving the consultant information necessary to conduct a fair valuation of the business. Using assumptions approved by UPS, which were clearly not ones a prospective buyer of Freight would make, the consultant estimated Freight was worth about $2 billion &ndash; three times as much as UPS had determined. On that basis, UPS did not record a goodwill impairment in 2019. Had UPS properly valued Freight, its earnings and other reported items would have been materially lower.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order also alleges that, in 2020, UPS entered into a non-binding term sheet to sell Freight for $800 million with adjustments to be made later that were likely to reduce the final price. Despite its own analysis and its entry into this term sheet, UPS relied again on a consultant&rsquo;s valuation of Freight in 2020 to support not impairing the business&rsquo;s goodwill. UPS also did not inform the consultant of the term sheet. As in 2019, the consultant relied on assumptions from UPS that were clearly not ones a prospective buyer would make. Like the prior year, had UPS properly valued Freight and impaired goodwill, its earnings and other reported items would have been materially lower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodwill balances provide investors with valuable insight into whether companies are successfully operating the businesses they own,&rdquo; said Melissa Hodgman, Associate Director. &ldquo;Therefore, it is essential for companies to prepare reliable fair value estimates and impair goodwill when required. UPS fell short of these obligations, repeatedly ignoring its own well-founded sale price estimates for Freight in favor of unreliable third-party valuations.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that UPS violated Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act, the reporting, book and records, internal accounting controls, and disclosure controls provisions of the Exchange Act, and various related rules. In addition to the civil penalty, UPS, without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, agreed to cease and desist from further violations of these provisions, adopt training requirements for certain officers, directors, and employees, and retain an independent compliance consultant to review and make recommendations about the company&rsquo;s fair value estimates and disclosure obligations.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation, which is continuing as to other parties, was conducted by Joseph Zambuto, Jr. and supervised by Assistant Director Rami Sibay.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span><span>We are delighted to announce that BMLL won &lsquo;Outstanding Market Data Services Provider - Equities&rsquo; at The TRADE&rsquo;s inaugural Leaders in Trading New York awards.<br /></span></span></p>
<p><span>These awards recognise the biggest achievers in a series of categories including Algorithmic Trading; Execution Management; Outsourced Trading; honouring top buy-side trading desks and other market participants in the Editors&rsquo; Choice category.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>BMLL won this award following a year of significant milestones and delivering on their ambitious strategic growth plans to democratise access to high-quality, historical data and analytics, at scale. This included building a US presence and growing the US team with the addition of Client Services, Sales Managers and Data Scientists.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>
<p><span>2024 milestones include:<br /></span></p>
<ul>
<li> <span>BMLL&rsquo;s historical market data coverage has reached 98% of the MSCI All Country World Index spanning global Equities, ETFs and Futures from 100+ trading venues, at Level 3 granularity.&nbsp;</span> </li>
<li> <span>In the last 12 months alone, BMLL added more than 40 data sets globally, including six years of nanosecond unconflated OPRA options data.</span> </li>
<li> <span>In October 2024 BMLL secured a $21 million strategic investment, in a round led by Optiver, with participation from CTC Venture Capital and existing investors. Optiver also joined BMLL&rsquo;s ever-expanding universe of customers.</span> </li>
<li> <span>Having established itself as the golden source of historical Level 3 data, in Q1 2024, BMLL started offering Level 2 / Level 1 historical data to address shortcomings in data quality from incumbent providers such as Refinitiv and Bloomberg. BMLL Level 2/1 historical data is engineered from Level 3, the most granular data available, and far superior to traditional offerings.</span> </li>
</ul>

<title>CFTC’s Global Markets Advisory Committee Advances Recommendation On Tokenized Non-Cash Collateral</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftcs-global-markets-advisory-committee-advances-recommendation-on-tokenized-no/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftcs-global-markets-advisory-committee-advances-recommendation-on-tokenized-no/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission&rsquo;s Global Markets Advisory Committee, sponsored by Commissioner Caroline D. Pham, today advanced a recommendation to expand the use of non-cash collateral through the use of distributed ledger technology. The GMAC&rsquo;s Digital Asset Markets Subcommittee also presented on the progress of its Utility Tokens workstream.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&ldquo;All over the world, there have been successful and proven commercial use cases for tokenization of assets, such as digital government bond issuances in Europe and Asia, over $1.5 trillion notional volume in institutional repo and payments transactions on enterprise blockchain platforms, and more efficient collateral and treasury management,&rdquo; Commissioner Pham said. &ldquo;Now, we can finally begin to make progress on U.S. regulatory clarity for digital assets with today&rsquo;s GMAC recommendation on tokenized non-cash collateral. This marks a significant first step toward realizing these opportunities for our derivatives markets &mdash; with exactly the same guardrails and protections in place. Embracing new technology does not mean compromising on market integrity. I&rsquo;m also excited by the progress of the Utility Tokens workstream and their extensive efforts on a regulatory solution for these key assets which will help to unleash rapid innovation and growth in the digital economy. I applaud the leadership of the GMAC and the Digital Asset Markets Subcommittee and workstreams for promoting the competitiveness of our markets and the United States.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Today&rsquo;s recommendation by the GMAC&rsquo;s Digital Asset Markets Subcommittee was approved without objection, marking the 14<span>th</span>&nbsp;GMAC recommendation advanced to the CFTC in the last 12 months, the most of any advisory committee ever in the same timeframe.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/11581/GMAC_DAM_UseofDLTasDerivativesCollateral_112124/download">Digital Asset Markets Subcommittee Recommendations to Expand Use of Non-Cash Collateral through Use of Distributed Ledger Technology</a></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The CFTC has consistently permitted the use of non-cash assets as collateral to satisfy regulatory margin requirements for both cleared and non-cleared derivatives, subject to specified conditions and limitations designed to mitigate credit, market, and liquidity risks. Various operational challenges, however, have impeded use of non-cash collateral, which results in adverse consequences for market efficiency. By improving the operational infrastructure for assets already eligible to serve as regulatory margin, blockchain or other distributed ledger technology can help reduce or eliminate some of those challenges without requiring any changes to collateral eligibility rules.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This recommendation provides a legal and regulatory framework for how market participants can apply their existing policies, procedures, practices, and processes to support use of DLT for non-cash collateral in a manner consistent with margin requirements.</span></span></p>

The GMAC also makes recommendations regarding international standards for regulating futures, swaps, options, and derivatives markets, as well as intermediaries.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In June 2023, Commissioner Pham&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8740-23">announced the leadership and membership</a>&nbsp;of the GMAC and its subcommittees &mdash; the largest-ever single advisory committee initiative sponsored by the CFTC.

<title>SEC Charges Advisory Firm La Mancha And Its Owner David Kushner With Fraud - Defendants, Who Purported To Make Business Loans, Including To Professional Athletes, Allegedly Stole Investor Funds To Pay For Personal Expenses</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-charges-advisory-firm-la-mancha-and-its-owner-david-kushner-with-fraud-def/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-charges-advisory-firm-la-mancha-and-its-owner-david-kushner-with-fraud-def/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged David Kushner, a resident of Boca Raton, Florida, and his company La Mancha Funding Corp. with defrauding nearly two dozen investors out of approximately $2.1 million in a series of private securities offerings. Kushner is La Mancha&rsquo;s president and sole owner.</p>
<p>As alleged in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Kushner and La Mancha raised approximately $10.5 million from investors through a series of &ldquo;LLCs&rdquo; for the purpose of investing in short-term loans made to, among others, sports agents and professional athletes, including current and former NFL players. However, Kushner and La Mancha allegedly made material misrepresentations to the investors about what would be done with the investors&rsquo; funds, secretly taking hundreds of thousands of dollars in undisclosed &ldquo;fees&rdquo; for themselves out of the intended loan proceeds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The complaint alleges that the defendants also misappropriated nearly $1.5 million of loan repayments that, according to the terms of the LLC operating agreements, were supposed to go back to the investors. Kushner used those and other misappropriated funds, including the undisclosed fees, to pay personal expenses, such as payments for personal credit card bills, college tuition, country club dues, a luxury vacation, a Mercedes Benz, and a rental home in the Hamptons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we allege, Kushner lied to investors and simply stole the money that would have given them at least some of the investment returns he had promised,&rdquo; said Sheldon L. Pollock, Associate Director of the SEC&rsquo;s New York Regional Office. &ldquo;The Commission continues to scrutinize private investment opportunities where defendants fail to follow through on their commitments to investors.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Kushner and La Mancha with violating the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties, as well as a conduct-based injunction and an officer-and-director bar against Kushner.</p>
<p>The investigation of this matter was conducted by Cynthia Matthews, James Flynn, Jessica Quinn and George N. Stepaniuk of the SEC&rsquo;s New York Regional Office and was supervised by Mr. Pollock. The litigation will be led by Russell Feldman, under the supervision of Preethi Krishnamurthy. The SEC also wishes to acknowledge the assistance of Office of the District Attorney for New York County, which today filed parallel criminal charges against Kushner.</p>

<title>SIFMA Comments To FDIC On Brokered Deposits Rulemaking</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sifma-comments-to-fdic-on-brokered-deposits-rulemaking/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sifma-comments-to-fdic-on-brokered-deposits-rulemaking/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>SIFMA submitted a letter to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) on a proposal to revise its regulations implementing Section 29 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act), which impose restrictions on the ability of certain insured depository institutions (IDIs) to accept brokered deposits and define the scope of parties that constitute deposit brokers. The letter focuses on the proposal&rsquo;s application to securities broker-dealers and their brokerage customers, as well as investment advisers and their clients.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We respectfully request that the FDIC withdraw the proposal due to the lack of evidence justifying its proposed revisions and failure to consider relevant factors,&rdquo; SIFMA wrote in the letter, noting the proposal lacks a sufficient empirical basis and lacks data to estimate its impacts.</p>
<p>The lack of data is particularly concerning, SIFMA wrote, given the potentially negative consequences of the proposal which, as the letter details, &ldquo;could reduce customer returns and safe banking options, compromise a stable source of deposit funding for IDIs and deter the allocation of excess customer cash to risk-free deposits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yesterday, the FDIC announced a &ldquo;pause&rdquo; in rulemakings, including this proposal, and the necessity of this proposal should be fully reconsidered during that time.</p>
<p>If the proposal is not withdrawn, the letter recommends the FDIC revise the proposal as outlined below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retain the existing 25% test using assets under administration rather than assets under management metric, which would resolve a number of issues with the Proposal.</li>
<li>Retain the current Primary Purpose Exception (PPE) notice and application processes, as the proposed notice and application processes are unworkable.</li>
<li>The proposed changes to the scope of and application/notice processes for the PPE would create significant transition costs that should be addressed.</li>
<li>The proposed changes to the deposit broker definition are not risk-based, make the definition overinclusive and are unlikely to address operational challenges.</li>
<li>Other well-established exceptions should be retained: 
<ul>
<li>exclusive deposit placement relationships should be retained.</li>
<li>when 100% of funds are placed into transactional accounts that do not pay any fees, interest, or other remuneration to the depositor</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The comment letter further expands on these views and can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sifma.org/resources/submissions/letters/notice-of-proposed-rulemaking-unsafe-and-unsound-banking-practices-brokereddeposit-restrictions/">here</a>.</p>
<p>SIFMA also submitted a joint comment letter with six fellow trade associations detailing how the proposal on brokered deposits violates the Administrative Procedure Act. That letter can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sifma.org/resources/submissions/letters/unsafe-and-unsound-banking-practices-brokered-deposits-restrictions-joint-trades/">here</a>.</p>

<title>SEC Chair Gensler To Depart Agency On January 20 - Gensler Implemented Reforms To Enhance Efficiency, Resiliency, And Integrity In U.S. Capital Markets - Agency Held Wrongdoers Accountable And Returned Billions To Harmed Investors</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-chair-gensler-to-depart-agency-on-january-20-gensler-implemented-reforms-t/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-chair-gensler-to-depart-agency-on-january-20-gensler-implemented-reforms-t/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="PR-Body">The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that its 33rd Chair, Gary Gensler, will step down from the Commission effective at 12:00 pm on January 20, 2025. Chair Gensler began his tenure on April 17, 2021, in the immediate aftermath of the GameStop market events. He led the agency through a robust rulemaking agenda to enhance efficiency, resiliency, and integrity in the U.S. capital markets. He also oversaw high-impact enforcement cases to hold wrongdoers accountable and return billions to harmed investors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Securities and Exchange Commission is a remarkable agency,&rdquo; said Chair Gensler. &ldquo;The staff and the Commission are deeply mission-driven, focused on protecting investors, facilitating capital formation, and ensuring that the markets work for investors and issuers alike. The staff comprises true public servants. It has been an honor of a lifetime to serve with them on behalf of everyday Americans and ensure that our capital markets remain the best in the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank President Biden for entrusting me with this incredible responsibility. The SEC has met our mission and enforced the law without fear or favor. I&rsquo;ve greatly enjoyed working with my fellow Commissioners, Allison Herren Lee, Elad Roisman, Hester Peirce, Caroline Crenshaw, Mark Uyeda, and Jaime Liz&aacute;rraga. I also thank Congress, my colleagues across the U.S. government, and fellow regulators around the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Treasury Markets</span></p>
<p>During Chair Gensler&rsquo;s tenure, the SEC adopted critical enhancements to the $28 trillion U.S. Treasury markets. To lower cost and risk in the Treasury markets, the agency adopted rules to promote central clearing and narrow circumstances in which broker-dealers are exempt from national securities association registration. These reforms will lower risk and enhance efficiency throughout the entirety of the U.S. capital markets.</p>
<p><span>Equity Markets</span></p>
<p>Under Chair Gensler, the SEC made the first significant updates to the $55 trillion U.S. equity market in nearly 20 years. The agency unanimously made updates to the National Market System so that stocks can be traded more efficiently with narrower spreads and lower fees. Improvements also include shortening the settlement cycle to one day, which is good for investors and lowers risk in the market. Further, the agency unanimously adopted rules to update information regarding brokers&rsquo; execution quality. These reforms benefit investors by making equity markets more efficient.</p>
<p><span>Resiliency</span></p>
<p>The Commission adopted amendments during Chair Gensler&rsquo;s tenure regarding Form PF, the confidential reporting form for certain SEC-registered investment advisers to private funds. The amended rules require that large hedge fund and private equity fund advisers make current reports on certain events to the Commission. The SEC further amended Form PF jointly with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to improve the quality of the information the agencies receive from all Form PF filers, and those changes will be implemented next year. Finally, the Commission adopted reforms to money market funds to make them more resilient, liquid, and transparent, including in times of stress.</p>
<p><span>Corporate Governance</span></p>
<p>To better promote trust in the capital markets, the SEC under Chair Gensler adopted a number of changes regarding corporate governance, including updating the rules for when corporate insiders can sell their shares, for when executives have to give back compensation based on erroneously reported financials, and for disclosure of executive pay versus performance. The agency also adopted new rules to allow shareholders to vote their preferred mix of board candidates on universal proxy cards in contested director elections. Additionally, the Commission adopted rules requiring more timely disclosure by those who are seeking control and buy more than a 5 percent stake in a company.</p>
<p><span>Disclosure</span></p>
<p>Since April 2021, the Commission has adopted several rules to ensure that investors get the disclosure they need from public companies and companies seeking to go public, broker-dealers, and investment advisors.</p>
<p>First, the Commission adopted rules to enhance disclosure around public company issuers&rsquo; cyber and climate risks, as well as for those companies seeking to go public via a special purpose acquisition company. The rules are grounded in materiality, as investors need this information to make buying, selling, holding, and voting decisions.</p>
<p>Second, the Commission adopted rules requiring certain broker-dealers and investment advisers to notify customers of data breaches that might put personal information at risk.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission enhanced transparency to the markets by regularly publishing aggregate, anonymized data regarding registered investment funds, private funds, and investment advisers.</p>
<p><span>Accounting and Auditing</span></p>
<p>During Chair Gensler&rsquo;s tenure, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), overseen by the SEC, successfully negotiated a Statement of Protocol with Chinese market authorities to allow the PCAOB to fully inspect and investigate, for the first time, the auditors of China-related companies listed in the United States. For the last two years, the PCAOB has been able to fulfill its inspection and enforcement-related responsibilities as it relates to audit firms in China and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Further, in April 2021, the PCAOB had only updated five of the standards it adopted on an interim basis when it was created 20 years ago. The interim standards had been carried over from existing American Institute of Certified Public Accountants standards, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act envisioned that the PCAOB would update them soon after its creation. Since Chair Gensler was sworn in, the PCAOB has updated 18 interim standards and two other standards to reflect the current oversight needs in accounting and auditing.</p>
<p><span>Examinations and Enforcement</span></p>
<p>The Divisions of Enforcement and Examinations, which make up about half of the agency, have been steadfast cops on the beat during Chair Gensler&rsquo;s tenure. The agency received more than 145,000 tips, complaints, and referrals and awarded approximately $1.5 billion to whistleblowers. The Commission filed more than 2,700 enforcement actions and obtained approximately $21 billion in penalties and disgorgement orders. Between fiscal years 2021 and 2024, the agency returned more than $2.7 billion to harmed investors as a result of enforcement actions.</p>
<p>Further, the SEC recovered more than $250 million for harmed investors through examination of investment advisors, investment companies, and broker dealers, among others. The Division of Examinations also enhanced communication with registrants by sharing more timely information about its annual priorities and observations and proactively engaging with industry and other regulators.</p>
<p>Under Chair Gensler, the Commission continued the work Chair Jay Clayton began to protect investors in the crypto markets. During Chair Gensler&rsquo;s tenure, the agency brought actions against crypto intermediaries for fraud, wash trading, registration violations, and other misconduct.</p>
<p>In the last full fiscal year, according to the SEC&rsquo;s Office of the Inspector General, 18 percent of the SEC&rsquo;s tips, complaints, and referrals were crypto-related, despite the crypto markets comprising less than 1 percent of the U.S. capital markets. Court after court&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-pli-s-56th-annual-institute-securities-regulation-111424#_ftn37">agreed</a>&nbsp;with the Commission&rsquo;s actions to protect investors and rejected all arguments that the SEC cannot enforce the law when securities are being offered&mdash;whatever their form.</p>
<p><span>About Chair Gensler</span></p>
<p>Chair Gensler was formerly Chair of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, leading the Obama Administration&rsquo;s reform of the $400 trillion swaps market. He also was senior advisor to U.S. Senator Paul Sarbanes in writing the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (2002) and was undersecretary of the Treasury for Domestic Finance and assistant secretary of the Treasury from 1997-2001.</p>
<p>In recognition for his service, Chair Gensler was awarded the Alexander Hamilton Award, the U.S. Treasury&rsquo;s highest honor. He is a recipient of the 2014 Frankel Fiduciary Prize.</p>
<p>Before joining the SEC, Chair Gensler was professor of the Practice of Global Economics and Management at the MIT Sloan School of Management, co-director of MIT&rsquo;s Fintech@CSAIL, and senior advisor to the MIT Media Lab Digital Currency Initiative.

<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li>At 3.45% in October, the national delinquency rate was up 6% from the same time last year, marking five consecutive months of year-over-year increases</li>
<li>While 30- &amp; 60-day delinquencies decreased from September, seriously past due loans (90+ days) continued their slow rise, now up 7.3% from last year and at the highest level since May 2023</li>
<li>Though both foreclosure starts (+12.2%) and completions (+10.1%) were up in October, both remain down from last year (-12.3% and -9.5%, respectively) and well below pre-pandemic levels</li>
<li>Likewise, foreclosure inventory was up a modest +1K in the month, but there are 28K fewer loans in active foreclosure than there were at this same time last year</li>
<li>Prepayment activity rose on easing interest rates to a level not seen in over two years (May 2022) and nearly double where it was last October</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) today published for comment proposed amendments to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asc.ca/securities-law-and-policy/regulatory-instruments/13-102">Multilateral Instrument 13-102&nbsp;<em>System Fees</em></a>. The proposal is intended to better align system fee revenues with projected national systems operating costs.</p>
<p>The CSA is proposing to increase system fees for SEDAR+ and the National Registration Database (NRD) over a five-year period starting in late 2025. These system fee increases are necessary to ensure sufficient funding to operate the CSA&rsquo;s national systems over those five years. Under the proposed amendments the total system fees collected by the CSA would increase, however no new system fees would be introduced, and the flat-fee structure would be retained.</p>
<p>The proposed fees, which would continue to be based on cost-recovery, reflect the reduced revenue and cost increases experienced by the CSA in the development and operations of the national systems. In recent years, all industries have seen significant increases in IT labour costs of between 35 and 45 per cent, along with cost increases for technology and cybersecurity risk mitigation costs<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>The proposed system fee increase of 60 per cent in November 2025 would be less than $2,500 for 95 per cent of filing and registrant organizations and less than $1,000 for 85 per cent of these organizations. There would be three per cent increases in each of the following four years to continue meeting national systems funding needs.</p>
<p>Since system fees continue to be based on the type and number of filings submitted and the number of individual registrants, the proportional fee increases would equitably impact all market segments.</p>
<p>The CSA invites comments on this proposal, which can be found on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.asc.ca/">CSA members&rsquo; websites</a>. The 90-day comment period closes on February 19, 2025.</p>
<p>The CSA, the council of the securities regulators of Canada&rsquo;s provinces and territories, coordinates and harmonizes regulation for the Canadian capital markets.</p>
<p>The BC Securities Commission is not publishing the proposed amendments and changes for comment at this time while it awaits necessary government approvals following the B.C. provincial election.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury&rsquo;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) took another major step in implementing commitments made by G7 leaders to curtail Russia&rsquo;s use of the international financial system to further its war against Ukraine. OFAC&rsquo;s action includes the designation of Gazprombank, more than 50 internationally connected Russian banks, more than 40 Russian securities registrars, and 15 Russian finance officials. OFAC is also issuing an alert describing sanctions risks related to Russia&rsquo;s System for Transfer of Financial Messages (SPFS), which the Kremlin created and uses to evade sanctions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s sanctions targeting Russia&rsquo;s largest remaining non-designated bank, as well as dozens of other financial institutions and officials in Russia, will further diminish and degrade Russia&rsquo;s war machine. This sweeping action will make it harder for the Kremlin to evade U.S. sanctions and fund and equip its military,&rdquo; said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. &ldquo;We will continue to take decisive steps against any financial channels Russia uses to support its illegal and unprovoked war in Ukraine.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>GAZPROMBANK</h3>
<p>OFAC is designating&nbsp;<span>Gazprombank Joint Stock Company&nbsp;</span>(Gazprombank) alongside its six foreign subsidiaries. Gazprombank is a conduit for Russia to purchase military materiel for its war effort against Ukraine. The Russian government also uses Gazprombank to pay its soldiers, including for combat bonuses, and to compensate the families of Russian soldiers killed fighting Putin&rsquo;s brutal war against Ukraine. Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom have previously sanctioned Gazprombank.</p>
<p>Luxembourg-based bank<span>&nbsp;GPB International SA</span>,<span>&nbsp;</span>Hong Kong-based&nbsp;<span>GPB Financial Services Hong Kong Limited</span>, Cyprus-based<span>&nbsp;GPB Financial Services Limited&nbsp;</span>and&nbsp;<span>GPB-DI Holdings Limited</span>, Switzerland-based&nbsp;<span>Gazprombank (Switzerland) Ltd</span>, and South Africa-based<span>&nbsp;GPB Africa and Middle East Pty Ltd</span>&nbsp;are wholly owned subsidiaries of Gazprombank.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gazprombank is being designated pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 14024 for operating or having operated in the financial services sector of the Russian Federation economy. GPB International SA, GPB Financial Services Hong Kong Limited, GPB Financial Services Limited, GPB-DI Holdings Limited, Gazprombank (Switzerland) Ltd, and GPB Africa and Middle East Pty Ltd are being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being owned or controlled by, or for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Gazprombank. All entities owned 50 percent or more, directly or indirectly, by Gazprombank or the six designated Gazprombank subsidiaries, are subject to blocking, even if not identified by OFAC.</p>
<p>Concurrently with this action, OFAC is issuing two new general licenses (GL) authorizing U.S. persons to wind down transactions involving Gazprombank, among other financial institutions, and to take the necessary steps to divest from debt or equity issued by Gazprombank. OFAC is also amending Russia-related GL 53 to ensure that diplomatic banking activities involving Gazprombank are not disrupted. OFAC continues to maintain a&nbsp;<a href="https://ofac.treasury.gov/selected-general-licenses-issued-ofac">variety of authorizations</a>, including GLs authorizing transactions related to agricultural commodities, medicine, medical devices, certain transactions in support of non-governmental organizations, the official business of third-country diplomatic missions located in the Russian Federation, and certain transactions and official business of certain international organizations and entities.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>SYSTEM FOR TRANSFER OF FINANCIAL MESSAGES&nbsp;</h3>
<p>OFAC is also&nbsp;<a href="https://ofac.treasury.gov/media/933656/download?inline">issuing an alert</a>&nbsp;underscoring the sanctions risk for foreign financial institutions that join Russia&rsquo;s System for Transfer of Financial Messages (commonly known by its Russian acronym, SPFS, short for&nbsp;<em>Sistema Peredachi Finansovykh Soobshcheniy</em>). SPFS is part of the&nbsp;<a href="https://ofac.treasury.gov/media/918726/download?inline">financial services sector</a>&nbsp;of the Russian Federation economy because of its role facilitating communication between financial institutions engaged in Russia&rsquo;s financial system. This means that any foreign financial institution that joins or has already joined SPFS may be designated for operating or having operated in the financial services sector of the Russian Federation economy pursuant to E.O. 14024. Russia has used and promoted SPFS, designed as an alternative to Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) network, to maintain international financial connectivity, evade sanctions, and fund its war effort. OFAC views joining SPFS after publication of this alert as a red flag and is prepared to more aggressively target foreign financial institutions that take such action. OFAC also urges stakeholders to review their exposure to institutions that have joined SPFS, as such banks may be conduits for Russian sanctions evasion.</p>
<h3>DOZENS OF RUSSIAN BANKS</h3>
<p>Further curtailing Russia&rsquo;s connections to the international financial system, OFAC is designating more than 50 small-to-medium Russian banks to prevent Russia from abusing the international financial system to pay for the technology and equipment it needs to sustain its illegal and unjust war against Ukraine. Foreign financial institutions that maintain correspondent relationships with these banks should be aware that continuing to do so entails significant sanctions risk.</p>
<p>For more information about these targets, please see&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2725#ftnref1">Annex 1</a>&nbsp;below.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>RUSSIAN SECURITIES REGISTRARS</h3>
<p>OFAC is aware that Russia has attempted to evade or avoid OFAC sanctions on the&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2404">National Settlement Depository</a>&nbsp;by requiring, via Presidential Decree 840, the transfer of certain securities to local Russian securities registrars. Today, OFAC is designating more than 40 such registrars. &nbsp;OFAC has also updated&nbsp;<a href="https://ofac.treasury.gov/faqs/1197">FAQ 1197</a>&nbsp;to provide further guidance on securities held at or otherwise involving these registrars.</p>
<p>For more information about these targets, please see&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2725#_Annex2">Annex 2</a>&nbsp;below.</p>
<p><span>CBR OFFICIALS&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>In September 2022, OFAC designated&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0612">Central Bank of the Russian Federation</a>&nbsp;(CBR) Governor&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0981">Elvira Naibullina</a>&nbsp;and First Deputy Governor&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0981">Olga Skorobogatova</a>. At the time, Treasury noted that Russia&rsquo;s financial technocrats have, directly and indirectly, supported the Kremlin&rsquo;s unprovoked war against Ukraine. Today, OFAC is designating 11 additional CBR officials, including those involved in maintaining Russia&rsquo;s international financial connectivity or promoting alternate financial pathways that Russia can exploit to pay for much-needed equipment and technology.</p>
<p>For more information about these targets, please see&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2725#_Annex3">Annex 3</a>&nbsp;below.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>VTB SHANGHAI AND SBERBANK NEW DELHI STAFF</h3>
<p>Today&rsquo;s action also includes designations of key Russian staff members at U.S.-designated&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0608">VTB Bank Public Joint Stock Company</a>&rsquo;s branch in Shanghai, China (VTB Shanghai) and U.S.-designated&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0705">Public Joint Stock Company Sberbank of Russia</a>&rsquo;s branch in New Delhi, India (Sberbank New Delhi).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following Russian nationals are being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the financial services sector of the Russian Federation economy:</p>
<p><span>Andrei Anisimov&nbsp;</span>is Sberbank New Delhi&rsquo;s Deputy Managing Director.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Elena Fedkina</span>&nbsp;is a VTB Shanghai Relationship Manager.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Ilya Lishenko&nbsp;</span>is VTB Shanghai&rsquo;s Senior Relationship Manager.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Roman Logov&nbsp;</span>is VTB Shanghai&rsquo;s Deputy General Manager.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since February 2022, OFAC has designated dozens of Russia-based staff at Russian banks and continues to investigate Russian and third-country nationals working at foreign branches, representative offices, and subsidiaries of Russian banks for designation pursuant to E.O. 14024.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Canada Climate Week Xchange (CCWX) is a new five-year initiative on a mission to bring together diverse organizations to support Canada&rsquo;s commitment to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by 2030, through events dedicated to addressing Canada&rsquo;s climate-related challenges and opportunities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CCWX is a collaboration between Toronto Stock Exchange, Canada Climate Law Initiative (CCLI), CPA Canada, GLOBE Series, and the Responsible Investment Association (RIA). Canadian organizations and individuals are encouraged to apply to have their event included in the inaugural CCWX, which will run from November 24 to 30, 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Successful climate action will require sustained collaboration between organizations across the country, including Canadian listed companies. Toronto Stock Exchange is delighted to work with our founding members to ensure a diversity of voices is represented to drive effective climate action.&rdquo; &ndash; Eliza Riego, Managing Director, Product Innovation and ESG Strategy, Toronto Stock Exchange</p>
<p>&ldquo;Conversations about climate change are needed to help businesses, regulators, and the general public make informed decisions and help transition Canada to a net-zero economy. CCWX makes important space for those discussions and actions through a full week of impactful events around the country.&rdquo; &ndash; Sonia Li Trottier, Director, Canada Climate Law Initiative</p>
<p>&ldquo;CPA Canada is proud to be a founding member of Canada Climate Week Xchange and to participate in a collaborative and knowledge-driven approach to climate action across the Canadian finance and accounting ecosystem. Our organization has a long history of empowering CPAs and the broader business community with practical guidance and thought leadership on topics from accounting for emissions to sustainability standards implementation and voluntary carbon markets. We look forward to contributing to what I&rsquo;m confident will be an engaging and rewarding forum.&rdquo; &ndash; Pamela Steer, President and CEO, CPA Canada</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is important for First Nations organizations like the First Nations Financial Management Board (FMB) to contribute to CCWX as First Nations will be disproportionately impacted by climate change, while also holding unique potential to play an outsized role in climate solutions. The events envisioned by this initiative provide a vital platform to highlight both the investments required for climate adaptation in First Nations communities, and the important role First Nations can play in the supply chains that enable greener technologies." &ndash; Harold Calla,&nbsp; Executive Chair, FNB</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is important that Canada has a climate week to discuss and address the specific opportunities and challenges that climate change poses to our financial system. As the voice of Canada&rsquo;s responsible investment community, the RIA is uniquely attuned to these critical considerations and Canada&rsquo;s just transition to a net zero economy. This is an important and timely convening of pan-industry conversations. Neither investors, nor any other industry can do it all by themselves. We need to collaborate and CCWX &nbsp;will provide an ideal forum.&rdquo; &ndash; Patricia Fletcher, CEO, Responsible Investment Association (RIA)</p>

<h2>Speech</h2>
<p>Good afternoon, it&rsquo;s a pleasure to be here at the Tokenisation Summit. I know many of you are at the forefront of modernising financial services and this summit is helpfully bringing entrepreneurs and practitioners together. The Bank of England (the Bank) is following these developments closely, so this is a timely opportunity to speak to you.</p>
<p>Innovation occurring in wholesale financial markets today could have a truly transformative impact. It might change how well markets function, how participants and regulators interact with those markets, and consequently boost growth and economic development. To give a sense of the scale of the potential change, in twenty years we may look back and see parallels between the way the financial system works today and the way we used to travel in the 19th century.</p>
<p>Back in the late 1800s people got around by horse and cart; once the first commercially successful combustion engine was invented it took only a few decades for production line processes to make that invention available to the general public, transforming the world of travel. Today, tokenisation and the adoption of new technologies in financial markets, such as programmable platforms, including those based on distributed ledger technologies (DLT), have the potential to make post-trade processes faster, cheaper and more efficient, restructuring our financial system and the way we engage with it.</p>
<p>The way people travelled in the 19th century involved many steps, each adding costs. A horse&rsquo;s energy and capabilities constrained travel to certain routes, and required frequent stops to refuel or rest overnight. As with many transformative inventions, when the combustion engine was invented, people could not imagine what it would mean for them. If you asked people in the 19<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century what they needed to improve travel they would have asked for faster horses. The rapid transition from horse and cart to cars removed many transport inefficiencies. The economic benefits of highly efficient production lines made car travel affordable and accessible for a larger market. This led to incentives to invest in quality road infrastructure, creating a virtuous cycle of increasing efficiencies.</p>
<p>Digitisation has been the combustion engine of financial markets, transforming paper-based systems of the 1960s and 70s to computer-based activity, on to the digital systems of today. Tokenisation and the adoption of new technology can further revolutionise financial markets, like automated production lines fundamentally altered our conception of what was possible in transportation.</p>
<p>Tokenisation refers to the process of issuing or representing assets in the form of digital tokens, usually on a programmable platform. In some sense, tokenisation is not a novel concept &ndash; financial securities like stocks have existed primarily as digital representations on databases for a long time, and we have found ways of representing commodities such as gold electronically, so it is easier to trade them. The real innovation is the type of infrastructure on which that token sits, and what that enables.</p>
<p>As it stands today, the implementation of programmable ledgers and tokenisation initiatives in traditional financial markets, for both securities and money, is at the experimental or early adoption stage. Think of these as the new machines and processes in our car factory which are replacing manual assembly.</p>
<p>Right now, we are testing the machines. Some of them might work out, some of them might not. But it could in time bring about better outcomes, even if mass adoption could still be many years away.</p>
<p>Let me first turn to what the new machines can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distributed ledgers, as opposed to centralised ones that all participants need to reconcile with, can reduce the need for a single central party to perform record-keeping on the ledger and can also mean there isn&rsquo;t a single point of failure in how critical data is stored.</li>
<li>The use of cryptographic techniques to secure data can reduce risk by improving the security and integrity of financial transactions.</li>
<li>Programmability, the ability to write specific rules that will execute automatically in response to predetermined conditions or data, known as &lsquo;smart contracts&rsquo;, has facilitated the consolidation and collapsing of the trade and post-trade functions, resulting in reduced settlement risk, and unprecedented efficiency gains in the trade lifecycle.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The role of regulators in enabling and facilitating innovation</h3>
<p>The invention of the car, and its mass production, came from private enterprise. But public authorities had a role to play too in its safe adoption across the population. Better public infrastructure like roads and pavements were needed. And over time, as the risks became clearer, effective regulations greatly reduced casualties from road accidents, without disincentivising the innovations that led to mass car ownership.</p>
<p>In the same way today, public authorities have a role to play in the reinvention of wholesale financial markets, both as enablers of innovation and providers of public infrastructure, and as regulators to ensure adoption happens in a way that preserves financial stability and is safe for participants in these financial markets.</p>
<p>The Bank of England understands the role that it needs to play in this reinvention, and we have been active in facilitating innovation in wholesale markets, in relation to both assets and money. Today I&rsquo;m going to talk more about the assets side, but we are cognisant both are key components to the transition, and both are progressing promisingly. Let me highlight some of the Bank&rsquo;s work in this space, alongside some of the potential developments in the wider financial markets.</p>
<h3>Digital Securities Sandbox</h3>
<p>The Digital Securities Sandbox, or DSS, has recently opened for applications. This joint initiative between the Bank and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), open to UK-registered firms, is a really significant milestone for the UK. The Sandbox gives the Bank the power to &lsquo;turn off&rsquo; the rules, to allow industry to experiment with developing technologies, including tokenisation, to issue, trade and settle both digitally native securities, and so-called &lsquo;digital twin&rsquo; tokenised securities in a safe and secure environment for a range of regulated asset classes.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk183009696"></a>Echoing the words of the minister earlier, we look forward to seeing proposals supporting the issuance of a digital gilt in the Sandbox. This encapsulates both our traditional objective on financial stability through supporting the functioning of the critical gilt market, but also our newer secondary objective on innovation by looking at how thinking differently and trying new approaches could support developing this market.</p>
<h3>Digital money</h3>
<p>If tokenisation of securities is like the move from horse and cart to mass-produced cars, the transformation of money and payments is like the creation of the railways. As Deputy Governor Sarah Breeden has previously discussed, payments provide the rails for the trains of our financial system to run on.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/november/beyond-faster-horses-wholesale-financial-markets-in-the-digital-age#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>To unlock more of the benefits of tokenisation, including the programmability of securities, money needs to keep up with developments in tokenised assets. At the same time, ensuring the orderly settlement of wholesale market transactions is critical. Singleness of money &ndash; the principle that all different forms of money must be exchangeable with each other at par &ndash; is fundamental to monetary and financial stability. For this reason we&rsquo;ve indicated that we have a low-risk appetite for a significant shift away from current levels of settlement in central bank money to privately-issued forms of money like tokenised deposits.</p>
<p>As outlined in the Payments Innovation Discussion Paper published over the summer<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/november/beyond-faster-horses-wholesale-financial-markets-in-the-digital-age#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[2]</a></sup>&nbsp;the Bank is considering ways to preserve and enhance the usefulness of central-bank money as a settlement asset for digital asset transactions. Part of this is the work taking place on the Bank&rsquo;s RTGS<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/november/beyond-faster-horses-wholesale-financial-markets-in-the-digital-age#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[3]</a></sup>&nbsp;system where we have already introduced omnibus accounts, and are working closely with the industry to design and develop a synchronisation service.</p>
<p>Synchronisation could enable an asset to be transferred from one party to another on an external platform, including potentially one based on DLT, with the cash leg of the transaction taking place on the existing RTGS ledger. The Bank has tested synchronisation in experiments working together with the Bank of International Settlement (BIS)&rsquo;s Innovation Hub London Centre and other partners.</p>
<p>Alongside synchronisation, we are also considering what additional functionality a so-called wholesale central bank digital currency could bring. The Bank will launch a programme of experiments across both use cases in the coming months.</p>
<h3>The age of programmable ledgers and tokenisation</h3>
<p>The settlement process after a trade is agreed in traditional securities markets retains sequential, often manual processes that are time-consuming, costly, and operationally risky for all users of financial markets. Inefficiencies impose financial costs and operational risks on almost all financial market participants. This includes financial market infrastructure (FMI) operators, financial intermediaries such as banks, and end-investors such as pension funds. Post-trade processes are today more efficient than ever before, but there is a ceiling to the efficiency that can be achieved using legacy technology &ndash; just as you could only make a horse transport you so far before it needed to rest.</p>
<p>There is an increasing amount of investment in the application of distributed ledger technology in financial markets. The tokenisation of securities on distributed ledgers &ndash; digital securities &ndash; offers the potential to merge trade and post-trade functions, shortening settlement cycles and offering more programmability and automation in financial transactions. This could introduce more liquidity to a wider range of financial assets, and provide opportunity for more assets to be utilised &ndash; for example, as collateral &ndash; in the way traditional securities are used today. The potential benefits from distributed ledgers and the potential benefits from tokenisation are more powerful when considered together.</p>
<h3>Unlocking new markets</h3>
<p>Representing assets in digital form, or &lsquo;tokenisation&rsquo;, could offer improved investor access and opportunities, such as through more widespread fractionalisation of assets. Fractional ownership can unlock access to assets that were previously illiquid or exhibited prohibitively high barriers for investment. Tokenisation can lower these barriers to entry for investors by making it cheaper to interact with the market.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier by the FCA, there is great interest in the tokenisation of Money Market Funds (MMFs) in particular, and the role these can play in the financial system in the future. A number of firms have successfully issued tokenised MMFs on private and public blockchains in the past year.</p>
<p>Tokenised MMFs could reduce some liquidity mismatch risks in stress events by reducing the need for investors to redeem their MMF shares for cash to meet short-term liquidity needs &ndash; such as margin calls &ndash; where market participants could transfer tokenised MMF shares instead. But this activity could also create new risks, particularly in more severe stress events where funds need to suspend redemptions, or where confidence was lost that the MMF unit could be redeemed at par.</p>
<p>Our view is that further exploration of fund tokenisation is consistent with the objectives of the DSS, and we encourage firms to utilise the Sandbox to experiment with MMFs as securities. Fund tokenisation activity taking place in the DSS will allow us to consider the risks and benefits from potential use cases in a safe, controlled environment, including using tokenised fund units as collateral. We look forward to seeing applications to the DSS that propose to support fund tokenisation. However, in line with the principles the Bank has set out for money to function effectively, we do not consider MMF tokens to be a form of money or to be suitable for use as a settlement asset.</p>
<h3>More efficient markets?</h3>
<p>The DSS is also an invaluable opportunity for regulators to learn how to best support innovation and changes in the financial markets environment whilst also protecting financial stability. Currently the only assets used widely in activities such as repo, lending and collateralisation are cash, and those assets held at central securities depositories. Tokenisation has the potential to widen this perimeter to other asset classes. While the Sandbox is our primary tool for assessing how to modify the UK settlement regime, it also enables regulators to track how the assets are traded and utilised more efficiently. This could be through fractionalisation of commodities such as gold or removing the barriers to trading private and currently illiquid assets like loans or private equity.</p>
<p>To take an example, short-term lending, particularly secured lending, is one area that has traditionally been hindered by operational frictions; existing systems make it very difficult to move assets quickly or without settlement delivery risk. A combination of programmable transactions and distributed ledgers can unlock the potential for more precise, simultaneous transactions that allow for securities to be pledged, borrowed or lent for short periods of time. This can lead to a more efficient use of assets (and by extension, a firm&rsquo;s balance sheet), and potentially reduce the impact of settlement failure and funding squeezes. For example, Digital Financing, a blockchain-based application built on JP Morgan&rsquo;s Onyx (now Kinexys) platform demonstrated a 56% reduction in operational costs and faster alternatives to receive secured intraday funding without requiring balance sheet usage.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/november/beyond-faster-horses-wholesale-financial-markets-in-the-digital-age#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Any future settlement regime will need to consider these additional use cases in the round to ensure support for growth in demand and innovation. Through our work on the DSS, we will learn what the implications for financial stability might be, to help us design a regime that delivers safe and sustainable innovation.</p>
<h3>The wider landscape</h3>
<p>&nbsp;Although it is exciting to see a wide variety of innovation and exploration, unchecked, this variation might lead to market fragmentation which may trap liquidity. The importance of facilitating the transfer of information such as records of ownership, or forms of money between distinct platforms and ecosystems, will continue to serve as one of the key pillars of success in an increasingly digital financial system. Both regulation and market forces can work towards achieving the right level of interoperability to fully utilise the infrastructure being developed to serve this new market.</p>
<p>Our work in international fora also aims to prevent market fragmentation. In particular, tokenisation should preserve the global nature of financial markets.</p>
<p>A key part of this will be the adoption of consistent standards internationally.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/november/beyond-faster-horses-wholesale-financial-markets-in-the-digital-age#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[5]</a></sup>&nbsp;We are working with other international regulators and standard setting bodies to develop a common understanding of the benefits and risks of tokenisation. This helps to ensure our approaches to regulation are consistent with each other, under the principle of &ldquo;same risk same regulatory outcome&rdquo;. To the extent tokenised assets bring similar risks to financial stability as other assets, they should be subject to equivalent regulatory standards.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/november/beyond-faster-horses-wholesale-financial-markets-in-the-digital-age#footnote-7" id="footnote-ref-7"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Regulators are also conducting joint experimentation to further our collective understanding, including on interoperability in this landscape. For example, the Bank is participating in BIS&rsquo; Project Agor&aacute;<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/november/beyond-faster-horses-wholesale-financial-markets-in-the-digital-age#footnote-8" id="footnote-ref-8"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[7]</a></sup>&nbsp;&ndash; alongside six other central banks. This project is exploring how tokenised commercial bank deposits and central bank money may be exchanged on a public-private programmable platform, initially focused on<br />cross-border payments.</p>
<p>Central Bank led projects such as the Monetary Authority of Singapore&rsquo;s Global Layer 1 also seek to advance technical standards for tokenisation platforms.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Much like the productivity of the worker in a car factory was transformed with the advent of the production line, the institutional investor&rsquo;s experience of wholesale markets could prove to be simpler, faster and cheaper if the opportunities programmable ledgers and tokens present are realised. Settling trades in financial securities like shares and bonds could be faster, as could cross-border payments. The tokenisation of new types of assets could open up and develop new markets where infrastructure was previously cumbersome. These larger and more diverse markets are how this innovation can drive growth. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Across wholesale financial markets the Bank of England is committed to exploring opportunities for innovation and tokenisation and working alongside innovators to ensure this digital transformation benefits everyone. From facilitating innovation in securities settlement to exploring opportunities for new forms of money, the Bank and international regulators have a significant role to play.</p>
<p>We understand what that role is - wholesale financial markets involve a lot of risk, and it is important that innovation happens in a way that is safe for participants and does not propagate risk in the system. Regulation has a key role to play in ensuring our financial markets innovate while remaining safe. Public-private partnership experimentation in developing technologies is also crucial.</p>
<p>I, and my colleagues, believe that the continued experimentation and development of these technologies can ultimately redefine the frontiers of market connectivity, financial system efficiency and sustainability. We look forward to working with industry to ensure the UK can move from the horse and cart era of manual post-trade processes, to the automated production line equivalent of tokenised securities settlement, and the transformation and optimisation of wholesale financial markets.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>IOSCO has today published a&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iosco.org%2Flibrary%2Fpubdocs%2Fpdf%2FIOSCOPD778.pdf&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cmailing-lists%40iosco.org%7C2430b5d2a450435e773d08dd0a0c9a6f%7Cbcc6c66cdb3b48328af2cc363a097444%7C0%7C0%7C638677771446297164%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=RB7orvapdHhL05mLU9Dh285TvbIxEuGGBbLxNqRgLHE%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Consultation Report</a>&nbsp;inviting feedback on its recommendations relating to pre-hedging practices.</p>
<p>Pre-hedging is used by dealers to manage risks associated with anticipated wholesale principal orders in relation to primary market offerings and secondary market transactions. This can occur across various markets, including securities and derivatives, on trading venues and over the counter (OTC) markets. It encompasses a range of asset classes such as equities, fixed income, currencies and commodities.</p>
<p>The Consultation Report offers a definition of pre-hedging and proposes a set of recommendations to guide regulators in determining acceptable pre-hedging practices and managing the associated conduct risks effectively.</p>
<p>There can be benefits from the use of pre-hedging for dealers and clients to price and execute certain transactions. However, various market participants, standard setters and national and supra-national authorities have raised potential concerns about pre-hedging practices.</p>
<p><strong>Jean-Paul Servais</strong>, Chair of IOSCO and Chairman of the Belgium Financial Services &amp; Markets Authority (FSMA) emphasized the importance of this initiative:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Last year, IOSCO&rsquo;s Board approved a mandate to assess vulnerabilities in pre-hedging practices. This Consultation Report reflects our commitment to understanding existing regulatory frameworks and identifying gaps in international standards.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Existing industry codes and standards relating to pre-hedging mostly target OTC markets and/or only specific asset classes, or do not cover the range of potential issues related to pre-hedging.</p>
<p><strong>James Andronis</strong>, Chair of IOSCO&rsquo;s Committee on Regulation of Market Intermediaries (C3) said:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;In preparing this Consultation Report, we have taken the time to carefully consider our members&rsquo; existing regulatory approaches and existing industry codes. We believe the proposed Recommendations will assist to promote greater consistency and good conduct in pre-hedging in the interest of market integrity and market participants.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>IOSCO seeks feedback on its proposed definition and recommendations, which should be applicable in most circumstances, by&nbsp;<strong>February 21, 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Additional feedback is sought on whether the proposed recommendations need to be adapted to specific circumstances, e.g. in relation to potential differences of pre-hedging practices and internal non-electronic transactions and in the context of electronic trading, including competitive requests for quotes (RFQs).</p>

<title>FCMs Voice Concern Over Economics And Timeline Of Repo And Treasury Clearing: Acuiti</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fcms-voice-concern-over-economics-and-timeline-of-repo-and-treasury-clearing-ac/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Sell-side firms that will provide clearing services to clients under the SEC&rsquo;s treasury and repo clearing mandates have raised concerns over the economics of participation in the market and the timeline for implementation, a <a href="https://iongroup.com/resource-center/markets/us-treasury-markets-plotting-the-sell-sides-path-to-mandatory-clearing/?utm_source=pdf&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=markets+cd+content&amp;utm_content=press+release+acuiti+report+2024">report</a> from Acuiti has found.</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has introduced mandates for centralized clearing of treasury and repo transactions to enhance transparency, stability, and resilience in the $27 trillion Treasury market. The move represents one of the most significant shifts in US capital markets for decades.</p>
<p><a href="https://iongroup.com/resource-center/markets/us-treasury-markets-plotting-the-sell-sides-path-to-mandatory-clearing/?utm_source=pdf&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=markets+cd+content&amp;utm_content=press+release+acuiti+report+2024"><i>US Treasury Markets: Plotting the Sell-Side&rsquo;s Path to Mandatory Clearing</i></a>, released today and produced in partnership with <a href="https://iongroup.com/?utm_source=pdf&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=markets+cd+products&amp;utm_content=cd+xtp+markets+collateral+update+2024">ION</a>, surveyed or interviewed senior executives at the major Future Commission Merchants (FCMs) and banks that will be active in the market.</p>
<p>The report found that FCMs have concerns over the timeline and the economics of providing clearing services in treasuries and repos. In addition, many question the capacity of the market to absorb the demand for clearing.</p>
<p>With just over 12 months until the treasury clearing deadline and 18 until repo clearing, the central clearinghouses that will process the transactions under the new mandated framework are still developing their access models.</p>
<p>In addition, many FCMs are still uncertain about their approach to the market and the models they will offer clients from day 1.</p>
<p>Most importantly, around a third of respondents said that they were &ldquo;critically concerned&rdquo; over the overall level of returns from offering repo clearing in what is likely to be a capital-intensive, high-volume, low-margin business.</p>
<p>The key findings of the report are:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>There is significant industry uncertainty about the viability of current mandate deadlines, with 48% of survey respondents saying the repo deadline was unlikely or impossible and 31% saying the same for the cash deadline.</li>
<li>76% of survey respondents favor a phased implementation of the mandate.</li>
<li>There remains widespread doubt that current sell-side models and infrastructure can scale to meet incoming demand.</li>
<li>There is significant concern over the economics of providing treasury and repo clearing services for the FCMs that offer it to clients.</li>
<li>FCMs are planning investments in technology to increase automation and reduce overheads in what is likely to be a high-volume, low-margin business.</li>
<li>Consideration of building the required technology is still at an early stage, but almost two-thirds of the market will work with third-party vendors for some or all of the required build.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;With just over a year until introduction of the mandate begins, there remain significant uncertainties in how FCMs and repo desks will approach treasury and repo clearing,&rdquo; says <b>Ross Lancaster, Head of Research at Acuiti</b>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clarifications and potential additional regulatory activity around accounting treatment, capital requirements, and cross-asset margin offsets will ultimately indicate whether a dominant model will emerge, or the current sponsored model will co-exist with an agency clearing model.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Francesco Margini, Chief Product Officer for Cleared Derivates, ION Markets</b>, says, &ldquo;Despite the current uncertainties, what is clear today is that automation and scalability of the clearing process will be essential for firms to support the high-volume US Treasury cash and repo business. Big decisions lie ahead of sell-side firms on the technology strategy in support of the clearing mandate. The expectation is that market standardization brought by a centrally cleared business will enable software vendors like ION to play an important role in delivering solutions that meet the needs of our customers.&rdquo;</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Proposes To Extend The Time Firms Have To Handle Complaints Relating To Motor Finance Commission</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-proposes-to-extend-the-time-firms-have-to-handle/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-proposes-to-extend-the-time-firms-have-to-handle/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The proposed extension would allow firms more time to handle complaints efficiently and effectively and help prevent disorderly, inconsistent and inefficient outcomes for consumers and firms.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p><span>The&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/consultation-papers/cp24-22-further-temporary-changes-handling-rules-motor-finance-complaints" title="CP24/22: Further temporary changes to handling rules for motor finance complaints"><span>FCA is seeking feedback</span></a><span>&nbsp;on proposals to extend the time firms have to respond to motor finance complaints where a non-discretionary commission arrangement was involved. The regulator previously extended the time firms have to respond to motor finance complaints involving a discretionary commission arrangement (DCA).</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA&rsquo;s consultation follows the Court of Appeal&rsquo;s 25 October judgment in Hopcraft v Close Brothers Ltd, Johnson v FirstRand Bank Ltd, and Wrench v FirstRand Bank Ltd.</span></p>
<p><span>In these cases, the Court decided it was unlawful for the car dealers to receive a commission from lenders providing motor finance without first telling the customer about the commission and getting their informed consent to the payment. To obtain informed consent, the borrowers would have to have been told all material facts that might have affected their decision to enter into the agreements, which, in these cases, included how much the commission would be and how it was to be calculated. The judgment related to fixed commission motor finance agreements as well as DCAs, which the FCA banned in 2021. The 2 lenders involved in the cases intend to appeal.</span></p>
<p><span>Firms who provide motor finance are likely to receive a high volume of complaints in response to the judgment. The proposed complaint handling extension, which the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/fca-consult-extending-time-motor-finance-firms-handle-commission-complaints" title="FCA to consult on extending the time motor finance firms have to handle commission complaints"><span>FCA previously said it would consult on</span></a><span>, would allow firms more time to handle complaints efficiently and effectively. This would help prevent disorderly, inconsistent and inefficient outcomes for consumers and firms.</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA is consulting on 2 options for extending the time firms have to provide final responses to motor finance complaints involving a non-discretionary commission arrangement:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Until 31 May 2025, reflecting how long it may take to hear whether the Supreme Court has granted permission to appeal. The FCA plans to set out its next steps on DCA complaints in May 2025. Subject to the outcome of any Supreme Court application, the FCA would update on motor finance non-DCA commission complaints at the same time.</span></li>
<li><span>A longer extension until 4 December 2025, to align with the current rules for motor finance firms dealing with discretionary commission complaints.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Most car finance deals arranged through a dealer involve commission. Anyone who is not satisfied with their car finance deal should complain. People who were previously told their motor finance agreement did not involve a DCA, may wish to make a new complaint. The FCA has updated its&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/car-finance-complaints" title="Car finance complaints"><span>information for consumers</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Nikhil Rathi, chief executive of the FCA said:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>'The Court of Appeal&rsquo;s ruling means many customers who bought a car using finance through a dealer could be owed compensation. We want to make sure that consumers who are owed money get it in an orderly way, and that the motor finance market continues to provide competitive deals for the millions of people that rely on it.'</span></p>
<p><span>Firms will need to use the additional time provided to ensure they have the resources to investigate and issue final responses to complaints at the end of the proposed extension. As has begun already, firms should also consider whether to make any financial provisions. The focus of the Court of Appeal decision was common law and equitable principles, rather than FCA rules. Firms authorised by the FCA must meet wider legal requirements as well as regulatory rules.</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA is also consulting on giving consumers more time to refer motor finance commission complaints not involving a DCA to the Financial Ombudsman Service.</span></p>
<h2><span>FCA review into historical DCAs in motor finance</span></h2>
<p><span>In January this year, the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/fca-undertake-work-motor-finance-market" title="FCA to undertake work in the motor finance market"><span>FCA launched a review</span></a><span>&nbsp;of historical motor finance DCAs.</span></p>
<p><span>The review seeks to understand if there was widespread misconduct related to DCAs before the 2021 ban, if consumers have lost out and, if so, the best way to make sure appropriate compensation is paid in an orderly, consistent and efficient way.</span></p>
<p><span>Alongside the review, motor finance firms were given more time to provide final responses to complaints about motor finance where a DCA was involved, and consumers more time to refer their complaints to the Financial Ombudsman. This was to prevent disorderly, inconsistent and inefficient outcomes for consumers and knock-on effects on firms and the market while the FCA reviewed the issue and determined the best way forward.</span></p>
<p><span>In September, the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/extension-motor-finance-complaint-handling-pause-confirmed" title="Extension to motor finance complaint handling pause confirmed"><span>FCA further extended this</span></a><span>&nbsp;until 4 December 2025. This was because it had taken longer than expected to get the data needed for the review. Before deciding its next steps, the FCA also wanted to take account of relevant court decisions. These included the recent Court of Appeal judgment and the judicial review, heard in October 2024, by Barclays Partner Finance of a Financial Ombudsman decision relating to a DCA in a motor finance agreement. The FCA is awaiting the outcome of the judicial review judgment.</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA is considering what impact the Court of Appeal&rsquo;s judgment has on the review into historical DCAs in motor finance, including for both its timeline and scope. This is likely to be influenced by any decision of the Supreme Court to hear an appeal and, should it do so, when it makes a final judgment.</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA will write to the Supreme Court asking it to decide quickly whether it will give permission to appeal and, if it does, to consider it as soon as possible, given the potential impact of any judgment on the market and the consumers who rely on it. If permission to appeal is granted, the FCA will consider intervening to share its expertise to assist the Court.</span></p>

<p><span><span>Operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) represented 45% of the total contracts in Q3 2024, followed by procurement scope with 33%, and contracts with multiple scopes, such as construction, design and engineering, installation, O&amp;M, and procurement, which accounted for 10%.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Some notable contracts awarded during Q3 2024 include Bechtel Energy's approximately $4.3 billion lump-sum turnkey EPC contract for Train 4 and related infrastructure at the Rio Grande Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) export project in the Port of Brownsville, Texas.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Saipem made significant contributions with several key contracts such as the&nbsp; $4 billion agreement with QatarEnergy LNG for the North Field offshore compression program in Qatar, covering engineering, procurement, fabrication, and installation of six platforms, along with 28-inch, approximately 100 km of corrosion-resistant alloy rigid subsea pipelines, 24-inch, 100 km subsea composite cables, 150 km of fiber optic cables, and various other subsea facilities as part of the COMP3A and COMP3B projects.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Additionally, Saipem secured a $2 billion contract from Saudi Aramco for the EPCI of wellhead platform topsides, jackets, tie-in platforms, rigid flowlines, submarine composite cables, and fiber optic cables for the Marjan field in Saudi Arabia, and further it received two contracts overall valued approximately $1 billion for the EPCI of jackets, production deck modules, subsea pipelines (both rigid and flexible), and subsea power cables for the Marjan, Zuluf, and Safaniyah fields in Saudi Arabia.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Kad concludes: &ldquo;The surge in large-scale offshore and subsea projects, particularly in the Middle East, underscores the continued emphasis on expanding energy infrastructure to meet rising demand. As companies secure high-value contracts across key oilfields, the sector is not only reinforcing its strategic partnerships but also positioning itself to support long-term growth in energy production, with an increasing focus on sustainability and technological innovation in project execution.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<title>Tradewell Technologies Named FIA's 2024 Innovator Of The Year</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/tradewell-technologies-named-fias-2024-innovator-of-the-year/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>FIA today&nbsp;<a href="https://email.fia.org/c/12kVrgFr1VflmZ2BclLhVNWzBn3cKu">announced the winners</a>&nbsp;of its annual pitch competition for startups at the FIA Expo. The pitch competition is part of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://email.fia.org/c/12kVrhCKc30K9IvQ5lmE67UCsZEOkg">FIA&rsquo;s Innovators Pavilion</a><span>, a platform for introducing startups to trading firms, clearing brokers, exchanges and other firms active in the global derivatives markets.&nbsp;<br /><br />The winners were selected by a panel of six judges with expertise in evaluating emerging solutions in capital markets. The judges based their decisions on presentations given by each startup during the pitch competition, which took place in two stages on November 19 and 20.<br /><br />This year&rsquo;s winner was&nbsp;</span><a href="https://email.fia.org/c/12kVri6oM6Try5fswQakbhTDTNXC79">Tradewell Technologies</a><span>, a startup based in New York and London that is bringing algorithmic trading tools to the corporate bond market. The judges commended the company for its potential to transform the way that asset managers execute their trades in corporate bonds and bring greater efficiencies to the work flow in that market, and potentially other fixed income markets around the world.&nbsp;<br /><br />Two companies were chosen as runners-up&nbsp;in the competition to be Innovator of the Year &ndash;&nbsp;</span><a href="https://email.fia.org/c/12kVriA3maM8WrZ4YkY0grSFkCgpU2">ClearToken</a><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://email.fia.org/c/12kVrj3HWeEQkOIHpPLGlBRGLqzdGV">Gr&atilde;o Direto</a><span>. Gr&atilde;o Direto is a Brazilian company that is bringing modern technology and data analytics to the trading of soybeans and other agricultural products in Brazil. The judges commended the company for the way it uses mobile apps and other modern technology to connect farmers with buyers as well as the way its platform has provided greater transparency into the Brazilian grain markets. Cleartoken is a UK company that is developing a central counterparty for digital assets that will operate under the supervision of the Financial Conduct Authority. The judges commended the firm for offering a solution for the digital asset markets that allows trading venues to solve for clearing through an independent platform. &nbsp;<br /><br />"This year&rsquo;s cohort includes many terrific companies and the judges spent a lot of time discussing the pros and cons of each company before making their final decisions. The winners individually have tremendous potential to bring innovation into financial and commodity markets, and collectively they demonstrate an impressive range of entrepreneurial innovation," said FIA's SVP for Publications, Data and Research Will Acworth. "On behalf of FIA, I thank the judges for taking the time to listen to all of the presentations and bring all of their experience and expertise in the questions and answers with the companies and into the final deliberations on the winners. "<br /><br />This year's judges were: Alyssa Blankenship, Investor, DRW Venture Capital, DRW Holdings; Mira Witzig Borja, VP of Markets Strategic Investments, Citigroup Global Markets; Alex Gheorghe, Investor, Illuminate Financial; Nathaniel Jackson, Director, Prime Derivatives Services, Barclays; George Kalant, Venture Capital Lead, Chicago Trading Company; and Tim Perevozchikov, Vice President - Quantitative Research, Two Sigma Securities, LLC.</span></p>

<title>Approaching Policymaking Pragmatically, Federal Reserve Governor Michelle W. Bowman, At The Forum Club Of The Palm Beaches, West Palm Beach, Florida</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-8">
<p>Good afternoon.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241120a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;It is a pleasure to join you for today's meeting of the Forum Club of the Palm Beaches. It is truly humbling for me to be invited to speak to your membership, in the company of the many influential leaders, authors, and other public figures this organization has hosted since its founding in 1976.</p>
<p>Before turning to the main topic of my remarks today, I want to briefly share with you a bit about my background. I am one of the longest serving members currently on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), having served as a Board member since November 26, 2018. As a member of the Board, I am a permanent voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and serve in other capacities&mdash;I lead the Board committees on smaller and community banks and on consumer and community affairs and serve as a member on other committees that broadly address supervision and regulation and payments. I also provide input into the full range of matters that come before the Board.</p>
<p>I am the first Governor appointed to fill the role created by Congress for someone with demonstrated primary experience working in or supervising community banks, banks with less than $10 billion in assets.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241120a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;I have been both a banker, working in the community bank owned and operated by my family since 1882, and a bank supervisor&mdash;as the Kansas State Bank Commissioner. Early in my career, I spent almost a decade working in public service in several federal government roles, including setting up the Department of Homeland Security after 9/11 and as a Deputy Assistant Secretary and policy advisor to the first Homeland Security Secretary, Tom Ridge. I also served as a counsel on several U.S. House Committees, and as a staff member for the former U.S. Senator from Kansas, Bob Dole.</p>
<p>These experiences have provided me with a uniquely broad perspective about the role of government and the functioning of the U.S. economy&mdash;from the view of a regulated business, an executive branch agency, the legislative branch, and state and federal regulatory agencies.</p>
<p>Throughout my career, but particularly in my current role as a member of the Board of Governors, I have approached my responsibilities in an independent way, relying on facts, analysis, my own experience and judgment, and the pursuit of the congressionally mandated goals that guide the work of the Board.</p>
<p>In some cases, this approach has led me to depart from the views of my colleagues. At its September meeting, the FOMC voted to lower the target range for the federal funds rate, for the first time since we began tightening to combat inflation, by 1/2 percentage point to 4-3/4 to 5 percent. I dissented from that decision, preferring instead to lower the target range by 1/4 percentage point. In my statement published after the meeting, I agreed with the Committee's assessment that, given the progress we have seen since the middle of 2023 on both lowering inflation and cooling the labor market, it was appropriate to reflect this progress by beginning the process of recalibrating the policy stance toward a more neutral setting. As my statement noted, I preferred a smaller initial cut in the policy rate. With inflation continuing to hover well above our 2 percent goal, I saw the risk that the Committee's large policy action might be interpreted as a premature declaration of victory on our price-stability mandate. In addition, with the U.S. economy remaining strong, moving the policy rate down too quickly, in my view, would carry the risk of stoking demand unnecessarily and potentially reigniting inflationary pressures.</p>
<p>My dissent was notable in that the last dissenting vote from a Fed Board member on an FOMC vote occurred nearly 20 years ago. My dissent was guided by my view and interpretation of the available data and my understanding of the Fed's dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices, which I will discuss more in a moment.</p>
<p>Everyone in this room knows that experience is important. My experiences have shaped and reinforced my views on how policymakers can best serve the public&mdash;narrowly, including in monetary policy decisionmaking and the regulation of the banking industry, but also more broadly in thinking about policymaking in support of an agency's mission balanced with its extensive impact on the affected industry and the U.S. economy.</p>
<p><strong>A Pragmatic Approach to Policymaking</strong><br /><strong>A Goal-Oriented Approach</strong><br />In the past, I have discussed the role of policymaking from the perspective of a Federal Reserve Board member. But taking a step back, there are some broader themes relevant to agency policymaking more generally, themes that are useful beyond the context of the Federal Reserve. At a basic level, I think of this as a pragmatic approach. It requires tradeoffs to balance regulation while also not inhibiting economic growth.</p>
<p>The first question I like to ask when confronted with a policy issue is, "Why are we here?" You may recognize this question from Philosophy 101, but this question also applies to the exercise of executive authority by regulatory agencies. The Federal Reserve has extensive responsibilities, and equally extensive powers, but it must exercise these powers only in furtherance of specific goals established by statute. The sheer scope of the Fed's powers can present a temptation to go beyond the statutory authority. For example, to play a more active role in the allocation of credit, or to displace other sources of bank funding even when market sources of liquidity are functioning well. It could also include the temptation to venture into policy matters unrelated to the Fed's responsibilities that are better addressed by Congress or other policymakers (here, a push for banking sector climate change related regulation comes to mind). The goals Congress has laid out for the Fed are complicated and important. Congress should not expect the Federal Reserve, or any other agency for that matter, to solve problems beyond that agency's limited purpose. Doing so would contravene the intent and authority of Congress.</p>
<p>To begin, I will provide a few concrete examples of how the starting point for policy is the agency's mission, including in: (1) the execution of monetary policy, and (2) the conduct of banking regulation and supervision.</p>
<p>In conducting monetary policy, Congress has given us the dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. Achieving these goals has often proven challenging, particularly over the last several years, as these policy objectives can sometimes be in tension. Policy actions to tame inflation, like raising the target range for the federal funds rate, can have an adverse effect on employment. A critical input to the FOMC decisionmaking process is an analysis of economic conditions and outlook. The real economy continues to be strong, with solid momentum in economic activity, robust household spending and business investment, and a healthy labor market that remains near full employment. Although economic conditions have been supportive of our employment mandate, they have been unsatisfying for our price stability mandate as inflation continues to be elevated.</p>
<p>We have seen considerable progress in lowering inflation since early 2023, but progress seems to have stalled in recent months. The 12-month measure of core personal consumption expenditures inflation&mdash;which excludes food and energy prices&mdash;has moved sideways at around 2.7 percent since May, and the latest consumer and producer price index reports point to a similarly elevated or even higher reading for October. The persistently high core inflation largely reflects pressures on housing services prices, perhaps due to an increase in demand for affordable housing and an inelastic supply.</p>
<p>Gross domestic product (GDP) increased at a solid pace in the third quarter, maintaining the momentum from the previous four quarters. Growth continued to be driven by private domestic final purchases, as personal consumption, and retail sales in particular, strongly increased last quarter, more than offsetting further weakness in housing activity due to high mortgage rates. Retail sales continued to rise in October, even though Hurricanes Helene and Milton may have exerted a small drag on sales last month. The annual revision of the national income and product accounts confirmed that GDP has been providing the right signal about the ongoing strength in economic activity, as gross domestic income and personal income were revised up considerably for 2023 and the first half of this year.</p>
<p>The October employment report seems to have been affected by the recent hurricanes and the Boeing strike. It also featured the lowest response rate to the payroll survey in decades. After accounting for these special factors, it seems that payroll employment continued to increase in October at a pace close to the average monthly gain seen in the second and third quarters. The unemployment rate remained low at 4.1 percent in October, down from 4.3 percent in July. The labor force participation rate remains well below pre-pandemic levels and edged down further in October due to lower prime-age participation. While unemployment is notably higher than a year ago, it is still at a historically low level and below my and the Congressional Budget Office's estimates of full employment.</p>
<p>The labor market has loosened from the extremely tight conditions of the past few years. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has been close to the historically elevated pre-pandemic level in recent months. But there are still more available jobs than available workers, a condition that before 2018 has only occurred twice for a prolonged period since World War II, further signaling ongoing labor market strength. Wage growth has slowed further in recent months, but it continues to indicate a tight labor market.</p>
<p>The rise in the unemployment rate this year largely reflects weaker hiring, as job seekers entering or re-entering the labor force are taking longer to find work, while layoffs remain low. In addition to some cooling in labor demand, a mismatch between the skills of the new workers and available jobs could further raise unemployment, suggesting that higher unemployment has been partly driven by the stronger supply of workers.</p>
<p><strong>Monetary Policy</strong><br />In the monetary policy function, we rely on the best data available, but without question the data are imperfect. We also consider a range of possible future economic conditions to help inform our monetary policy decisionmaking, which requires that we make assumptions and predictions about the future. Looking back over time, our crystal ball has never been perfect at predicting the risks that may emerge, how those risks may influence economic conditions, and how that should be considered in analyzing our monetary policy goals. To illustrate this point in terms of recent events, we have not yet met our inflation goal and, as I noted earlier, progress in lowering inflation appears to have stalled.</p>
<p>I see greater risks to the price stability side of our mandate, especially while the labor market remains near full employment, but it is also possible that we could see a deterioration in labor market conditions. These predictions always come with a dose of humility, however, particularly because they rely on imperfect data. The labor market data have become increasingly difficult to interpret, as surveys and other measurements struggle to incorporate large numbers of new workers and to account for other influences that we do not yet fully understand and have not yet been able to accurately measure. As the dynamics of immigration and business creation and closures continue to change, it has become increasingly difficult to understand the payroll employment data. In light of the dissonance created by conflicting economic signals, measurement challenges, and data revisions, I remain cautious about taking signal from only a limited set of real-time data releases.</p>
<p>While the mandate for monetary policy is straightforward, its execution is complex. Our decisions are guided by our dual mandate, but arriving at them entails careful analysis of sometimes flawed data, and informed judgments about unknowable future conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Bank Regulation and Supervision</strong><br />In conducting bank regulation and supervision, the Federal Reserve promotes the safe and sound operation of individual banks, and the stability of the broader financial system. These bank regulatory goals have obvious synergies&mdash;individual banks operating in a safe and sound manner tends to create conditions that promote financial stability in the banking sector. The Fed's bank regulatory objectives include implicit tradeoffs: we aim to foster a banking system that is safe, sound, and efficient, while serving the U.S. economy, and facilitating economic growth. The objectives must also support the full breadth of the banking system from the very largest to the very smallest.</p>
<p>Striking a balance among these competing goals can certainly be a challenge, and policy views on where that balance should be struck may vary. We should approach the task of bank regulation with an understanding and appreciation of these tradeoffs, coupled with an affirmative acknowledgment that the banking system is an important driver of business formation, economic expansion, and opportunity. A banking system that is safe and sound yet irrelevant would not fulfill our regulatory objectives, but would be the inevitable outcome of following a path that strives for elimination of risks rather than promotion of effective risk management. Banks are unique individual businesses, not public utilities.</p>
<p>The pursuit of these bank regulatory goals requires an approach that considers a range of regulatory and supervisory tools, from the quantitative&mdash;like the setting of bank capital and liquidity requirements&mdash;to the more subjective&mdash;like evaluating bank management during the examination process. And while the goals themselves seem straightforward, the tools available and the complexity and evolution of the financial system over time present real challenges from a policymaking perspective.</p>
<p>When we consider drafting a new regulation, we should always ask "What problem would this new regulation solve?" Policymakers should exercise restraint in the promulgation of a new regulation, by articulating the problem it purports to solve and presenting an efficient way to address it. Identifying the problem that requires addressing often poses one of the most significant challenges. Ideally, the process would begin by identifying the problem, then move to an analysis of whether proposed solutions are within the agency's statutory authorities, and finally whether targeted changes to the regulatory framework could result in improvements, remediation of gaps, or elimination of redundant and unnecessary requirements.</p>
<p>But for a number of reasons, the problem identification process can result in misidentification of issues, and a resulting failure to prioritize the most important ones. Take for example the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), and the regulatory response. At its root, this bank's failure exposed significant flaws in the bank's management and the regulators' oversight and supervision. The interest rate and funding risks, rapid growth, and the idiosyncratic business model and concentrated customer base of the bank, were apparent and obvious. These risks were mismanaged by SVB and not acted on early enough by bank supervisors.</p>
<p>These were not the only factors contributing to the firm's failure, but these critical elements should have been the key priorities for the supervisory function to address after the bank's failure. And yet in the aftermath of SVB's demise, we have focused on regulatory proposals ranging from substantial increases in bank capital requirements, to pushing down global systemically important bank (G-SIB) and large bank requirements to much smaller firms, finding supervisory deficiencies in the management of well-capitalized and financially sound firms, and considering widespread changes to the funding and liquidity requirements and expectations that apply to all banks.</p>
<p>A crisis is not a regulatory blank check. In some ways, it presents heightened risks that should prompt us to show our work even more carefully. A deliberate, transparent, and fact-based approach to pursuing statutory objectives also serves the goal of avoiding the impression of pursuing unrelated policy goals, particularly those that venture into political concerns outside of an agency's purposes or functions. Promoting safety, soundness, and financial stability should not devolve into an exercise of regulatory allocation of credit&mdash;picking winners and losers&mdash;or promoting an ideological position through more open-ended processes like bank supervision and examination.</p>
<p><strong>Effective and Efficient Solutions</strong><br />Once we have a clear and thorough understanding of our statutory objectives and have a framework to identify issues, gaps, or redundancies, the next task is to focus on finding efficient solutions to those issues. In doing so, we should consider policy alternatives and perspectives that may differ from our past approach. We should also acknowledge that we may not have all the facts or information necessary to immediately identify an effective solution. Successful policymaking requires openness and humility, caution, and a deliberate approach.</p>
<p>With respect to monetary policy, uncertainty surrounding available data and the many variables that can affect future economic conditions suggest that we should pursue a cautious approach. At the most recent meeting in November, the Committee decided to take an additional step along the path of moving toward a more neutral policy setting. I agreed to support this action, since it aligns with my preference to lower the policy rate gradually, especially in light of elevated inflation and the uncertainty about the level of the neutral rate.</p>
<p>My estimate of the neutral policy rate is much higher than it was before the pandemic, and therefore we may be closer to a neutral policy stance than we currently think. I would prefer to proceed cautiously in bringing the policy rate down to better assess how far we are from the end point, while recognizing that we have not yet achieved our inflation goal and closely watching the evolution of the labor market. We should also not rule out the risk that the policy rate may attain or even fall below its neutral level before we achieve our price stability goal.</p>
<p>It is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. At each FOMC meeting, my colleagues and I will make our decisions based on the incoming data and the implications for and risks to the outlook and guided by the Fed's dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. During each intermeeting period, we typically receive a range of economic data and information. In addition to closely watching the incoming data, I meet with a broad range of contacts to discuss economic conditions as I assess the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance. Especially in light of the data measurement challenges that I mentioned earlier, engaging with contacts helps me interpret the signals provided by the data and gain a better understanding of how the economy is evolving.</p>
<p>Consistent with this pragmatic approach, I am pleased that the November post meeting statement included a flexible, data-dependent approach, providing the Committee with optionality in deciding future policy adjustments. As I noted earlier, my view is that inflation remains a concern, and I continue to see price stability as essential for fostering a strong labor market and an economy that works for everyone in the longer term.</p>
<p>In banking regulation, this pragmatic approach requires us to consider the costs and benefits of any proposed change, as well as incentive effects, impacts on markets, and potential unintended consequences. But it also means that we must consider the limits of regulatory responsibility&mdash;grounded by our statutory objectives&mdash;when taking regulatory action. In my view, these considerations apply beyond Federal Reserve policymaking to regulatory actions taken by any agency.</p>
<p>As I noted previously, statutory mandates guiding the Fed's bank regulatory responsibilities provide an important grounding for agency action. But they must be viewed in the broader context of promoting an effective and efficient banking system that supports market functioning and encourages economic growth, business creation and expansion, and opportunity. Our responsibility is not to look only at whether a proposal will promote greater safety and soundness, but to consider the broader context, including whether regulatory incentives will skew the allocation of credit, adversely affect capital markets, or push traditional banking activities outside of the banking system into less regulated non-banks.</p>
<p>Is the bank regulatory framework efficient? Does it allow banks sufficient freedom and flexibility to operate and meet customer needs? And importantly, are there areas within the approach to regulation and supervision that simply cannot be justified based on a cost-benefit analysis? The answer to the latter is "Yes." There are a number of areas where right-sizing regulation and our supervisory approach would be appropriate and can be done in a way that does not sacrifice safety and soundness or threaten financial stability.</p>
<p>Regulation is most effective when it strikes an appropriate balance between competing goals and objectives. In the banking system, this means operating in a safe, sound, and financially stable way, while also supporting economic growth and efficiency. When we fail to consider this broader context, we risk disincentivizing growth, imposing overly burdensome and unnecessary regulations, setting opaque and unreasonable expectations through the supervisory process, and forcing the inefficient allocation of capital.</p>
<p>Sometimes this debate escapes from the dusty offices of the banking regulators into plain view, as during the past year on the Basel III Endgame package of bank capital reforms. While this proposal prompted extensive comment from a wide range of commenters, it also inspired a negative television and radio advertising campaign, which is unprecedented for a relatively technical bank regulatory issue. But these ads highlighted an uncomfortable truth: the regulatory approach we took failed to consider or deliver a reasonable proposal, one aligned with the original Basel agreement yet suited to the particulars of the U.S. banking system. Instead, the proposal released last year opted for significant capital increases for some banks, in excess of 20 percent, departing significantly from the approach adopted by our international counterparts.</p>
<p>This public engagement has been useful, and it seems to have softened some of the over-calibrated positions underpinning the original capital reform proposal. But this level of public engagement and debate was also a byproduct of the rulemaking process. While regulatory overreach can threaten the credibility of agency action in the eyes of the public, a transparent process allows public commenters to pressure test and pushback on agency action.</p>
<p>However, when agencies overwhelm the process by publishing thousands of pages of rulemakings in a short period of time, the public's ability to provide meaningful feedback on our rules is compromised. Last year the federal financial agencies published over 5,000 pages of rules and proposals. And yet, even when the public is able to comment on these voluminous proposals, regulators often ignore this constructive feedback and move forward to publish final rules with minimal or no changes relative to their proposals, as with the Community Reinvestment Act rule.</p>
<p>Maintenance of an existing regulatory framework is not glamorous but is perhaps one of the more important agency functions to ensure that the framework is striking the right balance between promoting a strong banking system and supporting economic growth. This requires reviewing and updating regulations to ensure that prior agency actions continue to address problems efficiently as industries and conditions change.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241120a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;When agencies prioritize the creation of new regulation in the absence of a statutory mandate, harmful and unintended consequences can result. One such example is the adverse effects of regulatory constraints on Treasury market functioning. Rules like the Supplementary Leverage Ratio, the G-SIB Surcharge, and the Liquidity Coverage Ratio pose known and identified constraints on the Treasury market that may contribute to future stress and market disruption if left unaddressed.</p>
<p>Finally, while transparency&mdash;like that intended by the rulemaking process&mdash;can lead to better public engagement and outcomes, it is important that agency actions are transparent even when not legally mandated. The most obvious opportunity for additional transparency in the banking framework is in supervision. Supervision by its nature involves confidential and detailed inquiries into bank operations, with examiners evaluating quantitative measures like capital and liquidity, while making judgmental assessments of the activities and risks of the institution, and its risk-management approach. Supervisory expectations should not surprise regulated firms, and yet transparency of these expectations is often challenging to achieve. In fact, since the failure of SVB supervisory surprises have become more common in bank examinations.</p>
<p>In light of the recent Supreme Court cases regarding agency actions, agencies should respond in a way that furthers the goals of transparency and accountability, and act as a check on regulatory overreach. The elimination of&nbsp;<em>Chevron</em>&nbsp;deference has the potential to transform agency rulemakings positively&mdash;in a way that promotes the pragmatic approach I outlined in this discussion. The same considerations we follow in the pursuit of our statutory objectives could help support rulemakings that are built upon a stronger factual and analytical basis, with a thorough and more comprehensive explanation of an agency's policy approach.</p>
<p><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong><br />While my remarks today have largely focused on Federal Reserve responsibilities, a pragmatic approach has broader applicability. Agencies can build public support for their activities by following these simple principles&mdash;a rigorous focus on statutory objectives, a foundation based on facts and careful analysis in forming policy, crafting efficient solutions, and public transparency and accountability. Agencies and their regulated businesses will benefit from a rigorous process that considers different perspectives, the intended and unintended consequences of decisions, and the costs and benefits of actions. The ability of the banking system to finance the future growth of the U.S. economy hinges upon our ability and willingness to shift our approach to regulation and supervisory oversight. A pragmatic approach to policymaking will better enable the U.S. economy to continue to grow now and into the future.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Three Senior Executives In Two Actions Alleging Massive Bribery Scheme Involving Indian Energy Companies Adani Green And Azure Power - Adani Green’s Note Offering Raised $175 Million From U.S. Investors While Bribery Scheme Was In Progress</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-charges-three-senior-executives-in-two-actions-alleging-massive-bribery-sche/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-charges-three-senior-executives-in-two-actions-alleging-massive-bribery-sche/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Gautam Adani and Sagar Adani, executives of Adani Green Energy Ltd., and Cyril Cabanes, an executive of Azure Power Global Ltd., for conduct arising out of a massive bribery scheme. According to the SEC&rsquo;s allegations, the bribery scheme was orchestrated to enable the two renewable energy companies to capitalize on a multi-billion-dollar solar energy project that the companies had been awarded by the Indian government.&nbsp;During the alleged scheme, Adani Green raised more than $175 million from U.S. investors and Azure Power&rsquo;s stock was traded on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>In one action, the SEC charged Gautam Adani, Chairman of Adani Green&rsquo;s Board of Directors, and his nephew, Sagar Adani, Executive Director of Adani Green&rsquo;s Board. According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Gautam and Sagar Adani orchestrated a bribery scheme that involved paying or promising to pay the equivalent of hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to Indian government officials to secure their commitment to purchase energy at above-market rates that would benefit Adani green and Azure Power. As alleged, Gautam and Sagar Adani were engaged in the bribery scheme during a September 2021 note offering by Adani Green that raised $750 million, including approximately $175 million from U.S. investors. The Adani Green offering materials included statements about its anti-corruption and anti-bribery efforts that were materially false or misleading in light of Gautam and Sagar Adani&rsquo;s conduct.</p>
<p>In the other action, the SEC charged Cyril Cabanes, a former member of Azure Power&rsquo;s Board of Directors, with Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) violations for his role in the alleged bribery scheme. According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Cabanes allegedly facilitated the authorization of bribes in furtherance of the scheme while in the United States and abroad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As alleged, Gautam and Sagar Adani induced U.S. investors to buy Adani Green bonds through an offering process that misrepresented not only that Adani Green had a robust anti-bribery compliance program but also that the company&rsquo;s senior management had not and would not pay or promise to pay bribes, and Cyril Cabanes participated in the underlying bribery scheme while serving as director of a U.S. public company,&rdquo; said Sanjay Wadhwa, Acting Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;We will continue to vigorously pursue and hold individuals, including senior corporate officers and directors, accountable when they violate our securities laws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint against Gautam and Sagar Adani charges them with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and officer and director bars. The SEC&rsquo;s complaint against Cabanes charges him with violating the FCPA and seeks a permanent injunction, a civil penalty, and an officer and director bar. Both complaints were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York.</p>
<p>In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Eastern District of New York today unsealed criminal charges against Gautam and Sagar Adani and Cabanes, among other individuals connected to Adani Green and Azure Power.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s ongoing investigation regarding Adani Green is being conducted by Nicholas Karasimas, Stewart Gilson, Christopher M. Colorado, and Alison Conn of the New York Regional Office. It is being supervised by Tejal D. Shah. The litigation will be led by Mr. Colorado, Mr. Karasimas, and Mr. Gilson, under the supervision of Daniel Loss. The FCPA investigation is being conducted by Eric Heining, Patrick Noone, and Paul Block of the SEC&rsquo;s FCPA Unit. The litigation will be led by Boston Regional Office Trial Counsel Martin Healey. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office, the Fraud Section of the U.S. Department of Justice, and the FBI.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) today published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/securities-law/instruments-rules-policies/1/11-7100/osc-staff-notice-11-7100-delegation-registration-function-ciro" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_self">notice</a>&nbsp;with details about its plans to delegate the registration function for investment dealers and mutual fund dealers, and the individuals who act on behalf of mutual fund dealers, to the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO). Re-alignment of certain functions between OSC and CIRO is one of the priorities identified in the OSC&rsquo;s proposed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/securities-law/instruments-rules-policies/1/11-799/osc-notice-11-799-statement-priorities-request-comments-regarding-statement-priorities-fiscal-year" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_self">Statement of Priorities for 2025-2026</a>&nbsp;published earlier today.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Transitioning these registration functions to CIRO is a positive step towards a more modern and harmonized regulatory system for market participants and investors,&rdquo; said Grant Vingoe, CEO of the OSC. &ldquo;This move will streamline the registration process, reducing the burden for registrants in Ontario, while the OSC&rsquo;s continued oversight of CIRO will involve a strong degree of enhanced investor protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>CIRO is already responsible for the registration of individuals who act on behalf of investment dealers, and this will continue. The planned expanded delegation, subject to required regulatory approvals, would be effective Spring 2025.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Delivering a more efficient registration framework is one of six ways in which CIRO&rsquo;s Strategic Plan brings value to investors, to the industry which serves them and to Canadians as a whole,&rdquo; said Andrew J. Kriegler, President and CEO of CIRO. &ldquo;CIRO will work with the OSC to ensure a smooth transition for registrants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The delegation of the registration function for investment dealers and mutual fund dealers was one of the key recommendations in the Capital Markets Modernization Taskforce (Taskforce) report published in January 2021. Delegation of the registration function to CIRO will not result in a change to the key information that firms and individuals are required to submit with respect to applications for registration and updates to registration information.</p>
<p>The mandate of the OSC is to provide protection to investors from unfair, improper or fraudulent practices, to foster fair, efficient and competitive capital markets and confidence in the capital markets, to foster capital formation, and to contribute to the stability of the financial system and the reduction of systemic risk. Investors are urged to check the registration of any persons or company offering an investment opportunity and to review the OSC investor materials available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_self">www.osc.ca</a>.</p>
<p>The Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) is the national self-regulatory organization that oversees all investment dealers, mutual fund dealers and trading activity on Canada's debt and equity marketplaces. CIRO is committed to the protection of investors, providing efficient and consistent regulation, and building Canadians' trust in financial regulation and the people managing their investments.

<title>Canadian Securities Regulators Explore Streamlining Registration Delegation To The Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) announced today its members will be considering delegating certain registration functions and powers to the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO). CIRO currently performs certain registration functions for some CSA members under delegated authority, and this further delegation would create a consistent and harmonized approach in registration processes for CIRO members across Canada.<br /><br />The proposed delegation model may be restricted to routine applications of investment dealers and mutual fund dealers (firms and individuals) in some jurisdictions. Delegating registration functions would allow CSA members to focus on the oversight of CIRO, regulatory policy, addressing novel issues, and granting exemptive relief applications. Portfolio managers, restricted portfolio managers, investment fund managers, exempt markets dealers, restricted dealers, and scholarship plan dealers (firms and individuals) would continue to register with, and be overseen by, their local securities regulator.<br /><br />Aligned with the CSA&rsquo;s objective outlined in its 2022-2025 Business Plan, these new delegated functions and powers would create efficiencies and reduce regulatory burden by providing certain market participants with a single and centralized registration process.<br /><br />&ldquo;In 2023, we sought to modernize the Canadian self-regulatory framework in a way that adapts to evolving capital markets and responds to the needs of market participants and investors alike. Today&rsquo;s announcement marks a natural progression of those efforts and a continued commitment to our goal of strengthening Canada&rsquo;s capital markets regulatory system,&rdquo; said Stan Magidson, CSA Chair and Chair of the Alberta Securities Commission. &ldquo;We expect this initiative would benefit market participants through a more streamlined process and allow regulators to prioritize policy developments that continue to foster healthy, fair and efficient markets.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;CIRO, like all regulators, has a responsibility to deliver regulation efficiently, effectively and remove duplication. The CSA&rsquo;s consideration of streamlining registration delegation supports our strategic objective to deliver a more effective registration framework,&rdquo; said Andrew J. Kriegler, President and CEO of CIRO. &ldquo;As CIRO continues to deliver on its strategic plan, I look forward to further collaborating with the CSA to improve registration standards across Canada. We will work with CSA members that decide to delegate, under their respective timelines, to support a smooth delegation process.&rdquo;<br /><br />Subject to obtaining the necessary approvals, delegation orders or proposed rule amendments would be issued by CSA members locally in due course.<br /><br />The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) issued a separate news release today with respect to its plans on this matter.<br /><br />The CSA, the council of the securities regulators of Canada&rsquo;s provinces and territories, co-ordinates and harmonizes regulation for the Canadian capital markets.<br /><br />The Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) is the national self-regulatory organization that oversees all investment dealers, mutual fund dealers and trading activity on Canada's debt and equity marketplaces. CIRO is committed to the protection of investors, providing efficient and consistent regulation, and building Canadians' trust in financial regulation and the people managing their investments.</p>

<title>Finansinspektionen: Stability In The Financial System (2024:2): Improved Outlook, But Risk Of Set-Backs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The outlook for financial stability has improved somewhat in the past six months. Sweden continues to experience a mild economic downturn, but interest rate cuts are contributing to improved optimism about the future. At the same time, the uncertain global economic and geopolitical situation is leading to heightened risks, in part in the form of cyber attacks. These are the conclusions of FI&rsquo;s second stability report for the year.</span></p>
<div class="editor-content">
<p>Sweden is experiencing a mild economic downturn, and unemployment is relatively high. The Riksbank's interest rate cuts are contributing to increased optimism about the future, primarily among households. The banks have high resilience, and credit growth in the financial system is dampened.</p>
<p>Household finances continue to be under pressure, and interest expenses are high. Many households are restrictive in their consumption. However, there is a clear expectation of lower interest rates going forward, and consumption will probably pick up again in the next year. Therefore, FI makes the overall assessment that stability in the financial system has improved somewhat.</p>
<p>At the same time, commercial real estate firms have continued to adapt to the higher interest rates. Recently, their access to financing has improved. Firms with high indebtedness need to continue to reduce their debt and strengthen their financial position.</p>
<p>"We see a slow recovery, but there is a risk of set-backs. The situation is vulnerable given the uncertain economic and geopolitical environment. The risk of a geopolitical deterioration leads to an adverse impact on global trade and energy prices," says Daniel Barr, Director General at FI.</p>
<h2>Cyber attacks can increase further</h2>
<p>A deterioration in global security increases the risk of attacks on the financial system. Such attacks can occur in different ways, for example as cyber attacks, disinformation, infiltration and sabotage.</p>
<p>"In our supervision of the financial market, we are seeing that the resilience of financial firms has not been built up at the same rate as the operations have been digitalised. It is quite simply time for firms to strengthen their ability to protect their operations. How firms are working with this is also something that we will prioritise in our supervision going forward", says Daniel Barr.</p>
<p>Since the financial system is both concentrated and interconnected, the impact of an attack on one actor can quickly spread to other actors and, in a worst-case scenario, lead to extensive interruptions. This, in turn, could have a major impact on financial stability.</p>
<h2>New regulations pending</h2>
<p>One key step in strengthening the resilience of financial firms is the DORA regulation, which enters into force in January next year. Under these EU regulations, the requirements on how financial firms handle cyber risks will be raised and harmonised.</p>

<title>Federal Reserve Board: Speech By Governor Cook On The Economic Outlook At The University Of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/federal-reserve-board-speech-by-governor-cook-on-the-economic-outlook-at-the-un/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Christa. It is wonderful to be with you here on the University of Virginia's beautiful campus. This is my first visit here as an adult. As a child, I was fortunate enough to be able to attend the commencement ceremony of my aunt and uncle, who received their doctoral degrees from UVA several decades ago. My family and I are grateful to the University of Virginia for all the educational opportunities it has afforded us over the years. I look forward to connecting with many of the exceptional students and faculty during my visit.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241120a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>As a member of the Federal Reserve Board, I always find it a pleasure to hear from people in communities across the country and to share some views of my own. At the Fed, I am committed to pursuing the best policy to achieve the dual-mandate goals given to us by Congress of maximum employment and price stability. Today, I would like to share with you my outlook for the economy, including some international comparisons of productivity and inflation, and offer my views on U.S. monetary policy.</p>
<p>Broadly, I view the economy as being in a good position. Inflation has substantially eased from its peak in mid-2022, though core inflation remains somewhat elevated. Unemployment remains historically low, but the labor market is no longer overheated. Economic growth has been robust this year, and I forecast the expansion will continue. Looking ahead, I remain confident that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent objective, even if the path is occasionally bumpy. Meanwhile, I see employment risks as weighted to the downside, but those risks appear to have diminished somewhat in recent months.</p>
<p><strong>Inflation</strong><br />Inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, has eased notably from a peak of 7.2 percent in June 2022. Estimates based on the consumer price index and other data released last week indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in October. Core PCE prices&mdash;which exclude the volatile food and energy categories&mdash;increased 2.8 percent, down from a peak of 5.6 percent in February 2022.</p>
<p>Despite this significant progress on disinflation, the elevated core figure suggests that we have further to go before credibly achieving our inflation target of 2 percent. Although most price indicators suggest that progress is ongoing, I anticipate bumps along the road. For instance, when measured on a monthly basis, estimated core PCE inflation stepped up in September and October after four months of lower readings. Even so, I still see headline and core inflation falling to 2.2 percent next year and to lower levels after that. Moreover, disinflation has been widespread across a broad range of goods and services. Taken together, recent data support my view that the disinflationary process is continuing.</p>
<p>Thinking of the components of inflation, core goods and core services inflation excluding housing are now at rates consistent with previous periods when inflation averaged about 2 percent. As a result, housing services account for most of the excess of core inflation over our target. Despite a slowing in rent increases for new tenants over the past two years, recent research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland suggests that existing rents for continuing tenants may still be notably below new tenant rent levels.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241120a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;Existing rents rising toward market rent levels is keeping housing services inflation temporarily elevated. My view is that housing services inflation will come down gradually over the next two years as the earlier slowing of growth in new tenant rent feeds through into the overall rate.</p>
<p>Recently, other inflation factors have been subdued. Core import prices have continued to step down from the surprisingly strong pace in the first half of the year. Global oil prices have fluctuated, largely in response to developments in the Middle East, but are back near the lows reached in late summer.</p>
<p>My confidence in continued disinflation is further reinforced by the moderation in wage growth. The employment cost index report showed that hourly compensation for private-sector workers rose at a 2.9 percent annual rate in the third quarter, the lowest since 2021. The 12-month change in average hourly earnings in October was 4 percent, down from 4.3 percent during the previous year. The wage premium for job switchers, a significant contributor to wage growth early in the pandemic recovery, has largely disappeared, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.</p>
<p><strong>Labor Market</strong><br />Turning to the labor market, on balance, recent data suggest that it remains solid. Monthly increases in firms' payrolls have slowed from earlier this year but are consistent with only a gradual cooling in the labor market. The October employment report did show a sharp slowdown in job creation, but that was largely due to the temporary effects of recent hurricanes and a labor strike.</p>
<p>While economists and forecasters often focus on aggregate data for the national economy, it is important to acknowledge that hurricanes Helene and Milton resulted in the tragic loss of life and devastating destruction in many parts of the country, including some here in the state of Virginia. My thoughts remain with those affected communities. The Federal Reserve System remains in touch with these communities to help the financial institutions that serve them in any way we can.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241120a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>The broader trend I see is that national job growth is solid but perhaps not quite strong enough to keep unemployment at the current low rate. Net hiring so far this year is running somewhat below estimates for what economists call the breakeven pace, or the rate of hiring needed to keep the unemployment rate constant, when accounting for changes to the size of the labor force. With job growth coming in below the breakeven pace, which was likely more than 200,000 jobs a month over the past year, the unemployment rate has risen from a historical low of 3.4 percent in April 2023 to 4.1 percent in October.</p>
<p>Other data are also consistent with a gradual cooling in labor demand. The vacancies-to-unemployment ratio has fallen from a peak of 2.0 in 2022 to 1.1 in September, slightly below where it stood just before the pandemic. The rate at which workers are quitting their jobs continued to slide in recent months to well below its pre-pandemic level, which could indicate that workers are less optimistic about finding a better job should they leave their current role. Notably, firms' hiring rates and hiring plans remain subdued, while workers report reduced availability of jobs. Although layoffs remain low, less hiring makes it harder for labor market entrants and reentrants to find jobs. Also, our contacts report that employers are being more selective, waiting to find workers with the skills they seek, rather than pursuing a hire-and-train strategy.</p>
<p>Overall, I see a labor market that has largely normalized after being overheated because of pandemic disruptions and dislocations. The labor market is in a good position&mdash;with the supply and demand for workers being roughly in balance&mdash;such that it is no longer a source of inflationary pressure in the economy. I will continue to watch incoming data carefully and remain attuned to signs of undesirable further cooling in the labor market.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Output and Productivity Growth</strong><br />Along with generally solid labor market data and moderating inflation, recent indicators show economic activity moving along at a strong pace. Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at a 2.8 percent annual rate in the third quarter, consistent with the solid growth recorded in the first half of the year.</p>
<p>American consumers remain resilient, with broad-based gains in household spending on both goods and services. This supports broader economic growth because consumer spending constitutes roughly two-thirds of GDP. Spending at retailers and restaurants rose 2.8 percent in October from a year earlier, a faster 12-month rate of increase than the prior two months. Recent data revisions show that household income and savings have been higher than previously thought, improving the outlook for consumer spending and GDP growth.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that the U.S. economy has been growing rapidly even as inflation has been declining significantly over the past two years. One reason why this solid growth could be occurring is that potential growth, or the maximum rate at which an economy can grow without causing inflation over the medium term, may have increased.</p>
<p>One factor that appears to have supported both potential and actual growth is a faster pace of productivity gains. Recent data indicate labor productivity has grown at a 1.8 percent annual rate since the end of 2019, surpassing its 1.5 percent growth rate over the previous 12 years. Several forces could have boosted productivity in recent years. As I discussed in a recent speech in South Carolina, the U.S. experienced a surge in new business formation since the start of the pandemic.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241120a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;These newer firms are more likely to innovate and adopt new technologies and business processes, thus boosting productivity.</p>
<p>Two other factors boosting productivity relate in part to changes in the U.S. economy during and after the pandemic. Worker reallocation across jobs and locations surged early in the pandemic and remained high for some time. There is some research suggesting that such reallocation resulted in better and more productive matches between some workers and jobs, thus raising labor productivity.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241120a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;At the same time, severe labor shortages during the post-pandemic recovery spurred many businesses to invest in labor-saving technologies and to restructure aspects of production more efficiently, which may also have given at least a one-time boost to productivity.</p>
<p>More broadly, the continued sizable investment in new technologies may promote ongoing strength in productivity growth. Much of this investment has gone toward artificial intelligence (AI), which has the potential to transform many aspects of the economy and job market, as I discussed in speeches earlier this fall.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241120a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a><span>,</span><a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241120a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a></p>
<p><strong>International Comparisons</strong><br />Compared with productivity abroad, recent U.S. productivity growth looks quite exceptional. As shown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/cook-20241120-fig1.PNG" id="fig1">figure 1</a>, before the pandemic, the U.S. had faster productivity growth&mdash;as shown by the green portion of the bars&mdash;than other advanced economies, but the difference was small. Since the pandemic, however, U.S. productivity growth has far exceeded that of Europe, Canada, and Australia, as shown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/cook-20241120-fig2.PNG" id="fig2">figure 2</a>. To explain this notable outperformance, some have highlighted our country's relatively flexible labor market and greater business dynamism compared with these other economies.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241120a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;Moreover, to the extent that investment in technology has been a driver of cross-country differences, it is notable that private investment in AI has been much higher in the U.S. than abroad.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241120a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a></p>
<p>This productivity outperformance is likely a main reason why U.S. GDP growth has been stronger than that of foreign economies; the path of inflation, however, has largely been similar across the globe. As shown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/cook-20241120-fig3.PNG" id="fig3">figure 3</a>, inflation in the U.S. and abroad rose sharply in 2021 and 2022, amid supply bottlenecks and a post-pandemic recovery in demand. Inflation reached a higher peak in European economies that were most directly affected by the energy price shock from Russia's war in Ukraine. Inflation has since declined globally as supply normalized and monetary policy tightening restrained demand. U.S. inflation, as shown by the black line, is nearly back to its 2 percent target level, while core inflation, as shown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/cook-20241120-fig4.PNG" id="fig4">figure 4</a>, has come down but remains somewhat above 2 percent.</p>
<p><strong>Monetary Policy</strong><br />As I stated, the totality of the data suggests that a disinflationary trajectory is still in place and that the labor market is gradually cooling. As such, I view the risks to achieving the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability as being roughly in balance. Consistent with those balanced risks, in my view, it likely will be appropriate to move the policy rate toward a more neutral stance over time.</p>
<p>My colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee and I acted earlier this month to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point. That action came after we reduced the rate by 1/2 percentage point in September. Together, these moves were a strong step toward removing policy restriction.</p>
<p>Going forward, I still see the direction of the appropriate policy rate path to be downward, but the magnitude and timing of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. I do not view policy as being on a preset course, and I am ready to respond to a changing outlook. In fact, I find it helpful to consider a range of scenarios when thinking about the path of policy.</p>
<p>If the labor market and inflation continue to progress in line with my forecast, it could well be appropriate to lower the level of policy restriction over time until we near the neutral rate of interest, or the point when monetary policy is neither stimulating nor restricting economic growth. However, if inflation progress slows and the labor market remains solid, I could see a scenario where we pause along the downward path. Alternatively, should the labor market weaken in a substantial way, it could be appropriate to ease policy more quickly.</p>
<p>My policy decisions will be guided by our dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices, and I know delivering on those goals will produce the best economic outcomes for all Americans.</p>
<p>Thank you for having me here today. I look forward to your questions.</p>

<title>Basel Committee Reaffirms Expectation To Implement Basel III; Finalises Guidelines To Strengthen Banks' Counterparty Credit Risk Management; And Progresses Work To Strengthen Supervisory Effectiveness</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/basel-committee-reaffirms-expectation-to-implement-basel-iii-finalises-guidelin/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li>Unanimously reaffirms expectation to implement Basel III in full, consistently and as soon as possible.</li>
<li>Finalises guidelines for strengthening banks' counterparty credit risk management.</li>
<li>Progresses work to strengthen supervisory effectiveness following the 2023 banking turmoil.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision met in Basel on 19&ndash;20 November 2024 to take stock of recent market developments and risks to the global banking system, and to discuss a range of policy and supervisory initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation of Basel III</strong></p>
<p>Committee members unanimously reaffirmed their expectation of implementing all aspects of the Basel III framework in full, consistently and as soon as possible. Such a commitment was also recently&nbsp;<a class="external" href="http://www.g20.org/pt-br/documentos/trilha-de-financas/4th-fmcbg-communique.pdf/@@download/file" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span class="firstword">reiterated</span></a>&nbsp;by G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors.</p>
<p>As part of its Regulatory Consistency Assessment Programme, the Committee reviewed and approved the assessment reports on the implementation of the Net Stable Funding Ratio and large exposures framework by Korea. The reports will be published next month.</p>
<p><strong>Non-bank financial intermediation</strong></p>
<p>The Committee discussed banks' interconnections with non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI). NBFI continues to grow and evolve in ways that could present risks and vulnerabilities to the global banking system. Banks are connected to NBFI through a wide range of direct and indirect activities and services. Data gaps hinder the effective measurement and management of risks to banks from their NBFI interconnections. Banks and supervisors must continue to be vigilant to these risks and to better gauge the range and materiality of interconnections.</p>
<p>The Committee reviewed the comments received to its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d574.htm"><span class="firstword">consultation</span></a>&nbsp;on guidelines for counterparty credit risk management. Building on the feedback received, it approved a final set of guidelines that seek to address weaknesses in banks' counterparty credit risk management exposed in recent episodes of NBFI distress. The finalised guidelines will be published next month.</p>
<p><strong>2023 banking turmoil</strong></p>
<p>The Committee discussed its work to develop a suite of practical tools to support supervisors in their day-to-day work as part of its efforts to strengthen supervisory effectiveness in light of the lessons learned from last year's banking turmoil. This work covers the supervision of liquidity risk and interest rate risk in the banking book, the assessment of the sustainability of banks' business models, and the importance of effective supervisory judgment. An update on this work will be published in early 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Macroprudential policy</strong></p>
<p>The Committee took stock of the range of practices adopted by jurisdictions that set a positive rate for the Basel III countercyclical capital buffer when risks are judged to be neither subdued nor elevated. As previously&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs_nl30.htm"><span class="firstword">noted</span></a>, the Committee supports and sees benefits in the ability of authorities to set such a positive "cycle-neutral" rate. To that end, it agreed to publish a report on existing practices to support jurisdictions that wish to apply positive cycle-neutral rates. The report will be published next month.</p>
<p>Members also discussed the comments received to the Committee's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d571.htm"><span class="firstword">consultation</span></a>&nbsp;on measures to address "window-dressing" behaviour by some banks in the context of the framework for global systemically important banks. Work on addressing such behaviour will continue in 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Climate-related financial risks</strong></p>
<p>The Committee continued to review its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d560.htm"><span class="firstword">proposed</span></a>&nbsp;Pillar 3 disclosure framework for climate-related financial risks. It anticipates the finalisation of this work in the first half of 2025.</p>

<ul>
<li><span>Experts highlight that a listing on BME Growth is an ideal option for financing small and medium-sized Latin American companies looking to grow in Europe</span></li>
<li><span>The benchmark event for investment between Europe and Latin America highlights the fact that the region has become the fourth largest direct investor in Spain</span></li>
<li><span>The second day of the Forum, which brought together more than 400 attendees, also focused on renewable energy and the role of technology in driving the region forward</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The 26th edition of the Latibex Forum ended today at the Palacio de la Bolsa de Madrid. During the two-day event, 250 meetings were held between more than 40 companies from Latin America and Spain and 60 investors, 33% of which were international (most of them from Great Britain, France and Switzerland). In total, the event was attended by more than 400 people.</p>
<p>One of the main themes of this year's edition of the benchmark event for investment between Europe and Latin America is the growth of Ibero-American investment in Spain. In fact, today's event highlighted the fact that in 2023 the region became the fourth largest direct investor in Spain, behind only the United States, the United Kingdom and France, and ahead of European countries such as Germany and Italy, according to a recent ICEX report.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are very satisfied with the outcome of this 26th edition of the Latibex Forum. The event has once again provided highly valued meetings for both companies and investors, at a particularly crucial time for the region. This year has highlighted the important link between both sides of the Atlantic and the decisive role that stock markets can play in channelling Latin American investors into Europe, with Spain as a natural entry point&rsquo;, explained Jes&uacute;s Gonz&aacute;lez, Managing Director of Latibex, BME Growth and BME Scaleup.</p>
<p>The second session of the Forum featured three panels. The panel on the role of Ibero-American companies in investment in Spain was divided into two parts. Firstly, the debate on direct investment was moderated by Adri&aacute;n Blanco (ICEX) and included interventions by Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a Jim&eacute;nez (Clarel, recently acquired by the Colombian Trinity Group) and Manuel Balmaseda (Cunef). All three spoke about how the cultural links between Spain and Latin America make Spain the natural entry point for companies from that region into Europe. O Among the data they shared, it is worth highlighting that one out of every ten euros invested in Spain from abroad comes from the region, there are 20 Latin American countries investing in Spain and their main sectors are digitalisation, financial services and food.</p>
<p>The section on sources of financing, moderated by Juan Aguayo (Cuatrecasas), included presentations by Jes&uacute;s Gonz&aacute;lez, Managing Director of BME Growth, Christian Struve (Fracttal), and Mirari Barrena (Armanext). The experts stressed that financial markets are a source of financing compatible with other sources, as demonstrated by the more than 7,000 million euros in more than 500 capital increases carried out by BME Growth companies since the birth of this market.</p>
<p>The panellists agreed that more and more small and medium-sized Latin American companies planning to expand their business in Europe want to access the financial markets on this side of the Atlantic. They also highlighted that growth markets such as BME Growth or BME Scaleup are ideal options for them because of their requirements tailored to the needs of small and medium-sized companies, the infrastructure offered by BME, its more than two decades of relationship with the Latin American markets, its competitive costs, the reputation of being a listed company and legal certainty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A panel on renewable energies was also held to analyse the challenges and prospects of the sector in the region. Renato Rocha (Neonergia), Jos&eacute; Oliv&eacute; (Cox) and &Aacute;lvaro Vilasante (Grupo Energ&iacute;a Bogot&aacute;) spoke, moderated by V&iacute;ctor Peir&oacute; (GVC Gaesco). The panel discussed, among other issues, the development of the green transition in the region, the importance of water management, the growing liberalisation of the energy sector in Brazil and the growth opportunities for companies in the sector in other countries such as Colombia, Chile and Peru.</p>
<p>Finally, to conclude the second day and close the Latibex Forum, Justo Hidalgo (Adigital) moderated the panel &lsquo;Strategic Technologies (AI, cloud, cybersecurity) for the development of the region&rsquo; with the participation of Antonio Arancibia (Movizzon) and Alfredo Cebri&aacute;n (Cuatroochenta). Among other issues, the three discussed the need for a developed strategic technology sector to foster economic growth in the region, with a special focus on cybersecurity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Santander and Cuatrecasas are the main sponsors of the Forum and Morningstar, CFA Society Spain, ICEX and WTV. will be sponsors. Instituto BME, Atribus and the Spanish Institute of Analysts will be collaborators.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Introduction</span></p>
<p>Distinguished guests, members of the Reit Association of Singapore, and fellow colleagues. Thank you for having me yet again. In all my past REITAS engagements, I have always tried to keep the topic current. One year, I spoke about Reits becoming less Singapore centric and looking more toward overseas assets. In another year, I talked about higher interest rates and their impact on Reits&rsquo; leverage levels. This year will be no different. I intend to touch on another hot button topic: namely internalisation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The shift towards internalisation</span></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, not to talk about internalisation would be to ignore the elephant in the room. &nbsp;I know my audience today includes many external Reit managers who are watching this development very closely. My remarks will approach the subject with you in mind.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditionally, Singapore-listed Reits, or S-Reits, have been managed by external managers owned by sponsors. Sponsors like this model because they can recycle capital, retain control over the properties, and earn recurring income through management fees. Unitholders are willing to accept this model because, in return, sponsors can provide a pipeline of properties for the Reit to acquire and help secure better financing terms. And indeed, many of our Reits have grown tremendously over the past 20 years because of our sponsors&rsquo; efforts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, like all things, the external manger model isn&rsquo;t perfect. It has given rise to a number of questions including:</p>
<ul>
<li>alignment of interest of the unitholders and managers in terms of the fees paid, whether they be in units or cash,&nbsp;</li>
<li>how fees should be structured: namely, whether fees should be based on distribution per unit or net property income, and</li>
<li>concern that managers may be entering into M&amp;A deals to benefit their sponsors or simply to earn more fees.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These issues have been around for a while. The option of internalisation has also been there since Day One. So why are we only seeing internalisation efforts now? I believe 3 factors account for this trend:</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the recent emphasis on enhancing shareholder value or in the case of Reits, unitholder value, that has been gaining momentum particularly in this region. We ourselves have recognised this demand, which is why our recent regulatory emphasis has been on what we call value focus initiatives to facilitate enhancing shareholder value. Unitholders want to see more value from their sponsors and managers, in return for the fees they are paying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second is the rise in interest rates prior to the most recent months. Higher rates as you well know, make financing conditions difficult. Unitholders become more sensitive to costs. They then start to question whether external managers and sponsors are adding enough value to justify their costs.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unitholders are more ready to remove external managers if they feel the value added does not outweigh the management fees. Indeed, internalisation allows unitholders to have greater control over the manager in addition to potentially saving on fees. This shift reflects a broader desire for more direct oversight and accountability which I will elaborate on later.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, REITs are much bigger now. As I mentioned earlier, the conventional thinking in the past was that external managers and sponsors add a lot of value by providing a pipeline of properties and securing better financing terms. Today, what I am hearing from unitholders of big Reits is: &ldquo;Our Reit is now so big. Maybe we no longer need to depend on the sponsor for properties and can secure good financing terms on our own.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Internalisation as one form of market discipline</span></p>
<p>9. &nbsp; &nbsp; So, what are the implications for our externally managed Reits? Again, I can see 3 trends that are shaping the situation.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; &nbsp;First, in general as a stock market matures, investors develop stronger views, are more willing to voice these views and put them to a vote. This trend is unlikely to go away. Indeed, this is the level of market discipline every mature market needs so we as regulators, very much want to encourage this. We believe more active investors and effective market discipline will encourage our Reits to improve their operational performance and returns to unitholders.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp; In the same way that we have seen shareholders of listed companies requisition for meetings to put through the changes that they want, Reit unitholders may see the internalisation process as an opportunity to express their views and hold external manager accountable.&nbsp;Simply put, internalisation is but one form of market discipline for unitholders to keep Reit managers on their toes and ensure they create value.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, unlike companies, it is the sponsors who appoint all the directors to the boards of external Reit managers. I understand for a small number of Reits, the directors of their REIT managers are put up for confirmation by the unitholders. Some Reits like Parkway Life, Keppel DC, and Starhill Global subject their REIT manager directors to unitholders&rsquo; endorsement.&nbsp; But for the others, the fact that unitholders have no control over the directors of the external Reit managers may have led to unintended consequences. It may be that when unitholders want change, they feel they have little or no say over the board of the REIT manager. This may perhaps have led them to choose the nuclear option of removing the REIT manager altogether. By this I mean that when unitholders are unhappy, they are short of intermediate options and have no choice but to push the red button. In the case of a REIT, it means unitholders may turn to internalisation because there is no other way available to them to express their displeasure.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we as regulators want to encourage and actively enable market discipline. Earlier I drew a parallel between internalization by unitholders, and shareholders of a company requisitioning a meeting to remove the board of directors. This is market discipline at work, which is why we proposed in April to make it easier for shareholders and unitholders to call for general meetings to bring about the changes they feel are important.&nbsp;</p>
<p>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People tend to think of market discipline as a negative thing, in terms of investors punishing the share price of a company because they disagree with what the company is doing. It is important to remember that market discipline cuts both ways. If investors are happy with what the Reit is doing, then the market should reward the Reit by increasing the share price. We as regulators also want to facilitate this upside of market discipline. That is why we have fine-tuned our surveillance system to reduce our trading queries when there is a movement in share price. This will allow Reits that enhance unitholder value to fully reap the benefits of their efforts and to fully enjoy the upside of market discipline through an unfettered increase in share price.<br /><br /><span>&nbsp;Internalisation vs External Managers: What&rsquo;s SGX RegCo&rsquo;s position?</span></p>
<p>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where then do we at SGX RegCo stand on internalisation versus external management?</p>
<p>16.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Our view is that whether a Reit should internalise or have an external manager, is a decision for unitholders. As a regulator, our guiding principle is that once unitholders have decided one way or the other, we will support the process.&nbsp;If the requisite number of unitholders have decided in favour of internalisation, then let us get on with it. We will not allow internalisation to be blocked using backdoor methods.</p>
<p>17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, internalisation is a new development here, and we have yet to see the process happen end to end. I must admit it has been a learning journey for us as regulators as well and we are always open to hearing how we can make the process smoother and faster. We have already learnt that trust deeds may not have been written with internalisation in mind. One suggestion has been to have only one voting exercise whereby unitholders can vote at a single EGM on all the changes that need to be made at one go. Another idea is to ensure unitholders are well-informed of what the entire internalisation exercise may entail before they vote. While we hear this and are committed to improving the process, this is not something we can do alone. We will need to work with our fellow regulators to improve the process.</p>
<p><span>Conclusion</span></p>
<p>18.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What then should external managers do in the face of internalisation becoming a possibility in the S-Reit sector? It follows that if internalisation is one form of market discipline, then perhaps keeping unitholders happy would be the one way to respond. So, here&rsquo;s what I think external managers can consider if they do want their unitholders to be happy:</p>
<p>19.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, as I mentioned at the start of my speech, there are questions about fee structure and whether there is alignment of interest with unitholders. External managers may wish to consider these issues and how to communicate clearly to unitholders their thinking and how they are ensuring that their interests are aligned.</p>
<p>20.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, sponsors may also wish to consider giving unitholders some intermediate options to express their views. Unitholder engagement is a good start. Indeed, I am heartened by the efforts of some Reit managers that are facing macroeconomic headwinds to engage their unitholders. Another way may be to give shareholders a say in the appointment of directors. We already do have Reits for example, that give unitholders a confirmatory vote on the appointment of directors to the Reit manager.&nbsp;</p>
<p>21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, and most importantly, is for sponsors to signal very clearly their commitment to create value for unitholders. One lesson we can learn from this is that sponsors should avoid having Reits with overlapping mandates or anything at all that may lead unitholders to question their commitment to the Reit or to one Reit over another. In this regard, I am again heartened to see recent articles in the local media highlighting how our Reits have been active in their portfolio management activities to pursue growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, thank you for your attention. I wish you a fruitful day of discussions and learning.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em><span>First fund launched by BNPP AM in partnership with International Woodland Company (&lsquo;IWC&rsquo;)</span></em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em><span>Fund aims to shape the commercial forests of tomorrow</span></em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span>BNP Paribas Asset Management (&lsquo;BNPP AM&rsquo;) today announced the launch of the BNP Paribas Future Forest Fund (&lsquo;FFF&rsquo; or &lsquo;the Fund&rsquo;). The fund is classified Article 9 under SFDR</span><sup><a href="https://mailhost.mondovisione.com/WorldClient.dll?Session=RI0QP1C0OT5N8&amp;View=BlankMessageBody#footnote-light-1" id="footnote-marker-light-1-1">[1]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;and will invest in sustainable forestry to generate financial returns to investors and combine sustainable investment practices to combat climate change, improve asset resilience, and enhance biodiversity.</span></p>
<p><span>The fund is the first launched by BNPP AM in partnership with natural capital expert IWC. IWC is a global natural capital specialist, majority owned by BNPP AM and headquartered in Copenhagen, with over 30 years&rsquo; experience in providing investment management and advisory services within sustainable forest investments, agriculture investments, and ecosystems restoration.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Aligning Environmental and Financial Goals</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Sustainable forestry investments are an opportunity for investors who are seeking to align environmental and social benefits with financial objectives. Indeed, forestry investments can play a significant role in investment portfolios, as they can deliver attractive long-term risk-adjusted returns, stable annual income, diversification benefits due to low correlation with other asset classes, and inflation-hedging properties. In addition, sustainable forestry is key in fighting climate change as trees are instrumental in removing and storing carbon and can safeguard and improve terrestrial biodiversity while offering protection against deforestation.</span></p>
<p><span>Grounded in a controlled risk investment approach, via core timberland investments in developed geographies (US, Oceania, Europe), the BNP Paribas Future Forest Fund has a strong ESG</span><sup><a href="https://mailhost.mondovisione.com/WorldClient.dll?Session=RI0QP1C0OT5N8&amp;View=BlankMessageBody#footnote-light-2" id="footnote-marker-light-2-1">[2]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;framework guiding the production of sustainable timber. The Fund will only invest in FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) certified or certifiable forests and serve its investors with plug-in data for their greenhouse gas accounting targets and EU, or other regulatory, reporting needs.</span></p>
<p><span>The Fund targets a size of USD 500 million (USD 750 million hard cap) and has had a first closing of USD 130 million in November. The target portfolio will consist of 8 to 12 assets in the&nbsp;</span><span>US (South, Northeast, and Pacific Northwest), Australia, New Zealand, and Europe.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Meeting the Rising Demand for Sustainable Timber</span></strong></p>
<p><span>The Fund addresses key macroeconomic trends indicating a growing demand for timber. Over the last 60 years, global demand for wood products has doubled and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) forecasts that wood demand will increase by another 37 to 60 per cent between 2020 and 2050. The sustained increase in demand for timber products is arising from several mega-trends, including population growth, urbanisation, increase in per capita income, and a green transition.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Otto Reventlow, CEO of IWC</span></strong><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;The BNP Paribas Future Forest Fund represents a significant step forward to bring sustainable forestry investment into the mainstream and recognises timberland as a compelling investment proposition. With this fund, we ensure that our focus on commercial viability is balanced with a strong commitment to protect and enhance biodiversity and climate resilience. We are proud to collaborate with BNP Paribas Asset Management to create a fund that aligns financial objectives with the urgent need for environmental stewardship.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>David Vaillant, Global Head of Finance, Strategy and Participations at BNPP AM and Chairman of IWC:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;We are very pleased to partner with IWC and leverage their deep expertise in natural capital, ensuring that we make a meaningful impact in the world of sustainable forestry. The Future Forest Fund illustrates the common vision we have with IWC to actively contribute to the environmental transition. This new fund will enable us to answer our clients' growing interest in this new asset class as we widen our breadth of natural capital solutions.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Maxence Foucault, Senior ESG Specialist, private markets at BNPP AM</span></strong><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>"At BNP Paribas Asset Management, we are committed to pioneering investment solutions that address the challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss. The BNP Paribas Future Forest Fund is a prime example of how investors can align environmental benefits with financial targets."</span></p>

<title>End-To-End Accountability: Remarks To Association Of Superannuation Funds Of Australia Conference 2024 - Remarks By ASIC Commissioner Simone Constant At Association Of Superannuation Funds Of Australia Conference 2024 In Sydney On 20 November 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul>
<li>Driving better retirement outcomes and member services is a strategic priority for ASIC. Ensuring accountability of superannuation trustees will be a significant focus for us over the next year.</li>
<li>We have written to the CEOs of every APRA-regulated superannuation trustee, urging industry leaders to act now to improve their oversight of death benefits. We are concerned the metrics being used to track death claims handling and processing are too sparse to drive accountability.</li>
<li>We have also reminded senior executives that they will become accountable persons under the Financial Accountability Regime from next March, which will be an important step in helping us ensure there is top-down accountability in superannuation funds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Before I begin, I&rsquo;d like to acknowledge the Traditional Owners of the land on which we meet today, the Gadigal people of the Eora nation, and pay my respects to Elders past and present.</p>
<p>I would also like to congratulate ASFA on another successful annual conference, and on your longstanding leadership in lifting retirement outcomes for Australians.</p>
<p>Today marks one year since I commenced my five-year term as an ASIC Commissioner. It feels significant to open my anniversary here with you today because so many of my conversations over the past year &ndash; with APRA, industry, and customers and consumers &ndash; have been about ensuring Australians can plan for and participate in their retirement with confidence.</p>
<p>We welcome today&rsquo;s announcement from the Treasurer as a continuation of those conversations and look forward to stepping up our focus on superannuation, retirement income, and retirement expenses.</p>
<p>Confident and informed participation in the economy is our goal at ASIC. We want superannuation to deliver for Australians at every age and at every stage. You need to help your members build their wealth whilst they work and service them as customers so they can confidently enjoy it, right through retirement.</p>
<p><span class="NormalTextRun CommentStart CommentHighlightPipeClicked CommentHighlightClicked SCXW138200014 BCX8">In the age of ageing, this is no small challenge. There are six million Australians currently at or above superannuation preservation age and we expect a retirement wave of another three million to&nbsp;</span><span class="NormalTextRun CommentHighlightClicked SCXW138200014 BCX8">join them</span><span class="NormalTextRun CommentHighlightClicked SCXW138200014 BCX8">&nbsp;in the next</span>&nbsp;decade<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/end-to-end-accountability-remarks-to-association-of-superannuation-funds-of-australia-conference-2024/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Many of these Australians have contributed to super over their entire working lives but rarely interacted further with their fund until a lifechanging moment &ndash; such as leaving the workforce, ill health, or the loss of a loved one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s why I often refer to them not as members but as customers &ndash; because in these moments, they expect a certain level of customer service from you.</p>
<p>But despite being able to forecast the demands of this wave a generation in advance, our superannuation system appears to be struggling under the weight of these expectations. And it is certain that the waves will continue.</p>
<p>In recent research conducted for ASIC, we found that less than half of Australians trust superannuation funds to do the right thing by their members. The remainder were either neutral or explicitly didn&rsquo;t trust their funds. This is a big problem when we&rsquo;re thinking about confident and informed participation.</p>
<p>For this reason, driving better retirement outcomes and member services is a strategic priority for ASIC. The two are inextricably linked &ndash; you can&rsquo;t have good retirement outcomes without good member services.</p>
<p><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW187786911 BCX8">And providing good member services can come down to three really simple principles: being transparent, being accountable, and meeting the fair expectations of your members&nbsp;</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW187786911 BCX8">consistently</span>.</p>
<p>I want to focus in particular on the second of these principles today, because ensuring accountability of superannuation trustees is a significant focus for ASIC over the coming days, weeks, and months.</p>
<h2>Death benefits</h2>
<p>Last week, we commenced proceedings against United Super &ndash; the trustee for Cbus &ndash; for unreasonable delays in processing claims for total permanent disability (TPD) and death benefits.</p>
<p>We allege this systemic failure impacted more than 10,000 members and claimants at their most vulnerable time, with many claims taking more than 12 months to resolve.</p>
<p>Following this action, today I am calling on every superannuation industry leader to improve their oversight of death benefits, as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/news-items/asic-writes-to-superannuation-trustees-to-drive-improvement-to-death-benefit-claims-handling/" title="ASIC writes to superannuation trustees to drive improvement to death benefit claims handling">wrote to the CEOs of every APRA-regulated superannuation trustee</a>&nbsp;outlining significant concerns about the way some trustees are tracking processing times for death benefit claims and managing their processes.</p>
<p>These concerns have come out of our surveillance on death benefit claims handling, on which we will publish a full report early next year.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re writing to CEOs about this now though because some gaps need action now. This is too important to wait.</p>
<p>In particular, we are concerned that metrics are tracked too sparsely overall to drive accountability for these important outcomes; also, that the metrics trustees are using to track death benefit claims don&rsquo;t capture this process end-to-end, and don&rsquo;t reflect the real experiences of people out there dealing with loss.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about husbands and wives, brothers and sisters, parents and children, who need a way forward after the worst day of their lives.</p>
<p>From their perspective, the clock starts the moment they contact you about the loss of their loved one and stops when the claim is paid.</p>
<p>Yet for whatever reason, some trustees are starting the clock when a package of documents is sent or when all completed applications are received.</p>
<p>Metrics like this do not reflect the fair expectations of your members and their families &ndash; and don&rsquo;t help boards make good decisions either.</p>
<p>Customer-centric metrics are an opportunity to understand where your processes are falling down and how you can fix them.</p>
<p>For example, how will you know if grieving family members can&rsquo;t meet your documentation requirements if you only track how long it takes you to make a final decision?</p>
<p>In their eyes, it doesn&rsquo;t matter how quickly this decision is made if it takes 18 months to gather all the right paperwork.</p>
<p>Some trustees have invested time and resources into improvements in the area. Others we looked at in our member services surveillance however were actually surprised when we presented them their own data on end-to-end claims handling. This is the wrong reaction.</p>
<p><span class="NormalTextRun CommentStart CommentHighlightPipeRest CommentHighlightRest SCXW256374782 BCX8">Accountability means owning actions and outcomes. It means admitting when you have fallen short and taking steps to measure up. You can&rsquo;t&nbsp;</span><span class="NormalTextRun CommentHighlightRest SCXW256374782 BCX8">measure up without data and metrics to measure</span>.</p>
<p>It is our obligation to do all we can to enforce the law when boards of trustees do not meet theirs. This remains the case even when service delivery arrangements are outsourced. Indeed, circumstances may mean metrics and measurement are even more important when third parties undertake operations on your behalf. However you arrange your service delivery, you are always accountable from trustee director through to your end member.</p>
<p>Today I would also like to remind you that from next March, senior executives will become accountable persons under the Financial Accountability Regime. That means that leaders will personally be on the hook for certain responsibilities within their remit.</p>
<p>Clearly, you cannot outsource your FAR accountability, so if you accept those accountabilities make sure you have the tools of responsibility &ndash; including the necessary information &ndash; to meet them.</p>
<p>This will be a significant step in ensuring there is top-down accountability to members in superannuation funds.</p>
<h2>Private markets and best financial interest duty</h2>
<p>In lifting accountability &ndash; and transparency &ndash; across the superannuation sector, I am pleased that ASIC and APRA have a complementary role and are very much aligned.</p>
<p>We share regulatory responsibility for private assets in superannuation. With ASIC&rsquo;s current focus on driving consistency and transparency in private market investments, we have an ongoing dialogue about APRA&rsquo;s work around valuations of unlisted assets held by superannuation funds.</p>
<p>Currently, APRA-regulated superannuation funds allocate around 20% of their portfolios, on average, to private assets. Some funds have announced plans to pull back from this space, but many say they intend to allocate more in future.</p>
<p>It is not for ASIC to lead the discussion on investment allocation. It is for ASIC to expect that as their exposure to private markets grows, funds stay focused on their obligations &ndash; both to members, and to the market as such significant participants in that market.</p>
<p>That includes ensuring that they are acting in the best financial interests of members, that they adhere to all laws and standards of market conduct and integrity, that their investments, whether held directly or through fund managers, are valued appropriately, and that risk is clearly disclosed and communicated to members.</p>
<p>I want to congratulate APRA on their inaugural publication of fund level data on expenditure. This is an important transparency measure that will help ensure trustees are meeting the expectations of members in every dollar they spend.</p>
<p>We will shortly embark on a complementary piece of work: a financial reporting and audit surveillance of superannuation funds. This is the first financial year that financial reports of superannuation funds were lodged with ASIC, and we plan to ensure that there is a high standard of reporting, to build confidence and trust.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Ultimately, you can&rsquo;t have good retirement outcomes without good member services &ndash; and you can&rsquo;t have good member services without accountability, transparency, and consistency in the way you meet the expectations of your members &ndash; your customers.</p>
<p>We will continue to do our job to ensure trustees measure up to their responsibility to do theirs.</p>
<p>As I look ahead to my second year with ASIC, I can see that 2025 is going to be another significant one in our superannuation work, and in our job in the superannuation system.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t want you to wait until then to act &ndash; we need you to start improving the systems and processes in your job today.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<title>Welcoming Remarks At The “Conversations With Global Investors”, Investment Forum Of The 2024 Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, Ms Julia Leung,  Hong Kong Securities And Futures Commission Chief Executive Officer, 20 November 2024</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/welcoming-remarks-at-the-conversations-with-global-investors-investment-forum/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, good morning.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Securities and Futures Commission, Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the  Academy of Finance, let me extend to you all a very warm welcome to Hong Kong, and to  this investment forum on Day 3 of our Global Financial Leaders&rsquo; Investment Summit. We are  most delighted to host you here and explore how to &ldquo;sail through changes&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This Connect Hall provides the perfect setting for today&rsquo;s investment forum. I want to tell you  a bit of its history. This venue used to be the bustling Trading Hall of our stock exchange  since 1986. At its peak, hundreds of trading desks were arranged in concentric circles and  nearly 1,000 traders donning bright red vests jostled on red carpets. This is also where  hundreds of enterprises strike the iconic Gong to set off the listing journey.</p>
<p>When the last trading desks walked into history seven years ago, the Trading Hall was given  a new life in this Connect Hall, which is named after the Stock Connect programme between  Mainland and Hong Kong stock exchanges. Only two days ago, we celebrated the 10th  Anniversary of Stock Connect in this very Hall. For the Hong Kong market, the past decade  has been a remarkable journey of transformation into a super conduit of capital between  Mainland China and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Good old memories aside, I believe this hall embodies the irresistible forces of change that  constantly drive our capital markets forward.</p>
<p>In global markets, the many forces of transformation have continued to reshape our market  practices, growth strategies and also regulation. As leading investment managers, you have  a knack for identifying evolving market trends to stay steps ahead, seize opportunities, and  keep both your firm and investors out of harm&rsquo;s way. And my job as a regulator shares a  similar purpose, to adapt to the shifting landscape through an agile and proportionate  regulatory regime.</p>

<title>Supervision And Regulation, Federal Reserve Vice Chair For Supervision Michael S. Barr, Before The Committee On Financial Services, U.S. House Of Representatives, Washington, D.C.</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/supervision-and-regulation-federal-reserve-vice-chair-for-supervision-michael-s-3/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/supervision-and-regulation-federal-reserve-vice-chair-for-supervision-michael-s-3/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Chairman McHenry, Ranking Member Waters, and other members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify on the Federal Reserve's supervisory and regulatory activities. Accompanying my testimony is the Federal Reserve's semiannual&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/supervision-and-regulation-report.htm">Supervision and Regulation Report</a>. Today, I will discuss current conditions in the banking sector, and our recent supervisory and regulatory activities.</p>
<p><strong>Banking Conditions</strong><br />Overall, the banking system remains sound and resilient. Banks continue to report capital and liquidity ratios above minimum regulatory levels, and asset quality generally remains sound. Bank lending has continued to grow, albeit at a modest pace that reflects decreased demand and tighter lending standards than we have seen since early last year.</p>
<p>Capital ratios have increased this year, building on the capital increases from the year before and leaving the system better positioned to weather potential losses. This is supported by this year's stress test results, which showed that large banks have sufficient capital to meet their minimum capital ratios and continue their operations under a highly stressful scenario.</p>
<p>Liquidity conditions overall are stable. Notably, deposits and liquid assets on bank balance sheets remained steady in the first half of the year. Additionally, the share of uninsured deposits in the system continued to decline, falling to a level last seen in 2019.</p>
<p>While the system as a whole is resilient, we are carefully monitoring the continued rise in delinquency rates among certain commercial real estate loans&mdash;such as those backed by offices, especially in major cities, and, more recently, those backed by multifamily housing. Delinquency rates for certain consumer loans are also elevated. In response to rising delinquencies, banks have increased loan loss provisions. Cybersecurity risk also continues to be a supervisory priority. The Federal Reserve's supervisory activities in this area promote financial institutions' ability to protect against cyber incidents, safeguard critical infrastructure, and address emerging technology risks.</p>
<p><strong>Supervision</strong><br />Federal Reserve supervisors continue to work diligently to assess all bank risk-management practices to be prepared for both expected and unexpected stresses.</p>
<p>We continue to make progress on improving the speed, force, and agility of supervision to align better with the risks, size, and complexity of supervised banks, as appropriate. This is necessary to ensure that banks and supervisors are managing the types of risks highlighted by last year's stress in the banking system. Supervisors must be prepared to take timely action as risks build up; deploy supervisory tools and escalation effectively; account for changes in market, economic, and financial conditions in their examination priorities and supervisory conclusions; and identify new and different patterns of risks.</p>
<p>We have made progress on these goals. First, we are working to ensure that supervision intensifies at the right pace as a bank grows in size and complexity. Second, we are modifying supervisory processes so that once issues are identified, they are addressed more quickly by both banks and supervisors. Third, we are finding ways to better incorporate forward-looking risk analysis into supervision.</p>
<p><strong>Regulation</strong><br />Moving to regulation, as you know, last summer, the Board sought comment on two proposed rules that would modify risk-based capital requirements for large banks: the Basel III Endgame proposal and the proposal to adjust the capital surcharge for the largest and most complex banks. We asked for and received a great number of comments on all aspects of the proposals and, earlier this year, I laid out potential adjustments to these proposals based on those comments.</p>
<p>Last year, the bank regulatory agencies also invited comment on a proposal to require large banks to issue and maintain a minimum amount of long-term debt. We received feedback from commenters on potential adjustments to the proposal, which are under consideration. And, as I have mentioned in previous speeches, we have been considering ways to improve liquidity resilience and improve banks' ability to respond to funding shocks.</p>
<p>These initiatives have been joint efforts among the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC, and we look forward to that continued collaboration next year. We will continue to seek an approach that helps to ensure financial system resilience and supports the flow of credit to households and businesses through the economic cycle.</p>
<p>Thank you. I am happy to take your questions.</p>

<td class="body-text">
<p>Good morning, and welcome to FIA Expo.<br /><br />It&rsquo;s wonderful to be back here in Chicago&mdash;the epicenter of our industry&mdash;for what promises to be a fascinating two days of discussions.&nbsp;<br /><br />Truthfully, it&rsquo;s also nice to escape the bedlam inside the Washington beltway for a few days.<br /><br />With the elections behind us, I&rsquo;m longing for less shouting, fewer political text messages and hopefully, more common sense. And some honesty, as well. Because if you can&rsquo;t come to grips with the truth, you can&rsquo;t come together to solve problems and heal wounds.<br /><br />Growth must begin with a reality check. Our industry deserves that too.<br /><br />This fall has been an amazing time for me, personally.<br /><br />My college football team&mdash;the Indiana Hoosiers&mdash;are undefeated for the first time ever under new head coach Curt Cignetti.&nbsp;And my adopted professional football team, the Washington Commanders&mdash;are having a surprisingly good season behind &ldquo;Hail Mary, Full of Grace&rdquo; quarterback Jayden Daniels. (sorry Caleb!)<br /><br />These two developments have literally changed my mood for the better. I get up whistling in the morning. I smile more. I now have a skip in my step. It&rsquo;s changed my demeanor from grouchy to almost tolerable.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, there are many reasons for the success of my two football programs. But I believe the top reasons are the coaches&mdash;and their willingness to be truth tellers and be honest with their players.<br /><br />You can&rsquo;t begin to win until you have laid bare the reality of where you are as an organization. Only then can you start to build up.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />For example, Commanders&rsquo; head coach Dan Quinn has instituted "Tell the Truth Mondays." During these meetings, he encourages his team to be honest and accountable for what went right &ndash; and what went wrong &ndash; on Game Day.&nbsp;<br /><br />Coach Quinn has created a safe space to allow coaches and players to tell the truth and course correct for the betterment of the team. This is creating a culture of growth and winning.<br /><br />That idea really resonated with me. It got me thinking about our industry and how we might benefit from a frank analysis of how we&rsquo;re doing.<br /><br />So, let&rsquo;s have our own Tell the Truth Day and recognize what we do well and identify where we need to improve.<br /><br />First off, what are we doing right?<br /><br /><strong>Tell the Truth Fact Number 1: The global growth story of our industry is real.</strong><br /><br />FIA data shows global trading volume of futures and options continues to increase. We expect to notch another record year in 2024, marking seven straight years of record activity.&nbsp;<br /><br />And on this theme of honesty, we should point out that much of that growth comes from retail trading, and specifically India. We are also seeing retail growth in US equity options and futures, crypto products and prediction markets.<br /><br />The retail story is worth keeping an eye on.<br /><br />But retail isn't the whole growth story. Here in the US, we see record levels of trading activity in Treasury futures and options, in both volume and open interest.</p>

<td class="body-text">This growth is fueled by recent inflation and economic volatility in the markets, and the need of market participants to hedge the associated risks.<br /><br />While volumes typically get the headlines, it&rsquo;s the open interest chart that&rsquo;s more interesting to me. Because it shows the long-term hedging and commercial interest in this market, which hit a record high in August.<br /><br />This is a sign of a healthy market.<br /><br />Turning to the global energy complex, we have also seen strong growth in futures and options across products from crude oil to natural gas to electricity. This growth extends to alternatives like wind and solar. And it&rsquo;s not surprising. &nbsp;<br /><br />With the geo-political conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, and the long arc of the energy transition, I expect the energy complex to continue to be a part of our industry&rsquo;s expansion.<br /><br />This diverse growth story is worth crowing about on Tell the Truth Day.<br /><br />Which brings me to&nbsp;<strong>Tell the Truth Fact Number Two: This industry&rsquo;s growth is fueled by innovation, and we must nurture this environment of risk-taking.</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />Innovation has been part of our DNA since the inception of our markets, and we must never take it for granted.<br /><br />Just look around this conference. For a decade now, Expo has been home to our<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://email.fia.org/c/12kOOgO0LWa9ijfxXhAhOIpKejc3mm">Innovators Pavillion</a>, where we feature creative start-ups that bring new ideas and technologies to our markets.&nbsp;<br /><br />Past innovators have used this platform as a springboard to raise millions in capital and operationalize their businesses. This year is no exception to this risk-taking spirit.<br /><br />I encourage you to visit the trade show floor to meet the 10 amazing companies showcasing their services that modernize our industry.<br /><br />But as we look to the future, we must also recognize the pioneers and visionaries who built our markets. These are the people who have democratized the derivatives markets through electronic trading, new products and exchanges, and increased access to global markets.&nbsp;<br /><br />Look no further than this year&rsquo;s distinguished class of the&nbsp;<a href="https://email.fia.org/c/12kOOhhFm02QGFZaoMnXTSoLF7uR9f">FIA Hall of Fame</a>, which we announced last week.<br /><br />We will celebrate these six leaders at the&nbsp;<a href="https://email.fia.org/c/12kOOhLjW3Vy52IMQhbDZ2nN5VNEW8">50th Boca conference</a>&nbsp;next March. And they are worthy of our appreciation today, for the vision and achievement they have brought and continue to bring to our markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />This innovative spirit must be nurtured through policies that promote competition and risk-taking. We need smart regulation that is fit for purpose, and we need policies that incentivize new entrants to come into our space.<br /><br />This leads me to&nbsp;<strong>Tell the Truth Fact Number 3: Competition is heating up, but more is needed.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />When I started in this industry nearly 30 years ago, there were more than 100 FCMs. Today, there are 50. Back then, there were 20 exchanges registered with the CFTC. Today there are 16. And among those 16, only four have meaningful volume.<br /><br />On Tell the Truth Tuesday, we must admit that our markets would benefit from more competition.<br /><br />Competition sharpens our animal spirits. It encourages innovation and lower costs. And choice is good for consumers.&nbsp;<br /><br />That said, we are starting to see some signs that competition is heating up.<br /><br />One area is interest rate futures. New exchanges have embarked on a campaign to compete in the US interest rate futures market. So far, volumes have remained low, but this competition has spurred the animal spirits in the fixed income marketplace for the first time in over a decade.&nbsp;<br /><br />This competition in the treasury markets is further driven by the SEC&rsquo;s treasury and repo clearing mandate, which currently takes effect in 2025 and 2026. We now have three clearinghouses that will compete in treasury clearing as these markets move towards a &ldquo;futures-style&rdquo; client clearing model.&nbsp;<br /><br />Whoever can build the clearing model that best optimizes the collateral and bank capital for market participants may be the big winner. This competition is good for the marketplace, and it's fascinating to watch.<br /><br />Another area ripe with competition is event markets. These markets date back to my time at the CFTC, when the Iowa Political Markets first started an exchange to predict election results.&nbsp;<br /><br />Recent court rulings have clarified the legal uncertainty around these markets, allowing several prediction markets to move forward with scale before this past election. And boy did they.<br /><br />While listening to my Commanders football game on the radio before the election, I heard no less than three commercials for Robinhood promoting their event contracts on the Presidential election.&nbsp;Others must have been listening too &hellip; as Robinhood surpassed 200 million contracts traded in the week leading up to the election.<br /><br />It's astounding that this activity exceeds the number of people who actually voted in the Presidential election &ndash; and that these markets were more accurate than traditional polls.&nbsp;<br /><br />I&rsquo;m still digesting what these markets mean for the traditional regulatory environment, but the wisdom of crowds appears to have worked in this instance.&nbsp;<br /><br />On Tell the Truth Tuesday, it&rsquo;s exciting to see that competition in our industry is heating up, and we welcome this trend.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />But in life, too much of a good thing can sometimes lead to unintended consequences. And that&rsquo;s why the laws that govern our markets require&nbsp;<em>fair</em>&nbsp;competition and&nbsp;<em>responsible</em>&nbsp;innovation.<br /><br />Unfettered competition and innovation could jeopardize the integrity of the markets and put customers at risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Which brings me to the&nbsp;<strong>final Tell the Truth fact of the day: The laws and regulations of our industry must keep pace with our evolving market structure.</strong><br /><br />Traditionally, the regulation of the futures markets has been by functional activity.<br /><br />Public exchanges that bring together buyers and sellers are regulated to protect the fairness of the marketplace.&nbsp;Clearinghouses, with their obligations to protect the financial integrity of the system, have strict financial protections and safeguards to avoid contagion risk.&nbsp;And clearing members, who serve as agents for their clients, are charged to protect these customers and their funds.<br /><br />Increasingly, however, we are seeing more exchanges embedding all of these functions within one legal structure.<br /><br />But as the Good Book says, &ldquo;No one can serve two masters.&rdquo;<br /><br />FIA has strong concerns that consolidating these functions could undo the independent checks and balances of our markets and, ultimately, put customers at risk.&nbsp;We strongly encourage the current CFTC and the incoming Administration to propose strong rules that govern the inherent conflicts from these arrangements.<br /><br />So, I&rsquo;ll leave you with these final thoughts on Tell the Truth Tuesday.&nbsp;<br /><br />As we approach Thanksgiving, I&rsquo;m reminded that our industry is a big, messy and sometimes loud family. Maybe like many of yours.<br /><br />We work hard and we play hard. We have a lot of diverse views, and we don&rsquo;t have all the answers.&nbsp;At the same time, we&rsquo;re trying to bring the right people together to have an honest, frank discussion to reach the best conclusions for our industry.<br /><br />Together, and only together, will we continue our industry&rsquo;s impressive track record of resiliency and innovation.&nbsp;<br /><br />And that&rsquo;s what this week is about. So, as we kick off Expo, I hope you will learn new things, meet interesting people and engage with your colleagues with an honest and open mindset.<br /><br />If we can do that, the sky is the limit for our markets.</td>

<p>The Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA), the independent regulator of financial services conducted in and from the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), today hosted its Annual Outreach session, drawing more than 500 participants from across the financial services sector. The event underscores the regulator&rsquo;s commitment to enhancing industry collaboration, innovation, and compliance.</p>
<p>As part of the Annual Outreach, the DFSA announced the publication of its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dfsa.ae/download_file/3762/0">2024 Cyber Thematic Review</a>, assessing the cybersecurity maturity and resilience of Firms operating in, and from, the DIFC. Aligned with the UAE and Dubai Cybersecurity strategies, this Review underscores the Authority&rsquo;s commitment to enhancing cybersecurity standards across the financial sector.</p>
<p>While the number of Authorised Firms has surged by 25% between 2022 and 2024, the Review revealed continuing improvement overall in Firms&rsquo; cybersecurity maturity within DIFC. It examined progress made in Firms' cyber risk management programmes since the last DFSA&rsquo;s report in 2022 &ndash; highlighting emerging good practices, areas of improvement, and actionable recommendations for strengthening defences against evolving cyber threats. Key findings included:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Governance:</span>&nbsp;On average, 80-90% of Firms implemented the governance best practices to ensure accountability, transparency, and compliance mandated by the DFSA Rules</li>
<li><span>Baseline best practices:</span>&nbsp;Firms declared that, on average, they have implemented 90% of the fundamental best practices outlined in the Rules. These ensure the effective and secure operation of systems, software, and infrastructure.</li>
<li><span>Resilience:</span>&nbsp;Remains at approximately 80% given improvements in the implementation of resilience requirements which enable systems, networks, or infrastructure to continue to function despite disruptions, failures, or unforeseen events.</li>
</ul>
<p>The DFSA&rsquo;s 2024 Annual Outreach also featured comprehensive updates from the DFSA&rsquo;s Policy, Enforcement, and Authorisation Divisions, providing attendees with insights into the latest regulatory developments, enforcement priorities, and licensing enhancements designed to streamline compliance processes. Additional Supervision focused sessions also took place, focusing on Innovation and Technology, Prudential, Conduct of Business, and Financial Crime Conduct. Discussions notably centred on fostering technological innovation while ensuring robust measures against financial crime, including anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism.</p>
<p><span>Justin Baldacchino, Managing Director of Supervision at the DFSA, said:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s Annual Outreach has been a pivotal step in reinforcing trust, transparency, and collaboration within the financial sector. Cybersecurity is central to the DFSA&rsquo;s mission to protect the financial ecosystem within the DIFC, and the findings of our latest Review show encouraging progress, but they also highlight areas where firms must further strengthen their defences. I would like to thank all our industry participants who joined this year&rsquo;s Annual Outreach &ndash; together, we will continue to strengthen the future of finance with DIFC.&rdquo;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you very much for the opportunity to be here today, and a particular thank you to our hosts, John Williams, Fabiola Ravazzolo, and their team at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. This conference is a timely and welcome addition to the range of engagements the New York Fed hosts. Foreign exchange markets are critical to so much economic activity, from hedging to trade financing, and they are evolving rapidly. We have come a long way from the days when spot markets were dominant, and the New York Fed has been a positive force at every step along the way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me state at the outset that these are unusual circumstances in which to be giving a policy speech. I serve as Treasury&rsquo;s Assistant Secretary for International Finance and was nominated for this role by President Biden. Given the results of the U.S. presidential election, I&rsquo;ll be ending my service in just a couple of months&rsquo; time. But the U.S. cross-border payments agenda&nbsp;is&nbsp;an area where there is significant and broad-based agreement across the public and private sectors, and across both political parties. We need a modern system of payments, guided by strong U.S. international financial leadership. As such, the U.S. cross-border payments agenda has many elements where actions across administrations can build towards shared goals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of these shared goals is to improve the efficiency and safety of the infrastructure that underlies international commerce. Another is to maintain and strengthen the conditions that lead to the important global roles of the U.S. financial sector and the U.S. dollar, with the resulting benefits these bring for governance, our national security, financial stability, and the global economy. We all also aim to have high standards with respect to privacy and the enforcement of anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are pursuing these goals across three lines of effort. First, we are directly encouraging and participating in responsible payments innovation and experimentation. Second, we are coordinating with the private sector and foreign partners to better align legal, regulatory, and supervisory frameworks, which are the foundations of a more efficient and effective payments system. And third, we are supporting strong international standards and high-quality compliance regimes, which ensure the stability of payments and of the broader financial system.&nbsp; I believe the United States must lead when it comes to cross-border payments to maximize the chances that any new systems with significant international usage reach the quality and standards we prefer when it comes to governance and support for financial stability. My comments today will review these efforts in turn, relate them to the role of the dollar, highlight some areas where we need to be cautious, and suggest some next steps for moving forward.</p>
<h3>THE PROBLEM OF CROSS-BORDER PAYMENTS</h3>
<p>Cross-border payments are essential to global business and finance. But in my experience as a policymaker, there is a widely held complaint that cross-border payments are slow, costly, unreliable, or unsafe. I have heard this from large multinational corporations and representatives of small business, in advanced economies, emerging markets, and low-income countries alike.</p>
<p>Wholesale payments are typically the fastest and least expensive mode of payment, and over 90% of wholesale payments utilizing the SWIFT system typically reach the beneficiary bank within an hour.&nbsp; However, customers experience a high degree of variation across regions.&nbsp; In Africa, more than 20 percent of even wholesale payments take more than a day to reach the account of the end customer. In Asia-Pacific and the Middle East, this figure is greater than 10 percent.<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2722#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;At the retail level, too, cross-border transfers remain slow and costly. The average cost of a $200 remittance in 2024 was 6.4 percent, including roughly 2 percent for foreign exchange conversion and roughly 4 percent for service fees. In many parts of the world, 40% of remittances take more than one day to reach the beneficiary.<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2722#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span>[2]</span></a></p>
<p>Some of this cost and delay is deliberately built into the system as a feature, not a bug. For example, some is due to batching and delayed settlement in legacy payment arrangements, which may help mitigate credit, legal, and liquidity risk. And, separately, some delay may result from faithful compliance with AML/CFT requirements, which is of course critically important.&nbsp;<br />But there&rsquo;s clearly room to make cross-border payments faster, cheaper, more accessible, and more transparent, without exacerbating risk or neglecting compliance. And doing so would bring great benefits. It would improve the functioning and competitiveness of a broader set of trade corridors and, with key partner countries, reinforce diversification efforts like the &ldquo;friendshoring&rdquo; Secretary Yellen has prescribed. It would reduce barriers for retail transfers like remittances and cross-border payments to small businesses, enabling new business models and fostering entrepreneurship. And making the dollar-oriented system faster and more efficient would strengthen our hand in upholding U.S. values like privacy and in bolstering both our national security and that of our allies.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>PARTICIPATION IN RESPONSIBLE PAYMENTS INNOVATION AND EXPERIMENTATION</h3>
<p>Let me start with our efforts to foster responsible innovation and experimentation in payments technology.&nbsp; The landscape is evolving, in part, from the integration of well-known tools, like application programming interfaces (APIs) and quick response (QR) codes, into existing payments infrastructure. Some innovations build on more recent technologies, like distributed ledgers, that could bring fundamental change to payment, clearing, and settlement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Around the world, public authorities and private firms have started applying this range of innovations to their domestic payment systems. As of March 2024, 89 percent of Brazil&rsquo;s population had initiated a payment through its Pix real-time payment system. Pix is free to individuals for most payments, and according to IMF data, the cost to merchants accepting a Pix payment is 85 percent less than accepting a credit card.<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2722#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><span>[3]</span></a>&nbsp;Similarly, India&rsquo;s Unified Payment Interface (UPI) is credited by the World Economic Forum with reducing payment fees to Indian consumers by more than $67 billion since its inception in 2016.<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2722#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><span>[4]</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span>In the United States, the private and public sectors have developed new solutions for domestic instant payments, some of which gave rise to new products that are able to reach households less likely to otherwise participate in the financial sector.<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2722#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><span>[5]</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>U.S. policy seeks to maximize the chances that these kinds of technological innovations can also increase the safety and efficiency of cross-border payments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As one example, the United States is directly leading, participating in, or observing various experiments or new offerings of domestic and cross-border payment solutions. In 2023, following several years of exploration, the Federal Reserve launched FedNow, an instant payment infrastructure that allows businesses and individuals to send and receive domestic payments in real time through participating depository institutions. The Fed has also proposed extending operating hours for its other payment services, the Fedwire Funds Service and National Settlement Service. Together, and in combination with private-sector efforts like The Clearing House&rsquo;s RTP Network among others, these developments bring the benefits of near round-the-clock payments and improved liquidity management for domestic payments.</p>
<p>Further, the Fed is contributing to international projects to improve cross-border payments. Together with six other central banks and over forty private sector firms, including several U.S. firms, the Fed is participating in Project Agor&aacute;, an initiative of the Bank for International Settlements to explore the integration of tokenized central bank and commercial bank money on the same platform. Last year, with the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Fed concluded Project Cedar x Ubin+, an exploration of improvements to multi-currency wholesale cross-border payments on a bilateral and technology-neutral basis.</p>
<p>Finally, the Treasury and other agencies are exploring the possibility of enhancing bilateral payment system connectivity with select other jurisdictions. This might be achieved in multiple ways, including interconnecting fast payment systems or supporting the participation of foreign banks in domestic payment platforms. Improving connectivity in these ways requires the United States and its partners to develop a better understanding of each other&rsquo;s payments technology and protocols, to formulate and agree on a governance system, and to take care to ensure that payments integrity programs and AML/CFT compliance controls in the partner countries meet international standards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Improvements in bilateral connectivity may not only offer economic benefits for American consumers and businesses, they may also offer the promise of greater adherence to global standards and shared national security gains. Enhancing connectivity with the U.S. system may offer significant commercial benefit for our partners, and that presents an opportunity for the United States to invite a deeper and more transparent commitment to shared policy goals, like combatting illicit finance.</p>
<p>Of course, even though I have only highlighted public sector activity so far, the United States government recognizes that the private sector has an essential role to play in improving cross-border payments. Regulated U.S. financial institutions are at the forefront of exploring global, &ldquo;always on&rdquo; real-time payments, clearing, and settlement, using a variety of technologies, and we wish to create a climate that ensures these institutions can remain at the frontier. Relatedly, we believe that policymakers should preserve optionality as to what form innovation takes. Governments should avoid picking winners and losers in payments technology.</p>
<p>Now, I should note, not all payments system experimentation is as responsible, cautious, and transparent as the efforts I just described. This is no small matter. If a poorly designed payments system were widely adopted, it would not only fail to resolve cross-border payments challenges, it could do significant harm&nbsp;to international financial stability and economic security.&nbsp;Policymakers and industry participants should take that risk seriously and be very skeptical of any project that seeks to wipe the slate clean, or avoid safeguards in the current system, or omit, elide, or avoid strong and transparent governance and oversight. One reason the United States must continue to lead on innovation and governance for cross-border payments is precisely to avoid the proliferation of opaque systems that may introduce unacceptable macro-financial, illicit finance, and operational risks into the global financial system.</p>
<h3>IMPROVING LEGAL, REGULATORY, AND SUPERVISORY FRAMEWORKS</h3>
<p>Next, I would like to share how the United States is engaging to improve legal, regulatory, and supervisory frameworks in support of responsible innovation, reduced frictions in payments, and greater competition and transparency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Internationally, one line of U.S. effort since 2020 has been to provide intensive support for the G20&rsquo;s Roadmap to Enhance Cross-border Payments. As part of this Roadmap, Treasury has been encouraging legal and regulatory changes in foreign jurisdictions, including so that more financial data, not less, can move freely across borders. Localization and other restrictions on cross-border data sharing, if implemented beyond narrow national security considerations, can restrict firms from working with the best data or compliance service providers, if those providers happen to be in a foreign country. That harms U.S. business. And, such restrictions can also become major obstacles to the highest quality risk management and most efficient cross-border payment technologies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Domestically, Treasury and the Financial Stability Oversight Council have repeatedly recommended that Congress develop a clear regulatory framework for stablecoins, a technology often described as showing promise in facilitating cross-border transactions.<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2722#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><span>[6]</span></a>,<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2722#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><span>[7]</span></a>&nbsp;But stablecoins are structurally vulnerable to runs, which can pose risks to consumers and investors, and to financial stability. Analogous to how, in pegged currency regimes, foreign reserves back the value of the exchange rate, most stablecoin issuers require dollar-denominated liquid assets to peg their stablecoin to the dollar. Doubts about the quality of those backing reserves, or about the redeemability of the stablecoin at par, can lead to runs on the issuer. This is not theoretical. In the last three years, we&rsquo;ve seen prominent stablecoins break their peg during periods of market stress. And in 2022, we saw the complete collapse of the Terra/Luna arrangement, which had a totally inadequate mechanism for trying to stabilize the value of its token.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year, the Financial Stability Board published high-level recommendations for the oversight, supervision, and regulation of broadly adopted stablecoins, consistent with the key features we have advocated in a U.S. stablecoins framework.<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2722#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><span>[8]</span></a>&nbsp;Treasury has also advocated for common-sense reforms of its tools and authorities to address the increasing use of stablecoins by a variety of illicit actors, including to evade sanctions.</p>
<p>Finally, Treasury has also called, as Under Secretary Liang did in a speech last month, for a federal payments framework.<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2722#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"><span>[9]</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span>The current framework for the regulation of non-bank and e-money payment service providers has requirements that vary from state to state. This raises risks for the integrity of payment systems and public trust in money. It also raises barriers to entry, limiting competition and innovation. A federal payments framework would help maintain the global leadership of U.S. financial firms.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>SUPPORTING STRONG INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS AND COMPLIANCE</h3>
<p>Finally, we must navigate these technological innovations, and changing laws and regulations, without abandoning our commitment to strong international standards and compliance regimes. Standards and compliance regimes limit economic risk and help protect citizens around the world from fraud and other illicit finance threats.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used the phrase &ldquo;standards&rdquo; several times now. But in plain English, what do I mean? Standards can specify requirements for how payments technology must work, including elements related to the underlying programming code and messaging used to send and process payment requests. Standards can set the rules to determine who is allowed to participate in a payments system and when, and what users must do to manage risk and to make sure payments can continue to flow in the face of certain threats or disruptions. Operational standards might describe who has responsibility for oversight of various parts of the system and what pieces of information must be transparent and disclosed. Standards can define precisely what it means for a payment to be settled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Domestically, high quality, clear standards promote a safe and level playing field for firms, and invite stakeholder trust in their critical infrastructure. Internationally, standards can facilitate the spread of best practices and interoperability among systems&mdash;making it possible for the system in one country to &ldquo;speak&rdquo; to the system in another, both technically and legally.</p>
<p>One example of these standards is the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI), which provide guidance for managing the credit, collateral, and liquidity risks of payment system participants, as well as consideration of the operational risks than arise when system upgrades are rolled out.&nbsp; Another example is Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards, which specify steps that countries should implement in order to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing. They are critical in our efforts to prevent or trace financial activity involving fraudsters, drug traffickers, terrorists, and other bad actors. Currently, the United States is actively involved in the revision of FATF Recommendation 16 on payment transparency to reflect evolutions in the payments landscape over the last two decades and ensure the standard remains technologically neutral. A final example is the standards Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI), which recently published a harmonized international Organization for Standardization (ISO) 20022 messaging standard to reduce complications in cross-border payments created when different countries use different messaging formats.</p>
<p>These payment system standards are typically technology neutral. They apply just as well to new systems as they do to old ones. As we enter a period when legacy and innovative payment solutions coexist, standards will facilitate interoperability, not only across jurisdictions but also between diverse technologies. And accordingly, we will continue to encourage the application of these existing standards to new systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But we have to remain vigilant. Innovation can often give rise to new, implicit standards, long before the appropriate standard-setting organizations have reacted or caught up to the new technology.&nbsp;Therefore, the United States is and should continue to be an active and vocal participant in international standard-setting processes, ensuring that the responsible institutions keep pace with change. Public authorities, including Treasury and the Federal Reserve, represent the United States in groups like the FATF and CPMI.&nbsp; But we also rely on private sector firms to develop and advance standards, including those that apply internationally. For example, the American National Standards Institute, which is the U.S. member of the ISO, convenes experts across the private and public sectors, including Treasury, as well as academia. These and similar bodies are setting standards for critical and emerging technologies, and U.S. engagement is essential.</p>
<p>Treasury also supports the good work of the IMF and World Bank to provide payment system technical assistance and capacity development. This work helps embed and put into practice high quality technical, legal, and regulatory standards around the world. In the process, it helps deliver real benefits for the functioning of many domestic and cross-border payment systems in emerging market and developing economies.</p>
<p>Conversely, we should be wary of innovations that fail to meet international standards for safety, and soundness. For example, the United States has pressed international organizations to end any involvement with payment initiatives that are specifically designed to undermine or skirt global AML/CFT rules, sanctions, and other illicit finance controls. And we will discourage participation in payment systems that are not subject to high-quality international standards and supervision. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>POSITIVE EXTERNALITIES, CURRENCY CHOICE, AND THE INTERNATIONAL ROLE OF THE DOLLAR</h3>
<p>How does all of this relate to the role of the U.S. dollar? The fact that the dollar&rsquo;s global usage far exceeds the U.S. share of global economic and financial activity reflects features that are mostly unrelated to payments. It more likely stems from the fact that the dollar is supported by a transparent and reliable legal system, an independent central bank, and a government committed to sound macroeconomic policies and a freely floating currency. Dollar dominance is also likely buoyed by the global importance of U.S. capital markets, which support open, deep, and liquid trades in dollar-denominated securities.<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2722#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><span>[10]</span></a></p>
<p>That said, we do not &ndash; and must not &ndash; take for granted the benefits of the dollar system.&nbsp; And we should be appropriately humble with respect to our understanding of the demand for dollar use. After all, the fall of the pound and rise of the dollar roughly 100 years ago stands among the few observed shifts from one globally dominant currency to another. That&rsquo;s not a lot of data points to use to test hypotheses.</p>
<p>So, while there is little evidence from recent history that payments technology is a driver of currency choice, we must still at least entertain the possibility that new, high-quality, and safe payments infrastructures that are based on, or compatible with, the U.S. dollar, would bolster the dollar&rsquo;s important international role.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To be clear, the United States has not sought to compel anyone to use the dollar in cross-border or foreign transactions.&nbsp;Rather, we believe that emerging cross-border payment arrangements should preserve currency choice, including the ability to use a vehicle currency in foreign exchange transactions. All else equal, this will help reduce the overall cost of cross-currency payments. And if we succeed in keeping the U.S. public and private sectors central to payments innovations, operating within a well-designed domestic and global legal and regulatory environment, and upholding high-quality global standards and compliance regimes, the continued dominant use of the dollar strikes me as both the likely outcome and one that is in the interests of Americans as well as our allies and partners around the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To achieve that vision, the United States is seeking to advance payment rails innovation, implement sound regulatory frameworks internationally and at home, and promote international standards that improve safety and address illicit finance risks. We should step up our commitment to explore the potential benefits of tokenization solutions, pass strong and responsible domestic stablecoin legislation, and press international organizations to avoid supporting any payments innovations that could undermine existing, high-quality standards. And all together, these efforts can help maintain the continued primacy of the dollar and support the strength of the U.S. financial system, to the benefit of Americans and the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The steps I&rsquo;ve outlined above speak to core U.S. values and the need for sustained U.S. public and private sector engagement. The payments landscape is evolving in ways that have far reaching implications, from natural security to economic prosperity. The future of the financial system, global markets, and the U.S. and global economies demands our continued leadership.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good afternoon.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like to start by thanking our panelists today for sharing their perspectives and engaging in an important and insightful discussion.&nbsp; On the U.S. Government side, each of you is a close partner, and I appreciate the tremendous effort you put into carrying out our national security mission.&nbsp; I also see many members of the CFIUS bar, the business community, as well as compliance professionals.&nbsp; Thank you for your collaboration in the CFIUS process as well &ndash; you have an important role to play in supporting our work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this conference last year, I spoke about the Committee&rsquo;s compliance and enforcement work as well as our enhancements to transaction reviews and efficiencies; we also discussed mitigation agreement monitoring, third-party processes, non-notified transactions, and planned regulatory updates.&nbsp; Today, I want to highlight the progress made in furtherance of those priorities, and some of the work that lies ahead.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to handling hundreds of cases and ongoing monitoring responsibilities, we have made important regulatory updates, as previewed last year.&nbsp; We have also redoubled our efforts on enforcement, now levying eight civil monetary penalties in the past two years, four times more in that period than in the Committee&rsquo;s history.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, fulfilling our mandate in the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018, or FIRRMA, to regularly consult and meet with allies and partners, we have also been active across the globe in sharing best practices regarding robust investment screening, the importance of timely reviews, and how to promote open investment consistent with the protection of national security.&nbsp; We certainly can and must do both.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our work and the status of the United States as the world&rsquo;s top destination for foreign direct investment highlights that this balance is possible.&nbsp; In the past two years alone, CFIUS has cleared hundreds of transactions with a collective value of nearly $500 billion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our national security work requires depth, breadth, and resources. Over the past year, we have continued to strengthen our analytical and operational capabilities.&nbsp; We have done this by building and implementing sophisticated tools, platforms, and methodologies for assessing and addressing national security risks.&nbsp;We employ cutting-edge information technology platforms to securely manage and facilitate novel aspects of CFIUS&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; We have expanded and deepened our human capital and today have a team with widely diverse backgrounds, from lawyers to science Ph.D.s to intelligence professionals to bankers to compliance professionals and former prosecutors.&nbsp;And across the Committee, we benefit from a much broader team with incredible subject matter expertise.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to take a moment to recognize the hard work of the career public servants who carry out the work of CFIUS.&nbsp; In addition to Treasury&rsquo;s role as chair of CFIUS, there are eight other agency political appointees who lead this work across the Committee, but there are hundreds of career staff who do the hard work and in-depth analysis that underpins each transaction we review.&nbsp; Working with this group of dedicated national security professionals has been an honor, and our national security is stronger as a result of their contributions.</p>
<p>The work of our outstanding team, in conjunction with our ongoing technological improvements, have enabled us to be more efficient and effective as we contend with two core challenges.&nbsp; First, transactions are increasingly complex.&nbsp; And second, the global security landscape is constantly changing, and CFIUS is identifying and addressing more national security risks than in years past as a result, including as it relates to sensitive data and technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have also been paying particular attention to the role of limited partners in investment funds.&nbsp; The reality is that not all LP arrangements are the same and it is often important for the Committee to understand the identity and role of LPs when relevant to understanding a transaction and assessing whether it poses national security risk.&nbsp; We recognize that sometimes a fund sponsor, for example, may have a contractual commitment to keep confidential the identity of an LP, and to that end, I can reassure you that we have processes and procedures in place to ensure that information filed with the Committee is handled appropriately.&nbsp; Indeed, the Committee strictly adheres to its statutory confidentiality obligations.&nbsp; And we&rsquo;ve done a lot of thinking around the issue of LP investments, benefitting from, among other things, the work of the Department of Commerce in this area.&nbsp; In the same way that financial institutions are obligated to &ldquo;know your customer,&rdquo; I often tell businesses seeking funding they should know their investor &ndash; because CFIUS certainly will.&nbsp; LP agreements, side letters, and other informal arrangements can all be potential vectors for national security risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On that note, I want to take a moment to recognize our colleagues in the Intelligence Community.&nbsp; The Committee is a voracious consumer of the IC&rsquo;s work, which gives Committee members critical information and analysis to fully understand the potential &ldquo;threat&rdquo; for each and every transaction that comes before CFIUS.&nbsp; This is a fundamental input to our work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I mentioned efficiency as an important part of our work &ndash; and we take that seriously.&nbsp; We are working through cases faster than in years before.&nbsp; In 2023, CFIUS cleared 66 percent of distinct transactions without mitigation measures in either the 30-day assessment period for a declaration or the initial 45-day review period for a notice &ndash; compared to 58 percent in 2022. In 2024, preliminary data shows this clearance rate continuing to climb ever further.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>CFIUS also improved its efficiency by decreasing the frequency of withdrawn and refiled transactions from 23 percent of notices in 2022 to 18 percent of notices in 2023.&nbsp; This is the first such reduction in five years, and a trend we see continuing into 2024.&nbsp;These changes are not incidental; instead, they reflect the focus we&rsquo;ve placed on improving efficiency at every step in our process and the dedicated work of Committee staff.</p>
<p>We have also transformed how we approach compliance with mitigation agreements.&nbsp; Today, we are actively monitoring mitigation measures in approximately 240 cases.&nbsp; We have expanded and devoted significant resources to monitoring, nearly doubling the size of Treasury&rsquo;s team over the last several years, including hiring professionals with audit and other relevant compliance experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2023, Treasury and other agencies went on over forty site visits, both domestically and internationally, to monitored businesses.&nbsp;In addition to the Committee&rsquo;s monitoring role, the use of third parties and internal compliance professionals is a critical piece of ensuring the protection of national security &ndash; from third party monitors and auditors to trustees to security officers and security directors, all of whom play an integral role in working with mitigated companies and the Committee to protect national security.</p>
<p>We also remain vigilant in our enforcement of mitigation agreements, and as I mentioned earlier we&rsquo;ve made tremendous advancement in this space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an effort to increase transparency with regard to enforcement actions, in August, we debuted an updated enforcement website that provides further information regarding how the Committee approaches compliance and enforcement.&nbsp; This includes new information regarding the penalties CFIUS has levied in the past few years, including the $60 million penalty imposed for a company&rsquo;s failure to take appropriate measures to prevent unauthorized access to certain sensitive data and failure to promptly report unauthorized access.&nbsp; I can also share that, in the last year, CFIUS has &ndash; for the first time &ndash; utilized its subpoena authority in support of its national security mission.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As many of you know firsthand, we have continued to improve our ability to identify transactions that may pose a risk to national security and were not notified to the Committee by the parties.&nbsp; The Committee leverages multiple tools and data sources &ndash; including public reporting, subscription services, tips from the public, Committee members or Congress, and classified reporting &ndash; to identify and analyze such non-notified transactions.&nbsp; Treasury&rsquo;s non-notified team screens thousands of transactions, ultimately putting forward those that may raise national security considerations to the Committee for consideration to request a filing.&nbsp; The President&rsquo;s order in May of this year prohibiting the purchase and requiring the divestment of certain real estate operated as a cryptocurrency mining by facility by MineOne initially came to the Committee&rsquo;s attention through our non-notified process after we received a tip from the public.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The MineOne case also showcases the importance of our jurisdiction over real estate transactions.&nbsp; CFIUS reviewed and investigated this transaction pursuant to authorities provided by Congress in FIRRMA to cover real estate transactions in close proximity to certain sensitive U.S. facilities.&nbsp; We have been focused on updates to our real estate jurisdiction, working closely with the Department of Defense.&nbsp; Last year, we added eight military installations to our real estate regulations and earlier this month, we issued a final rule that expands CFIUS&rsquo;s ability to review certain real estate transactions by foreign persons near more than 60 military bases and installations across 30 states.&nbsp;This is the result of a recent comprehensive assessment conducted by the Department of Defense regarding its military installations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And just yesterday, we issued a final rule to sharpen our investigation and enforcement tools.&nbsp; Among other things, this rule expands our authority to request and subpoena information for non-notified transactions, increases the maximum monetary penalty available for certain violations, and expands the instances in which CFIUS may use its subpoena authority, including in the non-notified context.&nbsp; After taking into consideration the public comments we received on the proposed rule, the final rule allows the CFIUS Staff Chairperson to impose a deadline with respect to party responses to mitigation agreement drafts not as a default, but where appropriate.&nbsp; We see this as a necessary tool in certain instances.&nbsp; These enhancements are drawn from lessons learned as we have increased our focus on compliance, monitoring, and enforcement over the last few years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also remain engaged with Congress as one of our key stakeholders.&nbsp;In July, I again testified before the Senate Banking Committee regarding the work of the Committee.&nbsp; We regularly engage with congressional staff and members regarding potential legislation, and pursuant to our statute, from time-to-time provide case briefings on covered transactions after concluding action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our protection of national security does not stop at the border; indeed, our national security is linked to the security of our allies and partners.&nbsp; Therefore, it is essential to U.S. national security that our allies and partners develop and maintain effective national security-focused investment screening processes.&nbsp; This has been an important part of our work and in 2023 and 2024 alone, alongside the State Department, we have had hundreds of engagements with our foreign allies and partners, including an investment screening Memorandum of Intent that Treasury Secretary Yellen signed last year with her counterpart in Mexico.&nbsp;Over the past few years, the work we have done has contributed to the proposal, creation, or enhancement of investment screening programs in over 30 countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am proud of Treasury and the Committee&rsquo;s efforts in all of these areas, but I also recognize that there is more work to do.&nbsp; While some of us will be departing our roles during this transition period, the incredible career staff will carry on with the same high caliber of professionalism and competence that you all have come to expect.&nbsp;In doing so, I fully anticipate that the Committee will remain focused on promoting and enforcing compliance with our regulations and agreements, improving our efficiency, and honing our authorities to ensure the protection of national security, all the while creating a welcoming environment for foreign investment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you again for joining us today.</p>

<title>Canadian Securities Administrators Proposes Amendments And Changes To Implement An Access Model For Certain Continuous Disclosure Documents Of Non-Investment Fund Reporting Issuers</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/canadian-securities-administrators-proposes-amendments-and-changes-to-implement/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) is seeking feedback on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/accessmodel" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">proposed amendments and changes</a>&nbsp;to implement an access model for certain disclosure documents of non-investment fund reporting issuers (the&nbsp;<strong>Proposed Access Model</strong>).&nbsp;<br /><br />The Proposed Access Model aims to modernize the way documents are made available to investors by allowing issuers to provide investors with electronic access to certain continuous disclosure documents, without impacting investors&rsquo; ability to request, or provide standing instructions to receive, those documents in electronic or paper form. It will give issuers another alternative to send annual financial statements, interim financial reports and related management&rsquo;s discussion &amp; analysis (MD&amp;A) (collectively,&nbsp;<strong>CD documents</strong>), instead of following the current requirements found in securities legislation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Proposed Access Model is consistent with the general evolution of our capital markets and recognizes that investors are increasingly accessing and consuming information electronically,&rdquo; said Stan Magidson, CSA Chair and Chair and CEO of the Alberta Securities Commission. &ldquo;It will further enhance investors&rsquo; awareness of the availability of CD documents and how they can be accessed electronically.&rdquo;<br /><br />The CSA published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/news/canadian-securities-regulators-seek-comment-on-the-implementation-of-an-access-equals-delivery-model-for-non-investment-fund-reporting-issuers/">initial proposals</a>&nbsp;for implementing an access model for prospectuses, generally, and CD documents (the&nbsp;<strong>Initial Proposals</strong>) on April 7, 2022. On January 11, 2024, the CSA published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/news/csa-announces-final-amendments-and-changes-to-implement-an-access-model-for-prospectuses-of-non-investment-fund-reporting-issuers/">amendments and changes implementing an access model for prospectuses only</a>, which generally came into force on April 16, 2024.<br /><br />After considering the comments received during the 2022 consultation, as well as consulting with the CSA Investor Advisory Panel throughout the policy development process, the CSA made substantive changes to the Initial Proposals for CD documents to enhance the Proposed Access Model from an investor perspective.<br /><br />As we consider these to be material changes, we are republishing the Proposed Access Model for a further 90-day comment period that will end on&nbsp;<strong>February 17, 2025</strong>. Details about submitting comments can be found at the end of the CSA Notice of Republication and Request for Comment.<br /><br />With this republication, the CSA anticipates resuming the work needed to implement the amendments that would introduce the annual and interim disclosure statements that were proposed in May 2021 (<strong>CD modernization proposals</strong>). Further, in deciding on the timing for implementing any of the CD modernization proposals, we will ensure reporting issuers are provided with sufficient time to transition to any new forms and requirements.<br /><br />The CSA, the council of the securities regulators of Canada&rsquo;s provinces and territories, coordinates and harmonizes regulation for the Canadian capital markets.</p>

<title>BME Highlights The Role Of The Stock Exchange In Channelling Investments To And From Latin America At The 26th Latibex Forum</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bme-highlights-the-role-of-the-stock-exchange-in-channelling-investments-to-and/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li><span>David Jim&eacute;nez-Blanco, Vice-President of BME, defended at the opening of the event that the current situation is favourable for Latin American companies to list in Spain</span></li>
<li><span>Amparo L&oacute;pez Senovilla, Secretary of State for Trade, stated that Spanish direct investment in the region generates more than 425,000 direct jobs</span></li>
<li><span>The Forum also hosted a series of panels aimed at analysing the economic reality and investment opportunities in the region</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The first day of the Latibex 2024 Forum held at the Palacio de la Bolsa de Madrid has come to an end, in which the growing investment of Latin American companies in Spain and the role of the financial markets in channelling this investment has been one of the main themes. On the one hand, one-on-one meetings were held between companies and investors. At the same time, throughout the day, the agenda of panels on current economic issues in the region was developed.</p>
<p>The inaugural lunch was attended by David Jim&eacute;nez-Blanco, Vice-Chairman of BME, who in his speech stressed that &lsquo;we are in a favourable situation for the listing of Latin American companies on Spanish markets, especially in the case of SMEs and start-ups&rsquo;. He also stressed that the region has the necessary foundations to face the great challenges of the future in terms of sustainability with a certain advantage, such as the ageing population and climate change.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Amparo L&oacute;pez Senovilla, Secretary of State for Trade, stated that Latin America is one of the pillars of Spanish foreign policy and that three countries in the region are among the top ten destinations for Spanish direct investment abroad, an investment that generates more than 425,000 direct jobs. He also stressed that it is a two-way relationship, and that direct investment in Spain from Latin America is increasing all the time.</p>
<p>The inaugural lunch was also attended by Manuel Cendoya, Director General of Communication, Marketing and Corporate Studies and Vice-President of Santander Spain, and Juan Aguayo, partner at Cuatrecasas.&nbsp; Cendoya explained that 76% of Spanish companies in Latin America want to increase their investments in the region and that, although there is still some way to go, the improvements in legal security and the structural reforms that have been carried out are evident. He also underscored Santander's vocation to remain in the region, which is the Bank's hallmark.</p>
<p>Aguayo said that Cuatrecasas has 220 lawyers working in its four offices in the region. In his speech, he stressed that there are excellent Latin American companies that see Spain as a platform for growth and that see financing opportunities here, including the Spanish stock market.</p>
<p>The lunch was preceded by the panel &lsquo;Macro Analysis: Macroeconomic Perspectives in Latin America&rsquo;, with the participation of Javier J. P&eacute;rez, Chief International Economy and Eurozone at the Bank of Spain; Alejandro Padilla, Chief Economist at Banorte and Juan Cerruti, Chief Economist at Santander. The speakers reflected on the possibility of Latin America benefiting from the trade battle between the United States and China after Trump's election victory. They also discussed the region's opportunities in areas such as technology and the importance of the EU strengthening its ties with Latin America, given the need for rare earth raw materials for the green transition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alicia Rub&iacute;, Sustainability Partner, Strategy and Transactions at EY, then moderated the panel &lsquo;Sustainable Investment in Latin America: Challenges and Perspectives&rsquo; with the participation of Augusto Caro (CFA Society Spain), Jorge Murillo N&uacute;&ntilde;ez (Volc&aacute;n Compa&ntilde;&iacute;a Minera) and Luiz Alberto Esteves (CAF Development Bank). During the panel, the participants presented the challenges of sustainable investment, especially in the mining sector, discussed the need for a taxonomy to encourage this type of investment and talked about how sustainable investment should help to achieve social benefits for the population as a whole.</p>
<p>The first day of the Forum concluded with the panel on &lsquo;Equity Investment in Latin America&rsquo;. In this panel with Fernando Luque (Morningstar), D&iacute;dac P&eacute;rez (Caja de Ingenieros) and H&eacute;ctor Godoy (Santander AM) as speakers and Gizeh Polo (Cuatrecasas) as moderator, it was stated that Latin American stock market indices offer opportunities for investors after the recent falls and high valuations in other markets such as the United States.</p>
<p>The second and final day of the Forum will be held tomorrow, with the usual one-on-one meetings and three panels on renewable energies, Latin American investment in Spain and strategic technologies.</p>
<p>The Forum has Santander and Cuatrecasas as main sponsors and Morningstar, CFA Society Spain, ICEX and WTV. as sponsors. Instituto BME, Atribus and the Spanish Institute of Analysts will be collaborators.</p>

<title>ACER Identifies Need For Higher Consistency In European Gas And Hydrogen Network Plans</title>

<p>Natural gas and hydrogen network developments are instrumental for achieving EU&rsquo;s decarbonisation goals, ensuring natural gas security of supply and fostering the hydrogen market. Consistency in network planning at European and national levels promotes efficient network development.</p>
<p>Every two years, ACER&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsDBgUCUVFTB0xbA1VRHVYJA1cdUwwFAhoBAwEHDFAEBlBQAwUdBFxaUwAEBlEdBl0DBR0GCAkCGlRRAA4ZBQcBB1RTV1MDAFZTRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">evaluates</a>&nbsp;how well national gas and hydrogen Network Development Plans (NDPs) align with the EU-wide Ten-Year Network Development Plan (EU TYNDP).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is in ACER&rsquo;s latest Opinion?</span></p>
<p>ACER&rsquo;s latest Opinion (covering 2023-2024) reveals two main trends:</p>
<ul>
<li>Growing consistency in gas network planning: there is a modest yet encouraging trend towards aligning national gas NDPs with the EU TYNDP.</li>
<li>Emerging hydrogen network planning practices: several countries have developed hydrogen strategies, legal frameworks, and specific hydrogen planning activities. There is a low but growing consistency in hydrogen TYNDP projects included in the NDPs (rising from 17% in 2022 to 33% in 2024).</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What does ACER recommend?</span></p>
<p>To improve consistency of NDPs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consult stakeholders and coordinate with neighbouring operators to exchange information on scenarios, infrastructure gaps, and cross-border projects.</li>
<li>Coordinate the timing of national planning with the EU-TYNDP development process as much as possible.</li>
<li>Emphasise the integration of low-carbon and renewable gases, along with decommissioning and repurposing projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>To improve consistency of EU TYNDPs:</p>
<ul>

<p>Trading Technologies International, Inc. (TT), a global capital markets technology platform provider, announced today that it will soon offer clients access to Cboe equity index options, giving TT clients access to the rapidly growing equity options trading space.</p>
<p>Slated for launch early in 2025, Cboe equity index options on the TT platform will enable the firm's broad client base of institutional market participants and professional traders to easily take positions in Cboe's popular index products, including its flagship S&amp;P 500 Index (SPX), Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), Russell 2000 Index (RUT) and Mini SPX (XSP) options contracts.</p>
<p><span class="xn-person">Alun Green</span>, TT's EVP Managing Director, Futures &amp; Options, said: "TT has been a leader in exchange-traded derivatives throughout our existence. As we continue our expansion into new asset classes, U.S. equity options represent a significant part of the derivatives space. We're eager to unlock new opportunities for our clients with Cboe's hugely popular index options as a major first step in this diversification. Our clients want to participate via the powerful TT platform and trusted tools, and we're seeing particularly strong interest from firms in the&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Asia-Pacific</span>&nbsp;region, which are excited to access the markets through the after-hours session we'll support."</p>
<p>"Our collaboration with TT is particularly timely as global demand for U.S. options continues to rise, with investors increasingly seeking exposure to the U.S. equity markets," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Catherine Clay</span>, Global Head of Derivatives at Cboe Global Markets. "By offering clients access to Cboe's index options products, TT will further expand their customers' trading capabilities, enabling access to some of the most liquid markets in the world &ndash; including SPX, RUT and VIX options &ndash; and the ability to efficiently gain and manage exposure to U.S. large and small cap equity markets and market volatility. As the leading global derivatives exchange, Cboe is excited to support TT's expansion into U.S. equity options and broaden access to our markets and products for the global trading community." &nbsp;</p>

<title>ACER’s Hydrogen Monitoring Report Foresees That Europe Is Likely To Miss Its 2030 Renewable Hydrogen Targets</title>

<p>Europe's&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsABFcIAlFUAkwKVwJTHVZaBVQdU1gDXhoMUgUBUgQCBwIFBlcdWVIAVgxTAlQdBFtTBR0GDQlRGlRVAwMZAgQAAwEACFkHU1RSRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Hydrogen and Gas Decarbonisation legislation</a>&nbsp;(2024) tasks ACER with monitoring the emerging hydrogen market.</p>
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsCBgYDBVQAVkwBUARSHVYMUAQdUA4HBxoEXAZRBVVWBVAJUlAdWVIAVgxTAlQdBFtTBR0GDQlRGlRVAwMZAgQAAwEACFkHU1RSRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ACER&rsquo;s first hydrogen monitoring report</a>&nbsp;highlights that, despite ambitious EU strategies, hydrogen projects face risks from uncertainties of future hydrogen demand and high costs.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the main findings?</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Low hydrogen demand:&nbsp;</strong>The EU is likely to miss the 2030 strategic goal of 20 Mt renewable hydrogen consumption, as current consumption at European level is 7.2 Mt (99.7% of it produced from fossil fuels). EU renewable energy and decarbonisation targets can increase demand for renewable and low-carbon hydrogen by 2030, but so far uptake has been slow.</li>
<li><strong>Limited electrolyser capacity:</strong> 
<ul>
<li>Total installed capacity of electrolysers in Europe in 2023 was 216 MW.</li>
<li>Further 70 GW planned for 2030 announced but few are advanced.</li>
<li>Overall planned capacity is less than the 100+ GW needed to reach EU&rsquo;s 10 Mt renewable hydrogen production target by 2030.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>High costs prevent renewable hydrogen uptake:</strong>&nbsp;The cost of renewable hydrogen is currently 3 to 4 times higher than hydrogen produced from natural gas, discouraging its early offtake.</li>
<li><strong>Significant infrastructure planned but they face uncertainties in being realised:</strong> 
<ul>
<li>42,000 km of hydrogen pipelines, numerous storage projects and terminals are planned for the next decade, but only 1% has reached final investment decision, as future hydrogen demand uncertainties pose significant challenges to project promoters.</li>
<li>Integrated planning by gas, electricity and hydrogen network operators is needed to ensure grid development at sufficient pace and to optimally locate electrolysers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are ACER&rsquo;s key recommendations?</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Quickly transpose the EU (2024) hydrogen and decarbonised gas laws into national legislation and implement them.</li>
<li>Speed up electrolysers deployment and decarbonisation of electricity sector to increase renewable hydrogen&rsquo;s cost competitiveness.</li>
<li>Improve forecasting and accelerate integrated planning to identify realistic hydrogen infrastructure needs, avoiding overinvestments and reducing costs related to under-recovery risks.</li>
<li>When future demand is highly uncertain, consider incremental infrastructure development based on market needs (to avoid building too much network too fast and stranded assets).</li>
<li>Consider carefully the repurposing of gas networks for hydrogen to minimise costs, while not overlooking the potential impacts on the broader gas sector (including security of gas supplies).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Swiftly address demand risk in financing hydrogen networks.</li>
<li>Provide market certainty over the role of non-renewable, low-carbon hydrogen.</li>
</ul>

Six years of historical, nanosecond unconflated OPRA options data is now available to market participants globally, in addition to conflated datasets, complementing existing US equity and futures datasets.</span></p>
<p><span>Widely recognised as one of the industry's largest data sets, OPRA data is vital for traders, brokers, institutional investors, and market makers who need accurate and timely information to assess liquidity dynamics and understand market behaviour.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>OPRA consolidates and distributes options data from all U.S. equity options exchanges, providing a unified feed of options prices and trade information; f</span>inancial market participants rely on OPRA data to make informed trading decisions, manage risk, and optimise investment strategies.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li> <span>Buy-side firms use OPRA data to backtest strategies, perform TCA and execution analysis, and generate alpha.</span> </li>
<li> <span>Sell-side firms rely on OPRA data to backtest execution algorithms, improve smart order routers and demonstrate best execution, track liquidity fragmentation and stay informed of changes to market structure.</span> </li>
<li> <span>Using OPRA data, Exchanges can analyse market share across US equity options exchanges and mechanisms.</span> </li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong><span>Paul Humphrey, Chief Executive Officer of BMLL, said</span></strong><span>: &ldquo;Adding OPRA options data is another significant milestone in our data coverage expansion strategy.

<p><span>&ldquo;Spiralling data costs and OPRA&rsquo;s expansion of its data dissemination from 48 to 96 lines in February 2024 have placed a significant burden on market participants, both in terms of managing market data budgets and also the necessary data infrastructure [to handle 4TB of data per day]&rdquo;,&nbsp;<strong>said David Robinson, Chief Technology Officer, BMLL.&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;As a result, firms are looking for cloud-based OPRA data services that are easy to access, within their existing workflows.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>

<title>Cboe Conducts First European Retail Investor Survey - Indicates Strong Demand For European Equity Options And Trusted Financial Education</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul type="disc">
<li>Survey suggests strong interest in exchange-traded equity options from both current retail European derivatives investors and non-derivatives investors</li>
<li>European retail investors' primary motivations in options trading include capital protection and hedging</li>
<li>Investors overall said they want more dependable financial and options education</li>
<li>As part of Cboe's ongoing efforts to unlock greater retail participation in options, The Options Institute &ndash; Cboe's education arm &ndash; plans to expand its presence into Europe in early 2025</li>
</ul>
<p>Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe: CBOE), the world's leading derivatives and securities exchange network, today announced the results of its inaugural survey of European retail investors, conducted jointly by Cboe Europe Derivatives (CEDX), Cboe's pan-European equity derivatives marketplace, and The Options Institute, Cboe's education arm.</p>
<p>Overall, the survey reveals a strong interest among European retail investors in utilising exchange-traded options for risk management along with a clear need for education, highlighting an opportunity for the industry to address this demand. CEDX has been working with The Options Institute on ways to bring more awareness of financial markets and derivatives products to the European retail investor community and together plan to offer a comprehensive suite of educational resources in Europe from early 2025.</p>
<p>The survey aimed to gain insights into current retail investing preferences in Europe, attitudes towards options products and levels of interest in educational resources, to help inform The Options Institute's delivery of services in the region and empower a new generation of investors. Conducted amid ongoing efforts by European policymakers to encourage more retail investment in the region's capital markets, the survey results clearly indicate that exchange-traded equity options can play an important role in attracting greater retail participation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Survey participants were segmented into three categories: current derivatives users; participants interested in derivatives but who do not currently trade them (derivatives prospects) and participants that do not have a desire to trade derivatives. Key findings of the survey include:</p>
<p><b>Derivatives Users:</b></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><b>62%</b>&nbsp;are interested in trading options contracts with stocks/shares as the underlying;</li>
<li><b>61%</b>&nbsp;said they would take an advanced course to learn more about options;&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
<li><b>47%</b>&nbsp;said that capital protection is their top strategy for options, followed by hedging (35%) and risk reversals (33%);</li>
<li><b>41%&nbsp;</b>said they would seek education from exchanges.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Derivatives Prospects:</b></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><b>54%</b>&nbsp;of those aware of options are interested in trading them with stocks/shares as the underlying, though 66% said that they would need more basic financial education before taking that interest any further;</li>
<li><b>64%</b>&nbsp;said they wish they had more dependable sources of education around investing;</li>
<li><b>39%&nbsp;</b>said they would seek education from exchanges;</li>
<li><b>61</b><b>%</b>&nbsp;said that understanding options trading strategies is the options topic they are most interested in learning about, followed by risk and portfolio management (53%) and options basics (45%).</li>
</ul>
<p>Launched in 2021,&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4306244-1&amp;h=583298665&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cboe.com%2Feurope%2Fderivatives%2Foverview%2F&amp;a=CEDX" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CEDX</a>&nbsp;is a pan-European derivatives marketplace and offers equity index derivatives and more than 320 equity options on leading companies from 14 European countries. CEDX's mission is to grow European derivatives markets through a modern, efficient and pan-European ecosystem that lowers barriers to entry for institutional and retail investors. Earlier this year, Interactive Brokers joined the exchange as a participant and now provides its clients with access to CEDX's range of offerings, representing a significant milestone on its journey to improve the ability of individual and institutional investors to access European derivatives, particularly options.</p>
<p>Iouri Saroukhanov, Head of European Derivatives, Cboe Europe, said: "Cboe has witnessed firsthand the growing influence of retail investors, especially in US options, and these survey results demonstrate European markets are on the cusp of transformation by this community if the significant demand that exists for exchange-traded options can be effectively unlocked. CEDX has been striving to lower traditional barriers to entry by creating a more efficient, simpler, and lower cost pan-European derivatives exchange. However, more needs to be done to cultivate an investing culture among European retail investors and provide the necessary resources for them to start trading. Therefore, we are thrilled that The Options Institute will offer educational courses to European retail investors starting early next year, helping to address the limited access these investors have had to direct options education compared to other regions."</p>
<p>Alexandra Szakats, Head of The Options Institute at Cboe, said: "Access to meaningful and digestible education has played a pivotal role in the growth of options adoption in the US, particularly among retail investors. This survey demonstrates a tremendous opportunity for similar growth in European markets with Cboe being well-positioned to provide a wide set of educational resources that allow retail investors to make more informed decisions. The Options Institute is excited to expand into Europe, building upon its decades of worthwhile educational efforts through an array of content and resources. The insights from the survey and subsequent focus group discussions will inform our planned activities in the European market, helping retail investors better understand options and the utility they can provide to their portfolios."</p>

The Options Institute will look to build upon its efforts in the US and will offer derivatives and financial education through on-line courses, on-demand offerings and an options knowledge center to European investors. Courses often feature speakers from The Options Institute's Adjunct Faculty Program. Programming is available in English and Spanish with Dutch and German resources expected to launch in early 2025.</p>
<p>The European retail investor survey, and follow-up focus group discussions, were conducted between June and August of 2024.

<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/calpers-climate-solution-commitments-surpass-53-billion/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/calpers-climate-solution-commitments-surpass-53-billion/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>CalPERS announced Monday it has committed more than $53 billion toward investing in climate solutions as part of a growing global transition toward a low-carbon economy.</p>
<p>The milestone comes one year after CalPERS launched its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/page/investments/sustainable-investments-program/net-zero">$100 Billion Climate Action Plan</a>. The plan is a key component of CalPERS&rsquo;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/page/newsroom/calpers-news/2023/calpers-announces-100-billion-net-zero-pledge-and-new-climate-accountability-measures">Sustainable Investments 2030 Strategy</a>&nbsp;which &ndash; in addition to identifying opportunities for growth &ndash; seeks to reduce investment risks by cutting the emissions intensity of the fund&rsquo;s portfolio in half by the end of 2030 and achieving Net Zero emissions by 2050.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The energy transition underway represents one of the biggest investment opportunities in history,&rdquo; said CalPERS Chief Executive Officer Marcie Frost. &ldquo;We are providing the capital necessary to plant the seed for the low-carbon economy of the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>CalPERS had identified $47 billion in existing climate-focused investments when the plan was launched last November. Those investments are now valued at $50 billion. In addition, CalPERS has made new commitments of $3.6 billion in climate solution investments over the past year, divided between private equity and infrastructure.</p>
<p>Through a partnership with Brookfield, a global investment firm that acquired a stake in FirstEnergy Transmission, the CalPERS plan provides support for initiatives focused on the clean energy transition, including investments to enhance power grid reliability across multiple Midwest and Mid-Atlantic states.</p>
<p>CalPERS climate investments also include a private equity investment partnership with&nbsp;<a href="https://therisefund.com/" target="_blank" title="Opens in new window">TPG Rise Climate</a>. The fund focuses on scaling climate solutions globally and the partnership seeks to invest and collaborate in opportunities across the fund&rsquo;s core themes including energy transition, green mobility, sustainable fuels and molecules, and carbon solutions.</p>
<p>Climate solutions funded by CalPERS over the past year include an investment in&nbsp;<a href="https://octopus.energy/about-us/" target="_blank" title="Opens in new window">Octopus Energy</a>, a fast-growing renewable energy company based in the United Kingdom.&nbsp;<a href="https://octopus.energy/press/Octopus-Energy-valuation-increases-to-9bn-following-further-commitments-from-existing-investors/" target="_blank" title="Opens in new window">The company uses an advanced operating system to power 6 million homes in the UK, 60 million homes globally, and is expanding its operations into the United States</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We believe that making sound, long-term investments in climate solutions will generate outperformance while also providing the clean energy needed to meet the increased demands that people have for their homes, cars and technology,&rdquo; said CalPERS Chief Investment Officer Stephen Gilmore.</p>
<p>Beyond the fully executed deals, officials are reviewing an additional $3.2 billion in climate-related investments. Some of these investments could be finalized in the coming weeks and months.</p>
<p>The $100 Billion Climate Action Plan seeks investments aimed at climate adaptation, transition, and mitigation efforts. The plan is a partnership between the CalPERS Sustainable Investments team and the teams that manage the fund&rsquo;s various asset classes, working together to identify key investing opportunities.</p>

<title>Department of Justice: Former CEO Indicted For Role In Bribing Japanese Officials And BIT Mining Ltd. Resolves Foreign Bribery Investigation</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/department-of-justice-former-ceo-indicted-for-role-ii-bribing-japanese-official/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/department-of-justice-former-ceo-indicted-for-role-ii-bribing-japanese-official/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>An indictment was unsealed today charging the former CEO of 500.com (now BIT Mining Ltd.), Zhengming Pan, a Chinese national, with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). BIT Mining Ltd. has agreed to resolve investigations by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) into related FCPA violations arising from the company&rsquo;s participation in a corrupt scheme to pay bribes to Japanese government officials.</p>
<p>BIT Mining entered into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) in connection with a criminal information filed in the District of New Jersey charging BIT Mining with one count of conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery and books and records provisions of the FCPA and one count of violating the books and records provisions of the FCPA.</p>
<p>A federal grand jury in the District of New Jersey returned an indictment against Pan on June 18. Pan is charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery and books and records provisions of the FCPA, one count of violating the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA, and two counts of violating the books and records provisions of the FCPA.</p>
<p>&ldquo;BIT Mining, under the alleged direction of then-CEO Zhengming Pan, agreed to pay nearly $2 million in bribes to Japanese government officials to win a contract to open a lucrative resort and casino in Japan,&rdquo; said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department&rsquo;s Criminal Division. &ldquo;Pan has been indicted for his alleged role in directing company consultants to pay the bribes and to conceal the illicit payments through sham consulting contracts. Today&rsquo;s resolution and the charges against Pan demonstrate the department&rsquo;s continued commitment to holding both corporate and individual wrongdoers accountable for their crimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paying bribes to foreign government officials is a serious crime. The top leadership of BIT Mining, then known as 500.com, directed consultants to pay bribes to Japanese government officials to win a bid to open a large resort in Japan,&rdquo; said U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger for the District of New Jersey. &ldquo;The illegal scheme started at the top, with the company&rsquo;s CEO allegedly fully involved in directing the illicit payments and the subsequent efforts to conceal them. The company has admitted its crimes and agreed to pay a $10 million penalty, and its then-CEO has been charged for his role in the scheme. This agreement and indictment hold both the corporation as an entity and its top leadership accountable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s indictment against the former CEO of BIT Mining for bribing Japanese officials highlights the FBI&rsquo;s commitment to holding individuals accountable for illegal conduct,&rdquo; said Assistant Director Chad Yarbrough of the FBI Criminal Investigative Division. &ldquo;This type of criminal activity undermines the integrity of business practices. The FBI will relentlessly pursue those involved in illegal schemes creating unfair advantages and ensure they face the full consequences of the law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to court documents, between 2017 and 2019, BIT Mining, then known as 500.com, admitted that its then-CEO Pan, employees, and agents, agreed to pay approximately $1.9&nbsp;million in bribes and payments to intermediaries, knowing the money would be used to make bribe payments to Japanese government officials. The purpose of the bribes was to try to help 500.com win a bid to open an integrated resort (a large resort that includes hotels, casinos, retail, dining, convention facilities, and entertainment venues) in Japan. On behalf of 500.com, Pan allegedly engaged third-party consultants to assist 500.com in paying and concealing these bribes. 500.com, through these consultants, paid bribes in the form of cash, travel, entertainment, and gifts. Pan and others allegedly covered up the payment of these bribes by, among other things, entering into sham contracts with the consultants and falsely recording the payments as legitimate expenses, including as management advisory fees. Ultimately, despite carrying out this bribery scheme, 500.com did not win an integrated resort bid in Japan.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the DPA, BIT Mining agreed, based on the application of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, that the appropriate criminal penalty is $54 million. However, due to BIT Mining&rsquo;s financial condition and demonstrated inability to pay the penalty calculated under the U.S.&nbsp;Sentencing Guidelines, BIT Mining and the Justice Department agreed, consistent with the department&rsquo;s inability to pay guidance, that BIT Mining will pay a total criminal penalty of $10&nbsp;million. The Justice Department has agreed to credit up to $4 million against the civil penalty BIT Mining has agreed to pay to the SEC to resolve a parallel investigation.</p>
<p>BIT Mining has also agreed to continue to cooperate with the Fraud Section and the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the District of New Jersey in any ongoing or future criminal investigations. In addition, BIT Mining has agreed to continue to enhance its compliance programs and provide reports to the Justice Department regarding remediation and the implementation of compliance measures for the three-year term of the DPA.</p>
<p>The Justice Department reached this resolution with BIT Mining based on a number of factors, including, among others, the nature and seriousness of the offense. BIT Mining received credit for its cooperation with the department&rsquo;s investigation, which included (i) voluntarily producing relevant documents, financial data, and other information, including from foreign countries, while navigating some foreign data privacy and related criminal laws, accompanied by translations of a limited number of documents; and (ii) providing the government with facts learned during its internal investigation. The cooperation was, however, reactive and limited in degree and impact.</p>
<p>BIT Mining engaged in certain timely remedial measures, which included, among other things, (i)&nbsp;increasing governance and oversight of compliance risks and audit findings by the Board of Directors, (ii) promoting compliance and ethics through company-wide communications, (iii) incorporating compliance criteria in performance evaluations for senior management, (iv) conducting annual risk assessments, (v) creating an anti-corruption policy and engaging in company-wide training and communications to promote it, and (vi)&nbsp;transitioning its business model to an industry that presents a lower corruption risk and reducing its presence in high risk regions. In light of these considerations, BIT Mining&rsquo;s criminal penalty calculated under the U.S.&nbsp;Sentencing Guidelines reflects a 10% reduction off the bottom of the applicable guidelines fine range.</p>
<p>The FBI&rsquo;s International Corruption Unit is investigating the case.</p>
<p>Trial Attorneys Jil Simon and Ligia Markman of the Criminal Division&rsquo;s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Jennifer Kozar for the District of New Jersey are prosecuting the cases.</p>
<p>The Justice Department&rsquo;s Office of International Affairs and authorities in Japan provided assistance in this matter.</p>
<p>The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting FCPA and Foreign Extortion Prevention Act matters.

<title>SEC Charges BIT Mining With FCPA Violations In Connection With Bribery Scheme To Influence Members Of Japanese Parliament - Company, Formerly Known As 500.Com, Sought To Open Casino In Japan</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that BIT Mining Ltd., formerly known as 500.com Limited, agreed to pay a $4 million civil penalty to resolve charges that it violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) from 2017 to 2019 by engaging in a widespread bribery scheme to influence numerous foreign officials, including members of Japan&rsquo;s parliament, in efforts to establish an integrated resort casino in Japan. 500.com was an online sports lottery service provider headquartered in Shenzhen, China, whose shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol &ldquo;WBAI.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that the bribery scheme involved illicit payments of approximately $2.5 million in the form of cash bribes, entertainment, and extravagant trips. The order further finds that the bribes were authorized by a 500.com senior executive and that, after the bribery scheme came to light, the company never entered the market.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Investors must have confidence that the operations and performance of public companies reflect merit and legitimate considerations. Bribery and corruption turn that dynamic on its head, distorting the orderly operation of the markets and undermining investor confidence,&rdquo; said Charles E. Cain, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division&rsquo;s FCPA Unit. &ldquo;Here, 500.com&rsquo;s deficient controls fostered an environment that enabled a bribery scheme involving the highest level of the company and influential Japanese officials. This case underscores the need for robust internal accounting controls that are properly implemented and effective throughout an organization.&rdquo;</p>
<p>BIT Mining consented to the SEC&rsquo;s order finding that it violated the anti-bribery, recordkeeping, and internal accounting controls provisions of the FCPA. BIT Mining has agreed to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of these provisions and to pay the civil penalty mentioned above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a parallel action, the U.S. Department of Justice announced today it has entered into a non-prosecution agreement in which BIT Mining agreed to pay a $10 million criminal fine, of which $4 million will be satisfied by the company&rsquo;s payment of a civil penalty pursuant to the SEC&rsquo;s order.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Denise Hansberry and Maria F. Boodoo and supervised by Tracy L. Price of the SEC&rsquo;s FCPA Unit.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury today released Treasury International Capital (TIC) data for September 2024.&nbsp; The next release, which will report on data for October 2024, is scheduled for December 19, 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sum total in September of all net foreign acquisitions of long-term securities, short-term U.S. securities, and banking flows was a net TIC inflow of $398.4 billion. &nbsp;Of this, net foreign private inflows were $341.1 billion, and net foreign official inflows were $57.3 billion.</p>
<p>Foreign residents increased their holdings of long-term U.S. securities in September; their net purchases were $263.1 billion.&nbsp; Net purchases by private foreign investors were $252.8 billion, while net purchases by foreign official institutions were $10.3 billion.</p>
<p>U.S. residents increased their holdings of long-term foreign securities, with net purchases of $47.1 billion.</p>
<p>After including adjustments, such as estimated foreign portfolio acquisitions of U.S. stocks through stock swaps, overall net foreign purchases of long-term securities are estimated to have been $216.1 billion in September.</p>
<p>Foreign residents increased their holdings of U.S. Treasury bills by $20.4 billion.&nbsp; Foreign resident holdings of all dollar-denominated short-term U.S. securities and other custody liabilities increased by $20.9 billion.</p>
<p>Banks&rsquo; own net dollar-denominated liabilities to foreign residents increased&nbsp;by $161.4 billion.</p>
<p>Complete data are available on the Treasury website at:</p>
<p><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/data/treasury-international-capital-tic-system">https://home.treasury.gov/data/treasury-international-capital-tic-system</a></p>
<p>About TIC Data</p>
<p>The monthly data on holdings of long-term securities, as well as the monthly table on Major Foreign Holders of Treasury Securities, reflect foreign holdings of U.S. securities collected primarily on the basis of custodial data.&nbsp; These data help provide a window into foreign ownership of U.S. securities, but they cannot attribute holdings of U.S. securities with complete accuracy.&nbsp; For example, if a U.S. Treasury security purchased by a foreign resident is held in a custodial account in a third country, the true ownership of the security will not be reflected in the data.&nbsp; The custodial data will also not properly attribute U.S. Treasury securities managed by foreign private portfolio managers who invest on behalf of residents of other countries.&nbsp; In addition, foreign countries may hold dollars and other U.S. assets that are not captured in the TIC data.&nbsp; For these reasons, it is difficult to draw precise conclusions from TIC data about changes in the foreign holdings of U.S. financial assets by individual countries.</p>

<title>Embracing Risk: Remarks At The Ethiopian Capital Market Authority Industry Day, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, Washington D.C., Nov. 18, 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Glenn (Gordon), for that introduction. Glenn has served the SEC for many years, and so I encourage you to draw upon his deep expertise this week. On this fine American morning, I wish you a wonderful Ethiopian afternoon. I would like to begin by thanking Director General Hana Tehelku of the Ethiopian Capital Market Authority for allowing me to be a part of this wonderful, collaborative opportunity. My thanks as well to Scott Hocklander, our USAID Mission Director, and, of course, the fantastic team of experts from across the US Securities and Exchange Commission. My views are my own as a Commissioner and not necessarily those of the Securities and Exchange Commission or my fellow Commissioners.</p>
<p>The SEC turned ninety this year, and those decades of experience have taught us a lot about regulating capital markets. We are happy to share those lessons with you, even as we seek to learn from your experiences. I, for example, hope to learn whether the ECMA&rsquo;s &ldquo;Capital Market Regulatory Sandbox&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-ethiopian-capital-market-authority-111824#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span><span>[1]</span></span></a>&nbsp;could serve as a model for regulators seeking to foster creative disruption and innovation. Creative ideas for new processes and products need space to grow and stretch their legs, but when faced by a thicket of existing regulations blocking their path, many of these ideas never get out of the starting blocks.</p>
<p>Since 1948, the SEC has made it a priority to work with fellow regulators and international law enforcement agencies. In the last seventy-six years we have sent teams of experts to more than 100 countries eager &ldquo;to pursue larger and more robust capital markets,&rdquo; as a former SEC Chairman once put it.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-ethiopian-capital-market-authority-111824#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Last year alone, we engaged with a record 3,113 regulatory and law enforcement officials. We are continuing that fine tradition here in Ethiopia, and my only regret is that I am unable to be with you in Addis Ababa today to convey in-person my enthusiasm for this shared commitment to well-functioning capital markets.</p>
<p>Capital markets, at their core, are not about money, but about people. If capital markets work properly, they unleash human potential and improve people&rsquo;s lives. Capital markets can support someone&rsquo;s dream of building a business, buying a home, going to school, or retiring. Capital markets fund companies so that they can make products and services that people need. As we think about how to regulate capital markets well, we must never lose sight that their purpose is to serve people. And therefore, the purpose of a capital markets regulators is also to serve people. How can we serve well?</p>
<p>To answer that question, let me start by telling you about a favorite moment as a Commissioner. One of the true joys of my job is having the opportunity to speak with people from all walks of life and, indeed, all parts of the globe. While each of my interactions is important to me&mdash;and I come away from every meeting having learned something&mdash;some engagements keep returning to the forefront of my mind. One of those memorable moments was a conversation I had with the head of a financial regulator eager to see a &ldquo;larger and more robust capital market&rdquo; develop in her country. My guest emphasized the presence of risk in capital markets. Strikingly, she was concerned not with how best to&nbsp;<i>avoid</i>&nbsp;risk, but with how she could better convince her countrymen of the importance of&nbsp;<i>embracing</i>&nbsp;risk.</p>
<p>I left that meeting with a spring in my step. Usually when I talk to fellow regulators about risk, the conversation revolves around protecting unwitting investors from risky financial products, people, and practices. These conversations are important, but so too is the simple truth that the visiting regulator expressed, a truth that too many market observers and regulators choose to ignore or, worse yet, seek to expunge: risk-taking is a welcome and essential part of our capital markets. Investors&rsquo; willingness to take risks on new and growing businesses is an essential ingredient of a dynamic, growing economy. Without risk-taking, there can be no innovation&mdash;no challenge to the status quo. Without risk-taking, economies and nations stagnate.</p>
<p>Risk-taking is more than a necessary ingredient to economic growth; it is a manifestation of our humanity. It is often tied to a desire to improve our own and others&rsquo; lot in life. Sometimes the risk-taking is for the immediate thrill&mdash;racing down a ski slope or betting at a casino. But often risk-takers have a much longer view. A person forgoes income temporarily to go to school to improve her career prospects or drops out of school to start a company. A person quits a well-paying job to commercialize an innovation. Instead of putting her money in the bank or spending it, a person sets aside part of her salary to invest in stocks or bonds or in a friend&rsquo;s start-up. All of these activities involve risk-taking, as a person invests in herself or others.</p>
<p>The capital markets work because of countless individual decisions to take risks. Unlike more centralized sources of funding, such as banks or governments, capital markets draw on a crowd of risk-takers, none of whom views the world exactly the way anyone else does. Risk-takers in the capital markets include the people who invest in companies and the people who provide liquidity to the markets so that when someone wants to sell her stock or bond someone else stands ready to buy it. Both sets of risk-takers are essential to make markets work. As my regulatory visitor understood, a good capital markets regulator does not push risk-takers out of the markets, but invites them in because they make the markets function. The invitation comes in the form of sensible regulation: a stable, principles-based ruleset administered impartially by a transparent, deliberative regulator.</p>
<p>The capital markets regulator will face challenges in achieving and maintaining a sensible regulatory framework. The capital markets regulator&rsquo;s job is not to direct market participants&rsquo; risk-taking, but to cultivate the environment within which market participants dare to take risks. On one hand, insufficient or inept market oversight may dissuade risk-taking by leaving market participants stymied by fear of being victimized by bad actors. Why invest your hard-earned dollar &ndash; or birr &ndash; if you think the market is rigged? Why study a company&rsquo;s financial statements if you cannot trust that they are accurate? Why hand your money over to a broker if you fear she will use it to buy herself a car instead of the stock you directed her to purchase for you? Why buy a mutual fund if its adviser might be forcing the fund to buy securities at inflated prices from the adviser&rsquo;s own account? Why trade on an exchange if you worry the exchange operator is front-running you? Sensible, appropriately enforced rules can give investors the confidence to step into the marketplace.</p>
<p>On the other hand, too much regulation at the expense of investor autonomy is also a surefire way to squelch the risk-taking that is essential to economic growth and human flourishing. Why invest your hard-earned dollar &ndash; or birr &ndash; if you think the government will punish you for being a successful investor, for example, by taxing away gains or, more subtly, regulating them away? Why study a company&rsquo;s financial statements if the regulator forces you to reveal the insights you gleaned to other market participants? Why hand your money over to a broker if you fear that regulatory costs passed on by the broker will eat away your profits? Why buy a mutual fund if regulatory constraints on the fund&rsquo;s operation interfere with the adviser&rsquo;s ability to generate meaningful returns? What can you trade on an exchange if regulatory burdens make being a public company uneconomic?</p>
<p>The role of the capital markets regulator is to facilitate private decision-making, which can include setting financial accounting standards and ensuring that companies adhere to them, establishing a materiality-based disclosure framework for issuers of securities, setting rules for marketplaces on which securities trade and other market infrastructure, and governing how financial professionals and financial intermediaries interact with their customers. Principles-based rules do these things while still providing great latitude for private market participants to transact in the way that makes most sense for them within basic regulatory parameters.</p>
<p>As daunting as the regulator&rsquo;s balancing act might appear, collaboration with the public helps. The old proverb says, &ldquo;Many hands make light work.&rdquo; So too many minds bring the right balance to regulation. A good regulator listens more than it speaks. It draws heavily on input from market participants&mdash;investors, issuers, and the firms that serve them&mdash;and from academics who study the markets. A good regulator operates with radical transparency which helps ensure that no market participant gets preferential treatment or wields the regulator as a weapon against competitors. A regulator cannot rely on its own enforcement muscle to force everyone into compliance, but must work with people in the marketplace to build a culture of compliance with a shared goal of creating markets in which people feel comfortable taking risks.</p>
<p>Ethiopia&rsquo;s economic plan recognizes that economic growth is not a top-down exercise, but that &ldquo;[t]he private sector is . . . an essential stakeholder in fighting poverty, creating employment opportunities, ensuring long-term economic growth, and hence providing a pathway towards inclusive economic growth and transformation of the economy.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-ethiopian-capital-market-authority-111824#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><span><span>[3]</span></span></a>&nbsp;Ethiopia is taking an important step in enlisting the private sector with the opening of the Ethiopian Securities Exchange. The quintessential marketplace, a stock exchange brings buyers and sellers together, and the bargains they strike help inform the rest of the market about the value of the companies the securities of which are being traded. They offer a chance for people to participate in the growth of companies and thus in building the economy. In 1990, then-Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Richard Breeden expressed the significance of a stock market beautifully on a visit to Hungary, which had only recently shaken off the shackles of Soviet rule, had just held its first free election in forty-five years, and was re-opening its stock exchange after more than forty years of being shuttered. As he explained, &ldquo;Free capital markets will help open the door of economic opportunity to all citizens of Hungary . . . . A successful securities market in Hungary will hasten the pace of reform. It will help privatize state-owned institutions, mobilize investment and make it possible for privately owned organizations to raise working capital. It will give all Hungarians a tool for contributing to rebuilding Hungary's economy and future.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-ethiopian-capital-market-authority-111824#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><span><span>[4]</span></span></a>&nbsp;The circumstances here in Ethiopia are different, but the stock market offers similar promise of serving the Ethiopian people and facilitating their contributions to the growth of their nation.</p>
<p>Free markets are fundamental to enabling people to live abundant lives in the service of others. A nation&rsquo;s greatest resource is its people, but their talent too often goes untapped because the markets necessary to unlock them are broken or non-existent. Ethiopia&mdash;with more than forty percent of its population under fifteen<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-ethiopian-capital-market-authority-111824#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><span><span>[5]</span></span></a>&mdash;has great wealth. Hidden within your young people are innovations that will improve lives, medical breakthroughs that will ease pain, software code that will run the cities of tomorrow, engineering wonders that will render obsolete many of today&rsquo;s technologies, scientific breakthroughs that will answer age-old questions, books that will enlighten future readers, and art that will grace physical and digital walls.</p>
<p>The capital markets you are working to develop are not the only ingredient to unlocking all this latent talent, but they can play an essential role. When people have a place to invest the money they earn and funding flows easily to its highest and best use, human talent gets developed. Well-functioning capital markets produce companies that make things that people need, such as housing, food, and medicine, but also create the wealth that enables societies to fund things they want, such as great art, music, and scientific exploration. The stakes of this capital markets project are high: your young people count on you to build and operate these markets well so that they can reach their full potential to benefit themselves, their families, their nation, and their world. I look forward to seeing your important work unfold and to continuing to partner with you in it.</p>

<title>US Treasury Issues Final Regulations To Sharpen And Enhance CFIUS Procedures And Enforcement Authorities To Protect National Security</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-treasury-issues-final-regulations-to-sharpen-and-enhance-cfius-procedures-and/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-treasury-issues-final-regulations-to-sharpen-and-enhance-cfius-procedures-and/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury), as Chair of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), issued a final rule to enhance certain CFIUS procedures and sharpen its penalty and enforcement authorities. The final rule is the first substantive update to the monitoring and enforcement provisions of the CFIUS regulations since the implementation of the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRRMA), which amended CFIUS&rsquo;s governing statute (section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950). The final rule issued today follows a proposed rule issued in April and responds to public comments received in response to the proposed rule.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This rule enhances CFIUS&rsquo;s ability to vigorously defend the national security of the United States by ensuring our investment screening regime has a sharper scalpel to more quickly and effectively address national security risks that arise in CFIUS reviews,&rdquo; said Assistant Secretary for Investment Security Paul Rosen.</p>
<p>CFIUS is authorized to review certain transactions involving foreign investment into U.S. businesses and certain transactions by foreign persons involving real estate in the United States in order to determine the effect of such transactions on the national security of the United States. CFIUS enforces transaction parties&rsquo; compliance with its statute and regulations, as well as agreements entered into and conditions and orders imposed under such authorities, through its authority to impose civil monetary penalties and seek other remedies. In recent years, CFIUS has enhanced its compliance and monitoring capabilities, along with its ability to identify and investigate transactions that were not notified to CFIUS. This final rule reflects and builds upon those enhancements to help CFIUS accomplish its national security mission consistent with the United States&rsquo; open investment policy.</p>
<p>The final rule enhances CFIUS&rsquo;s authorities through the following key changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expanding the types of information CFIUS can require transaction parties and other persons to submit when engaging with them on transactions that were not filed with CFIUS;</li>
<li>Allowing the CFIUS Staff Chairperson to set, as appropriate, a timeline for transaction parties to respond to risk mitigation proposals for matters under active review to assist CFIUS in concluding its reviews and investigations within the time frame required by statute;</li>
<li>Expanding the circumstances in which a civil monetary penalty may be imposed due to a party&rsquo;s material misstatement and omission, including when the material misstatement or omission occurs outside a review or investigation of a transaction and when it occurs in the context of CFIUS&rsquo;s monitoring and compliance functions;</li>
<li>Substantially increasing the maximum civil monetary penalty available for violations of obligations under the CFIUS statute and regulations, as well as agreements, orders, and conditions authorized by the statute and regulations, and introducing a new method for determining the maximum possible penalty for a breach of a mitigation agreement, condition, or order imposed;</li>
<li>Expanding the instances in which CFIUS may use its subpoena authority, including in connection with assessing national security risk associated with non-notified transactions; and</li>

Request volumes for short-term certificates of deposit (-4.3%) and longer-term certificates of deposit (-2.8%) fell in October.</p>

<title>Central European Exchanges Join Forces To Develop Regional Capital Markets</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/central-european-exchanges-join-forces-to-develop-regional-capital-markets/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><img src="https://www.gpw.pl/pub/GPW/images/2024/Bratyslawa_2024.jpg" /></p>
<p><span>Representatives of seven Central European stock exchanges and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development have signed a Memorandum of Understanding in Bratislava. The initiative aims to strengthen the regional capital markets, which are key to supporting economic growth and innovation. The cooperation includes efforts to develop primary markets, ensure operational integration of market infrastructure, promote long-term savings, develop products for retail investors, and implement modern technologies. The Memorandum of Understanding creates new investment opportunities and fosters innovation in Central Europe</span>.</p>
<p>The Memorandum of Understanding signed in Bratislava on 13 November 2024 is an important step towards the operational integration and development of capital markets in the region. Representatives of the stock exchanges in Bratislava, Budapest, Bucharest, Sofia, Ljubljana, Warsaw, and Zagreb, with the support of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), have decided to improve their cooperation and take steps to strengthen the international position of local capital markets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>The Memorandum of Understanding lays the foundation for closer regional cooperation to further strengthen our region&rsquo;s capital markets. The streamlining of cross-border processes will allow for a more efficient flow of capital, which can make the CEE capital markets more attractive. We believe that these efforts will make the markets much more attractive to regional retail investors and global institutional investors,</em>&rdquo; said Tomasz Bardziłowski, President of the Management Board of the Warsaw Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The Memorandum of Understanding sets out priority areas for development which are fundamental to economic stability and growth in the region. One of the key objectives is the development of primary markets to facilitate access to capital for Central European companies, particularly in the early stages of business development and expansion. The development of this market segment is important for small and medium-sized companies which often have limited opportunities to raise capital from other sources.</p>
<p>Another important objective is the operational integration of capital market infrastructure in the region. Streamlining cross-border processes and better connecting exchanges will create a more integrated and user-friendly environment for investors and issuers.</p>
<p>Another key priority is to activate retail investors by promoting long-term investing, improving market liquidity, and reducing barriers to investment on regional exchanges.</p>
<p>The signatories of the Memorandum of Understanding emphasise that regional cooperation not only allows to address common challenges more effectively but also enhances the international competitiveness of the entire region. By pooling resources and experience, Central Europe can become an attractive location for capital investment and innovation financing.</p>
<p>Efficient capital markets provide key support to SMEs which play an important role in driving economic growth in the region. Businesses, especially in the high-tech and service industries, require flexible sources of capital to meet market challenges and accelerate growth. The Memorandum of Understanding will certainly contribute to their dynamic development.</p>
<p>The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, one of the key partners in the Memorandum of Understanding, has pledged its full support to regional initiatives building strong and sustainable capital markets. The EBRD, which has been actively involved in project financing and supporting economic development in Central Europe for years, sees this initiative as an opportunity to further strengthen local economies and investment systems.</p>
<p>The Memorandum of Understanding reflects the growing commitment of Central European exchanges to the development and integration of capital markets, which are of key importance to the region&rsquo;s economy. Supported by the EBRD, the initiative has the potential to bring significant benefits not only to companies but also to retail investors and households. An integrated and dynamic Central European capital market will become an attractive investment platform and an important stimulus for the future growth and economic stability of the entire region.</p>

<title>Higo Bank Selects DTCC’s ITP Services, Streamlining And Accelerating Post-Trade Processing - Adoption Of DTCC’s Institutional Trade Processing (ITP) Solutions Enables The Firm To Accelerate The Trade Lifecycle, As Jurisdictions Around The World Consider Moving To T+1 Settlement</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the premier post-trade market infrastructure for the global financial services industry, announced today that Japan&rsquo;s Higo Bank has adopted DTCC&rsquo;s ITP services to automate their middle and back office, helping them achieve no touch processing across domestic and cross-border transactions.</p>
<p>Higo Bank, the largest Japanese regional bank in Kumamoto Prefecture, selected CTM, including CTM&rsquo;s Match to Instruct (M2i) workflow, ALERT, and Settlement Instruction Manager to further automate their equities and fixed income post-trade processing. By increasing automation in this critical area, Higo Bank has removed manual touchpoints and created a faster and more efficient post-trade process allowing them to reduce risk and costs. The adoption of ITP&rsquo;s suite of services comes at a critical time as jurisdictions around the world are considering a move to T+1 settlement following the successful transition in the US in May 2024.</p>
<p>Kazuyoshi Uchiyama, Senior Executive Officer and General Manager of Financial Markets Division, Higo Bank, stated, &ldquo;The global focus on shortening settlement cycles, as well as the need to comply with the operational risk measurements set by the Basel Accords to enhance internal controls and strengthen human capital, has made straight through processing essential across operational workflows, from trade execution to settlement. At the same time, increased volumes and manual processes create risk and lengthen settlement processes. For these reasons, we are very pleased to have adopted DTCC&rsquo;s ITP services to further automate our post-trade process, increasing efficiency and reducing risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dtcc.com/institutional-trade-processing/itp/ctm">CTM</a>, DTCC&rsquo;s platform for the central matching of cross-border and domestic equity and fixed income transactions, automates the trade confirmation process. CTM&rsquo;s M2i workflow leverages the central matching capabilities of CTM, as well as Standing Settlement Instruction (SSI) enrichment via DTCC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dtcc.com/institutional-trade-processing/itp/alert">ALERT</a>. With the M2i workflow, trades that are allocated, confirmed, and matched in CTM by the institutional investment manager and their brokers will automatically trigger trade affirmation and delivery of instructions for Depository Trust Company (DTC)-eligible securities directly to the U.S. depository for settlement. When used in conjunction with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dtcc.com/institutional-trade-processing/itp/settlement-instruction-manager">Settlement Instruction Manager</a>, users can automatically generate and send settlement instructions to custodians and other third parties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are happy to collaborate with Higo Bank in bringing greater post-trade processing efficiency to the region,&rdquo; said Val Wotton, Managing Director and General Manager, DTCC ITP. &ldquo;ITP&rsquo;s functionality is unique in its ability to enable counterparties to reach settlement finality faster, while also connecting to thousands of global counterparties.&rdquo;</p>

<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has banned Mr Ari Harris from working in financial services. &nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>In July 2020, Mr Harris was convicted of inflicting grievous bodily harm without intent after stabbing a man twice in the neck. He was sentenced to 3 years&rsquo; imprisonment in July 2022. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr Harris and Reeds Motors Ltd (the firm), of which he was sole director, deliberately failed to notify the FCA of his offending, conviction and custodial sentence, despite obligations to do so. They deliberately provided false and misleading information to cover up the fact that he was in prison. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Following an application in October 2022, the FCA asked the firm why it needed an additional approved person. Both Mr Harris and the firm stated that this was required as Mr Harris was currently overseas and looking into a business abroad. Mr Harris continued to mislead the FCA during a telephone call, failing to mention that he was actually in prison at the time. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA decided to remove Mr Harris&rsquo;s approval to perform the senior management function at the firm and impose a ban which prevents him working in financial services in the future. The FCA has also cancelled the firm&rsquo;s permissions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Therese Chambers, executive director of enforcement and market oversight said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;These repeated efforts to conceal Mr Harris&rsquo; violent criminal conviction and incarceration clearly show a shocking lack of honesty and integrity. This ban is fully warranted.&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ol>
<li>Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/final-notices/ari-harris-2024.pdf" title="Final Notice 2024: Ari Harris">Final Notice for Mr Harris (PDF)</a></li>
<li>Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/final-notices/reeds-motors-ltd-2024.pdf" title="Final Notice 2024: Reeds Motors Ltd">Final Notice for Reeds Motors Ltd (PDF)</a></li>
<li>Mr Harris is prohibited from performing any function in relation to any regulated activity carried on by an authorised person, exempt person or exempt professional firm. &nbsp;</li>
<li>The decision was made by the FCA&rsquo;s Regulatory Decisions Committee. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Regulated firms and individuals subject to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/senior-managers-certification-regime" title="Senior Managers and Certification Regime">Senior Managers and Certification Regime</a>&nbsp;have an ongoing obligation to disclose any information of which the FCA would reasonably expect notice. This includes matters that are material to an approved person&rsquo;s fitness and propriety.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<title>FSB Chair Calls On G20 Leaders To Implement Agreed Reforms Fully</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fsb-chair-calls-on-g20-leaders-to-implement-agreed-reforms-fully/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fsb-chair-calls-on-g20-leaders-to-implement-agreed-reforms-fully/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="post-content"> 
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em><span>FSB Chair&rsquo;s letter is accompanied by the FSB&rsquo;s Annual Report, which highlights that progress in implementing key G20 regulatory reforms is uneven and that challenges remain. The FSB Chair urges the&nbsp;<a>continued, full, consistent, and timely implementation</a>&nbsp;of agreed-upon financial regulatory reforms.</span></em></li>
<li><em><span>Chair&rsquo;s letter also details policy efforts aimed at mitigating risks associated with non-bank financial intermediation, digitalisation, and climate change.</span></em></li>
<li><span>In this context, the FSB has submitted reports on artificial intelligence and on achieving consistent and comparable climate-related financial disclosures.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) today published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/11/fsb-chairs-letter-to-g20-leaders-november-2024/">letter from its Chair, Klaas Knot, to G20 Leaders</a><em>&nbsp;</em>ahead of their Summit in Rio de Janeiro on 18-19 November. The letter is accompanied by the FSB&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/11/promoting-global-financial-stability-2024-fsb-annual-report/">Annual Report</a>, which describes the FSB&rsquo;s work to promote global financial stability.</p>
<p>The letter warns of ongoing vulnerabilities within the global financial system, illustrated by recent episodes of market turmoil and the failure of several banks and non-banks in recent years. The March 2023 banking turmoil underscored the ongoing risk of bank runs and the need for quicker responses to deposit outflows. Enhancing the resilience of the non-bank financial sector remains a priority, with the FSB set to release policy recommendations addressing financial stability risks stemming from leverage in the coming year.</p>
<p>The letter stresses the importance of effective implementation of the FSB&rsquo;s policies, emphasising that authorities must not only put policies into national laws and regulations, but also build the capacity to operationalise them. This message is reiterated in the FSB&rsquo;s 2024 Annual Report, which accompanies the Chair&rsquo;s letter. The Annual Report, which tracks the FSB member jurisdictions&rsquo; implementation of regulatory reforms, notes uneven progress in key G20 regulatory reforms, including the final Basel III reforms and non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) reforms.</p>
<p>The letter notes the potential of digitalisation to bring greater efficiencies, including in new payment infrastructures and arrangements, which have the promise of enhancing efficiency and user experience. The FSB is developing policies to ensure consistent regulation across the various forms of payments and payment providers, whether by banks or non-banks, particularly in crypto-asset and cross-border payment arrangements. The FSB has also examined the financial stability implications from the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the financial system. While the letter notes that existing policy frameworks address many AI-related vulnerabilities, as outlined in its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/11/the-financial-stability-implications-of-artificial-intelligence/">report</a>, the FSB will work with national authorities and other international bodies to monitor AI use in the financial system and assess whether existing frameworks are sufficient.</p>
<p>Additionally, with global exposure to climate-related financial risks becoming more evident, there is an increasing need for high-quality, consistent, and comparable firm-level disclosures. To this end, the FSB is supporting global efforts for jurisdictions to adopt, apply, or otherwise be informed by the disclosure standards issued by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB). The FSB&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/11/achieving-consistent-and-comparable-climate-related-disclosures-2024-progress-report/">progress report on achieving consistent and comparable climate-related disclosures</a>&nbsp;notes that around three-fourths of the FSB member jurisdictions have already made significant progress towards the adoption or other use of the ISSB Standards, &nbsp;but also documents some of the remaining challenges that need to be overcome.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h2>
<p>Since 2015, the FSB has published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/work-of-the-fsb/implementation-monitoring/">annual reports</a>&nbsp;on the implementation and effects of G20 financial regulatory reforms. These reports highlight progress made by FSB members in addressing the issues that led to the 2008 global financial crisis and in building a more resilient financial system. In 2021, the report was revamped to be more forward-looking, reflecting the FSB&rsquo;s shift towards new topics and emerging risks. The current report provides a high-level assessment of current vulnerabilities in the global financial system, summarises the FSB&rsquo;s ongoing financial stability work, and reviews progress on G20 reforms, including evaluations or other assessments of their effects.</p>
<p>In July 2024, the FSB issued a consultation report that set out&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/07/recommendations-for-regulating-and-supervising-bank-and-non-bank-payment-service-providers-offering-cross-border-payment-services-consultation-report/">recommendations</a>&nbsp;that aim to strengthen consistency in the regulation and supervision of banks and non-banks in their provision of cross-border payment services in a way that is proportionate to the risks associated with such activities. This approach reduces the prospect of regulatory arbitrage by establishing a level playing field, to the extent possible given differences in business models and risk profiles, for both banks and non-bank payment service providers. The final recommendations will be issued in December 2024.</p>
<p>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. The FSB also conducts outreach with approximately 70 other jurisdictions through its six Regional Consultative Groups.</p>
<p>The FSB is chaired by Klaas Knot, President of De Nederlandsche Bank. The FSB Secretariat is located in Basel, Switzerland and hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>

<title>HKEX Celebrates 10th Anniversary Of Connect Programme</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/hkex-celebrates-10th-anniversary-of-connect-programme/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/hkex-celebrates-10th-anniversary-of-connect-programme/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="spanHeading"><span>Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) today (Monday) welcomed over 400 distinguished guests at HKEX Connect Hall to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Connect, the landmark mutual access programme that has transformed the region&rsquo;s financial markets and facilitated two-way capital flows between Mainland China and the world.</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span class="spanHeading">At the first-ever HKEX Connect Summit, HKEX Chairman Carlson Tong and Chief Executive Officer Bonnie Y Chan hosted a celebration ceremony alongside guests of honour that included&nbsp;</span>Acting Hong Kong Chief Executive Eric Chan, Financial Secretary Paul Chan, China Securities Regulatory Commission Vice Chairman Li Ming, the Director-General of the Economic Affairs Department of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in&nbsp;the HKSAR&nbsp;Xu Weigang,&nbsp;Deputy Commissioner&nbsp;of the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the PRC in the HKSAR Li Yongsheng, &nbsp;Securities and Futures Commission Chairman Kelvin Wong, Hong Kong Monetary Authority Chief Executive Eddie Yue, Shanghai Stock Exchange President Cai Jianchun, Shenzhen Stock Exchange President Li Jizun, and China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation General Manager Yu Wenqiang.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The event was also attended by other officials, regulators and distinguished guests from the financial community in Hong Kong and Mainland China. These individuals played a crucial role in driving the success of the programme, which began in 2014 with Stock Connect, a trading link between HKEX and the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) that was expanded two years later to also include the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE). This initiative kickstarted a decade of market connectivity, cementing Hong Kong&rsquo;s role as a global superconnector.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">HKEX Chairman, Carlson Tong, said: &ldquo;Today we celebrate a milestone that marks a decade of collaboration between HKEX, Mainland exchanges, regulators, clearing houses, and market participants from around the globe. Over the past 10 years, our partnership has not only helped strengthen our market infrastructure, but also created new opportunities and facilitated a remarkable surge in two-way capital flows. I am honoured to have played an active role in the launch of the Connect programme back in 2014, and I look forward to the continued collaboration and innovation with our partners in the next 10 years and beyond.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="spanHeading">HKEX Chief Executive Officer, Bonnie Y Chan, said: &ldquo;Over the past decade, the Connect programme has pioneered greater accessibility and provided unprecedented opportunities for international investors interested in the world's second-largest economy, and for Mainland China investors seeking to diversify their portfolios through Hong Kong, fostering greater liquidity and diversity in our markets. It has evolved beyond equities to include bonds, ETFs and interest rate swaps. From these to the recent record volumes in turnover, the Connect story is much more than just an investment channel. It is a story of continuous breakthroughs, innovations and enhancements. The future holds immense potential, and we at HKEX are committed to working alongside our regulators, our partners and market participants, to take the Connect story to even greater heights.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="spanHeading">Since the launch of Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect on 17 November 2014, and Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect on 5 December 2016, total Stock Connect turnover has continued to hit new records, with strong participation from both Mainland and international investors.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">Northbound and Southbound Stock Connect average daily turnover (ADT) reached RMB136.3 billion and HK$43.9 billion respectively in the first 10 months of 2024, accounting for 7.3 per cent and 17.2 per cent of the total turnover of the Mainland China and Hong Kong markets.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">As of September 2024, the market capitalisation of securities portfolios held in Hong Kong by Mainland Chinese investors through Stock Connect was over HK$3.3 trillion, more than 200 times that at the end of 2014.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">As Stock Connect enlarged its scope and benefited from significant enhancements to its infrastructure, the Connect programme also expanded into other asset classes, with the launch of Bond Connect in 2017, ETF Connect in 2022, and Swap Connect in 2023.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">More enhancements are underway, including block trading for Stock Connect, the inclusion of Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) to Connect, and RMB-denominated stocks in Southbound Connect, additions that will give international and Mainland investors even more opportunity and choice in allocating their investment portfolios.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<title>Quantoz Payments Issues Euro And US Dollar Stablecoins; Receives Backing From Major Crypto-Asset Firms - Quantoz Payments To Receive Investment From Fabric Ventures, Kraken And Tether</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Quantoz Payments B.V. (<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://quantozpay.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Quantoz</a>), the Netherlands headquartered payments technology company, is pleased to announce that it will start issuing two stablecoins EURQ and USDQ, designed to be MiCAR compliant, on Monday 18th November.</p>
<p>EURQ and USDQ are respectively euro and US dollar-referenced E-Money Tokens (EMTs), issued on the Ethereum blockchain by Quantoz, an Electronic Money Institution (EMI) authorised and supervised by De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB), the Dutch Central Bank.</p>
<p>The new EMTs will facilitate euro and US dollar transfers and payments in secondary markets as well as transfers across digital asset and crypto exchanges. Fiat-referencing stablecoins on blockchains can enable digital and decentralised payments that are faster, more transparent, secure and cheaper when compared to existing payment infrastructure.</p>
<p>Bitfinex and Kraken, two of the world&rsquo;s longest standing and most secure crypto-asset exchanges, plan to be the first to list EURQ and USDQ for trading to eligible clients on Thursday 21st November.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Arnoud Star Busmann, CEO of Quantoz Payments, said:</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;We are thrilled to bring to market truly European-native stablecoins, available on respected venues for European consumers and corporations, issued by a company with its roots in the Netherlands, one of Europe&rsquo;s leading fintech jurisdictions. The MiCA regulation brings a new level of trust to digital assets markets, not least through its prudential requirements on the issuers of stablecoins. As the world of payments becomes more digital, having well-regulated, transparent and fully backed stablecoins is critical to enabling faster, cheaper and more secure settlement within the world&rsquo;s largest single market.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>A group of investors including Fabric Ventures, Kraken and Tether are underlining their support for Quantoz by investing in the company.</p>
<p>Anil Hansjee, General Partner at Fabric Ventures, said:</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Europeans speak loudly about MICAR making stablecoin issuance seamless in Europe and whilst there are clearer rules, there are very few players that can pull it off at scale. Think regulatory licenses, tier 1 banking partners with adequate liquidity ratios and balance sheets, blockchain expertise, state of the art and scalable compliance onboarding, on chain transaction monitoring, treasury and risk management, security DNA, let alone an ability to convince major European exchanges to list you and market makers to provide liquidity, as well as dApps to build use cases around you. Quantoz Payments have achieved all this and brought all the right components to the table to succeed. Fabric Ventures are delighted to be participating in this partnership and in an investment thesis that sits firmly at the intersection of our expertise in payments and crypto."</i></p>
<p>Mark Greenberg, VP of Product &amp; GM of Consumer at Kraken, said:</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Stablecoins are the backbone of crypto, reshaping the way people connect traditional finance with the decentralized world. We&rsquo;re pumped to join this investment round and team up with industry partners to push the mission of crypto adoption forward.&rdquo;&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether said:</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Our support for Quantoz highlights Tether&rsquo;s commitment to fostering innovative and regulated solutions within the digital asset landscape. By supporting Quantoz and bringing technology solutions like&nbsp;</i><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://tether.io/news/hadron-by-tether-platform-brings-simplified-asset-tokenization-to-the-mass-market/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><i>Hadron by Tether</i></a><i>, we reinforce our dedication to expanding reliable, compliant financial tools that empower users and build trust across the digital ecosystem.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Arnoud Star Busmann, CEO at Quantoz Payments, added:</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Quantoz is an established digital payments technology company in the heart of the European Union and started issuing EURD earlier this year, another euro-backed stablecoin focused on e-money solutions for consumer payment ecosystems as well as treasury management for corporates.</i></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;The support through this investment round from some of the best businesses in digital assets will enable us to provide a timely solution for digital asset markets as well as unlock the benefits of blockchain based money for more traditional use cases. We are excited to be partnering with them on this journey.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>The amount of EURQ and USDQ in circulation is fully backed 1-to-1 by fiat reserves and highly liquid financial instruments such as government bonds. These reserves are managed by an independent foundation, subject to strict DNB oversight and are placed in segregated accounts with Tier 1 banks. In addition to the requirement of maintaining 100% reserves to fully back all circulating assets, Quantoz is also required to hold an additional 2% on its own balance sheet as part of its obligations under MiCAR.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Bursa Malaysia Berhad (&ldquo;Bursa Malaysia&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Exchange&rdquo;) will be hosting the 63<sup>rd</sup> WFE General Assembly &amp; Annual Meeting on 19-21 November 2024 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The WFE is the global industry association for exchanges and clearing houses.</p>
<p>The 3-day event is the WFE&rsquo;s flagship conference that brings together the captains of industry among global exchanges, regulatory authorities and key institutions for highlevel discussions on major issues surrounding the industry. This year, more than 300 delegates and representatives of 50 organisations from all over the globe will participate in the event, mostly in person, while some will join virtually.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among others, highlights from the conference include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keynote address by the Prime Minister of Malaysia YAB Dato&rsquo; Seri Anwar Ibrahim; </li>
<li>Fireside chat with YB Senator Datuk Seri Amir Hamzah Azizan, Malaysia&rsquo;s Finance Minister II, moderated by Datuk Muhamad Umar Swift, Chief Executive Officer of Bursa Malaysia on &lsquo;Capital Markets in Malaysia &ndash; The Way Forward&rsquo;; </li>
<li>Fireside chat with Dr. Jane Goodall, eminent primatologist, moderated by Tan Sri Abdul Wahid Omar, Chairman of Bursa Malaysia &amp; WWF-Malaysia, on bridging markets and biodiversity; </li>
<li>Panel discussions on topics including:  
<ul>
<li>The modern exchange and market infrastructure in today&rsquo;s changing marketplace </li>
<li>Role of exchanges in supporting the development of the diverse and fastgrowing South East Asia region </li>
<li>The Great Listings Debate: IPO Winter or Emerging Phoenix? o The Great Settlement Debate: To T+1 or Not</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In a joint welcome note to the delegates, Tan Sri Wahid and Datuk Umar said, &ldquo;We are honoured to be hosting this event, which will bring together a remarkable gathering of minds among the leaders of key institutions, united by a shared passion for innovation, collaboration and purpose. Bursa Malaysia looks forward to further contribute to the WFE&rsquo;s efforts to help shape and guide the development of global capital markets, as well as promote greater diversity and inclusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are also excited to share some of the latest developments from Malaysia, and how the wider ASEAN region is collaborating on initiatives that will position the region as a forerunner in sustainability leadership to meet the evolving needs of market participants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nandini Sukumar, CEO of the World Federation of Exchanges, said &ldquo;The ASEAN region is a dynamic powerhouse, led by the innovation and vigour that its exchanges bring to the development of the market. We are delighted to be in Kuala Lumpur, graciously hosted by Bursa Malaysia, who are central to the efforts of our industry and the country.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">The conference host rotates between regions each year with Bermuda in 2023 and Malta in 2022. The last time Malaysia hosted the WFE General Assembly &amp; Annual Meeting was 26 years ago in 1998.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As 2025 approaches, it is timely for Malaysia to host this year&rsquo;s WFE edition, given that the nation is poised to play a bigger role to promote a more inclusive and sustainable regional economy when it assumes the chairmanship of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) next year. This year&rsquo;s WFE will also witness the signing of a Memorandum of Collaboration between several ASEAN Exchanges.</p>

<title>ASIC Sues NAB For Failing Customers Facing Financial Hardship</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-sues-nab-for-failing-customers-facing-financial-hardship/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-sues-nab-for-failing-customers-facing-financial-hardship/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>National Australia Bank (NAB) failed 345 of its customers at their most vulnerable when they applied for hardship support from the bank, according to documents filed by ASIC in the Federal Court today.</p>
<p>ASIC alleges that between 2018 and 2023, NAB and its subsidiary AFSH Nominees Pty Ltd (AFSH) did not respond to 345 hardship applications within the 21-day timeframe required by law.</p>
<p>ASIC Chair Joe Longo said, &lsquo;We allege NAB unlawfully failed to respond to their customers&rsquo; appeal for help when they needed them most.</p>
<p>'These customers included people who were domestic violence victims, battling serious medical conditions, dealing with business closures or job loss. NAB&rsquo;s failures likely compounded the already challenging situation for these people.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Amidst rising cost of living pressures, we have seen an increased number of customers reach out to their lenders for relief, and we have seen first-hand the impact on lives and livelihoods when lenders fail to appropriately support customers experiencing financial hardship.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Compliance with financial hardship obligations is an enforcement priority for ASIC in 2024. Earlier this year, we put the lending industry on notice on the release of our&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-783-hardship-hard-to-get-help-lenders-fall-short-in-financial-hardship-support/" title="REP 783 Hardship, hard to get help: Lenders fall short in financial hardship support">hardship report</a>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We will not hesitate to take decisive action when banks and lenders fail to comply with their obligations.&rsquo;</p>
<p>ASIC is seeking declarations, pecuniary penalties and adverse publicity orders against NAB and AFSH.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s announcement follows ASIC&rsquo;s action against Westpac in September 2023 (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2023-releases/23-242mr-asic-sues-westpac-for-failing-to-respond-to-hardship-notices/" title="23-242MR ASIC sues Westpac for failing to respond to hardship notices">23-242MR</a>) for financial hardship misconduct.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Under section 72 of the National Credit Code, if a consumer notifies their lender that they are or will be unable to meet their credit obligations, lenders must consider varying the customer&rsquo;s credit contract and advise them of the decision within specified timeframes.</p>
<p>Variations to the credit contract can include payment deferrals, reduced payment arrangements, interest-only periods, term extensions, capitalisation of arrears or interest-rate reductions.</p>
<p>Improving consumer outcomes is a key priority and in August 2023, ASIC issued an open letter to the CEOs of all lenders (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2023-releases/23-235mr-as-cost-of-living-pressures-persist-asic-calls-on-lenders-to-support-customers-in-financial-hardship/" title="23-235MR As cost of living pressures persist ASIC calls on lenders to support customers in financial hardship">23-235MR</a>) advising of focus on financial hardship and expectations of lenders. ASIC then undertook a data collection involving 30 large lenders, and a review of 10 large home lenders to understand their approach to financial hardship.</p>
<p>ASIC reviewed the lenders&rsquo; policies and procedures, looked at case studies and conducted hypothetical customer exercises to understand differences in lenders&rsquo; approach to hardship. On 20 May 2024, ASIC published a report outlining its findings, Report 783&nbsp;<em>Hardship, hard to get help: Lenders fall short in financial hardship support</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-783-hardship-hard-to-get-help-lenders-fall-short-in-financial-hardship-support/" title="REP 783 Hardship, hard to get help: Lenders fall short in financial hardship support">REP 783</a>).</p>
<p>The report highlights failures of lenders to identify customers in financial stress, use of &lsquo;cookie-cutter&rsquo; approaches to dealing with hardship requests, as well as onerous assessment and approval processes.</p>
<p>ASIC is engaging with lenders to ensure they act on the findings outlined in the report and prioritise improving their approach to supporting customers experiencing financial hardship. Reviewed lenders have also been asked to prepare an action plan outlining how they will respond to the issues raised.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s Moneysmart website has information for consumers on what to do if you are experiencing&nbsp;<a href="https://moneysmart.gov.au/managing-debt/financial-hardship">financial hardship</a>. If you're unhappy with either the service received, or with your lender&rsquo;s decision, you can&nbsp;<a href="https://moneysmart.gov.au/how-to-complain">make a complaint</a>. If you have multiple debts, or would like help applying for financial hardship, contact the National Debt Helpline on 1800 007 007 to talk to a&nbsp;<a href="https://moneysmart.gov.au/managing-debt/financial-counselling">financial counsellor</a>&nbsp;for free.</p>
<p>For the 2023/2024 financial year 5,715 complaints were filed with AFCA regarding financial difficulty. This was an increase of 18% on the prior year (<a href="https://www.afca.org.au/annual-review-financial-difficulty-complaints">AFCA Annual Review</a>). AFCA observed that &ldquo;Too many of these complaints relate to poor treatment or ineffective communication during the hardship process. Urgent improvements are needed.&rdquo;</p>

<title>CFTC Staff Issues An Advisory Related To Clearing Of Options On Spot Commodity Exchange Traded Funds</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-staff-issues-an-advisory-related-to-clearing-of-options-on-spot-commodity-e/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-staff-issues-an-advisory-related-to-clearing-of-options-on-spot-commodity-e/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission&rsquo;s Division of Clearing and Risk today issued a staff advisory relating to the clearing of options on spot commodity Exchange Traded Funds.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>These options are on shares of the ETFs registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as securities and the shares are listed and traded on a SEC-registered national securities exchange. These ETF options are cleared and settled by the Options Clearing Corporation as the sole issuer of all equity options.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The advisory states, in light of relevant precedents in the courts, it is substantially likely these spot commodity ETF shares would be held to be securities. Therefore, DCR&rsquo;s position is the listing of these shares on SEC-registered national securities exchanges does not implicate the CFTC&rsquo;s jurisdiction, and therefore, the clearing of these options by OCC would be undertaken in its capacity as a registered clearing agency subject to SEC oversight. Accordingly, it is DCR&rsquo;s position that the CFTC does not have any more role regarding the clearing of these options on the part of OCC than with regard to OCC&rsquo;s clearing of any security.</span></span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="news news-single">
<p>Canada Post has announced in a news release that the Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW) began a national strike on Friday, November&nbsp;15, 2024, at 12:01&nbsp;a.m.&nbsp;ET. Canada Post's operations will shut down during the national strike.</p>
<p>The Autorit&eacute; des march&eacute;s financiers&nbsp;(&ldquo;AMF&rdquo;) has consequently implemented flexible alternative measures to ensure operational continuity and maintain services to financial consumers, industry representatives, reporting issuers, investment funds and financial institutions.</p>
<p>Among other arrangements, the AMF is planning to use private courier services when it needs to communicate in a timely manner with its clients.</p>
<p>Financial industry professionals, firms, reporting issuers, investment funds, insurers and financial institutions are asked to also implement measures to meet their obligations and thereby ensure compliance with the laws and regulations administered by the AMF. Such measures may include delivering documents by private courier or by hand to&nbsp;<a href="https://lautorite.qc.ca/en/general-public/contact-us">the offices of the AMF</a>.</p>
<h2>Measures for practitioners and candidates</h2>
<p>To avoid any delays due to the strike at Canada Post, we recommend&nbsp;<a href="https://lautorite.qc.ca/en/professionals/e-services">AMF E-Services</a>&nbsp;for all your transactions with the AMF.</p>
<p>You can securely complete all stages of an application using AMF E-Services, including submitting any documents and paying any fees required to ensure the timely processing of your file.</p>
<p>When transactions are completed via AMF E-Services, you can be assured that your file will be efficiently managed by AMF staff in accordance with the requirements associated with your profile.</p>
<h3>Practitioners and firms</h3>
<p>Representatives and firms must make sure that all documents and payments associated with their applications are received by the AMF on time. Late applications may not be processed.</p>
<h3>Candidates</h3>
<p>Exceptionally, candidates not registered for AMF E-Services who are awaiting a recognition of minimum qualifications, a notice of examination, exam results or a probationary certificate confirming their probationary period start date will receive the aforementioned via private courier.</p>
<p>The AMF stopped using Canada Post to deliver exam preparation manuals on November&nbsp;13, 2024, and will temporarily be using Purolator. Current delivery rates will remain unchanged.</p>
<h2>Measures for reporting issuers (firms and investment funds)</h2>
<p>If necessary, the AMF will publish a blanket decision exempting, under certain conditions, reporting issuers from the requirement to deliver interim financial reports, annual financial statements, MD&amp;As and management of fund performance reports. This exemption will not cover the requirement to file documents with the AMF and disclose financial results.</p>
<h3>Filings other than those required to be made via SEDAR+, SEDI or NRD</h3>
<p>Except in the case of filings required to be made via SEDAR+, SEDI or NRD, all documents that individuals and firms are required to submit to the AMF must be sent by facsimile or special delivery.</p>
<p>Such documents must be delivered to:</p>
<ul>
<li>au 800,&nbsp;rue du Square-Victoria, bureau&nbsp;2200, Montr&eacute;al&nbsp;(Qu&eacute;bec) H3C 0B4; or</li>
<li>au 2640,&nbsp;boulevard Laurier, bureau&nbsp;400, Qu&eacute;bec&nbsp;(Qu&eacute;bec) G1V 5C1.</li>
</ul>
<p>The AMF&rsquo;s general fax number is 514&nbsp;873-3090.</p>
<p><span>Filers are reminded that the disruption in regular mail service will not have any impact on filings required to be made via SEDAR+, SEDI or NRD.</span></p>
<p>The AMF asks reporting issuers and other affected parties to consult with their service providers on alternative delivery options and with their legal counsel on how to best fulfill their obligations relating to offering documents, take-over bids and proxy solicitations.</p>
<h3>Applications for exemptive relief from requirements to deliver documents</h3>
<p>During the disruption of regular mail service, there may be a need to apply for exemptive relief from requirements to deliver documents to securityholders and other parties. Urgent applications will be processed promptly.</p>
<p>Industry participants may also refer to&nbsp;<em><a class="is-external file-link-simple " href="https://lautorite.qc.ca/fileadmin/lautorite/reglementation/valeurs-mobilieres/11-201/2023-06-09/2023juin09-11-201-ig-vadmin-en.pdf" target="_blank"><span class="file-size">Policy Statement 11-201 respecting Electronic Delivery of Documents&nbsp;<small>(pdf - 158&nbsp;KB)</small><span class="icon-wrapper external-wrapper typo3-search-exclude"><img class="external" height="10" src="https://lautorite.qc.ca/typo3conf/ext/amf_site_lautorite/Resources/Public/Assets/svg/originals/external.svg" width="10" /></span><span class="visuallyhidden typo3-search-exclude">This link will open in a new window</span></span></a></em>.</p>

<h2>Measures for financial institutions or their agents</h2>

<title>US Department Of Justice: Operator Of Helix Darknet Cryptocurrency “Mixer” Sentenced In Money Laundering Conspiracy And Ordered To Forfeit Over $400M In Assets</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>An Ohio man was sentenced today to three years in prison for his operation of the darknet cryptocurrency &ldquo;mixer&rdquo; Helix, which processed transactions involving over $300 million worth of cryptocurrency from 2014 to 2017.</p>
<p>According to court documents, Larry Dean Harmon, 41, of Akron, ran Helix, a darknet mixer that laundered customers&rsquo; bitcoin. Helix was connected to Grams, a darknet search engine also run by Harmon. Helix was one of the most popular mixing services on the darknet and was highly sought after by online drug dealers who needed to launder their illicit proceeds. Helix processed at least approximately 354,468 bitcoin &mdash; the equivalent of approximately $311,145,854 in U.S. dollars at the time of the transactions &mdash; on behalf of its customers, including customers in the District of Columbia. Much of those funds were coming from or going to darknet drug markets. Harmon retained a percentage of these transactions as his commissions and fees for operating Helix.</p>
<p>Harmon worked to ensure Grams and Helix connected to or otherwise supported all of the major darknet markets at the time. Harmon developed an Application Program Interface (API) to allow darknet markets to integrate Helix directly into their bitcoin withdrawal systems. Harmon also customized features of Helix to ensure compatibility with significant markets. Investigators traced tens of millions of dollars from darknet markets to Helix.</p>
<p>On Aug. 18, 2021, Harmon pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering.</p>
<p>In addition to his term in prison, Harmon was sentenced to three years of supervised release; a forfeiture money judgment in the amount of $311,145,854; and forfeiture of seized cryptocurrencies, real estate, and monetary assets valued at over $400 million.</p>
<p>Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department&rsquo;s Criminal Division; U.S. Attorney Matthew M. Graves for the District of Columbia; Chief Guy Ficco of IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI); and Assistant Director Bryan Vorndran of FBI&rsquo;s Cyber Division made the announcement.</p>
<p>IRS-CI&rsquo;s Washington D.C. Cyber Crimes Unit and the FBI Washington Field Office investigated the case, with valuable assistance provided by the Justice Department&rsquo;s Office of International Affairs and U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Northern District of Ohio.</p>
<p>The Attorney General&rsquo;s Ministry of Belize and Belize Police Department provided essential support for the investigation, coordinated through U.S. Embassy Belmopan. The investigation was coordinated with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which assessed a $60 million civil monetary penalty against Harmon in a parallel action.</p>
<p>Trial Attorney C. Alden Pelker of the Criminal Division&rsquo;s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) and Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher B. Brown for the District of Columbia prosecuted the case. Trial Attorney Riane Harper and former Trial Attorney W. Joss Nichols of CCIPS, Paralegal Specialist Angela De Falco for the District of Columbia, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Riedl for the Northern District of Ohio provided valuable assistance.</p>

<title>Remarks At PLI’s 56th Annual Institute On Securities Regulation, Sanjay Wadhwa, Acting Director, SEC Division Of Enforcement, New York, NY, Nov. 15, 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good morning. Thank you to PLI for organizing this event and for the opportunity to address this audience.</p>
<p>As is customary, my remarks are in my official capacity as Acting Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement, and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Commission, the Commissioners, or other members of the staff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take the opportunity today to reflect on some of the goals and intentions that then-Director Gurbir Grewal and I, as his deputy, discussed when we assumed leadership of this remarkable Division three-plus years ago, and what I hope to see for the Division and its dedicated personnel going forward.</p>
<p>Since 2021, Gurbir and I frequently discussed, including at conferences like this one, that we would prioritize restoring investor trust and confidence in the financial markets by emphasizing robust enforcement that works to promote a culture of compliance among market participants.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/wadhwa-remarks-pli-111524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>We explained that this included empowering frontline Enforcement staff by largely deferring to their judgment on various issues in our investigations and our recommendations to the Commission.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/wadhwa-remarks-pli-111524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;We explained that we would do this because Enforcement staff (i) are immensely talented and possess great experience and judgment and (ii) are in the best position to know the ins-and-outs of their investigations, the quality of their evidence, and the tenor and substance of interactions with defense counsel.</p>
<p>We have done that. And I think the work of the Division over the past three-plus years has shown that our confidence in our Enforcement colleagues was well-placed. Enforcement staff have used their judgment wisely and appropriately, conducting investigations diligently, but with urgency, and without fear or favor, following the facts where they may lead, to protect investors across the industry. That is, after all, our mission, and this Commission and its Enforcement staff have endeavored to fulfill it on a daily basis.</p>
<p>This has resulted in consequential enforcement actions addressing material misstatements by public companies,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/wadhwa-remarks-pli-111524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;wholesale failures by gatekeepers to comply with their professional obligations,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/wadhwa-remarks-pli-111524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;and failures by advisory firms to disclose and guard against conflicts of interest.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/wadhwa-remarks-pli-111524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;It has resulted in actions alleging that insiders abused their position for personal gain.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/wadhwa-remarks-pli-111524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;And, of course, it has resulted in actions alleging massive frauds by various types of market participants.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/wadhwa-remarks-pli-111524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>Those enforcement actions have protected innumerable investors, both by putting an end to the specific conduct at issue, but also by deterring other market participants who saw the Commission act forcefully and, in response, remediated their own violations or redoubled their efforts at compliance.</p>
<p>Now, when Gurbir and I discussed our efforts to empower frontline Enforcement staff, there were some concerns in the defense bar that this would result in staff adopting unreasonable stances, or that good-faith efforts by market participants to comply would be disregarded.</p>
<p>From my perspective, those concerns were misplaced.</p>
<p>For one, Enforcement attorneys understand and appreciate the tremendous impact that an SEC investigation can have on parties that may find themselves in our crosshairs. Accordingly, giving process is part of the DNA of the Enforcement Division. For example, the Wells process remains a meaningful process for parties to make their arguments to the Enforcement Division, even without the Front Office participating in every meeting. As defense counsel that work with us regularly can attest, these meetings at times result in staff recommending reduced charges or even declining to recommend charges at all.</p>
<p>The empowerment of Enforcement staff involved both carrots and sticks. Not only did we say we would largely defer to their judgment on charges, but more importantly, we told them to use their judgment in recommending that the Commission reward parties that self-policed, self-reported, remediated, or otherwise meaningfully cooperated with our investigations.</p>
<p>Time and again, staff embraced our call on this point and asked Gurbir and me to consider those efforts by prospective defendants and respondents, and we, in turn, agreed to recommend resolutions to the Commission that imposed reduced penalties or even zero penalties.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/wadhwa-remarks-pli-111524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;Or, where parties have remediated the violations, we have taken that into account in determining what, if any, undertakings or other remedies to recommend.</p>
<p>This has even included actions involving recidivists and major firms.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/wadhwa-remarks-pli-111524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;And it illustrates exactly what we mean by emphasizing robust enforcement while working to create or promote a culture of compliance among market participants. Because only by working together can we &ndash; that is, the regulator and the regulated &ndash; maintain investors&rsquo; trust in the markets.</p>
<p>Now, you may ask yourself, given the proactive remediation I just mentioned, why then do we need an Enforcement Division? Let me be clear. In my view, this is &ndash; indeed, it has to be &ndash; a joint undertaking where internal or in-house compliance complements the Commission&rsquo;s enforcement efforts.</p>
<p>This is because self-regulation is not a substitute for regulatory enforcement. No matter how much we promote a culture of compliance; or message the benefits of self-policing, self-reporting, and proactive remediation; or even appeal to market participants&rsquo; better nature, there will always be those who cut corners, those who choose non-compliance, either deliberately or by underinvesting in their compliance functions. The incentives are simply too great without a strong Enforcement Division holding such parties in check.</p>
<p>After all, compliance has costs. There are the actual resources needed to implement effective compliance functions. And there are also the opportunity costs that may come from accurate disclosures, for example when disappointing financial figures drive investors elsewhere.</p>
<p>But one need only look at the state of the securities market before the enactment of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for a sense of what happens when market participants are restrained only by their own judgment.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/wadhwa-remarks-pli-111524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p>The marketplace therefore needs an Enforcement Division that is strong and that brings meaningful enforcement actions, actions that correct misbehavior before it spirals out of control and destroys investor wealth and investor confidence in the markets.</p>
<p>In fact, we have telegraphed in clear terms that one of the ways we achieve compliance is by reversing the incentives, by imposing penalties and other remedies that make it clear to market participants that complying with the securities laws is cheaper than violating those laws.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/wadhwa-remarks-pli-111524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;Certainly, I am sure that it is not lost on anyone that the increased self-reporting and other cooperation that we have been highlighting has come during a time of record civil penalties. Those record penalties help incentivize companies to adequately invest in their compliance departments and empower their compliance personnel, which in turn protects investors and the markets.</p>
<p>Ultimately, of course, protecting investors and promoting the integrity of the markets is what drives us all in the Division of Enforcement, and that should be a shared goal among all of us here. Securities law violations, whether they involve negligence, so-called &ldquo;technical violations,&rdquo; or deliberate intent to defraud, erode the integrity of the markets and undermine investor trust in our capital markets.</p>
<p>It is therefore crucial that the Division of Enforcement have the ability to enforce compliance across the industry, addressing investor risk wherever and in whatever context it arises. Whether involving major global companies, small firms, or executive or senior officers.</p>
<p>It is my hope that, going forward, we will continue to see respect for the investigative process and for the judgment of the professionals in the Division of Enforcement; that the Division will continue to operate as an effective watchman, ensuring that all market participants, across the industry, comply with their legal and regulatory obligations.</p>
<p>The stakes are just too high for it to be otherwise. The continued success of our capital markets, which are the envy of the world and the engine of economic activity, depends on it. And, the trust of the average investor turns on it.</p>
<p>Over the last three-plus years, the work of the Division, its staff, and the many market participants that have heeded our call to embrace our shared mission of protecting investors, has been a great source of pride for me, and I hope we can continue to build on that effort going forward.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<title>Master Plan Amendment For BIS Campus Open For Public Review</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/master-plan-amendment-for-bis-campus-open-for-public-review/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/master-plan-amendment-for-bis-campus-open-for-public-review/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div id="cmsContent">
<ul>
<li>Master plan amendment open for public review from 18 November to 17 December. The City of Basel's Construction and Transportation Department is responsible for the master plan procedure.</li>
<li>The amendment to the master plan is sought to realise the design selected as part of an international competition.</li>
<li>The BIS Campus Development project is expected to be in a design and planning phase until 2027, based on a proposed design by architectural firms ELEMENTAL and Nissen Wentzlaff Studio.</li>
</ul>
<p>The BIS today announced that it has requested an amendment to the master plan for its headquarters site in Basel. This is sought to realise the design proposed by ELEMENTAL and Nissen Wentzlaff Studio, which was selected as part of an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/about/building_project/competition.htm"><span class="firstword">international</span>&nbsp;competition</a>.</p>
<p>The master plan amendment, which has been developed in collaboration with the Department of Construction and Transportation Basel-Stadt, will be open for public review from Monday 18 November to Tuesday 17&nbsp;December 2024 at its offices at M&uuml;nsterplatz 11, Lichthof, 4051 Basel (opening hours: Mo&ndash;Fr 08:00&ndash;12:15 / 13:15&ndash;17:00) or online at&nbsp;<a class="external" href="http://www.bs.ch/bvd/planauflagen-und-anordnungen/nutzungsplanungsondernutzungsplanung" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">www.bs.ch/bvd/planauflagen-und-anordnungen/nutzungsplanungsondernutzungsplanung</a>.</p>
<p>The plan seeks to amend the existing master plan No. 214, which was approved in 2015 by the Grand Council of Basel-Stadt. Overseeing the process is the responsibility of the Department of Construction and Transportation, and the associated political decisions are the responsibility of the Governing Council of the Canton of Basel-Stadt.</p>
<p>The BIS acts as a hub for central banks and other financial regulatory and supervisory authorities across the globe, hosts many international meetings in Basel each year and brings thousands of visitors to the city. The Campus Development project aims to draw together the global central bank community in an environment that inspires thought leadership and collaboration. It also seeks to bring staff working in Basel together in a single location.</p>
<p>The plan to develop the site around the existing BIS Tower is in line with Basel-Stadt's concept for the area surrounding the train station and will correspond with other planned developments. The project is currently in the design and planning phase, which is expected to last until 2027. Adjustments to the planning are sought to give the required scope to implement the final design. More information on the project can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/about/building_project.htm"><span class="firstword">here</span></a>.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Background</em></p>
<p><em>The mission of the BIS is to support central banks' pursuit of monetary and financial stability through international cooperation, and to act as a bank for central banks. To pursue its mission, the BIS acts as&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.bis.org/about/index.htm?m=2&amp;accordion1=a+forum+for+dialogue+and+broad+international+cooperation"><em>a forum for dialogue and collaboration</em></a><em>&nbsp;among central banks and supervisory authorities. This includes hosting about 150 meetings in Basel every year, which bring more than 5,000 people to the city. The BIS also provides central banks with&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.bis.org/about/index.htm?m=2&amp;accordion1=a+platform+for+responsible+innovation+and+knowledge-sharing"><em>a platform for responsible innovation and knowledge-sharing</em></a><em>,&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.bis.org/about/index.htm?m=2&amp;accordion1=in-depth+analysis+and+insights+on+core+policy+issues"><em>in-depth analysis and insights on core policy issues</em></a><em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.bis.org/about/index.htm?m=2&amp;accordion1=sound+and+competitive+financial+services"><em>sound and competitive financial services</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p><em>A master plan is a binding development plan of an area, in this case the BIS headquarters site near Basel's main train station. In 2014, the BIS asked the Canton of Basel-Stadt to rezone part of this site to allow it to make better use of the property surrounding the Tower building in years to come. The master plan was approved by the Basel-Stadt government and parliament in 2014&ndash;15. Before applying for a building permit, the master plan needs to be updated to include, for example, the exact location of the proposed new tower.</em></p>

<title>FSB Europe Group Discusses Private Credit, Financial And Operational Vulnerabilities And Securitisation</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fsb-europe-group-discusses-private-credit-financial-and-operational-vulnerabili/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fsb-europe-group-discusses-private-credit-financial-and-operational-vulnerabili/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) Regional Consultative Group for Europe (RCG Europe) met on 14 and 15 November in Munich, Germany. The meeting was hosted by the Deutsche Bundesbank and Bundesanstalt f&uuml;r Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin).</p>
<p>On the first day, members participated in a workshop on the financial stability implications of private credit. Members discussed the drivers of growth of this form of credit and the benefits it brings to the broader economy. They also discussed the need to enhance understanding of potential risks, given limited data on the market, as well as existing regulations. A concentration of these schemes in the riskiest segments of the market exposes them to credit risk. Due to data gaps, lack of a secondary market to publicise valuations, and limited disclosure, it remains a challenge to monitor and understand the vulnerabilities of this sector.</p>
<p>Members discussed global and regional vulnerabilities in the financial system. They noted that long-standing vulnerabilities remain, including debt levels in governments, corporates and households. The spike in equity market volatility in August also signalled vulnerabilities in non-bank financial intermediation, an issue that the FSB has been discussing for a while. Geopolitical risk is likely to remain elevated, which warrants preparedness for heightened uncertainty and volatility, including in financial markets.</p>
<p>Another source of concern is operational vulnerabilities. Participants shared insights on how the global IT outage in July affected financial institutions in their region. On this note, they welcomed the FSB&rsquo;s public consultation on a Format for Incident Reporting Exchange (FIRE) and its potential to address challenges arising from the need for financial institutions to report the same operational incident to multiple authorities.</p>
<p>The group took note of the findings of a recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/10/depositor-behaviour-and-interest-rate-and-liquidity-risks-in-the-financial-system-lessons-from-the-march-2023-banking-turmoil/">FSB report</a>&nbsp;highlighting the vulnerabilities related to a combination of solvency and liquidity risks in a high-interest-rate environment, and the role of technology and social media for depositor behaviour. Members discussed the implications of these factors and potential tools to address related challenges.</p>
<p>Finally, members discussed the FSB&rsquo;s evaluation of the effects of the G20 financial regulatory reforms on securitisation. The FSB published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/07/evaluation-of-the-effects-of-the-g20-financial-regulatory-reforms-on-securitisation-consultation-report/">consultative report&nbsp;</a>assessing the extent to which the reforms have achieved their objectives and the evolution of securitisation markets. Members discussed the effects of reforms in the European context and look forward to the FSB&rsquo;s forthcoming final report.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h2>
<p>The FSB Regional Consultative Group for Europe is co-chaired by Soledad N&uacute;&ntilde;ez, Deputy Governor, Bank of Spain, and Vasileios Madouros, Deputy Governor, Central Bank of Ireland. Membership includes financial authorities from Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic,&nbsp;Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine, United Kingdom and the Group of International Finance Centre Supervisors. The European Commission, the European Central Bank (ECB), the ECB Banking Supervision also attended the meeting.</p>
<p>The FSB has six Regional Consultative Groups, established under the FSB Charter, to bring together financial authorities from FSB member and non-member countries to exchange views on vulnerabilities affecting financial systems and on initiatives to promote financial stability.<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/11/fsb-europe-group-discusses-private-credit-financial-and-operational-vulnerabilities-and-securitisation/#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Typically, each Regional Consultative Group meets twice each year.</p>
<p>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. The FSB also conducts outreach with approximately 70 other jurisdictions through its six Regional Consultative Groups.</p>
<p>The FSB is chaired by Klaas Knot, President of De Nederlandsche Bank. The FSB Secretariat is located in Basel, Switzerland and hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>

<div class="container">
<p>The financial services sector is the engine of the country&rsquo;s economy. A successful sector drives prosperity for companies, getting money to flow to small and medium-sized businesses allowing them to invest and grow.</p>
<p>The UK is a magnet for talent and investment, with London ranking as the world&rsquo;s second financial centre. We are the world leader for international bond issuance, foreign exchange trading and cross-border banking. The UK&rsquo;s asset management, hedge fund and private equity sectors continue to be the largest in Europe, alongside our insurance and long-term savings market.</p>
<p>We're a partner for growth and we support the Chancellor&rsquo;s vision for achieving it. Our regulation enables a fair and thriving financial services sector that allows people to spend, save and invest in their own future.</p>
<p>We have fully embraced our secondary international competitiveness and growth objective, embedding it into our processes, policy making and culture. We&rsquo;ve established a dedicated team to advise on implementing the new objective and our policy work now clearly articulates how we have applied the objective.</p>
<p>Our reform of UK listing rules &ndash; the most significant in 3 decades &ndash; aims to encourage a wide range of companies to list and raise capital in the UK, increasing opportunities for investors.</p>
<p>A new platform to allow private companies to trade their securities (PISCES) will support companies to scale up and grow and provide investors with better access to exciting companies. We are engaging market participants, industry leaders, trade bodies and exchanges to develop a proportionate regulatory framework and we look forward to publishing our consultation shortly.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve provided asset managers greater freedom in how they pay for research and are streamlining complex EU rules in the alternative asset management sector, cementing our position as the world&rsquo;s second largest asset management hub.</p>
<p>Wholesale market firms wishing to expand into the UK can now benefit from our dedicated pre-application support service. We&rsquo;re supporting UK and international insurance brokers by clarifying our conduct rules and distribution services.</p>
<p>In response to the Mansion House speech, we have published updates on specific issues raised in the speech:</p>

<p>We will work quickly with the Government, industry, consumer groups and other interested parties as we deliver this important work.</p>
<p>Recognising the vital role we play in enabling new firms to get off the ground, we have improved our authorisation process with 98% of cases now assessed within statutory deadlines, up from 78.9% in Q1 of 2022/23. Our innovation services, such as sandboxes, support firms to test drive and refine their innovative new products while our early and high growth oversight programme helps new firms meet standards so they can grow.</p>

<title>The ESAs Announce Timeline To Collect Information For The Designation Of Critical ICT Third-Party Service Providers Under The Digital Operational Resilience Act</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Supervisory Authorities (EBA, EIOPA and ESMA &ndash; the ESAs) published today a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-11/ESA_2024_22_Decision_on_reporting_of_information_for_CTPP_designation.pdf">Decision</a>&nbsp;on the information that competent authorities must report to them for the designation of critical ICT third-party service providers under the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA). In particular, the Decision requires competent authorities to report by 30 April 2025 the registers of information on contractual arrangements of the financial entities with ICT third-party service providers.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><a>Following the entry into force of DORA on 17 January 2025, the ESAs, together with competent authorities, will start the oversight of critical ICT third-party service providers (CTPPs) offering services to financial entities in the EU. The first oversight activity is the designation of CTPPs.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>The Decision published today provides a general framework for the annual reporting to the ESA of the information necessary for the CTPP designation, including timelines, frequency and reference dates, general procedures for the submission of information, quality assurance and revisions of submitted data, as well as confidentiality and access to information.</p>
<p>As the deadline for the first submission of the registers of information to the ESAs is set for 30 April 2025, the ESAs expect competent authorities to collect the registers of information from the financial entities under their supervision in advance, following their own timelines.</p>
<p>Although the implementing technical standards (ITS) on the Registers of information have not yet been adopted by the EU Commission, the ESAs note that the essential part of the requirements for registers of information is publicly available since the publication of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-01/JC_2023_85_-_Final_report_on_draft_ITS_on_Register_of_Information.pdf">ESAs Final Report</a>&nbsp;in January 2024 and that any potential changes in the registers following the rejection by the EU Commission and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esas-respond-european-commissions-rejection-technical-standards-registers">ESAs Opinion</a>&nbsp;on the rejection should be limited. Therefore, the ESAs encourage financial entities to anticipate as much as possible the preparation of their registers, especially for information which may not be immediately available (e.g. the relevant identifiers of their ICT providers).&nbsp;</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Fines And Bans Craig Buchan And Martin Cooke For Recklessly Breaching Requirements</title>

<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>Craig Buchan and Martin Cooke, former partners of MedDen Financial Services LLP (MedDen), have been fined &pound;6,037 and &pound;6,020 (respectively) and banned by the FCA for recklessly breaching an asset requirement imposed on the firm.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p><span>The FCA imposed an asset requirement on MedDen, meaning the firm could not diminish the value of any of its own assets. The asset requirement was imposed to safeguard MedDen&rsquo;s assets for the benefit of its customers who were owed redress for financial losses suffered because of advice they had received.</span></p>
<p><span>However, the day after the requirement was imposed, Mr Buchan and Mr Cooke recklessly withdrew funds from MedDen&rsquo;s bank account for their own benefit. This meant MedDen&rsquo;s bank accounts held no funds for customers who were owed redress. Both individuals also failed to report the breach of the asset requirement to the FCA.</span></p>
<p><span>Therese Chambers, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, stated:</span></p>
<p>'<span>We are committed to upholding the highest standards in the financial services sector to protect consumers from misconduct.</span></p>
<p><span>'We use our powers to impose asset requirements to protect consumers from the risk that bad actors may dissipate funds that should be earmarked for redress. We take any attempt to circumvent this very seriously and we will not allow those involved to remain active in the industry.'</span></p>
<h2>Background</h2>

<li>The FCA has determined that both Mr Buchan and Mr Cooke were not fit and proper to perform any regulated activities due to the serious nature of their breach of the requirements.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The asset requirement was put in place on 14 December 2020.</li>
<li>The total withdrawn from MedDen&rsquo;s bank account was &pound;9,292.36 between the 15 and 21 December 2020. These funds have not been returned.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Mr Cooke and Mr Buchan&rsquo;s respective penalties of &pound;61,020 and &pound;58,437 were reduced due to circumstances of financial hardship.</li>
<li>The FCA has imposed a financial penalty of &pound;6,037 on Mr Buchan and &pound;6,020 on Mr Cooke under Section 66 of the Financial Services and Markets Act (the Act). Both subjects have been issued with a prohibition order to prevent them from performing any function related to regulated activities carried out by any authorised or exempt person, as outlined in section 56 of the Act.&nbsp;</li>
<li>On 1 February 2021, MedDen entered voluntary liquidation.</li>

<title>The UK Prudential Regulation Authority Consults On Reforms To The UK Insurance Special Purpose Vehicle Regulatory framework</title>

<div class="content-block">
<div class="page-content page-carousel sc-a414f3ebd9454dcd8e78a4f012b15374">
<p>Today, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation/publication/2024/november/uk-ispv-regulatory-framework-consultation-paper">consultation paper (CP) 15/24</a>&nbsp;proposing reforms to the UK Insurance Special Purpose Vehicle (UK ISPV) regulatory framework, through a combination of changes to the finalised PRA rules and policy materials also published today in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation/publication/2024/november/review-of-solvency-ii-restatement-of-assimilated-law-policy-statement">policy statement (PS) 15/24</a>&nbsp;that will replace Solvency II assimilated law.</p>
<p>The proposed reforms are intended to enhance the safety and soundness of the insurance sector by making more diversified reinsurance capital available to cedants while also furthering the PRA&rsquo;s secondary competitiveness and growth objective by making authorisation of UK ISPVs faster and easier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proposals introduce a new accelerated pathway for certain UK ISPV applications (e.g. some types of catastrophe bonds) which meet the criteria set out in the PRA&rsquo;s proposed new statement of policy &ndash; Approach to authorising and supervising UK insurance special purpose vehicles. Under the accelerated pathway, in collaboration with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the PRA proposes to consider applications and, where satisfied, issue approvals within 10 working days (rather than the current 4&ndash;6-week process) of an application being submitted to the PRA and deemed complete.&nbsp; In addition, the proposed reforms will make it easier for a wider range of current market practices to be undertaken in the UK, while also streamlining and speeding up the standard application and approval processes. The reforms will also clarify the PRA&rsquo;s expectations of UK insurers who cede risks to Special Purpose Vehicles, wherever they are established.</p>
<p>Sam Woods the Deputy Governor for prudential regulation said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;These reforms will deliver a much faster turn-around time for approval of new Insurance Special Purpose Vehicles in the UK, supporting growth and competitiveness while maintaining safety and soundness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To help inform these proposals the PRA convened a number of discussions with industry, including a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/prudential-regulation/authorisations/insurance-special-purpose-vehicles/pra-subject-expert-group-on-ispvs-minutes-13-december-2023.pdf" target="_blank">subject expert group<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external">&nbsp;</span></a>, to gather a broad range of information and explore options for proposed reforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Next steps</h3>
<p>The PRA invites feedback on the proposals set out in this consultation and welcomes further discussion from stakeholders to help inform its final policy decisions. The consultation period closes on 14 February 2025. Please address any comments or enquiries to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:CP15_24@bankofengland.co.uk">CP15_24@bankofengland.co.uk</a>. The PRA proposes to publish final policy for firms in mid-2025.<br /><br />The current requirements on UK ISPVs derive from a combination of the PRA&rsquo;s final policy outlined in PS15/24 and UK legislation. The PRA is working actively with stakeholders to agree the most effective approach to introducing further reforms to the UK ISPV framework.&nbsp;<br />The PRA is grateful for the input received to date and looks forward to further constructive engagement and feedback during the consultation period.</p>

<p>The report assesses whether the proposed reference price methodology (RPM) complies with the requirements of the Network Code on Harmonised Transmission Tariff structures (<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtSUgVTV1BUVkwPAlcGHVZYDQ4dUFsAXhpWAAoCVlJRAgcJUgYdBFZRUVsDB1IdVlhRVB0GWAFUGgxVVgUZVlQGAQAAUwcCXFUCRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">NC TAR</a>). The proposed postage stamp RPM is complemented by an inter-transmission system operator compensation (ITC) mechanism, providing part of the revenue collected between Estonia, Finland, and Latvia as part of a market merger process called &lsquo;FINESTLAT&rsquo;.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the key findings?</span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>After analysing the NRA&rsquo;s consultation document, ACER concludes that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The capacity cost driver presented is not sufficiently defined, making it unclear whether it represents an efficient indicator for network utilisation.</li>
<li>There is limited assessment of the ITC&rsquo;s impact on the proposed methodology.</li>
<li>The consistent under-recovery of revenue, combined with the implementation of a price cap regime, raises questions about the efficient estimation of target revenue under Article 17 of the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsCVA9TWQdXUUxdUwAAHVZbVFcdUFxXVBoGXQoBBVANU1VUUlUdBFZRUVsDB1IdVlhRVB0GWAFUGgxVVgUZVlQGAQAAUwcCXFUCRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Gas and Hydrogen Regulation</a>.</li>
<li>Due to insufficient information, ACER cannot determine whether the methodology meets the requirements of cost-reflectivity, cross-border subsidisation, cross-border trade, and volume risk.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What does ACER recommend?</span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></strong></p>
<p>ACER recommends that the NRA, when adopting its decision:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enhances the clarity of published information.</li>
<li>Provides a more elaborate assessment of the RPM, considering ITC effects.</li>
<li>Publishes a simplified tariff model, including details on ITC-RPM interaction.</li>
<li>Describes the methodology for computing target revenue in detail.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, ACER invites the Estonian NRA to evaluate the effects of potentially moving to a non-price cap regime and implementing revenue reconciliation principles.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>The company, valued at 805 million euros, debuts on the stock exchange with a price of 10.23 euros per share</span></li>
</ul>
<p>BME welcomed Cox today. Enrique Riquelme, Executive Presidente of the company, and Ignacio Moreno, CEO, were accompanied by David Jim&eacute;nez-Blanco, Vice-Chairman of BME, at the traditional ringing of the bell at the Palacio de la Bolsa de Madrid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company debuted at a price of 10.23 euros per share, which implies a stock market valuation of 805 million euros.</p>
<p>It is the third company to join the main market of the Spanish stock exchange so far this year and the second this week, following the IPOs of Puig in May and Inmocemento (a spin-off of FCC) on Tuesday 12 last.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We welcome Cox to the stock exchange and celebrate its incorporation to the market. With them, the Spanish stock market gains in sectoral diversity and the company will now have the reputation, access to financing and all the other advantages of being a listed company. We wish the company the best of luck in the new journey it is embarking on today&rdquo;, explains David Jim&eacute;nez-Blanco, Vice-Chairman of BME.</p>
<p>Bj&oslash;rn Sibbern, Global Head Exchanges and Executive Board Member at SIX, said: &ldquo;With Cox's listing, there are now 26 companies listed on the Spanish financial markets in 2024, including the main market and the expansion markets (BME Growth and BME Scaleup). This week we have welcome three new additions to the SIX markets: Inmocemento, Sunrise today in Switzerland and Cox in Spain. It is great news that the pace of new companies joining the markets remains at this level, which demonstrates the role of the stock exchange in meeting the needs of companies in all circumstances&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company has begun trading under the ticker symbol &ldquo;<span>COXG</span>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Cox is a vertically and horizontally integrated water and energy utility, recognized globally as a leader in infrastructure and efficient resource management. The company specializes in desalination, reuse, and treatment technologies, as well as in the generation and transmission of renewable energy. Cox provides services across the entire value chain and leverages synergies created by its complementary capabilities through its divisions to maximize value creation. It operates in the Middle East, Latin America, Spain, South Africa, and North Africa.</p>

<div class="container">
<p>The FCA welcomes the Government&rsquo;s publication of their consultation response and the draft legislation on bringing environmental, social and governance (ESG) ratings providers into regulation. This is widely supported by industry.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>As financial services firms integrate ESG into their activities and expand their products in this space, they are increasingly reliant on third party ESG data and ratings services. We have previously said we support bringing ESG ratings providers into regulation, to improve transparency and trust in the market.</p>
<h2>Making new rules</h2>
<p>We will continue to work closely with the Government on their next steps as they welcome technical comments on their draft legislation.</p>
<p>Once the legislation is finalised by the Government next year, we intend to consult on proposals for the future regulatory regime in 2025.</p>
<p>We support a globally consistent approach that enables users to make better informed investment decisions and gives the market confidence in the reliability and quality of these products. Our regime will be proportionate and in line with the&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD690.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="IOSCO recommendations">International Organisation of Securities Commission (IOSCO) recommendations<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>, which focus on transparency, good governance, managing conflicts of interest, and proper systems and controls.</p>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>As we develop the future regulatory regime, we will engage widely to inform our approach. This will include all types of ESG ratings providers and users. We support a level playing field between all firms providing ESG ratings. We will continue engaging with other international authorities, including the EU, to support regulatory alignment.</p>

We continue to encourage both ESG data and ratings providers to sign up to the Code. This has been leveraged by Hong Kong to develop their Code, and other countries such as Singapore and Japan have introduced their own Codes of Conduct.</p>

<title>International Investors: Be Optimistic About China's Capital Market In The Long Term</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On November 7, the 2024 Shanghai Stock Exchange Global Investors Conference kicked off in Shanghai, with representatives from approximately 260 well-known domestic and international investment institutions registered to attend.</p>
<p>Shen Bing, Director-General of the Department of Fund and Intermediary Supervision of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), stated that the Chinese companies listed in A-shares, H-shares, and overseas are still at relatively low valuation levels compared with listed companies in other emerging economies, which provides a better choice for long-term foreign capital allocation.</p>
<p>Shen held that China's capital market has increasingly become one of the most important markets that international investors cannot overlook in their global allocation strategies. This is mainly based on three principles: First, international investors are optimistic about the stable development of China's economy in the long term. With the implementation of a series of incremental economic policies, the Chinese economy continues to improve. Fundamental data is showing marginal improvements, and these positive factors are attracting many investors. Second, international investors are optimistic about the development prospects of China's capital market in the long term. The global status and influence of China's capital market are gradually increasing; various measures implemented in the capital market this year have boosted operational activity and market vitality in society, further stabilizing investor confidence. Third, international investors are optimistic about China's investment and business environment in the long term. The two-way opening up of the capital market and the continuously optimized investment environment have also given the market powerful appeal.</p>
<p>Alex Zhou of Morgan Stanley Investment Management China pointed out that China's asset management industry is huge and contains enormous development opportunities. From the perspective of global allocation, China's capital market offers a wide range of investable assets with great diversity. From a risk diversification standpoint, China's capital market provides overseas investors with more options for diversified asset allocation.</p>
<p>Dilhan Pillay Sandrasegara from Temasek noted that a series of policies introduced by the Chinese government aimed at stabilizing the economy and promoting growth, including measures for capital market reforms, have boosted investor confidence. As long-term investors, they will continue to invest in China.</p>
<p>Florian Neto from Amundi stated that, in terms of future earnings forecast, Chinese assets are continuously growing, and this is an excellent time for allocation. Emily Woodland from BlackRock highlighted the immense potential for hybrid financing in the Asia-Pacific region and noted that they are seizing this opportunity in collaboration with partners.</p>

<p>The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 requires the Treasury, at least once in each Parliament, to make recommendations to the FCA about aspects of the government&rsquo;s economic policy to which the FCA should have regard when advancing its objectives and discharging its duties.</p>

<title>Sunrise, Leading Challenger In The Swiss Telecom Market, Shines Again At SIX Swiss Exchange</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><img height="316" src="https://www.bolsasymercados.es/aspx/Imagen.ashx?Num=6334" width="790" /></p>
<p>Today, Sunrise Communications AG (&ldquo;Sunrise&rdquo;), a Liberty Global spin-off, listed its Class A shares under the ticker symbol &ldquo;SUNN&rdquo; at SIX Swiss Exchange. At an opening price of CHF 44.75 per Class A share, the resulting market capitalization of Sunrise was around CHF 3.2 billion.*</p>
<p>On 16 February 2024, Liberty Global announced its intention to spin-off Sunrise into an independent publicly listed company at SIX Swiss Exchange. On 25 October 2024, Liberty Global shareholders approved the proposed 100% spin-off of Sunrise to be implemented through the distribution of a dividend-in-kind in the form of American Depository Shares (&ldquo;ADSs&rdquo;), whose holders are entitled to convert such ADSs into Sunrise shares.</p>
<p>The Class A ADSs are tradable on the NASDAQ since 13 November 2024 whereas the Class A shares started trading at SIX Swiss Exchange this morning, 15 November 2024. A public offering of both the company&rsquo;s ADSs and shares did not take place. Sunrise Class A shares are anticipated to be included in the SPI index family five trading days following the first trading day at SIX Swiss Exchange, i.e. as of 22 November 2024.</p>
<p>Sunrise CEO Andr&eacute; Krause says: &ldquo;Today marks the successful introduction of Sunrise as a standalone company on SIX Swiss Exchange. I believe that Sunrise is better and stronger than ever. We are leveraging our strong number 2 position in the attractive Swiss telecom market, and we are well equipped to deliver our long-term vision and to continue serving Swiss customers with high-quality networks and attractive service offerings. The Sunrise shares represent a compelling investment opportunity for existing and new investors. Sunrise is primed for growth and cash returns and we expect an attractive progressive dividend policy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bj&oslash;rn Sibbern, Global Head Exchanges and Executive Board Member at SIX, highlights: &ldquo;I am delighted to welcome back Sunrise to SIX Swiss Exchange. It is exciting to see one of Switzerland&rsquo;s key telecom players deepen its roots here, bringing new investment&nbsp;opportunities to the market. I wish Sunrise every success as it continues its journey as an independent SIX-listed company. This listing rounds off a successful year, after the exchanges of SIX in Switzerland and Spain recorded the two largest IPOs in the world in the first half of the year.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span>*&nbsp;<span>Reflecting Sunrise's economic share count, ie. including 1/10th of the not listed and traded Sunrise Class B shares, resulting in 71.4 million shares outstanding.</span></span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="spanHeading"><span>Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) is pleased to announce today (Friday) it is collaborating with leading index compiler Hang Seng Indexes Company Limited (HSIL) to jointly launch an index tracking the largest Chinese companies in the vibrant Stock Connect universe, supporting the development of Hong Kong&rsquo;s capital market product ecosystem.</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading">The Hang Seng HKEX Stock Connect China Enterprises Index (SCCEA Index) will be the first co-branded index between HKEX and HSIL when it launches on 21 November 2024.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">Constituents of the index include the 80 largest Chinese companies by market capitalisation listed on the Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges that are traded on Stock Connect. With a balanced sector representation, this cross-market index will offer global investors a comprehensive and authoritative benchmark to capture the investment opportunities in China.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">HKEX Chief Executive Officer, Bonnie Y Chan, said: "As HKEX celebrates 10 years of Stock Connect, we are delighted to be partnering with Hang Seng Indexes Company in this initiative, bringing together the expertise of one of the world&rsquo;s leading exchange groups with the region&rsquo;s leading index compiler. Stock Connect has fundamentally transformed the relevance and competitiveness of Hong Kong&rsquo;s markets, and the launch of the Stock Connect China Enterprises Index underscores our ongoing commitment to further elevating the connectivity between Mainland China and international markets, providing investors with even more choice and opportunity, as we continue to explore adjacencies. We look forward to working closely with asset managers, issuers and market participants on new product innovations based on this index, further enriching the Stock Connect ecosystem to support the depth and breadth of Hong Kong&rsquo;s capital markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="spanHeading">Hang Seng Indexes Company Chief Executive Officer, Anita Mo, said: &ldquo;Today, I am delighted to announce the launch of the SCCEA with HKEX. The SCCEA is a comprehensive China index, an extension of our flagship HSCEI that incorporates large-cap A-shares, helping investors capture China exposure through Stock Connect. By capitalising on the combined strengths of HSIL and HKEX, as well as the growing trading turnover under Stock Connect, the introduction of the SCCEA will further support Hong Kong&rsquo;s role as a super connector between the mainland China and the rest of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="spanHeading">HKEX and HSIL will work together on driving awareness for the new co-branded index, helping to promote Hong Kong as the premier international financial centre for China-related investments. The SCCEA Index will be distributed by both HKEX and HSIL through their respective channels from 21 November 2024.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">Methodology and additional information about the SCCEA Index will be available on the HKEX and HSIL websites from the index launch date.</p>

<title>ASX Files Its Defence In The ASIC Proceedings</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asx-files-its-defence-in-the-asic-proceedings/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asx-files-its-defence-in-the-asic-proceedings/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today ASX Limited (ASX) has filed a Concise Statement in Response (Concise Response) to the proceedings brought by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) in the Federal Court on 13 August 2024. ASIC alleges that by making certain statements to the market on 10 February 2022 in relation to the previous CHESS replacement project, ASX contravened sections of the ASIC Act 2001 relating to misleading or deceptive conduct, and false or misleading representations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As detailed in the Concise Response, the previous CHESS replacement project was a highly complex, technical and dynamic project on which ASX regularly communicated progress. Based on the work being carried out by ASX, and the information available at the time regarding the status of the project, ASX denies that the statements made on 10 February 2022 contravened the law.</p>
<p><b>Managing Director and CEO Helen Lofthouse said</b>: &ldquo;ASX accepts that the delays with the previous CHESS replacement project caused disruption, something for which we&rsquo;ve apologised. However, there was a reasonable basis for the statements ASX made about the project&rsquo;s progress on 10 February 2022 and we do not accept the allegations that we breached the law.&rdquo;<i> </i></p>
<p>&ldquo;ASX provided regular updates on the project, including that it was subject to feedback and change, as well as the input of our external suppliers. When we became aware that the project required a deeper reassessment, we commissioned an independent review.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We took the difficult decision to pause and reassess the project and we have conducted several independent reviews, including those requested by our regulators, and we continue to implement recommendations from these reviews. In addition, we have taken a different approach to how we are implementing this important upgrade to ASX&rsquo;s equity clearing and settlement systems, including selection of a product based solution and staging the implementation over two releases. ASX has also established the CHESS Replacement Partnership Program to support continued industry participation in this critical project.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our ongoing regulatory engagement with ASIC remains open and constructive. However, it is in the interests of the company and its shareholders that ASX defends the proceedings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>HM Treasury has committed to make the following changes to the UK&rsquo;s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) framework as part of the government&rsquo;s work to reform our rulebook for capital markets so that it delivers for investors and firms, and supports growth across the UK.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Learning the lessons from the events in the Nickel market in March 2022, the government is ensuring that the Financial Conduct Authority has the necessary tools to appropriately oversee the off-exchange trading of commodity derivatives, while maintaining the international competitiveness of these markets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It will also commence the revocation of the detailed requirements in legislation that govern the organisation and operation of investment firms, as well as those relating to transaction reporting so that the regulators can deliver a more proportionate, streamlined and agile framework in regulatory rules.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All these changes require legislation. To avoid any gaps in regulation, the government will work hand in hand with the regulators and will only commence the relevant revocations when the rules are ready to come into force.</p>

<div class="govspeak">
<p>This consultation sets out the government&rsquo;s proposal for a new platform that will allow private companies to trade their securities in a controlled environment and on an intermittent basis. The new Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System (<abbr title="Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System">PISCES</abbr>) incorporates elements from public markets, such as those that offer multilateral trading, and elements from private markets that provide greater discretion on what company disclosures should be made public.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Participating on&nbsp;<abbr title="Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System">PISCES</abbr>&nbsp;will support companies to scale up and grow, providing liquidity, helping shareholders, including employee shareholders, to realise their gains, and providing an opportunity to companies to rationalise their shareholder base. Investors will gain better access to exciting companies while also benefiting from greater transparency and efficiency than available in private markets.</p>
<p>This proposal will support the pipeline for future initial public offerings (<abbr title="Initial Public Offerings">IPOs</abbr>) in the UK, by improving the interface between private companies and UK public markets, and complementing the government&rsquo;s wide ranging and ongoing reforms to boost the UK as a listing destination.</p>
<p><abbr title="Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System">PISCES</abbr>&nbsp;will be developed using a financial market infrastructure (<abbr title="Financial markets infrastructure">FMI</abbr>) sandbox.</p>
<p>The consultation sets out the proposed design of the regulatory regime for&nbsp;<abbr title="Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System">PISCES</abbr>&nbsp;and invites feedback. This proposal will be of interest to expected participants in&nbsp;<abbr title="Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System">PISCES</abbr>&nbsp;such as potential companies, investors, and market operators; as well as regulated intermediaries (brokers, investment banks etc), professional service firms and trade associations.</p>

<div class="gem-c-govspeak govuk-govspeak govuk-!-margin-bottom-0">
<div class="govspeak">
<p>The purpose of implementing a green taxonomy is to support investment into activities aligned with sustainability goals, and to mitigate greenwashing. However, the government is aware that taxonomies can be complex in practice, and feedback on their value is mixed.</p>
<p>This consultation is therefore seeking views on whether a UK Green Taxonomy would be additional and complementary to existing sustainable finance policies, including in supporting market participants to make sustainable investment decisions, and the specific market and regulatory use cases which facilitate this.</p>
<p>This will inform an assessment of the value of implementing a UK Taxonomy, and exactly how it could be targeted to ensure it is as effective as possible.</p>

<title>AuditBoard Survey Finds Misalignment Between Top Risks And Internal Audit Efforts - Key Findings Suggest One In Three Organizations Won’t Be Ready For The Institute Of Internal Auditors’ Global Internal Audit Standards January 2025 Deadline.</title>

<p class="sc-5159831f-0 sc-f534bc0f-26 jHnRxb"><a class="sc-fc7f2c12-0 cvSXOA sc-f534bc0f-23 dyZGRD" href="https://www.auditboard.com/">AuditBoard</a>, the leading cloud-based platform transforming audit, risk, compliance, and ESG management, today announced the results of a new research report,&nbsp;<a class="sc-fc7f2c12-0 cvSXOA sc-f534bc0f-23 dyZGRD" href="https://www.auditboard.com/resources/ebook/2025-focus-on-the-future-inflection-point-for-transformation-at-mid-decade/"><span class="sc-b323b31-0 sc-f534bc0f-29 jkVOH eRGQux">2025 Focus on the Future: Inflection Point for Transformation at Mid-Decade</span></a>. The report reveals a fundamental lack of alignment between top risks businesses face and the level of resources internal auditors are able to put towards those vulnerabilities.</p>
<p class="sc-5159831f-0 sc-f534bc0f-26 jHnRxb">The first half of the 2020s has been an era of perpetual risk-induced disruption spanning cybersecurity, AI, supply chain, inflation, third party, sustainability, and beyond. Despite largely static resource levels, internal audit leaders face a critical imperative to help their organizations tackle the rising volume and velocity of risks. The&nbsp;<span class="sc-b323b31-0 sc-f534bc0f-29 jkVOH eRGQux">2025 Focus on the Future</span>&nbsp;survey found many internal audit leaders are missing key opportunities to leverage technology, strategize, prioritize, and collaborate across their organizations, making it challenging to narrow the gap between rising risk demands and stagnant risk management capabilities. The data reveals:</p>
<ul class="sc-ace17a57-0 sc-f534bc0f-7 iThNvR bBhbVR list-decimal wp-block-list">
<li class="sc-b323b31-0 sc-f534bc0f-30 dLWKFS eVpdVZ"><span class="sc-b323b31-0">Risks may be growing, but resources are not:&nbsp;</span>Roughly three-quarters of those surveyed expect headcount to decrease or stay the same in 2025. AuditBoard survey data from the past three years collectively reveal a clear pattern of optimistic staffing forecasts followed by less rosy realities.&nbsp;</li>
<li class="sc-b323b31-0 sc-f534bc0f-30 dLWKFS eVpdVZ"><span class="sc-b323b31-0">There has been a lack of progress in implementing generative AI in internal audit:</span>&nbsp;Only 4% of those surveyed reported substantial progress in implementing AI in any area of internal audit, potentially jeopardizing audit teams&rsquo; chances of leveraging this capacity multiplier to achieve better results with less effort and increasing their risk of falling behind with AI.&nbsp;</li>
<li class="sc-b323b31-0 sc-f534bc0f-30 dLWKFS eVpdVZ"><span class="sc-b323b31-0">Lack of readiness to conform with The Institute of Internal Auditors&rsquo;&nbsp;</span><a class="sc-fc7f2c12-0 cvSXOA sc-f534bc0f-23 dyZGRD" href="https://www.theiia.org/en/standards/2024-standards/global-internal-audit-standards/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><span class="sc-b323b31-0"><span class="sc-b323b31-0 sc-f534bc0f-29 jkVOH eRGQux">Global Internal Audit Standards</span></span></a><span class="sc-b323b31-0">:</span>&nbsp;The survey found that at least one in three organizations won&rsquo;t be ready for the upcoming January 2025 deadline, indicating the lack of priority some internal auditors may be placing on guidance on the worldwide professional practice of internal auditing.</li>
<li class="sc-b323b31-0 sc-f534bc0f-30 dLWKFS eVpdVZ"><span class="sc-b323b31-0">Cybersecurity retains its place as the top-ranked risk and top area of audit effort</span>: 82% of internal auditors rated this risk as &ldquo;very high&rdquo; or &ldquo;higher than average&rdquo; for their organizations in 2025, versus 81% in 2024 and 83% in 2023 &mdash; a priority that is mirrored by the top rank in planned audit efforts.&nbsp;</li>
<li class="sc-b323b31-0 sc-f534bc0f-30 dLWKFS eVpdVZ"><span class="sc-b323b31-0">Ongoing misalignment between risk levels and planned audit efforts in key areas:&nbsp;</span>Survey respondents ranked changing economic conditions as the #2 risk, but it ranked #11 in terms of audit effort, showcasing a mismatched risk-to-effort ratio. Conversely, fraud was a lower-ranked risk at #10 but ranked high at #3 in terms of planned audit efforts. This suggests seemingly static views on risk and resource allocation while highlighting potential opportunities to reprioritize and redirect resources to assess and manage business&rsquo; most pressing risks.&nbsp;</li>
<li class="sc-b323b31-0 sc-f534bc0f-30 dLWKFS eVpdVZ"><span class="sc-b323b31-0">Immature views on the process, purpose, and importance of internal audit strategic planning and technology planning:</span>&nbsp;39% of respondents are not collaborating with other governance, risk, and compliance teams to share technologies. This missed opportunity often results in disconnected data and teams, audit fatigue, duplication of effort, and coverage gaps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p class="sc-5159831f-0 sc-f534bc0f-26 jHnRxb">&ldquo;Our organizations have experienced a half-century&rsquo;s worth of disruption in half a decade. These are not ordinary times; extraordinary action is required,&rdquo; said Richard Chambers, AuditBoard&rsquo;s Senior Advisor, Risk and Audit and the former CEO of The Institute of Internal Auditors. &ldquo;The internal audit profession is facing an inflection point. We must better equip ourselves to understand and face tomorrow&rsquo;s risks while deriving more benefits from limited resources.

<title>US Treasury Releases Report On Macroeconomic And Foreign Exchange Policies Of Major Trading Partners Of The United States</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury delivered its semiannual Report to Congress on Macroeconomic and Foreign Exchange Policies of Major Trading Partners of the United States.&nbsp; In this Report, Treasury reviewed and assessed the policies of major U.S. trading partners, comprising about 78 percent of U.S. foreign trade in goods and services, during the four quarters through June 2024.</p>
<p>In accordance with the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, the Report analyzed the practices of the United States&rsquo; major trading partners and concludes that no major U.S. trading partner manipulated the rate of exchange between its currency and the U.S. dollar for purposes of preventing effective balance of payments adjustments or gaining unfair competitive advantage in international trade during the four quarters through June 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this Report, Treasury found that no major trading partner met all three criteria for enhanced analysis under the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 during the four quarters ending June 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Biden Administration strongly opposes attempts by the United States&rsquo; trading partners to artificially manipulate currency values to gain unfair advantage over American workers.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Treasury firmly advocates for our major trading partners to adopt policies that support strong, sustainable, and balanced global growth and reduce excessive external&nbsp;imbalances. Treasury continues to engage closely on currency-related issues to ensure a level playing field for America&rsquo;s firms and workers,&rdquo; Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen said today.</p>
<p>Seven economies are on Treasury&rsquo;s &ldquo;Monitoring List&rdquo; of major trading partners that merit close attention to their currency practices and macroeconomic policies:&nbsp;China, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Germany.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Report also reiterated Treasury&rsquo;s call for increased transparency from China. &nbsp;China&rsquo;s failure to publish foreign exchange intervention and broader lack of transparency around key features of its exchange rate policy make China an outlier among major economies and warrant Treasury&rsquo;s close monitoring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s Report is submitted to Congress pursuant to Section 3005 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, 22 U.S.C. &sect; 5305, and Section 701 of the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015, 19 U.S.C. &sect; 4421.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Europe Trip Takeaways And The Development Of Consolidated Tape, By Kelvin To, Founder And President Of Data Boiler Technologies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>After a month in Europe meeting with regulators, trading venues, market participants and other stakeholders, I have many takeaways pertaining to the Consolidated Tape (CT) and related market structure reforms. Analogies from my mix of train rides and air flights traveling across 14 countries and 18 cities, how the CT can provide seamless experience that fit different purposes? I invite you to join me on this journey by <a href="https://www.databoiler.com/index_htm_files/DataBoiler%20Europe%202024.pdf">clicking here to download the full whitepaper</a>.</p>
<p>The following is an abstract summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tight spread constant refreshing EBBO as advertised price to draw big crowds and infuse trust </li>
<li>Deciphering the Consolidated Tape in layperson terms, its economic viabilities and market impacts </li>
<li>Dynamics among the protectionists, opportunists, regulators, overlooked, and the underrepresented </li>
<li>Save costs, grow the overall pie, reduce vulnerabilities, and support sustainable economic development </li>
</ul>
<p>Amid the creation of a <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/ny3j24sm/much-more-than-a-market-report-by-enrico-letta.pdf">Savings and Investments Union</a> initiative upon the incomplete Capital Markets Union, the EU needs substantially more than a name change. It needs to convince the world to place their trust and money in the EU market. Given Brexit and the UK taking divergence paths with the EU, <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/corporate/sicgo-report-2023-24.pdf">international competitiveness and growth</a> is at the heart of the UK FCA.&nbsp; In the race of market data reform, the US is leading the world with the Securities Information Processors (SIPs) introduced back in 1975 and the most recently approved rule (effective December 9, 2024) to improve <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/final/2024/34-101070.pdf">Transparency of Better Priced Orders</a>, a.k.a. accelerated implementation of <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/final/2020/34-90610.pdf">Market Data Infrastructure Rule</a>.</p>
<p>Travel across Europe with a low budget takes careful planning and understanding of the nuances (market micro-structure). The same goes with building the CT, to make the impossible possible, e.g., making a CT subscription of &euro;100 per user achievable. Every country I visited has these Americanized boardwalks that connect to my favorite old towns. They co-exist and grow the overall pie, which is the key point here.</p>
<p>I am not sure if it was the European pride or protectionism, rejecting the Americans in building the capital markets&rsquo; boardwalks (<a href="https://www.databoiler.com/index_htm_files/DataBoiler%20202409%20A-Z%20components%20of%20EU%20Equity%20CT.pdf">see this for our suggested mock-up &ldquo;Schematic of EU Equity Data Aggregation and Consolidation&rdquo;</a>) to attract big crowds. On one hand, the issuers want these American big brands to invest in their companies. On the other hand, local Exchanges and small domestic participants are worried that order flow may be segmented away to erode their market shares. Selling data and connectivity is the bread-and-butter for typical Exchanges. Yet, such is the mentality of <i>&lsquo;we burn, you burn with us&rsquo;</i> to <i>[allegedly give CT crappy data, e.g., 100,000 messages at any given point in time, i.e., mussed up everything and ecosystem degradation to exacerbate gap between proprietary feeds and CT]</i> is sadly a lose-lose approach.</p>
<p>Protectionism and self-interest blinded the eyes of the bigger picture. I am referring to the EBBO. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/eufm.12430">This empirical study</a> shows that <i>&ldquo;traders are more likely to select dealers (SIs) over exchanges when quoted bid&ndash;ask spreads are wide on exchanges and when the tick size is not binding in the exchanges order books.&rdquo; </i>For a win-win approach to enable prosperity for all EU Citizens, Europe needs a narrow bid-ask spread and constant refreshing of the EBBO, i.e., not over 100 messages at any given point in time to make the tape useful / suitable for BestEx analysis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is totally practical as proven by the High Frequency Trading firms (HFTs) and self-aggregators (SAs). Exchanges are not doing anything extra but providing the same fastest data feed and connection as they provide to the HFTs and SAs (see <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/final/2020/34-90610.pdf">MDIR</a> <i>&lsquo;same manner same methods&rsquo;</i> provision). It benefits the trading and investing communities, including the European trading venues because a usable tape and narrow spread EBBO advertised price can draw crowds to shop in the European markets.</p>
<p>There are legitimate reasons why pre-trade data in Consolidated Quote System of the US SIP is prioritizing speed over streaming of non-core non-essential data. It goes fast by traveling light, analogies to my having 1 backpack and 1 carry-on for my entire 1-month trip. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/market-data-available-securely-synchronized-time-kelvin-to/">Time lock encryption</a> (TLE) and compressed streaming of &ldquo;core data&rdquo; and relevant regulatory data can help overcome the extra hop latency issue in data consolidation. Because it takes a longer time to decode the full depth of book, odd-lot and other nitty-gritty in the Proprietary Feed. The CT would NOT be at a disadvantage in net.</p>
<p>One does not need to know how many people are in the queues of every convenience store across all European markets if he/she may be shopping for milk within neighborhood distance. Top-of-book EBBO provides an indication and introduces price pressure that any neighborhood store should not be too far off from this pan-Europe best price. Again, using a mix of CT and selected Proprietary feeds save money.</p>
<p>I wonder why some local European firms may decide to choose an endogenous selection to trade on certain exchanges or with dealers, and then review the performance every 6 months instead of up their game in execution performance. One logical reason is they under invest in technologies and lack resources or are understaffed. Second, a lack of EBBO thus far causes their clients not to be aware of receiving inferior price. Third, they rely on a strong presence throughout Europe and stickiness relationships with clients rather than execution performance to do business. Fourth, they are afraid that the geographic dispersion and aggregation distance would cause their EBBO refresh rate to be &lsquo;stale&rsquo; anyway, that I disagree.</p>
<p>The market shrinks because of protectionist policies that reduce serendipity. The viability of a CTP business model is dependent on its ability to fulfill different sell- and buyside subscribers&rsquo; needs. CTP central procurement should be able to save money also for SAs. CT must have non-display low latency subscribers to commingle with display options for outgoing data delivery. One size does not fit all. Attempts to use a single &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; service to satisfy both is na&iuml;ve.</p>
<p>If a pre-trade equity CT is not using the same low latency methods and manner of delivery that Exchanges provide to the HFTs and SAs for incoming data to CTP, it essentially creates more data fragmentation (i.e., what you see on CT is not the same as what others see on Proprietary feeds). The US SEC recognizes the SIPs were not modernized alongside markets evolution and technologies development, therefore it requires the <i>&ldquo;same manner same methods&rdquo;</i> provision (see page 186 or footnotes 608 and 609 of <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/final/2020/34-90610.pdf">MDIR</a>).</p>
<p>I recommend forming an industrywide non-profit entity (NPE) and putting our technologies on top to bid for the CT. Broad representations in governance of the NPE (like NASD before it becomes FINRA) are substantially superior to rate setting by any one group.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Economic Outlook, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell: At Conversation With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, Dallas, Texas</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good afternoon. Thank you to the World Affairs Council, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, and the Dallas Regional Chamber for the kind invitation to be with you today. I will start with some brief comments on the economy and monetary policy.</p>
<p>Looking back, the U.S. economy has weathered a global pandemic and its aftermath and is now back to a good place. The economy has made significant progress toward our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. The labor market remains in solid condition. Inflation has eased substantially from its peak, and we believe it is on a sustainable path to our 2 percent goal. We are committed to maintaining our economy's strength by returning inflation to our goal while supporting maximum employment.</p>
<p><strong>Recent Economic Data</strong><br /><em>Economic growth</em><br />The recent performance of our economy has been remarkably good, by far the best of any major economy in the world. Economic output grew by more than 3 percent last year and is expanding at a stout 2.5 percent rate so far this year. Growth in consumer spending has remained strong, supported by increases in disposable income and solid household balance sheets. Business investment in equipment and intangibles has accelerated over the past year. In contrast, activity in the housing sector has been weak.</p>
<p>Improving supply conditions have supported this strong performance of the economy. The labor force has expanded rapidly, and productivity has grown faster over the past five years than its pace in the two decades before the pandemic, increasing the productive capacity of the economy and allowing rapid economic growth without overheating.</p>
<p><em>The labor market</em><br />The labor market remains in solid condition, having cooled off from the significantly overheated conditions of a couple of years ago, and is now by many metrics back to more normal levels that are consistent with our employment mandate. The number of job openings is now just slightly above the number of unemployed Americans seeking work. The rate at which workers quit their jobs is below the pre-pandemic pace, after touching historic highs two years ago. Wages are still increasing, but at a more sustainable pace. Hiring has slowed from earlier in the year. The most recent jobs report for October reflected significant effects from hurricanes and labor strikes, making it difficult to get a clear signal. Finally, at 4.1 percent, the unemployment rate is notably higher than a year ago but has flattened out in recent months and remains historically low.</p>
<p><em>Inflation</em><br />The labor market has cooled to the point where it is no longer a source of significant inflationary pressures. This cooling and the substantial improvement in broader supply conditions have brought inflation down significantly over the past two years from its mid-2022 peak above 7 percent. Progress on inflation has been broad based. Estimates based on the consumer price index and other data released this week indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in October and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent. Core measures of goods and services inflation, excluding housing, fell rapidly over the past two years and have returned to rates closer to those consistent with our goals. We expect that these rates will continue to fluctuate in their recent ranges. We are watching carefully to be sure that they do, however, just as we are closely tracking the gradual decline in housing services inflation, which has yet to fully normalize. Inflation is running much closer to our 2 percent longer-run goal, but it is not there yet. We are committed to finishing the job. With labor market conditions in rough balance and inflation expectations well anchored, I expect inflation to continue to come down toward our 2 percent objective, albeit on a sometimes-bumpy path.</p>
<p><strong>Monetary Policy</strong><br />Given progress toward our inflation goal and the cooling of labor market conditions, last week my Federal Open Market Committee colleagues and I took another step in reducing the degree of policy restraint by lowering our policy interest rate 1/4 percentage point.</p>
<p>We are confident that with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the economy and the labor market can be maintained, with inflation moving sustainably down to 2 percent. We see the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals as being roughly in balance, and we are attentive to the risks to both sides. We know that reducing policy restraint too quickly could hinder progress on inflation. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too slowly could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.</p>
<p>We are moving policy over time to a more neutral setting. But the path for getting there is not preset. In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, we will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The economy is not sending any signals that we need to be in a hurry to lower rates. The strength we are currently seeing in the economy gives us the ability to approach our decisions carefully. Ultimately, the path of the policy rate will depend on how the incoming data and the economic outlook evolve.</p>
<p>We remain resolute in our commitment to the dual mandate given to us by Congress: maximum employment and price stability. Our aim has been to return inflation to our objective without the kind of painful rise in unemployment that has often accompanied past efforts to bring down high inflation. That would be a highly desirable result for the communities, families, and businesses we serve. While the task is not complete, we have made a good deal of progress toward that outcome.</p>
<p>Thank you, and I look forward to our discussion.</p>

<title>The EBA Issues An Opinion In Response To The European Commission's Proposed Amendments To The EBA Final Draft Technical Standards On Supervisory Reporting And Pillar 3 Disclosures</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-eba-issues-an-opinion-in-response-to-the-european-commissions-proposed-amen/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published an Opinion on the amendments proposed by the European Commission to the EBA final draft Implementing Technical Standards (ITS)</span>&nbsp;<span>on public disclosures by institutions and supervisory reporting under the revised Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR3). The EBA acknowledges that the Commission&rsquo;s proposal provides some flexibility compared to the current version of the ITS and accepts it as an intermediate step. The Commission and the EBA will continue to work together to better articulate and further operationalise these ITS.</span></p>
<p>In the final package submitted by the EBA to the Commission this year, only the main body of the ITS on public disclosures and on supervisory reporting were meant to published in the EU Official Journal, while the templates and instructions were supposed to be accessible through the EBA website. The Commission proposed to re-include the templates in the normative package to be published in the Official Journal.</p>
<p>In the Opinion, the EBA acknowledges that the changes proposed by the Commission still maintain some of the flexibility originally envisaged and agreed on under the CRR3 mandates for the ITS. The EBA also notes that the original approach to keep both templates and instructions on the EBA website only, would be a preferred one, as it provides more flexibility in the development of such IT solutions.</p>
<p>The EBA accepts the European Commission&rsquo;s proposal, although it considers it as an intermediate step on the basis of which both the EBA and the European Commission will continue to work together to better articulate and further operationalise the ITS in accordance with the mandates under the CRR3.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<p>This Opinion is based on Article 15(1), fourth subparagraph, of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 (&lsquo;EBA Regulation&rsquo;), which requires the Authority to submit its response in the form of an opinion to amendments proposed by the European Commission.</p>
<p>On 20 June 2024, the EBA submitted to the European Commission, for adoption,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-updates-pillar-3-disclosure-framework-finalising-implementation-basel-iii-pillar-3-framework">the draft ITS on pillar 3 disclosures</a>. On 5 July 2024, the EBA submitted to the European Commission, for adoption, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-updates-supervisory-reporting-framework">final draft ITS on supervisory reporting</a>.</p>
<p>On 7 and 28 October 2024, the European Commission informed the EBA of its intention to endorse the draft ITSs with amendments and submitted a modified version of the ITSs.</p>

<h2><span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: normal;">Speech</span></h2>
<p>My Lord Mayor, Chancellor, ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>I am going to use my time this evening to talk about growth in the economy, why it matters, the current state of economic growth and its determinants, and what can happen in the future. These are, of course, very important issues.</p>
<p>I will start with some scene setting and context. Our decisions on monetary policy require us to assess the consequences for inflation of the pressure at the time on domestic economic resources. That pressure reflects the balance between demand and supply in goods and services, and in the labour market. We cannot just look at actual output and employment and their growth. We have to compare the actuals with a measure of potential supply, the productive potential of the economy. This way we can assess the utilisation of resources. But, we cannot directly observe productive potential. It has to be estimated, and from that we can produce an assessment of the degree of spare capacity in the economy.</p>
<p>This concept of potential supply capacity is crucial for the MPC in assessing inflationary pressures in the economy, but its overall significance goes well beyond that. As well as being the speed limit for how quickly the economy can grow without causing upward inflationary pressure, it also determines the growth of wealth in the long run, and is critical in many aspects of public policy, including fiscal policy.</p>
<p>So, what determines potential supply? In the shorter-term, it is the supply of labour and productivity (the efficiency of the use of the inputs). In the medium to longer-term, it is structural factors such as the size of the population, the rate of innovation, and changes in education and skills.</p>
<p>Enough theorising. I hope this much makes the point that growth in the economy matters.</p>
<p>Next questions are why does this matter now, and what has been going on? There are, almost needless to say, lots of facts and figures that could be put forward at this stage. I will stick to the almost bare minimum. Bottom line &ndash; it&rsquo;s not a good story.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk181970905"></a>I am going to give three figures for three time periods from Bank staff estimates: the average annual rate of growth of potential supply in the UK economy and the contribution to that growth rate of productivity and of labour supply. From 1990 to 2008, the average annual potential growth rate was 2.6%. Productivity contributed 2.2pp and labour supply 0.4pp. After the financial crisis, from 2009 to 2019, the potential growth rate fell to 1.3% pa, of which productivity contributed 0.3pp and labour supply 1.0pp. From 2020 &ndash; 2023 the potential growth rate fell further, to 0.7%, with productivity contributing 0.5pp and labour supply 0.2pp. Covid was clearly a major factor here.</p>
<p>Enough numbers. I think the point comes across. Potential supply growth has fallen since the financial crisis, with the main contributor to that fall being weaker productivity growth. Covid was then a major factor in causing a further fall. I think the issue now is not what Covid did at the time &ndash; it was clearly a huge shock to the economy. Rather, the more important question is whether and to what extent Covid has left a lasting impact on potential supply?</p>
<p>I am not going to spend any of the rest of my time seeking to diagnose what has happened to potential growth since the financial crisis. It is of course interesting and highly relevant, but time doesn&rsquo;t allow I&rsquo;m afraid.</p>
<p>Before moving to a series of questions designed to help to set out what we should do about this situation, there is at least one other big question which deserves a short answer at least. Is the UK alone in this situation? Not entirely.</p>
<p>The UK looks rather more like other parts of Europe than this continent does relative to the US. The US has a better story to tell.</p>
<p>I will frame the rest of my remarks around five questions, which I think are relevant to thinking about what we do to tackle the issue of potential supply. The answers will be short, a lot more could be said, but not this evening &ndash; you will I hope be pleased to hear that Lord Mayor.</p>
<p>The five questions are: why does investment matter and what can we do about it; is labour supply an issue; are we measuring things properly and if we did, could we rest easy; does the openness of the economy, and the world economy matter here; and will AI ride to the rescue?</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk181970939"></a>Why does investment in the economy matter, and what can we do about it? Productivity growth is linked to capital deepening &ndash; so it is linked to investment. The OECD produces data which show investment as a share of GDP. The UK has been almost continuously at the bottom of the G7 league table since the late 1990s. So, other things equal, the UK has a lower level of capital. Looking over the last ten years, business investment in the UK has been particularly weak by G7 standards.</p>
<p>We need to encourage business investment in the UK. Public investment is important as a foundation &ndash; we need better infrastructure and investment in education and the health services. So, Chancellor, I welcome the plans you have set out in the Budget, and the focus you have placed on public capital investment. But, to those who have pointed out that this will not &ndash; using the OBR&rsquo;s projections &ndash; raise the potential growth rate substantially, my response is &ldquo;of course not&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The OBR do project an increase in potential growth, but that needs to be accompanied by stronger business investment as you have set out. And that business investment will depend on quite a few things including good public infrastructure. I have attended and spoken at quite a few of these dinners Lord Mayor, and I well remember a number of your predecessors exhorting Chancellors of the day to build Cross-Rail, as it was then known. Well, it wasn&rsquo;t always easy and it took rather more time and money than expected, but I will say this &ndash; we have the Elizabeth Line now and it&rsquo;s really good. It&rsquo;s worth remembering this story.</p>
<p>The second big need for investment is the financial system being organised to supply capital. This has also been a regular subject at these dinners, not least because of the tireless and continuous advocacy of Sir Nicholas Lyons. Pension issues are important here. The UK pension system is too fragmented. Chancellor, thank you for the work that you and Emma Reynolds are leading here and you have set out this evening. It is, I am afraid, heavy lifting and a lot of it. You need and must have our support.</p>
<p>As I have said recently, as well as addressing the fragmentation of pension funds, we have to encourage investment in the real economy. Requiring or trying to compel investment by Asset Managers is not the answer. But, saying that cannot take the issue off the table, far from it. The City has an important role to play here in working to help to solve this issue.</p>
<p>Next question: is labour supply an issue? Yes. It is along with productivity the main determinant of potential supply. In the medium to long-term, the dominant influence here is likely to be the ageing population. The UK is very far from being alone in this respect. There are shorter term trends and determinants as well in terms of labour supply &ndash; I will come to these in a moment.</p>
<p>The ageing population does mean the tide is running against us on labour supply. It makes the productivity and investment issue all the more important. I will also say this: when we think about broad policy on labour supply, the economic arguments must feature in the debate.</p>
<p>Third question: are we measuring things properly and does it matter? Oh no you are thinking, he&rsquo;s going to go on about data again. Don&rsquo;t worry &ndash; I am going to be brief. We probably are not measuring things properly &ndash; to some degree we never do or can, but we can&rsquo;t fall back on measurement and assume the issue away. There are three main areas of measurement, and all of them have issues: the overall size of the economy; the amount of investment; and the labour force.</p>
<p>The economy is probably bigger than we think it is. Why? Because we are not very good at measuring intangibles, and these are the new economy. The ONS is going to include the value of data as an asset in the overall size of GDP in the next few years. That makes sense. It&rsquo;s probably worth a percent or two on GDP.</p>
<p>Likewise on investment, we don&rsquo;t measure investment in intangibles well, and this is a growth area &ndash; think about IT. But, there is little reason I&rsquo;m afraid to think this will vault the UK up the league table of investment, more likely all boats get lifted a bit.</p>
<p>And finally, the labour force. Oh dear. The travails of the Labour Force Survey are quite well known. It is a substantial problem &ndash; and not just for monetary policy &ndash; when we don&rsquo;t know how many people are participating in the economy. It would help if across the country we were better at answering the phone when the ONS call up. I do struggle to explain when my fellow Governors ask me why the British are particularly bad at this. The Bank, alongside other users, including the Treasury, continue to engage with the ONS on efforts to tackle these problems and improve the quality of UK labour market data.</p>
<p>So, measurement is an issue, but it doesn&rsquo;t take away the need to raise potential supply in the economy.</p>
<p>Question four: does the openness of the economy matter for potential supply? Yes. Openness to trade in goods and services affects productivity by facilitating competition, innovation and specialisation. There is also a strong positive relationship between openness to trade and foreign direct investment and its productivity. We can thank Adam Smith and David Ricardo for some of the earliest insights on this area.</p>
<p>Now, as I have said many times, as a public official I take no position on Brexit per se. That&rsquo;s important. But I do have to point out consequences. The changing trading relationship with the EU has weighed on the level of potential supply. The impact on trade seems to be more in goods than services, that is not particularly surprising to my mind. But it underlines why we must be alert to and welcome opportunities to rebuild relations while respecting the decision of the British people.</p>
<p>But, we should not focus just on the effects of Brexit. The picture is now clouded by the impact of geopolitical shocks and the broader fragmentation of the world economy. I will own up to being an old fashioned free trader at heart. It&rsquo;s a British characteristic I like to think. My point is this: amidst the important need to be alert to threats to economic security, let&rsquo;s please remember the importance of openness. Openness is an important determinant of productivity. There is nothing new about saying this, just to be clear.</p>
<p>Last question: will AI ride to the rescue and solve the low level of potential supply? I&rsquo;m not going to give another speech now on AI, so this will be brief and high level. AI has the clear potential to become general purpose technology. In other words, it can enable widespread innovation across many parts of the economy. Previous examples of such general purpose technology were the steam engine and electricity.</p>
<p>Sadly, not long ago the British economic historian Nick Crafts passed away. I knew Nick forty years ago before I became a central banker. One of the things he taught us was that general purpose technologies take longer to spread into the economy and the productivity data than we assume they will. It was nearly forty years for electricity. I don&rsquo;t think it will be that long for AI, but Nick&rsquo;s point remains true. We are mostly experimenting with AI at the moment. There are strong grounds for optimism and of course risks to deal with, but AI isn&rsquo;t an immediate magic solution. It has lots of potential, and we must stick with it.</p>
<p>To conclude, Lord Mayor. Potential supply and growth matter a lot. We don&rsquo;t have a good recent inheritance, so this is a big issue that needs our attention. Investment and capital formation, and how to increase it matter. So does labour supply in the face of an ageing population and an immediate question of participation. We can and should measure things better and we could try answering the phone to the ONS. We must do what we sensibly can to preserve safe openness of the economy. AI has a lot of potential to change the picture, but don&rsquo;t expect that change to come very quickly. These are very important issues.</p>
<p>Now I have one thing left to say.</p>
<p>[TOAST] The Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress</p>
<p>I would like to thank Sandra Batten, Sarah Breeden, Swati Dhingra, Megan Greene, Karen Jude, Josh Martin, Katie Martin, Mette Nielsen, Rhys Phillips, Dave Ramsden, Martin Seneca, Dan Steel, James Talbot and Sam Woods for their help in the preparation of these remarks.</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, is launching a data collection exercise together with the national competent authorities (NCAs), on costs linked to investments in AIFs and UCITS.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify">ESMA with the NCAs has designed a two-stage data collection involving both manufacturers and distributors of investment funds.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Information requested&nbsp;<em>from manufacturers</em>&nbsp;will provide an indication on the different costs charged for the management of the investment funds.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Information requested&nbsp;<em>from distributors</em>&nbsp;(i.e., investment firms, independent financial advisors, neo-brokers) will inform on the fees paid directly by investors to distributors.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text-align-justify">This initiative contributes to shedding light on pricing practices in a key part of the EU financial markets, information that has until now not been accessible to retail investors and supervisory authorities. Greater transparency will allow investors to know more about the features of the products that are offered to them and will further support the development of a competitive market for UCITS and AIFs.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">The data collection follows the Level 1 mandate received from the European Commission under the UCITSD/AIFMD review.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span>Next steps</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify">A report based on these data will be submitted to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission in October 2025. This will also be part of an enhanced 2025 ESMA market report on costs and performance of EU retail investment products.</p>

<title>UK Chancellor Fires Up Financial Services Sector To Drive Growth - Chancellor To Announce Package Of Reforms To Ensure The UK’s Status As A Global Powerhouse For Financial Services In Her First Mansion House Speech</title>

<div class="call-to-action">
<ul>
<li>Reeves to say regulatory changes post-financial crisis created a system which sought to eliminate risk taking &lsquo;that has gone too far&rsquo; and led to unintended consequences.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Growth focused remit letters sent to regulators and first-ever Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness Strategy to be published.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The Chancellor will announce a package of reforms to drive growth and competitiveness in financial services, as she argues that regulatory changes to eliminate risk after the financial crisis have &lsquo;gone too far&rsquo; and led to unintended consequences. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In her first Mansion House speech as Chancellor, Rachel Reeves will say that the UK&rsquo;s status as a global financial centre cannot be taken for granted. &nbsp;</p>
<p>She will argue that, while the UK will always uphold high standards, a system has been created which seeks to eliminate risk taking and holds back economic growth.&nbsp;&ldquo;The UK has been regulating for risk, but not regulating for growth,&rdquo; she will say.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chancellor will outline a plan to rebalance the system, setting the financial services sector up to innovate, grow and seize the opportunities for investment in businesses, infrastructure and clean energy across Britain.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will include setting new growth-focused remits for financial service regulators, the publication next year of the first ever Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness Strategy and creating pension mega funds to boost investment so that ordinary people benefit from growth.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking in the City of London, the Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves will say:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before we came into government, I was clear that the financial services sector must play a central part in our economic vision and our plan for economic growth. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Because I know that this sector is the crown jewel in our economy. It employs 1.2m people, from London to Edinburgh, and from Manchester to Belfast. It is one of the country&rsquo;s largest and most productive sectors, accounting for 9% of our economic output. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And it is a global success story: we are the second largest exporter of financial services in the G7.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="last-child">But we cannot take the UK&rsquo;s status as a global financial centre for granted. In a highly competitive world we need to earn that status and we need to work to keep it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>She will add:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>While it was right that successive governments made regulatory changes after the Global Financial Crisis, to ensure that regulation kept pace with the global economy of the time, it is important that we learn the lessons of the past.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="last-child">These changes have resulted in a system which sought to eliminate risk taking. That has gone too far and, in places, it has had unintended consequences which we must now address.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>She will conclude by saying:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The changes I have set out today will drive growth and competitiveness through investment and through reform. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A long-term strategy to harness the strengths of the financial services sector: making the UK a global leader in sustainable finance, developing the right approach to redress to reduce uncertainty, reinvigorating our capital markets by unlocking private investment through our pension funds, and reforming our approach to regulation to make it more dynamic and more competitive.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="last-child">Taken together, these measures represent the most pro-growth financial services package since the financial crisis.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="reform-to-unlock-innovation-and-growth">Reform to unlock innovation and growth&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>
<p>While the UK&rsquo;s regulatory model for financial services is respected around the world, reform is needed to unlock innovation, drive more investment and deliver sustainable economic growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>High regulatory standards will be maintained but parts of the regulatory system will be rebalanced to drive economic growth and competitiveness. The Chancellor has written to the Financial Conduct Authority, Prudential Regulation Committee, Financial Policy Committee and Payment Systems Regulator to ensure a greater focus on supporting economic growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Financial Ombudsman Service framework will also be modernised so that it continues to play a vital role for consumers to get redress while giving clearer expectations around its decisions for consumers and for financial services firms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The government will also consult on replacing the current Certification Regime, which applies to staff below senior management level, with a more proportionate approach that reduces costs so that businesses are freed up to focus on growth. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>To combat the scourge of fraud that cost UK consumers almost &pound;8.3 billion last year alone and steals money away from investment and lending by the financial services sector, a coordinated effort across sectors, law enforcement and government is needed. The Chancellor, Home Secretary and Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology have therefore written to the tech and telecommunication sectors calling for them to go further and faster in reducing the scale of fraud taking place on their platforms and networks &ndash; with an update on progress requested by March 2025 ahead of an expanded fraud strategy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further action is being taken to drive innovation in payments with the publication of a National Payments Vision, and reinvigorate the UK&rsquo;s capital markets by committing to legislate to establish PISCES by May 2025 - a world-first regulated market for trading private company shares where transfers will be exempted from stamp duty taxes on shares.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The government is launching a pilot to deliver a Digital Gilt Instrument, using distributed ledger technology (DLT), demonstrating the government&rsquo;s commitment to innovation in the financial services sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The government is also consulting on introducing a new framework for UK-based captive insurance companies to make the UK insurance market a more attractive hub for businesses seeking efficient risk solutions.</p>
<h4 id="stability--confidence-to-invest">Stability &ndash; confidence to invest&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Building on the Budget - which fixed the foundations of the economy by repairing the public finances and bolstered economic and fiscal stability &ndash; the Chancellor will set out a clear path for growth in the financial services sector.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The government will publish the first ever Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness Strategy in the Spring to deliver long-term certainty and cement the sector&rsquo;s place at the heart of the government&rsquo;s 10-year modern Industrial Strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The government will propose focusing on five priority growth opportunities in financial services to take advantage of the UK&rsquo;s existing strengths and maximise the potential for growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>These will be FinTech, sustainable finance, asset management and wholesale services, insurance and reinsurance, and capital markets. A Call for Evidence will be published alongside the announcement to ensure that industry voices are at the heart of designing the new Strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Strategy will reflect the fact that the success of the financial services sector is built on strong ties with international partners. This means strengthening partnerships with established and fast-growing financial centres will be a cornerstone of the government&rsquo;s approach to financial services: critical to attracting foreign investment and delivering economic benefits for the UK.</p>
<h4 id="investment-through-financial-services">Investment through financial services&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>
<p>To deliver more investment in businesses, infrastructure and clean energy, the Chancellor will also announce bold reforms to the pension system and lay the foundations for a world-leading sustainable finance regulatory regime.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two consultations will be published ahead of the Pension Schemes Bill in the Spring to merge defined contribution pension schemes and the Local Government Pension Scheme in England and Wales into megafunds &ndash; mirroring the pensions landscape in Australia and Canada. This, along with reforms to ensure better value from these pension schemes, could unlock around &pound;80 billion new investment in businesses and infrastructure, while boosting savers&rsquo; pension pots.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chancellor will announce that the British Growth Partnership has secured the support of two UK pension funds for its future launch. Aegon UK &ndash; as a substantial cornerstone investor &ndash; and NatWest Cushon, who have combined assets worth over &pound;219 billion, have both agreed to work with the British Business Bank with a view to investing in the UK growth companies of the future, subject to commercial and regulatory steps and, where appropriate, agreement from the Trustees. She is also expected to announce that, alongside Phoenix Group, the British Business Bank has completed its LIFTS investment in Schroders Capital, to create a new &pound;500 million investment vehicle to invest in UK science and technology. The government expects 20% of the LIFTS capital to be invested into life sciences.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chancellor will also set out plans to mobilise trillions of pounds of private capital to support clean energy and growth as part of the UK&rsquo;s efforts to reclaims its position as a global leader in climate change. This follows action at the International Investment Summit and Budget to unlock investment, including &pound;27.8 billion of capitalisation for the National Wealth Fund, which is expected to mobilise over &pound;70 billion of private investment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>To deliver a world-leading sustainable finance framework, the Treasury will publish draft legislation to boost investor confidence in sustainable companies by regulating ESG ratings providers, publish a consultation on the value case for a UK Green Taxonomy, commit to consult on economically significant companies disclosing information using future UK Sustainability Reporting Standards and launch a set of integrity principles for voluntary carbon and nature markets ahead of a consultation in the new year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>To underpin continued UK leadership on transition finance, the government is delivering one of the key recommendations of the Transition Finance Market Review by co-launching the Transition Finance Council with the City of London Corporation. The government will also consult in the first half of next year on how best to take forward the manifesto commitment on transition plans in support of its ambition to become the global hub for transition finance -&nbsp; ensuring the UK&rsquo;s regulatory framework is growth-focused, internationally competitive and maintains the UK&rsquo;s status as a global financial hub. It has also emphasised the transition to net zero in the government&rsquo;s economic strategy within the remit of the Bank of England&rsquo;s Monetary Policy Committee, and reinstated sustainable finance as an area the Financial Policy Committee should support as part of its secondary objective.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>These announcements come alongside COP29&rsquo;s &lsquo;Finance, Investment, and Trade Day&rsquo; currently underway in Baku, Azerbaijan. Representing HM Treasury at COP29, Growth Minister Lord Spencer Livermore laid out the UK&rsquo;s commitment to making the UK the sustainable finance capital of the world, mobilise climate finance from a range of sources and reform the global financial system so it delivers better on climate change.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The government recognises the invaluable role of the mutual and co-operative sector in driving inclusive growth across the UK. It is therefore announcing a package to help unlock the full potential of the sector. This includes publishing a call for evidence on reform to credit union common bonds in Great Britain, writing to the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority asking them to produce a report on the mutuals landscape in 2025, and welcoming the establishment of an industry-led Mutual and Co-operative Business Council.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The government has already laid legislation to support modernisations to the Building Societies Act 1986 and continued funding the Law Commission to conduct reviews considering how the laws governing co-operatives, community benefit societies, mutual insurers, and friendly societies can be modernised.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chancellor will also announce an upcoming Financial Conduct Authority consultation to help households make better-informed decisions about their finances, as part of the government and regulator&rsquo;s joint Advice Guidance Boundary Review.</p>
<h4 id="stakeholder-reaction-to-the-chancellors-mansion-house-package">Stakeholder reaction to the Chancellor&rsquo;s Mansion House package</h4>
<p>David Postings, Chief Executive of UK Finance said:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="last-child">The Chancellor has set out a positive vision for financial services, which are a UK success story and vital to our economy. I strongly welcome her support for the sector, coupled with the fact that she is addressing how we can best balance risk and consumer protection to help support economic growth. Key to this is the regulatory environment, with the new remit letters rightly stressing the importance of growth and competitiveness in regulators&rsquo; work. The Chancellor has listened to industry and is delivering across a range of areas we have called for action on, including a digital gilt, tackling payment fraud, reforming the Financial Ombudsman Service, supporting green finance, and the National Payments Vision. I look forward to continuing to work closely with her and the government to ensure the UK retains a strong and globally competitive financial services sector.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>BVCA Chief Executive Michael Moore said:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The private capital industry warmly welcomes the decisive action taken by government to reform our pensions system to boost investment and deliver growth to the UK economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="last-child">Creating greater opportunity for investment by pension funds into private capital could have a transformational impact on the UK&rsquo;s most promising businesses whilst delivering strong returns for pension savers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Richard Oldfield, Group CEO Schroders said:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="last-child">We have all the building blocks we need to generate growth in the UK. We have great, innovative companies; we have the capital, and we have the expertise and a world class capital market to link the two. What we need now is an injection of optimism and a healthier attitude to taking risk in the pursuit of reward.&nbsp;It is great to see the government putting sensible risk taking back at the centre of our economy. Whether that&rsquo;s on green finance, infrastructure, science or tech; firms like Schroders working in partnership with pension schemes, regulators and the government can unlock the potential of the UK for the benefit of all of us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>James Alexander, CEO, UKSIF said:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="last-child">We welcome the new Chancellor&rsquo;s prioritisation of sustainable finance in her first Mansion House speech. We are pleased to see this ambitious suite of measures including further progress on transition plans, harmonisation with international standards, and carbon market integrity. If delivered, these measures could position the UK as a world-leading centre for sustainable finance.</p>

<title>LME Clear Proposes Measures To Further Bolster Market Resilience</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/lme-clear-proposes-measures-to-further-bolster-market-resilience/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/lme-clear-proposes-measures-to-further-bolster-market-resilience/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>LME Clear has today issued a consultation proposing a range of measures aimed to further bolster the resilience, transparency and fairness of its markets. The proposals include an increase to the minimum net capital requirement for members and the introduction of a default fund mutualisation limit and anti-procyclicality control.</p>
<p>Michael Carty, LME Clear CEO commented: &ldquo;Last year we committed to an ambitious programme of change to strengthen our markets, and these are the latest set of proposals designed to increase transparency, predictability and overall resilience for clearing members and market participants more broadly. I would like to thank members for their collaboration in the process so far and look forward to working together as we continue to advance our business and further enhance the health and vibrancy of our markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>LME Clear has undertaken a review of its membership terms and proposes to enhance credit-related requirements by increasing clearing members&rsquo; minimum net capital requirement from US$10 million to US$30 million. This proposal, which has been discussed with the relevant committees and advisory groups, would better align member capital requirements with those of peer CCPs and reassure market stakeholders of the resilience of LME Clear markets.</p>
<p>Following a comprehensive review of its default fund methodology, LME Clear is also proposing to move further towards a &ldquo;defaulter pays&rdquo; model and introduce an upper limit to the default fund, which would restrict the size of the mutualised component of the pre-funded resources paid by clearing members. This would ensure that the proportion of mutualised risk is fairly and more stably correlated with unmutualised risk, which is calculated by LME Clear as initial margin or additional margin. The limit would also be calculated in accordance with the published default fund methodology, providing transparency and determinism to the calculation process.</p>
<p>Additionally, LME Clear has proposed to introduce an anti-procyclicality control to improve the stability of the default fund. This would limit the percentage by which the default fund can fall in any one re-calculation and would work with the default fund limit to ensure member contributions are more stable and predictable.</p>
<p>The consultation also proposes a minor LME rulebook revision related to the refinement of Category 5 membership as well as a number of technical and administrative changes to the LME Clear rules and procedures.</p>
<p>The consultation invites feedback from all stakeholders by 16 December 2024.</p>

<p><br /><strong>Performance drivers of private2000 and Manufacturing sector</strong><br /><br /><span>The private2000 index spans a diverse range of industries, resulting in various revenue models and business activities. For example, service-oriented companies led the private2000&reg; VW US$ index's performance, contributing approximately 70% to the 0.72% monthly return in September 2024, demonstrating the private equity market's expansion into sectors with predictable, recurring revenue streams.</span><br /><br /><span>In comparison, manufacturing companies are heavily influenced by traditional production-based revenue models, and rely on value creation through physical goods, which are the primary drivers of their returns in Sep 2024. While this sector underperformed relative to the private2000 in September, its five-year annualized return of 9.79% demonstrates a solid potential for long-term growth.</span><br /><br /><span>On a risk-adjusted basis, the Manufacturing sector aligns with the market index (Sharpe ratio: 0.52 vs. 0.54). Investors with exposure to the manufacturing sector and an appetite for higher returns will need to ensure that their portfolio companies are well-positioned to capitalize on positive trends, such as increased demand for automation and robotics, to be rewarded for assuming higher risk.</span><br /><br /><span>This comparison between the global market index represented by the private2000 and the index that represents the manufacturing sector underlines the importance of granularity of information as far as capturing the market dynamics and investment valuations in private markets is concerned. This granularity often has a negative trade-off, which is the low number of observations at relevant industry or activity levels. By evaluating the values and performance of more than 80,000 assets each month for all segments representing the sector, customer and business models of the private asset market, Scientific Infra &amp; Private Assets is able to meet the dual requirement of information relevance and robustness.</span><br /><br /><span>Technical information: privateMetrics market indices and benchmarks are asset-level private equity indices that reflect the dynamics of private markets with a beta of 1. They are built by repricing thousands of private companies each month using the latest private market transactions to calibrate an asset pricing model. These market indices are different from manager indices, the contributions to which solely reflect their choices for managing and valuing their investments.</span><br /><br /><span>Links to key documents:</span></p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s&nbsp;<strong>Final Report on Voluntary Carbon Markets</strong>&nbsp;outlines a comprehensive set of 21 Good Practices aimed at ensuring financial integrity in VCMs, which could be applicable across all carbon credit markets.</p>
<p>In addition, IOSCO and the World Bank have today published a&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iosco.org%2Flibrary%2Fpubdocs%2Fpdf%2FIOSCOPD774-note.pdf&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cmailing-lists%40iosco.org%7Cbb44b613095e4c6dc5d508dd04967504%7Cbcc6c66cdb3b48328af2cc363a097444%7C0%7C0%7C638671766500890082%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=iqWqLdeUjDdFMdSfKZoawvF%2FNWE6XE5CAO%2FWYxjEWB4%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">policy note</a>&nbsp;outlining high-level elements for promoting financial integrity in carbon markets generally, using the occasion to announce a new partnership in 2025.

<p>Presenting the Final Report at COP29,&nbsp;<strong>Jean-Paul Servais</strong>, Chair of the IOSCO Board and Chairman of the Belgian Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA) said:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s report is the result of meaningful engagement with a diverse range of stakeholders, from regulators to market participants and beyond. Their insights have been invaluable in shaping our work on voluntary carbon markets over the past three years with a view to promote financial integrity in voluntary carbon markets.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Chair Servais further emphasized the importance of a collaborative approach when it comes to bringing financial integrity to carbon markets.&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Our partnership with the World Bank will empower jurisdictions worldwide in their efforts to establish robust, transparent, and effective carbon markets&rdquo;</em>, he said.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Growing Voluntary Carbon Markets could contribute much more to financing investments in mitigating climate change,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;said&nbsp;<strong>Jean Pesme,</strong>&nbsp;World Bank Director, Finance.&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;We look forward to working with IOSCO to support countries in implementing the guidelines in the policy note published today, which will help ensure carbon markets function with financial integrity, under sound regulation and supervision, and with built-in safeguards against fraud.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong>IOSCO&rsquo;s 21 Good Practices will support sound market structures and enhance financial integrity in VCMs, facilitating orderly and transparent trading of carbon credits.</strong></p>
<p>IOSCO&rsquo;s 21 Good Practices have three overarching objectives:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>To support the establishment of sound market structures and appropriate architecture for custody, trading, and settlement.</li>
<li>To promote transparency to foster information symmetry and ensure orderly and fair trading; and</li>
<li>To advocate for adequate market conduct and behaviour &ndash; to prevent fraud, market abuse, insider dealing and scams.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Rodrigo Buenaventura</strong>, Chair of IOSCO&rsquo;s Sustainable Finance Task Force (STF) and Chairman of the Spain CNMV, said:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Financial and market integrity is an essential component to the sound functioning of carbon markets. Today&rsquo;s Good Practices seek to be both practical and effective in fostering transparency, trust and integrity in voluntary carbon markets&rdquo;</em>.</p>
<p>The 21 Good Practices address five key principles of traditional financial market regulation, offering guidance for jurisdictions and market participants in developing and operating voluntary carbon markets:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Clear and effective regulatory frameworks</strong>&nbsp;that provide legal certainty and proportional oversight;</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced transparency</strong>&nbsp;in carbon credit creation, trading and use;</li>
<li><strong>Strong governance standards, risk management frameworks, and policies to address conflicts of interest within the carbon credit ecosystem;</strong></li>
<li><strong>Comprehensive market surveillance</strong>&nbsp;to detect and prevent fraud, abuse, and disruptive behaviours, and;</li>
<li><strong>Open, fair, and accessible trading for all participants, and standardization</strong>&nbsp;to boost market liquidity.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Verena Ross</strong>, co-Chair of IOSCO&rsquo;s STF Carbon Markets Workstream and Chair of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), said:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Establishing financial integrity and transparency within voluntary carbon markets is crucial for their credibility and impact. Our Good Practices build on the experience of securities markets regulators with the aim to empower market participants to engage confidently in this important sector in the future&rdquo;</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Rostin Behnam</strong>, IOSCO Vice-Chairman and co-Chair of the STF Carbon Markets Workstream, and Chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (U.S. CFTC), said:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;We developed the Good Practices in this report to create a roadmap for regulatory alignment, financial market integrity, and transparency. If taken onboard by regulators, relevant authorities, and market participants, these Good Practices can help to further enhance the utility of voluntary carbon markets while reflecting foundational characteristics of well-established and sound financial markets.&rdquo;</em></p>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fsb-assesses-the-financial-stability-implications-of-artificial-intelligence/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><span>Report notes that the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) offers several benefits but may also amplify certain financial sector vulnerabilities, such as third-party dependencies, market correlations, cyber risk and model risk, potentially increasing systemic risk.</span></li>
<li><span>While existing financial policy frameworks address many of the vulnerabilities associated with use of AI by financial institutions, more work may be needed to ensure that these frameworks are sufficiently comprehensive.</span></li>
<li><span>Report calls for financial authorities to enhance monitoring of AI developments, assess whether financial policy frameworks are adequate,&nbsp;</span><span>and enhance their regulatory and supervisory capabilities including by using AI-powered tools.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) published today&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/11/the-financial-stability-implications-of-artificial-intelligence/">The Financial Stability Implications of Artificial Intelligence</a>, a report outlining recent developments in the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in finance and their potential implications for financial stability.</p>
<p>Widespread adoption and more diverse use cases of AI have prompted the FSB to revisit its 2017 report on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2017/11/artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-in-financial-service/">AI and machine learning in financial services</a>. Financial firms currently use AI mainly to enhance internal operations and improve regulatory compliance, but generative AI (GenAI) and large language models have given rise to new use cases, such as document summarisation, information retrieval, and code generation. While many financial institutions appear to be taking a cautious approach to using GenAI, interest remains high and the technology&rsquo;s accessibility could facilitate more rapid integration in financial services.</p>
<p>Financial authorities are also using AI for more efficient supervision. The fast pace of innovation and AI integration in financial services, along with limited data on AI usage, poses challenges for monitoring vulnerabilities and potential financial stability implications.</p>
<p>The report notes that AI offers benefits from improved operational efficiency, regulatory compliance, personalised financial products and advanced data analytics. However, AI may also amplify certain financial sector vulnerabilities and thereby pose risks to financial stability.</p>
<p>Several AI-related vulnerabilities stand out for their potential to increase systemic risk. These include: (i) third-party dependencies and service provider concentration; (ii) market correlations; (iii) cyber risks; and (iv) model risk, data quality and governance. In addition, GenAI could increase financial fraud and disinformation in financial markets. Misaligned AI systems that are not calibrated to operate within legal, regulatory, and ethical boundaries can also engage in behaviour that harms financial stability. And from a longer-term perspective, AI uptake could drive changes in market structure, macroeconomic conditions and energy use that may have implications for financial markets and institutions.</p>
<p>The report notes that existing regulatory and supervisory frameworks address many of the vulnerabilities associated with AI adoption. However, more work may be needed to ensure that these frameworks are sufficiently comprehensive. To this end, the report calls on the FSB, standard-setting bodies and national authorities to: (i) consider how to address data and information gaps to better monitor AI adoption and assess the related financial stability implications; (ii) assess whether current financial policy frameworks are sufficient to address AI-related vulnerabilities both at domestic and international level; and (iii) enhance regulatory and supervisory capabilities, for example by sharing information and good practices across border and sectors as well as leveraging AI-powered tools.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h2>
<p>This report revisits the 2017 FSB report on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2017/11/artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-in-financial-service/">AI and machine learning in financial services</a>&nbsp;by taking stock of recent advancements, current use cases in the financial sector and drivers of adoption, as well as new potential benefits and AI-related financial sector vulnerabilities. The report draws on the experience and initiatives of FSB member jurisdictions, existing literature, and stakeholder outreach events including an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/09/oecd-fsb-roundtable-on-artificial-intelligence-ai-in-finance-summary-of-key-findings/">OECD-FSB joint AI roundtable</a>.</p>
<p>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. The FSB also conducts outreach with approximately 70 other jurisdictions through its six Regional Consultative Groups.</p>
<p>The FSB is chaired by Klaas Knot, President of De Nederlandsche Bank. The FSB Secretariat is located in Basel, Switzerland and hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>

<ul>
<li>Evaluates progress in EU electricity market integration across all market time periods (forward, day-ahead, intraday).</li>
<li>Highlights challenges in integrating balancing markets, developing forward markets, and the slow progress in implementing methodologies that define operations in day-ahead and intraday markets.</li>
<li>Outlines ACER's recommendations and ongoing efforts to improve electricity market efficiency, infrastructure investment and usage, and enhance flexibility through demand response.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Check out ACER&rsquo;s new interactive electricity dashboards</span></p>
<p>For the first time, this annual monitoring report is accompanied by&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsPBlAFWFFcUkwIVVIFHVZfVAQdCg8EVRpUVwAPVQZTVAYHBVIdAFxbA1hXBVEdAw9TDh0GCVICGlddUFUZCgYFDghXCVZTAVAFRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">three separate dashboards</a>&nbsp;on key market indicators such as prices and churn rates (a liquidity metric), balancing data (e.g., volumes, prices and cross border exchanges of balancing services) and data on long-term transmission rights (including risk premia).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the key findings?</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>In March 2024,&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsPBwEGUlMFVUxYAwVWHVYPBQAdUF0FBBoAVwRVVQAMAAMABAkdAFxbA1hXBVEdAw9TDh0GCVICGlddUFUZCgYFDghXCVZTAVAFRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ACER reported</a>&nbsp;frequent occurrences of negative electricity prices in the EU. In June 2024,&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsFUlADUAMBBUwKUwYBHVYNAQMdU10EVRpTUQdSUQVQAAJQB1IdAFxbA1hXBVEdAw9TDh0GCVICGlddUFUZCgYFDghXCVZTAVAFRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">the Agency warned</a>&nbsp;of rising congestion management costs in the EU power grid, which reached &euro;4 billion in 2023. ACER emphasised the importance of increased cross-zonal trading capacity.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s report by ACER finds that:</p>
<ul>
<li>With the expansion of renewable energy, the role of fossil fuels in electricity systems is diminishing. The new generation mix is marked by a 10% rise in hours of mostly non-responsive generation (generation that does not adapt to short-term changes in demand) in 2023. ACER stresses the need to enhance power system flexibility for an efficient energy transition.</li>
<li>However, delays in implementing market design changes hinder flexibility. 27% of market design rules (methodologies, terms, and conditions) are delayed in terms of implementation.</li>
<li>Balancing market integration remains limited in 2023. The Transmission System Operators (TSOs) of only four Member States have joined the balancing platforms which went live in 2022. ACER encourages more TSOs to join the balancing energy platforms, highlighting that increased participation can expand cross-zonal exchanges and reduce occurrences of high electricity balancing prices.</li>
<li>Current electricity forward markets offer investors visibility on future electricity prices for only up to one year.&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtQVVMDVgVWWkxcVFECHVZcAgMdC1hTVRoHVAcPBgQDA1RSAgUdAFxbA1hXBVEdAw9TDh0GCVICGlddUFUZCgYFDghXCVZTAVAFRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ACER has identified shortcomings</a>&nbsp;in regulatory measures aimed at addressing this challenge and proposed improvements.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are ACER&rsquo;s recommendations?</span></p>
<p>The report contains a suite of recommendations. In short, ACER:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recommends taking a proactive approach to further integrate power markets and strengthen connections.</li>
<li>Recommends an efficiency-first approach for both power infrastructure investments and usage, ensuring that every installed megawatt is fully used.</li>
<li>Stresses that improving long-term investment structures and ensuring better market integration will drive Europe's energy transition and economic growth.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What&rsquo;s next?</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p>
<p>ACER will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publish a new report on power infrastructure investment in December 2024.</li>
<li>Review the rules (terms, conditions and methodologies) that define market operations starting in 2025.</li>
<li>Propose a network code on demand-side flexibility to the European Commission by March 2025.</li>
<li>Continue to monitor power TSOs' involvement in balancing platforms.</li>
</ul>
<p>These steps aim to enhance market efficiency and contribute to a resilient, flexible electricity infrastructure that can support Europe&rsquo;s energy transition and long-term economic stability.</p>
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtQUAQDA1EBUEwNBwcBHVZaVwMdC1hQURpRB1EFDVEBAwZQBlIdAFxbA1hXBVEdAw9TDh0GCVICGlddUFUZCgYFDghXCVZTAVAFRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Read more.</a></p>

<title>Singapore’s Cyber Security Agency Award Veracity Trust Network S$1 Million Grant To Develop And Deliver AI-Powered Bot Detection - Veracity Trust Network Will Collaborate With The Cybersecurity Agency Of Singapore And A Global eCommerce Giant In The Fight Against Cyber Crime</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/singapores-cyber-security-agency-award-veracity-trust-network-s1-million-grant/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/singapores-cyber-security-agency-award-veracity-trust-network-s1-million-grant/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Veracity Trust Network (Veracity) has been awarded the Cybersecurity Co-Innovation and Development Fund (CCDF) CyberCall grant of S$1 million by the Cyber Security Agency Singapore (CSA). The grant will be used to develop and deliver advanced malicious bot detection in collaboration with one of world&rsquo;s largest fashion retailers. Veracity was selected based on its &lsquo;Beyond the Edge&rsquo; technology that utilises real-time behavioural analysis to detect and block even the most complex bots.</span></p>
<p><span>Veracity&rsquo;s data shows that approximately 30% of all website visits are malicious bots looking to do harm. The grant will be used to develop and deliver the next generation of this technology, which will provide advanced malicious bot detection tailored to the eCommerce company&rsquo;s operations. This is a large and growing menace as these bots seek to steal data, set up fake accounts, disrupt inventory, plant ransomware, and so on. Veracity was selected based on the efficacy of its platform that utilises real-time behavioural analysis to detect and block even the most complex bots.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;The problem of malicious bots is serious and getting worse as technology advances. It&rsquo;s a major issue that is growing in scale, sophistication and damage, with serious negative impact on all online organisations. In general, the eCommerce industry has been losing this particular arms race. Veracity was created to try to break the cycle and get ahead of malicious actors. This has clearly been recognised by the CSA, and we are honoured to have been selected by them,&rdquo; said Nigel Bridges, Group CEO, Veracity Trust Network.</span></p>
<p><span>The CCDF&rsquo;s CyberCall grant encourages collaborations between cybersecurity companies and end-users by facilitating the matching of industry proposals to end-user challenges and supports the co-development of innovative cybersecurity solutions in Singapore.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Veracity group CTO Stewart Boutcher, who has overall responsibility for the APAC region, was presented the Cybercall Innovator award by David Koh, Commissioner of Cybersecurity &amp; Chief Executive of CSA who, in his introduction to the awards commented "Innovative Cybersecurity companies are vital to a thriving Cybersecurity ecosystem. My warmest&nbsp;</span><span>congratulations</span><span>&nbsp;to the winners of the 2023 Cybercall: all these companies are pushing the boundaries of cybersecurity innovation."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Stewart, who is primarily tasked with leading the project for Veracity, commented: &ldquo;Working on the CyberCall project with CSA has been critical to support our innovative approach in using AI and machine learning to detect and prevent even the most sophisticated human-spoofing bots for a common good. Being at the heart of the Singaporean cybersecurity ecosystem will aid our continued goal to ensure we stay ahead of the bad actors that produce these malicious bots.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Veracity &lsquo;s solution works on the client-side &lsquo;beyond the edge&rsquo;, rather than at the firewall layer. This enables its technology to analyse micro-behaviours, reducing false positives while enhancing an organisation&rsquo;s cybersecurity posture. It uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to protect against sophisticated human-spoofing bots, and leverages more than six years&rsquo; worth of behavioural data gathered by the company.&nbsp;</span></p>

<title>ASIC Annual Forum 2024: Bridging Generations – Regulating For All Australians - Keynote Opening Address By ASIC Chair Joe Longo At The ASIC Annual Forum, 14 November 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-annual-forum-2024-bridging-generations-regulating-for-all-australians/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-annual-forum-2024-bridging-generations-regulating-for-all-australians/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul>
<li>As a community, we rightly value regulation as a necessary part of our lives to advance and protect the interests of everyone, particularly the vulnerable.</li>
<li>Against this background of multiple waves of reform, past present and future, and as we stand on the cusp of ever more change &ndash; it&rsquo;s time for a renewed national discussion about regulatory complexity.</li>
<li>It's time to ask: is this working, and if not, what should be done? It means looking to the future and considering how things should evolve to deal with not just the problems of this generation &ndash; but also the next. That challenge is front of mind for ASIC.</li>
</ul>
<p>Firstly, welcome to the ASIC Annual Forum &ndash; our 27<sup>th</sup>!</p>
<p>Thank you to Aunty Joan for her welcome to country. I also acknowledge the Traditional Owners of the lands on which we meet today, the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation, and I pay my respects to Elders past, present and emerging.</p>
<p>Thank you also to our co-hosts Amelia and Michael. We are all in good hands for the next day and a half.</p>
<p>There are too many distinguished guests to acknowledge, but I do want to thank my fellow ASIC Commissioners &ndash; Deputy Chair Sarah Court, Kate O&rsquo;Rourke, Alan Kirkland and Simone Constant, as well as the many ASIC staff and leaders who have made this event possible.</p>
<p>Twelve months ago, I opened last year&rsquo;s ASIC Annual Forum by observing &ldquo;now more than ever, we&rsquo;re all navigating complex, even uncharted, waters.&rdquo;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/asic-annual-forum-2024-bridging-generations-regulating-for-all-australians/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>
<p>And today, I would add that we&rsquo;re navigating those waters with overly-complex tools &ndash; a fragmented system where everything was designed for a specific circumstance&hellip;but no tool was designed with all the others in mind.</p>
<p>To drop the metaphor and speak plainly &ndash; I&rsquo;m talking about regulation.</p>
<p>I would venture that addressing this issue is more important than ever &ndash; not just for this generation, but for generations to come.</p>
<p>As a community, we rightly value regulation as a necessary part of our lives &ndash; to advance and protect the interests of everyone, particularly the vulnerable.</p>
<p>Indeed, ASIC has this year demonstrated how targeted and proportionate use of all our regulatory tools promotes compliance and accountability.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve achieved a number of regulatory and enforcement firsts &ndash; the first court-imposed penalty for greenwashing for example, and the first infringement notice issued to a market operator, the ASX.</p>
<p>We also took down more than 7,300 investment scam and phishing websites. We highlighted shortcomings in the way lenders provide financial hardship support. And we&rsquo;ve continued to address emerging regulatory challenges, including in relation to sustainable finance, crypto assets, and artificial intelligence technologies.</p>
<p>And yet, as I&rsquo;ve said before,<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/asic-annual-forum-2024-bridging-generations-regulating-for-all-australians/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>&nbsp;perhaps the single biggest challenge to how effectively regulation can advance and protect the interests of the community and business &ndash; is its complexity.</p>
<p>It has been a consistent theme in the many conversations I and my fellow ASIC Commissioners have with businesses, industry groups, and consumers, but also other regulators.</p>
<p>This complexity has two dimensions:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, the environment. The legal and regulatory landscape is increasingly complex; and we&rsquo;ve also seen a sharp increase in what the public expects of governments, regulators and business;</li>
<li>And second, the legislation and regulations that we devise, draft, deliver and implement can also be complicated.</li>
</ol>
<p>So today I would like to address this issue head on, and ask: is our approach to regulation working?</p>
<h2>It&rsquo;s time to pause and reflect</h2>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s start with &lsquo;why&rsquo; and &lsquo;why now&rsquo;.</p>
<p>We are at an opportune time to reflect because we&rsquo;re at a point where we can look back and consider past and recent law reform from a perspective that is informed by a wealth of experience.</p>
<p>Many of you will know that separately there have been, over the years, several attempts to simplify and streamline aspects of our legislative framework: the corporations law &lsquo;simplification task force&rsquo; established by the Commonwealth Attorney-General in the 1980s, the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program in the 1990s<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/asic-annual-forum-2024-bridging-generations-regulating-for-all-australians/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>, through to the recent reviews by the Australian Law Reform Commission into, for example, corporate criminal responsibility and Chapter 7 of the Corporations Act<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/asic-annual-forum-2024-bridging-generations-regulating-for-all-australians/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also now over five years since the report of the financial services Royal Commission. Subsequent tranches of law reform have included:</p>
<ul>
<li>the implementation of the Financial Accountability Regime;</li>
<li>reform of the way in which breaches of the law are to be self-reported, with the introduction of the &lsquo;reportable situations&rsquo; regime;</li>
<li>law reform in relation to competition in clearing and settlement, and financial market infrastructure; and</li>
<li>the establishment of the compensation scheme of last resort.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that isn&rsquo;t an exhaustive list. All these reforms relate directly to ASIC&rsquo;s responsibilities and jurisdiction. To varying degrees, all of them impact the financial sector and markets, and consumers and investors. And there are further changes ahead particularly driven by community expectations and the rapid pace of technological change, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>the proposed scams prevention framework;</li>
<li>mandatory climate disclosure;</li>
<li>building potential guardrails around AI; and</li>
<li>further consideration of how to regulate crypto assets.</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems to me that &ndash; against this background of multiple waves of reform, past present and future, and as we stand on the cusp of ever more change &ndash; it&rsquo;s time for a renewed national discussion about regulatory complexity particularly following the recent review by the ALRC, and also how ASIC implements regulation.</p>
<p>As a regulator, our experience is that&nbsp;<strong>simplicity means enforceability</strong>. That&rsquo;s good for consumers and investors &ndash; they get justice and outcomes &ndash; and it&rsquo;s good for businesses, who get clarity about what&rsquo;s required of them.</p>
<p>But are we providing this clarity right now?</p>
<h2>The current complexity</h2>
<p>Looking at the current legislative and regulatory landscape, as I&rsquo;ve said before &ndash;&nbsp;<strong>we don&rsquo;t do simplicity well in Australia</strong>.</p>
<p>As long ago as 1992, Professor Ian Ramsay wrote about the &lsquo;love affair&rsquo; Australia has with legislation and complexity. As he put it, &ldquo;it is now very clear that the way in which significant social problems are resolved is through legislation rather than the courts&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;nowhere is this more evident than in corporate law&rdquo;.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/asic-annual-forum-2024-bridging-generations-regulating-for-all-australians/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>
<p>More recently, the ALRC noted that:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corporations and financial services legislation has become unnecessarily complex. Regulated entities incur unnecessary costs when complying with their obligations. Consumers find it difficult to identify their rights. Lawyers struggle to advise their clients with sufficient certainty. Judges have become all too familiar with confronting the &lsquo;usual labyrinthine provisions of the Corporations Act&rsquo;.&rdquo;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/asic-annual-forum-2024-bridging-generations-regulating-for-all-australians/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>:</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at some numbers. Almost all Commonwealth Acts refer to another Act, and several refer to dozens or even hundreds of Acts.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/asic-annual-forum-2024-bridging-generations-regulating-for-all-australians/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>&nbsp;Over 49,000 definitions appear across Commonwealth Acts &ndash; and around 13% of all words in these Acts are affected by one of those definitions.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/asic-annual-forum-2024-bridging-generations-regulating-for-all-australians/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>
<p>The volume of legislation passed is also increasing. In the year of Federation, Parliament passed 17 Acts. Today the average is between 150 and 200 Bills a year.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/asic-annual-forum-2024-bridging-generations-regulating-for-all-australians/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>
<p>The result of all this is an often dizzying web of connections, references, and definitions. This has been graphically referred to as &ldquo;legislative porridge.&rdquo;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/asic-annual-forum-2024-bridging-generations-regulating-for-all-australians/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>
<p>Each new legislative reform is, of course, well-intended. It&rsquo;s meant to solve a real and present problem at a particular time. But done in isolation, short term, reactive and specific legislative threads woven together can look less like an elegant tapestry and more like a painting by Jackson Pollock.</p>
<p>There can also be complexity in the administration of the law: in the practices of regulators &ndash; how they implement the law &ndash; and how they interact with each other.</p>
<p>In short &ndash; regulators can make it better or worse.</p>
<p>Now, it may appear to some that ASIC is responsible for some of the complexity &ndash; by way of the numerous legislative instruments we issue, for example. We also regularly receive feedback that the guidance we issue is too much, or too little. But the reality is that those instruments, along with our guidance, are designed to solve problems and help the framework function effectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed, one could argue that one indicator of the clarity and efficacy of a particular piece of legislation is the number of supplementary documents it requires to be understood and to work effectively &ndash; the number of modifications, instruments, explanatory material, and pages of regulatory guidance.</p>
<p>I cannot stress enough that the legislative and regulatory complexity I&rsquo;ve highlighted, and the constant pipeline of change and reform, has implications for everyone.</p>
<p>Many of you will have experienced this impact yourselves. To quote the Attorney-General&rsquo;s Department: &ldquo;Complex legislation makes it difficult, expensive, and time-consuming for people to understand their legal rights and obligations. This creates burdens for business and restricts access to justice<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/asic-annual-forum-2024-bridging-generations-regulating-for-all-australians/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This goes back to what I said earlier &ndash; simpler and clearer legislation can be more effectively enforced. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The mosaic of complexity also impacts consumer issues &ndash; including how we combat scams, predatory lending and unfair contracts.</p>
<p>It makes it more likely that Australians lose out on the intended benefits of worthwhile reform.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear, then, that these issues&nbsp;<strong>affect all of us &ndash; legislators, regulators, businesses big and small, and consumers and investors</strong>.</p>
<p>Effective regulation makes society better,&nbsp;<strong>it should not be an anchor holding us back</strong>.</p>
<p>If we continue on the path we&rsquo;re on, we will&nbsp;<strong>undermine how effectively consumers and investors can exercise their rights</strong>, and we risk&nbsp;<strong>a chilling effect on productivity and innovation</strong>&nbsp;as businesses struggle to decipher and anticipate regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>To underscore the theme of this Forum, is that really the sort of legacy we want to leave for future generations?</p>
<p>So, if we&rsquo;re to aspire to more effective regulation &ndash; regulation that&rsquo;s easier to navigate, and better achieves its intended outcomes &ndash; it's time to ask:&nbsp;<strong>is this working, and if not, what should be done?</strong></p>
<p>It means&nbsp;<strong>looking to the future</strong>&nbsp;and considering how things should evolve to deal with not just the problems of this generation &ndash; but also the next. That challenge is front of mind for ASIC. Not just in how we contribute to discussions and debates, but in how we implement the regulations we&rsquo;re responsible for.</p>
<p>I would note here that as we grapple with the continuing digitisation of the economy &ndash; new responsibilities and expectations mount.</p>
<p>Now, this isn&rsquo;t a call for more regulators. We have a relatively small economy in global terms, with a sophisticated regulatory architecture. More bureaucracy is not the answer.</p>
<p>Instead, this is a call to reconsider our approach.</p>
<p>As well as the various initiatives over the years to improve our legislative framework, there has been significant thought given &ndash; by the Attorney General&rsquo;s Department, and others &ndash; to the principles<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/asic-annual-forum-2024-bridging-generations-regulating-for-all-australians/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>&nbsp;that should be adopted, to improve the clarity and effectiveness of the legislative and regulatory process.</p>
<p>These are principles we at ASIC support. For example, that:</p>
<ul>
<li>laws should be as simple as possible, to give effect to policy;</li>
<li>legislation should enable those affected to understand how the law applies to them; and</li>
<li>achieving clearer laws requires designing, instructing, drafting and assessing for clarity.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/asic-annual-forum-2024-bridging-generations-regulating-for-all-australians/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"><sup>[13]</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Many of you will be familiar with the &lsquo;reportable situations&rsquo; regime that came into effect in October 2021, and imposes obligations on Australian financial services and credit licensees to self-report non-compliance to ASIC. That regime was introduced with the best of intentions and indeed this time last year we announced it would be one of ASIC&rsquo;s enforcement priorities.</p>
<p>One of the challenges we have encountered in administering and enforcing the regime has been the number of modifications, and the number of pages of guidance that have been required to help industry meet their obligations and ensure the regime meets its objectives &ndash; in other words, to make it work.</p>
<p>In short, the complexity of that regime is affecting how we translate its intent to get the full benefit.</p>
<p>It is an example of how&nbsp;<strong>complexity is a clear and present danger to our work as a law enforcement agency</strong>.</p>
<h2>Time for action</h2>
<p>So &ndash; I&rsquo;m suggesting we would&nbsp;<strong>all</strong>&nbsp;benefit from some reflection about the edifice of complexity we have built, and dare I say it, the &lsquo;red tape&rsquo; that can hold back consumers and businesses. I&rsquo;m suggesting we get serious about what can be done.</p>
<p>I am grateful for the candour of the businesses, industry, and consumer advocates who have raised these issues with me over the past three years.</p>
<p>Across those many conversations it&rsquo;s become clear that&nbsp;<strong>the breadth and ambition of legislation and regulation is having real-world impact on businesses, and on the outcomes consumers can get when they have been wronged</strong>.</p>
<p>I will note here the Government&rsquo;s Regulatory Initiatives Grid, and the Regulatory Policy, Practice and Performance Framework released by the Department of Finance as policy steps in the right direction.</p>
<p>The Grid, for example, can help provide relief from the problems I&rsquo;ve described by delivering better visibility of proposed legislation and regulation, consultation processes, and data collection; and by allowing regulators to focus on shared priorities and how to best implement reform.</p>
<p>The Grid lays down a challenge to all regulators. That we should consider the initiatives we&rsquo;re proposing, and whether they need to happen at this or that particular time.</p>
<p>ASIC supports the Grid &ndash; and of course we have experience in setting out future ASIC activities in our own&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/regulatory-document-updates/regulatory-developments-timetable/" title="Regulatory developments timetable">regulatory developments timetable</a>&nbsp;that we introduced two years ago.</p>
<p>As the corporate regulator, with more than 30 years&rsquo; experience at the coal face of regulation, ASIC is regularly asked for its views on legislation and regulation. What I am proposing is built on that experience, and the success of our regulatory efficiency initiatives.</p>
<p>To that end, I can announce&nbsp;<strong>we will convene a Simplification Consultative Group</strong>&nbsp;made up of key consumer advocates, business leaders and directors and industry groups so we can address some of the complexity I have described.</p>
<p>Their task will be to identify&nbsp;<strong>how we, ASIC, can more efficiently and more effectively administer the law</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>How the levers and guidance available to ASIC can be more helpful.</strong></p>
<p>The fundamental approach of this group will be to listen to consumers, investors, and industry and challenge us to simplify and streamline how these issues are addressed. They will do this by leveraging the existing consultative panels ASIC runs, and inviting additional participation of groups, all with an urgent focus on establishing the key priorities that we can help address.</p>
<p><strong>Fresh thinking is required. We want to hear it. We want to engage with the ideas.</strong></p>
<p>I want this group to reinvigorate national discussion about complexity. And I want to build on the success ASIC has seen with the regulatory efficiency outcomes &ndash; from how we develop guidance, to how we use our compulsory information gathering powers, and how we engage with stakeholders.</p>
<p>The focus has to be&nbsp;<strong>making the most difference as quickly as possible</strong>&nbsp;for consumers and investors, for businesses large and small and for directors.</p>
<p>Although ASIC is just one agency, we have one of the broadest remits of any law enforcement agency. This means the way ASIC interprets and administers the law puts us in a unique position to help address the complexity we all face.</p>
<p>These are issues that have built up over decades and as the ALRC&rsquo;s report earlier this year has shown, there are no silver bullets. But I encourage all of you to work with us so we can make progress.</p>
<p>This will be similar to how ASIC has been driving a national discussion about the future of public and private markets, and the role of regulation in capital raising.</p>
<p>While the focus of this regulatory simplification work will start with ASIC, through this process I expect we will gain insights and ideas for new mechanisms that can provide more analysis and recommendations for reform.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we want to establish a consensus about what needs to be done, to ensure we tend towards simplicity for future regulatory development and implementation.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that many aspects of the current system aren&rsquo;t working as they should. There are clear costs to business, and hurdles for consumers and investors.</p>
<p>We all need it to be better.</p>
<p>This is about creating a simpler, more effective, and more enforceable regulatory system.</p>
<p>To all the consumers, business leaders and directors who have raised the issue of regulatory complexity with me &ndash;&nbsp;<strong>ASIC has heard you, and ASIC is going to act.</strong></p>
<p>Simplicity makes it easier to follow the law, for consumers to be protected by the law, and for regulators to enforce the law.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t be simple to get there &ndash; but we owe it to generations to come.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Qatar Stock Exchange (&lsquo;QSE&rsquo;) again led a delegation of its leading listed companies to New York this week, at a roadshow which took place on November 12 and 13, hosted at Bank of America&rsquo;s offices. The roadshow, was part of QSE&rsquo;s strategy to expand its investor base, attract further foreign investment and showcase the strength and potential of Qatar&rsquo;s capital markets.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The New York Roadshow brought together international investment managers with senior representatives from QNB, CBQ, QIB, Masraf Al Rayan, MPHC, Industries Qatar, GIS and QAMCO, Qatar Insurance, Milaha, Nakilat.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The conference offers US investors an opportunity to expand their relationship with Qatar as an investment destination and strengthen their understanding of investment opportunities with Qatar&rsquo;s leading companies. It also reflects the increased penetration of foreign institutional investors into Qatar&rsquo;s capital markets.&nbsp; Most recently foreign institutional investors have typically accounted for thirty-forty percent of average daily turnover and continue to be an active presence in its market.</span></span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Abdul Aziz Nasser Al Emadi, Acting, CEO of QSE said: &ldquo;QSE&rsquo;s, and our listed companies, commitment to our ongoing outreach is part of a long-term commitment.&nbsp; In fact, the Third Financial Sector Strategy, contains as one of its key objectives the &ldquo;internationalisation&rdquo; of our markets overall.&nbsp; This covers not just equity investors, the focus this week, but also fixed income investors as well as the regional and global market participants who provide the international &lsquo;connectivity&rsquo; that has been such an important part of Qatar&rsquo;s overall growth. The two go hand-in-hand with raised awareness requiring the further development of market access and market infrastructure that will make portfolio investment more efficient.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>He added &ldquo;Post World Cup and its related infrastructure build-out, Qatar is not standing still embarking on a new phase of growth driven by the proposed North Field expansion which will increase capacity to 142 MTPA by 2030, an 85% increase.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>It is expected that over the two days Qatar&rsquo;s listed companies will receive over one hundred meeting requests with fund managers.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<title>ASIC Annual Forum 2024: Enforcement Session Opening Remarks - Enforcement Session Opening Speech By ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court At The ASIC Annual Forum, 14 November 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>KEY POINTS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2024 has been a significant year. Our new investigations have jumped by 25%, and our civil enforcement cases have similarly increased. In addition, we have seen a lot of &lsquo;firsts&rsquo;.</li>
<li>Turning to 2025, and recognising current cost of living pressures, we have selected our enforcement priorities for the coming year with a focus on protecting consumers from financial harm.</li>
<li>These priorities communicate our intent to industry and our stakeholders and give a clear indication of where we will direct our resources and expertise.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good morning. It&rsquo;s a pleasure to be here again to announce our&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/asic-investigations-and-enforcement/asic-enforcement-priorities/" title="ASIC enforcement priorities">annual enforcement priorities</a>, and to set out for you some of the important work we have been doing over the last 12 months.</p>
<p>This work comes at an important time. Despite a challenging geopolitical situation, and pressing climate-related issues, all research points to cost-of-living pressures as the paramount issue of the time for Australians. Our enforcement and compliance work through 2025 will reflect that reality.</p>
<p>Last year I talked about the evolution of ASIC&rsquo;s enforcement approach to one that is proactive, strategic and bold. I add to that now, based on our work of the last 12 months, that we are taking an increasingly&nbsp;<strong>confident</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>ambitious&nbsp;</strong>approach to the outcomes we are seeking.</p>
<p><strong>Confident</strong>&nbsp;because we are unapologetically putting the interests of consumers and investors at the heart of everything we do, including, from time to time, in the face of resistance from those who have been misled about the safety or performance of their investment.</p>
<p>And&nbsp;<strong>ambitious</strong>&nbsp;because we seek to extend the full reach of the protective laws we administer. This year we have clarified and tested the extent of laws in unfair contract terms, the design and distribution obligations, greenwashing and crypto, and we will continue to take this approach.</p>
<p>Before I turn to some of our 2024 outcomes, I should remind you of why we have enforcement priorities in the first place.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, they respond to industry requests for transparency as to where we intend to direct our focus.</li>
<li>Second, they make the Commission&rsquo;s enforcement agenda clear to our staff, which helps with case selection, resource allocation and prioritisation.</li>
<li>Third, the announcement of particular areas of interest has a deterrent and compliance impact in and of itself.</li>
<li>Finally, they hold us to account &ndash; have we done what we said we would do?</li>
</ul>
<p>Important as our priorities are, they do not mark the full extent of our enforcement work. Misconduct requiring our attention will inevitably emerge in the course of a year, and we will always retain sufficient capacity to respond to issues of this kind.</p>
<h2>Highlights of 2024</h2>
<p>2024 has been a significant year. Our new investigations have jumped by 25%, and our civil enforcement cases have similarly increased. In addition, as the Chair mentioned earlier, we have seen a lot of &lsquo;firsts&rsquo;.</p>
<p>We have had our first important court outcomes with significant penalties imposed in greenwashing and design and distribution matters.</p>
<p>We have seen what will be, if accepted by the court, one of the largest penalties imposed on a superannuation trustee, in our proceedings against Australian Super.</p>
<p>We have had a record penalty imposed by the Markets Disciplinary Panel against Macquarie.</p>
<p>And, after our teams spent time in remote Indigenous communities taking evidence from First Nations consumers, we have seen the first final stop order imposed to prevent further harm to these consumers.</p>
<p>We have remained resolute in our determination to halt what we consider to be unlawful business models operated by&nbsp;<strong>Cigno</strong>, and in a strongly contested, long-running matter against Harvey Norman and Latitude Finance, both were found to have engaged in a widespread, misleading advertising campaign across multiple media channels. Perhaps unsurprisingly, as Harvey Norman is reputed to be the most prolific advertising purchaser in the country, this outcome received muted coverage.</p>
<p>In the criminal area, while we are often restricted in what we can say about our cases, they are extensive and resource-intensive.</p>
<p>This year has seen charges laid against several individuals for alleged &lsquo;pump and dump&rsquo; market manipulation; a former director sentenced to 11 years in prison for charges relating to the Courtenay House Ponzi scheme; a former financial adviser sentenced to 12 years in prison for causing nearly $6 million in losses to his clients; and a former financial planner sentenced to imprisonment for dishonest conduct.</p>
<p>Add to this&nbsp;<strong>Daniel Ali</strong>, former director of DanFX Trade, sentenced to more than seven years&rsquo; imprisonment for fraud and&nbsp;<strong>Rosemary Flegg</strong>, former company secretary of Continental Coal, convicted of stealing and forging bank statements.</p>
<p><strong>Cameron Waugh</strong>&nbsp;pleaded guilty to insider trading relating to the gold exploration company Genesis Minerals;&nbsp;<strong>William O&rsquo;Dwyer</strong>, former Managing Director of the Ralan Group, was sentenced to immediate imprisonment for obtaining financial advantage by deception, and just this week&nbsp;<strong>Brett Trevillian</strong>, investment manager at AlphaThorn, was sentenced to three years in prison for forging reports about the performance of his trading strategy.</p>
<p>As this list demonstrates, ASIC is an active criminal law enforcement agency. Indeed, while figures fluctuate, as at today we have more matters in the criminal courts than we do civil. We are executing warrants, freezing assets, and restricting people from fleeing the country so they can be held to account on a frequent basis.</p>
<p>Turning then to some of our priority areas of 2024. This year we rounded off a suite of important matters relating to the&nbsp;<strong>design and distribution obligations.&nbsp;</strong>These cases helped test and clarify the breadth of these important new laws which have been a recent feature of our enforcement work. In the first decisions in the area, we saw the court make orders against&nbsp;<strong>Firstmac</strong>&nbsp;for cross-selling a product to consumers outside of the relevant target market, and against&nbsp;<strong>Amex</strong>&nbsp;for failing to take reasonable steps to prevent the inappropriate distribution of its credit cards. It was penalised $8 million for this conduct.</p>
<p>In demonstrating the broad application of these laws, including in new and emerging conduct areas, the operator of the&nbsp;<strong>Kraken</strong>&nbsp;crypto-exchange was also found to have failed to comply with these obligations when offering a margin trading product to Australian consumers.</p>
<p>What we take from these decisions is that the laws are flexible, product-neutral, and have much work to do. Given our extensive efforts in the area, including courts cases, surveillances, regulatory guidance, and reports, we will now transition our focus here to business as usual &ndash; that is, the design and distribution obligations are now just another tool in our enforcement armoury.</p>
<p>Turning to another priority area, you are likely aware that the court this year imposed significant penalties on&nbsp;<strong>Mercer</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Vanguard</strong>&nbsp;in separate proceedings for&nbsp;<strong>greenwashing</strong>&nbsp;misconduct.&nbsp;<strong>Mercer</strong>&nbsp;was penalised more than $11 million for misleading investors as to the sustainable nature of some of its superannuation investment options; and shortly afterwards Vanguard was subject to the highest greenwashing penalty to date, in the amount of $12.9 million.</p>
<p>In another proceeding, following a strongly contested hearing, the court determined that&nbsp;<strong>Active Super</strong>&nbsp;made various misleading representations about its ESG credentials. The penalty in that matter remains to be determined.</p>
<p>These cases have confirmed that first, when an entity uses unqualified language or unequivocal terms such as we will &lsquo;not invest&rsquo; or we will &lsquo;eliminate&rsquo; in relation to investments, it cannot correct those representations by relying on a consumer searching around for some investment policy that might otherwise qualify those statements.</p>
<p>Second, when superannuation trustees or managed investment schemes make representations as to investment screens or their green credentials, there is no valid distinction to be made between direct and indirect investments.</p>
<p>Going forward into 2025 we will retain our focus on&nbsp;<strong>greenwashing and misleading claims relating to ESG credentials,&nbsp;</strong>and we will particularly consider claims that are inaccurate or made without reasonable grounds. Our work will span a broad range of sectors including listed companies, managed funds, and superannuation funds.</p>
<p>Turning now to some important outcomes in the area of&nbsp;<strong>high-cost credit and predatory lending,&nbsp;</strong>there is unfortunately no end of demand for our work. The business models we encounter often appear to have been designed for the very purpose of avoiding consumer credit protections, and often impact the most financially vulnerable consumers.</p>
<p>Such a business model is at the heart of our allegations in the&nbsp;<strong>Oak Capital Mortgage</strong>&nbsp;case, where we allege that Oak Capital engaged in systemic unconscionable conduct by using a lending model requiring a company to be the named borrower for the loans, in circumstances where the company did not benefit from, or have any genuine interest in, the loan. The impact of this was that the individuals seeking these loans were required to secure them with residential property, and they had no consumer credit protections when in default.</p>
<p>A similar model was evident in our proceedings against&nbsp;<strong>Rent4Keeps,&nbsp;</strong>where the company sought to argue that arrangements with customers which were styled as &lsquo;consumer leases&rsquo; were not subject to the credit laws because &ndash; despite the name of the company &ndash; the customers were purportedly not entitled to keep their products. The court found to the contrary, and that the arrangements were credit contracts, such that the consumer protection laws had been broken.</p>
<p>We have had a range of other like matters in court this year; and the&nbsp;<strong>Cigno</strong>&nbsp;saga that I talked about last year has continued.</p>
<p>The practices we see in this area are unethical, unscrupulous, and deliberate. They emerge in the form of&nbsp;<strong>business models designed to get around consumer credit protections</strong>, and they take advantage of those who are the most vulnerable. We will continue our focus on these issues in 2025, including holding the individuals behind these schemes to account.</p>
<p>Finally, in relation to our priority of tackling&nbsp;<strong>gatekeeper</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>market operator misconduct</strong>, as you are likely aware, significant proceedings were launched this year against Australia&rsquo;s largest market operator,&nbsp;<strong>ASX Limited</strong>, for allegedly making misleading statements related to its CHESS replacement project. That matter is continuing, and followed the first infringement notice issued to ASX following an ASIC investigation into its compliance with the market integrity rules. We have also taken action against&nbsp;<strong>Macquarie</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>JP Morgan</strong>&nbsp;for failing to prevent suspicious client orders being placed on futures markets, with, as I mentioned earlier, a record penalty imposed.</p>
<h2>Insurance and superannuation &ndash; observations on some emerging issues</h2>
<p>Turning to 2025, I want to make some observations on some emerging areas of concern. Insurance and superannuation make up key parts of our regulatory remit. Both are taking on increasing importance to Australians. Insurance because of issues surrounding climate change, extreme weather events, and affordability; and superannuation because it makes up such a large part of each person&rsquo;s wealth and standard of living in retirement.</p>
<p>In relation to&nbsp;<strong>insurance,&nbsp;</strong>I suspect many of us in this room have at one time or another faced the daunting task of trying to find a better insurance offer.</p>
<p>The ability to compare insurance products and pricing offers is critical for consumers seeking to purchase insurance that is both affordable and appropriate for their circumstances. Equally important is being able to rely on promises made by insurers when they send renewal notices referencing discounts for loyalty or the number of policies held.</p>
<p>Promises like these are why we have continued our focus on insurance this year, building on significant court outcomes in 2023. We recently instituted proceedings against&nbsp;<strong>QBE</strong>&nbsp;alleging it failed to deliver on pricing discount promises made to renewing customers on thousands of occasions. We will continue our work in this area next year, with a focus on&nbsp;<strong>f</strong><strong>ailures by insurers to deal fairly and in good faith with their customers</strong>.</p>
<p>Turning to superannuation, this year we have had a number of cases in court against large superannuation trustees including Australian Super, Mercer, Active Super and Telstra Super. As of Tuesday we can add United Super or Cbus to that list. Commissioner Constant, who leads our work in this area, talks frequently about the importance of superannuation trustees delivering for their members, and&nbsp;<strong>member services failures in the superannuation sector</strong>&nbsp;will continue as an area of focus in 2025.</p>
<p>Further to this, we are increasingly seeing disturbing scenarios involving the partial or complete loss of superannuation savings. A common example is where a consumer is advised, enticed or misled to withdraw superannuation savings from a regulated fund, and to invest them, often through the vehicle of a self-managed super fund, into a property development scheme or cryptocurrency asset.</p>
<p>An example of this is reflected in our recent investigation into investments in the&nbsp;<strong>Shield Master Fund</strong>. You may have seen reporting of ASIC&rsquo;s work on this matter. It makes for sobering reading. We understand that in a two-year period more than $480 million was invested in this fund by thousands of people. Potential investors were called by lead generators and referred to financial advisers. They were advised to withdraw their superannuation investments and to put part or all of them into the Shield Master Fund. This fund sat on the platforms of Macquarie and Equity Trustees, and many superannuants did so. While our work on this matter continues with great intensity, we are concerned that substantial investor funds may have been misapplied.</p>
<p>This is but one of several like matters that have come to our attention this year. We are therefore adding a new priority described broadly as&nbsp;<strong>misconduct exploiting superannuation savings</strong>. We see this as an emerging and concerning area for vigilance, and we are calling on both superannuants and superannuation trustees to exercise caution in such circumstances.</p>
<p>Before I turn to some new areas of focus for 2025, I want to remind you of our enduring enforcement priorities. They should be on the screen now. I won&rsquo;t go through these in any detail but suffice to say that these are types of conduct we consider to be so important as to always be a priority for our work.</p>
<p>Let me turn to some new areas of focus for 2025.</p>
<p>First &ndash;&nbsp;<strong>auditors</strong>. Auditors play a critical role across the financial system, as the principal external check on a company's reporting. The integrity of our markets depends on performance of the auditor role with independence and integrity.</p>
<p>There has been considerable recent public attention on the role of auditors and audit firms, and indeed a parliamentary joint committee delivered a report on this subject just last week. Given this interest, and the important and unique role played by auditors, we propose to intensify our oversight and enforcement work in this sector.</p>
<p>Second, I have already set out some of the harms we are seeing in relation to the promotion and mis-selling of high-risk property schemes. This misconduct is increasingly revealing itself to be on an industrial scale. The conduct usually involves a chain of participants, with each person in the chain collecting a fee from the unsuspecting investor along the way. This can include lead generators, cold callers, financial advisers, and conflicted directors of highly speculative property schemes. The investment is often done through the vehicle of newly created self-managed super funds, and increasingly we see investments described with reference to NDIS-compatible housing, presumably to suggest guaranteed or high returns due to a purported connection with the government scheme. Accordingly, we have a new enforcement priority relating to&nbsp;<strong>unscrupulous property investment schemes.</strong></p>
<p>Third, ASIC has award-winning real-time surveillance technology that helps to ensure that Australia has one of the cleanest markets in the world. To maximise the regulatory benefits of this surveillance, we have established a specialist team &ndash; what I might call a hit squad &ndash; to more intensively follow up and investigate our surveillance results. This team has its work well underway, and&nbsp;<strong>strengthening our investigation and prosecution of insider trading&nbsp;</strong>will be a key area of work for us in 2025.</p>
<p>Fourth, given the cost-of-living issues I have already referred to, we think it likely that some consumers will find it increasingly challenging to make payments for essential services. There are important consumer protections for the management and collection of debts, and we will be taking action where we see practices that fall short of these obligations.&nbsp;<strong>Debt management and debt collection misconduct&nbsp;</strong>will be a focus for us while current economic conditions prevail.</p>
<p>Finally, one of the obligations of holding a financial services or credit licence is to have adequate cyber security protections, and to respond appropriately to safeguard consumers&rsquo; personal information and data in the event those protections are breached. We are considering a range of matters where we consider licensees may have not adequately prepared for these events, particularly in their oversight and supervision of others. We will be further focusing on this issue next year.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Before I conclude, I want to touch for a moment on the concept of &lsquo;<strong>self-reporting&rsquo;</strong>. I do this because one of the most frequent questions I get following ASIC taking court action is: &lsquo;but they self-reported, and are paying compensation &ndash; why is it necessary to take them to court?&rsquo;</p>
<p>To this, I say three things:</p>
<p>First, if you have the privilege of holding an Australian financial services or credit licence the law requires you to report to ASIC as soon as you are aware there may be a material breach of the law. It is an offence not to. That is, the law requires self-reporting, and we generally do not laud people for simply complying with the law.</p>
<p>Second, the law also requires self-reporting to occur within 30 days. Despite this, we frequently see instances where reports to ASIC are made months, if not years, after issues are first raised internally by staff or other complainants. That&rsquo;s also a breach of the law.</p>
<p>Third, a report to ASIC is the beginning of the process, not its conclusion. Sometimes a self-report is followed by an internal review, or an externally commissioned independent report. At some stage we will be told about the outcome of such a review. More often than not, a privilege claim is made over its contents. We are assured though that there is nothing more for us to see.</p>
<p>Of course, we do not accept that assurance. As a former colleague of mine once said, a good regulator should always be sceptical. We will never simply look a gift-horse in the mouth &ndash; we will look at it, open its mouth, pull out its tongue and counts its teeth. We are sceptical of what is put to us, and with good reason. There is often a good deal more to see than what is reported to us, and we will generally conduct our own investigation and make our own assessment of the misconduct. Even where there is full and prompt disclosure and remediation, it may well be appropriate for a court to determine what contravention of the law has occurred, and what appropriate penalty should be imposed. This is important for community confidence and sends deterrent messages to the industry more broadly.</p>
<p>Thank you for your attention today. I am looking forward to the panel discussion with my colleagues.</p>

<title>ASIC Announces New Enforcement Priorities With A Focus On Cost Of Living Pressures</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-announces-new-enforcement-priorities-with-a-focus-on-cost-of-living-pressur/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-announces-new-enforcement-priorities-with-a-focus-on-cost-of-living-pressur/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC today announced its&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/asic-investigations-and-enforcement/asic-enforcement-priorities/" title="ASIC enforcement priorities">enforcement priorities for 2025</a>, capturing the key areas where it will direct resources and expertise in the coming year.</p>
<p>ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said, &lsquo;Our 2025 enforcement priorities reflect the increased risks consumers are facing that are being driven by cost of living pressures. These priorities are about protecting Australians from financial harm and targeting the people who try to take advantage of them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We will focus on business models that are designed to avoid consumer credit protections, and we will take action against those engaging in unlawful debt management and collection. We will also target conduct that exploits superannuation savings, with a particular focus on unscrupulous property investment schemes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;ASIC will continue to fiercely uphold the integrity of Australia&rsquo;s financial markets, and to support this, we have established a new dedicated team to target insider trading.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In 2025, ASIC&rsquo;s enforcement priorities will focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Misconduct exploiting superannuation savings</li>
<li>Unscrupulous property investment schemes</li>
<li>Failures by insurers to deal fairly and in good faith with customers</li>
<li>Strengthening investigation and prosecution of insider trading</li>
<li>Business models designed to avoid consumer credit protections</li>
<li>Misconduct impacting small businesses and their creditors</li>
<li>Debt management and collection misconduct</li>
<li>Licensee failures to have adequate cyber-security protections</li>
<li>Greenwashing and misleading conduct involving ESG claims</li>
<li>Member services failures in the superannuation sector</li>
<li>Auditor misconduct</li>
<li>Used car finance sold to vulnerable consumers by finance providers</li>
</ul>
<p>Last year, ASIC increased its new investigations by 25% on the previous year. ASIC also increased new civil proceedings by 23% and had important enforcement outcomes across areas from greenwashing to crypto, predatory lending, high-cost credit and insider trading.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have more matters before criminal courts around the country than we do before civil courts, and it requires intensive efforts by ASIC investigators to continue each of those cases.</p>
<p>&lsquo;However, numbers only tell one part of the story. Numbers don&rsquo;t capture the full impact of the enforcement actions filed including the resulting compliance and deterrence we achieve, particularly in relation to consumer and investor protections and changing industry behaviour,&rsquo; Ms Court said.</p>
<p>ASIC's enforcement priorities reflect emerging issues and risks the agency prioritises to detect, investigate and prosecute unlawful conduct affecting consumers, businesses and the economy.</p>
<p>While ASIC&rsquo;s strategic targets change from year to year, in keeping with shifting economic factors and the volatile risk environment, its enduring priorities remain the same.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s enduring priorities target:</p>
<ul>
<li>Misconduct damaging market integrity including insider trading, continuous disclosure breaches and market manipulation</li>
<li>Misconduct impacting First Nations people</li>
<li>Misconduct involving a high risk of significant consumer harm</li>
<li>particularly conduct targeting financially vulnerable consumers</li>
<li>Systemic compliance failures by large financial institutions</li>
<li>resulting in widespread consumer harm</li>
<li>New or emerging conduct risks within the financial system</li>
<li>Governance and directors&rsquo; duties failures</li>
</ul>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s goal is to help all Australians through promoting market integrity and consumer protection in the Australian financial system. We take decisive and high-profile enforcement action to protect consumers, address misconduct, punish wrongdoers, and, importantly, reduce the risk of misconduct in the markets and sectors we regulate.</p>

<title>Generally Soliciting Comments Without Checking Accreditation: Remarks Before The Small Business Capital Formation Advisory Committee, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, Washington D.C., Nov. 13, 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Erica. I would like to extend my congratulations to the new members of this Committee, Jennifer Newton, Rose Standifer, Wendy Stevens, and Emily Underwood. I look forward to your individual contributions to this Committee and thank you for your willingness to serve. Thanks to the rest of the Committee and our guest panelists for being here today.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-sbcfac-111324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>A belated thank you for your recommendation that the Commission &ldquo;increase the [Crowdfunding] offering threshold at which reviewed financial statements are required from $124,000 to $350,000.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-sbcfac-111324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Such a change could help make crowdfunding a viable fundraising avenue for more small companies. Thank you also for your observations at the Committee&rsquo;s last meeting on the state of small business capital raising, which I found illuminating. At future meetings, I would welcome similar reflections on your own on-the-ground experiences.</p>
<p>To be effective, capital markets must be able to get money into the hands of good managers, regardless of whether they have rich friends and family. Only then will investors&rsquo; funds find their way to the companies that can put those funds to their best use. Today&rsquo;s panels about emerging fund managers will help us explore ways we can lower barriers to entry for such managers and thus ensure that their expertise is being drawn upon to deploy capital.</p>
<p>The first panel will discuss the underutilization of Rule 506(c) under Reg. D, which allows issuers, including funds, to publicly advertise a private offering provided that each purchaser is accredited and that the issuer takes &ldquo;reasonable steps to verify&rdquo; the purchaser&rsquo;s accredited investor status.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-sbcfac-111324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;Most recently, issuers raised around $169 billion annually under Rule 506(c) compared to $2.7 trillion under 506(b), which does not permit general solicitation.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-sbcfac-111324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;I have some questions for your consideration during today&rsquo;s meeting:</p>
<ol>
<li>According to Professor Sabrina Howell&rsquo;s paper, an average of only 8.4% of venture capital funds have used general solicitation since 2013.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-sbcfac-111324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;Based on her paper, one of the reasons for the lack of interest in 506(c) seems to be the cost and legal risk associated with the &ldquo;reasonable steps to verify&rdquo; requirement.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-sbcfac-111324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;How could the Commission mitigate these costs and legal risk? Should we allow an investor to self-certify her accredited investor status?</li>
<li>Professor Howell&rsquo;s paper suggests that use of 506(c) may send a &ldquo;negative signal to investors&rdquo; that the fund is incurring the cost of 506(c) only because it &ldquo;does not have the requisite personal network to fundraise without general solicitation.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-sbcfac-111324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;Would reducing the cost of verification sufficiently address this negative signal?</li>
<li>The paper posits that reforming Section 3(c)(1) of the Investment Company Act could expand the use of Rule 506(c) because &ldquo;a 100-investor cap for 3(c)(1) private funds creates a regulatory barrier to 506(c) managers&rsquo; access to small-time retail [accredited] investors.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-sbcfac-111324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;Where should the cap be set to address this regulatory barrier?</li>
<li>Congress in the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act created a new exemption for &ldquo;qualified venture capital funds&rdquo; under Section 3(c)(1) of the Investment Company Act, which can raise capital from up to 250 investors and $12 million of aggregate capital contributions and uncalled committed capital.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-sbcfac-111324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;What types of businesses and investors do qualified venture capital funds typically serve? Would a higher cap on investors or capital raise increase the usefulness of Rule 506(c), expand access to investing opportunities for smaller or less connected investors, or help fund managers access the capital they need? If so, what should the caps be?</li>
<li>What else can the SEC do to create a regulatory environment in which talented emerging fund managers, including those who do not have wealthy networks, can get a competitive toehold?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you. I look forward to listening to today&rsquo;s discussion.</p>

<title>SIFMA And EY Publish U.S. Treasury Clearing Compliance Considerations Report To Guide Industry Transition To Central Clearing</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sifma-and-ey-publish-us-treasury-clearing-compliance-considerations-report-to/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sifma-and-ey-publish-us-treasury-clearing-compliance-considerations-report-to/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>SIFMA and Ernst &amp; Young LLP (EY US) today published &ldquo;<a href="https://www.sifma.org/resources/general/us-treasury-central-clearing-industry-considerations-report/"><em>U.S. Treasury Central Clearing &ndash; Industry Considerations Report</em></a>,&rdquo; designed to capture and organize the various considerations and activities market participants should evaluate while assessing and completing preparations for the upcoming U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Treasury Clearing Rule compliance dates. It is intended to be utilized as a guide by sell-side and buy-side market participants alike as they implement changes in response to new U.S. Treasury clearing requirements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Treasury securities play a key role in the U.S. and world economies.&nbsp; SIFMA has long supported efforts to make the Treasury market more resilient.&nbsp; At the same time, we recognize the need to ensure liquidity is not negatively impacted,&rdquo; said Joe Seidel, SIFMA Chief Operating Officer.&nbsp; &ldquo;As we transition to central clearing in compliance with the new SEC rules, it is important that the industry focuses on preparedness efforts to ensure as little market disruption as possible.&nbsp; The report is designed to offer a roadmap of considerations and actions firms need to take now to be ready for the coming deadlines.&nbsp; This is also part of SIFMA&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sifma.org/explore-issues/treasury-clearing/">broader efforts</a>, including the development of standard clearing documentation, to coordinate a smooth transition with the industry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clearing transactions involves a clearing agency stepping in between a buyer and seller to handle certain elements of transaction processing, manage risk and pay down obligations.&nbsp; In December 2023, the SEC approved a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/final/2023/34-99149.pdf" target="_blank">final rule</a>&nbsp;which mandates the clearing of certain eligible secondary market transactions in U.S. Treasury securities. It triggered a significant structural change to the U.S. Treasury market and will have significant impacts on broker-dealers, institutional investors, asset managers, hedge funds, interdealer brokers, principal trading firms, banks, and covered clearing agencies (CCAs). The first compliance date is March 31, 2025, by which time CCAs must implement enhanced practices as outlined in the respective rulebook of each CCA, which include risk management, margin, customer asset protection, and access to clearance and settlement services. The second compliance date is December 31, 2025, by which time direct participants of CCAs must comply with the requirements to clear eligible cash secondary market transactions. The third compliance date is June 30, 2026, by which time direct participants of CCAs must be compliant with the requirements to clear eligible Treasury repo transactions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The SEC&rsquo;s new Treasury clearing requirements represent a pivotal shift for the U.S. Treasury market, and firms must act quickly to meet the upcoming compliance deadlines,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ey.com/en_us/people/brendan-maher">Brendan Maher, Managing Director, Financial Services Consulting, EY</a>. &ldquo;This report offers market participants a practical framework to navigate this complex transition, highlighting key considerations and actions. At EY, we are committed to helping our clients adapt to these new regulations by providing actionable insights and strategic guidance to ensure a seamless and efficient transition to central clearing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC Rule will drive a number of changes to the overall U.S. Treasury market structure and require the integration of market participants who will now be mandated to centrally clear transactions for the first time. New CCAs may also emerge, and market participants may decide to connect to one or more CCAs to support their trading and clearing strategies. Such changes to the market will require new operations and capabilities to accommodate increased clearing volumes and new relationships between firms.</p>
<p>The report details the critical activities that institutions should consider as they design and implement a process for Treasury clearing. The primary objectives of the report are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide an implementation blueprint for industry participants on implementation priorities.</li>
<li>Identify the key steps to operationalize change across different clearing access models.</li>
<li>Surface key issues, open questions, and gaps in market structure and provide recommendations on the path to resolution.</li>
<li>Provide views on the target state transaction lifecycle from execution through margin processing, including proposed high-level transaction flows.</li>
<li>Provide insights on implementation dependencies across work efforts, where possible.</li>
<li>Serve as an educational resource on the rule and its implications.</li>
</ul>
<p>The report includes input and subject-matter analysis from market participants on both the buy-side and sell-side that was gathered 1) via a survey issued to SIFMA member firms by SIFMA and EY, 2) from information workshops hosted with SIFMA member firms, and 3) from bilateral conversations with market participants. It is available at the following link:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sifma.org/resources/general/us-treasury-central-clearing-industry-considerations-report/">https://www.sifma.org/resources/general/us-treasury-central-clearing-industry-considerations-report/</a></p>

<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today released an updated list of third-country groups (TCGs) and third-country branches (TCBs) operating across the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA). This annual publication enhances market transparency by providing stakeholders with clear information on the ownership structures of institutions operating within the EU/EEA under foreign control.</span></p>
<p>The 2024 update identifies 439 third country groups from 50 countries outside the EU/EEA that are currently active in the area. Among these, 8 groups have established intermediate EU parent undertakings (IPUs), as required by EU regulations, with 2 groups having dual IPUs. Additionally, 61 TCGs have branches in the EU/EEA, resulting in a total of 95 third country branches spread across EU/EEA.</p>
<p>This Report is part of the EBA's efforts to ensure that market participants have clarity regarding the direct ownership and presence of foreign institutions within the EU/EEA, contributing to a stable and transparent banking environment.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<ul>
<li>According to Article 21b of Directive 2013/36/EU (Capital Requirements Directive - CRD), third country groups (TCGs) operating through ​more than one institution in the Union and with total assets of EUR 40 billion or more are required to have an intermediate EU parent undertaking (IPU).</li>
<li>The EBA has a key role to play in facilitating cooperation between National Competent Authorities and in supporting their IPU decision-making process.</li>
<li>In July 2021, the EBA Guidelines (<a href="https://eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document_library/Publications/Guidelines/2021/GLs%20on%20IPU%202021-08/1017776/Guidelines%20on%20the%20monitoring%20of%20IPU%20threshold.pdf">EBA/GL/2021/08</a>) provided a common methodology for the calculation of the total value of assets in order to achieve consistent application of Union law.</li>
<li>In May 2022, the EBA published the decision (<a href="https://eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document_library/Publications/Decisions/EBA%20DC%20441%20-%20Decision%20on%20using%20EBA%20extranet%20for%20IPU%20threshold%20monitoring/1033197/EBA%20DC%20441%20-%20Decision%20on%20using%20EBA%20extranet%20for%20IPU%20threshold%20monitoring.pdf">EBA/DC/441</a>) on supervisory reporting for the threshold monitoring of the intermediate EU parent undertaking to ensure a timely application of the IPU requirement.</li>

<ul>
<li><span>On 19 and 20 November, 240 meetings between European investors and listed companies from Latin America and Spain will be held at the Palacio de la Bolsa in Madrid.</span></li>
<li><span>Public panels will address issues such as the macroeconomic situation in the region, investment opportunities, digitalisation and sustainability.</span></li>
<li><span>The Secretary of State for Trade, Amparo L&oacute;pez Senovilla, will participate in the inaugural lunch together with David Jim&eacute;nez Blanco, Vice-President of BME.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The 26th edition of the Latibex Forum will be held on 19 and 20 November. Once again this year, the Palacio de la Bolsa de Madrid will host an intense programme of public panel discussions on current issues and private meetings between listed companies and investors.</p>
<p>The Latibex Forum, which is the benchmark investment meeting between Latin America and Europe, will bring together more than 40 Latin American and Spanish companies with interests in the region with near 60 investors. Of these, 35% are international. The business representation includes companies from Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru and Spain. 240 meetings are scheduled.</p>
<p>David Jim&eacute;nez Blanco, Vice-Chairman of BME, explains that &lsquo;we have been holding this event for more than a quarter of a century to highlight the close ties between Latin America and Europe, with Spain as a natural bridge between the two sides of the Atlantic and the financial markets as the ideal scenario for channelling investment in both directions. Since 1999, BME has had the Latibex market, which allows us to invest in euros in Latin American companies from Europe. We also have an office in Bogota where we centralise our activities in the region, to which we attach great importance.</p>
<p>On Tuesday 19 November, the first panel will be dedicated to the macroeconomic outlook for Latin America, with Javier J. P&eacute;rez, Director of International Economics and the Eurozone at the Bank of Spain; Alejandro Padilla, Chief Economist at Banorte, and Juan Cerruti, Chief Economist at Santander. This will be followed by a panel dedicated to sustainable investment in the region.</p>
<p>The opening lunch will be at 14 hours, with David Jim&eacute;nez Blanco, Vice-President of BME, giving the welcome address, and Amparo L&oacute;pez Senovilla, Secretary of State for Trade, making a special speech. Carlos Rey de Vicente, Santander's regional head of South America, and Juan Aguayo, partner at Cuatrecasas, will also participate. The last panel of the first day, in the afternoon, will be dedicated to investment opportunities in the region.</p>
<p>On Wednesday 20 November, three more panels will be held on current issues. At 10 a.m., there will be a debate on the progress, challenges and prospects of renewable energies in Latin America, and later it will be the turn of Ibero-American companies to play an increasingly important role in investment in Spain and the role of strategic technologies such as Artificial Intelligence for the development of the region.</p>
<p>Among the companies attending the event are Latin American companies such as Cox Energy, Engie Energ&iacute;a Chile, Grupo Energ&iacute;a Bogot&aacute;, Grupo Financiero Banorte, Grupo Financiero Inbursa, Neoenergia, Rotoplas and Volc&aacute;n Compa&ntilde;&iacute;a Minera, and Spanish listed companies with business in Latin America such as Iberdrola, Telef&oacute;nica, BBVA, IAG, Telef&oacute;nica and Repsol.</p>
<p>Santander and Cuatrecasas are the main sponsors of the Latibex Forum, which has Morningstar, CFA Society Spain, ICEX and World Television (wtv.) as sponsors and the BME Institute, Atribus and the Spanish Institute of Analysts as collaborators.</p>
<p>You can find more information about the Forum&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forolatibex.com/ing/Home">on their website</a>&nbsp;and register to follow the panels&nbsp;<a href="https://register.forolatibex.com/foro-latibex-2024/register?lang=en">on this link</a>.</p>

<title>Remarks To The Small Business Capital Formation Advisory Committee, SEC Commissioner Mark T. Uyeda, Washington D.C., Nov. 13, 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/remarks-to-the-small-business-capital-formation-advisory-committee-sec-commissi-10/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/remarks-to-the-small-business-capital-formation-advisory-committee-sec-commissi-10/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good morning. First, I would like to echo Erica and my fellow Commissioners in extending a warm welcome to the newest members of the Committee. I appreciate your commitment to public service and look forward to your contributions to the Committee&rsquo;s work, which has included recommendations on the accredited investor definition and Regulation Crowdfunding, and looking at changes to the Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) Program. Today, the Committee continues to discuss important issues, including how venture capital funds raise capital, the section 3(c)(1) exception under the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the challenges that emerging managers face in raising capital and finding investment opportunities.</p>
<p>As you will hear about in more detail from Commission staff, section 3(c)(1) permits a private fund to raise capital without registration, provided that there are 100 or fewer beneficial owners and the fund is not making a public offering. Section 3(c)(1) also provides under certain conditions that certain venture capital funds with less than $12 million in aggregate capital contributions and uncalled committed capital are not required to register, so long as there are 250 or fewer beneficial owners.</p>
<p>Private and venture capital funds can provide nontraditional funding to small startups to help them innovate and grow. I wonder, however, if section 3(c)(1)&rsquo;s 100 investor limit for private funds remains appropriate. This limitation dates back to 1940, while the venture capital exception was promulgated by Congress as part of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018.</p>
<p>Much has changed since 1940. In some ways, it may be easier for smaller funds to raise capital, considering that they may engage in general solicitation by using the internet or other means if all of the purchasers are accredited, among other things. However, the 100 investor limit may be too small to effectively contribute capital to small businesses or to be successful as an ongoing fund. I look forward to hearing about the Committee and guests&rsquo; insights about smaller private and venture capital funds, emerging managers, and how to facilitate capital raising for smaller businesses.</p>
<p>I have been particularly concerned about the lack of appropriately tailored and therefore disproportionate compliance burdens on small advisers starting out. This can be a significant barrier to entry and a hurdle for emerging fund managers.</p>
<p>Thanks again to the Committee for their continued commitment to small business and I hope you have a successful and productive meeting.</p>

<title>Finansinspektionen: Amal Express Shall Pay An Administrative Fine</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Amal Express Ekonomisk f&ouml;rening shall pay an administrative fine of SEK 100,000.</span></p>
<div class="editor-content">
<p>Amal Express Ekonomisk f&ouml;rening is a registered payment service provider pursuant to the Payment Services Act (2010:751). The association offers cross-border money remittances via informal remittance systems, so-called hawala, to Somalia, other countries in Eastern Africa and other locations. Cross-border transactions &ndash; in some cases for a significant value &ndash; have been executed through the hawala service, and to some extent these transactions have been paid in cash. The service has entailed a high risk of money laundering and terrorist financing, and Amal has thus been exposed to a high risk of being used for such purposes. Given this background, the association has been obligated to take particularly strong measures.</p>
<p>Finansinspektionen has investigated Amal's compliance with the anti-money laundering regulations and identified deficiencies in the company's general risk assessment, customer risk classification, and due diligence measures.</p>
<p>These relate to central provisions in the anti-money laundering regulations, and Finansinspektionen makes the assessment that there is cause to view these breaches seriously. This applies in particular given that Amal should have taken particularly strong measures to counteract the high risk of the payment system provided by the association being used for money laundering and terrorism financing. Amal has taken a number of measures to rectify the deficiencies Finansinspektionen identified. Finansinspektionen therefore makes the assessment that the expectation that Amal will be able to comply with the regulations going forward is sufficient to only issue an administrative fine of SEK 100,000.</p>

<title>Prepared Remarks Before The Small Business Capital Formation Advisory Committee, SEC Chair Gary Gensler, Washington D.C., Nov. 13, 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/prepared-remarks-before-the-small-business-capital-formation-advisory-committee-9/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/prepared-remarks-before-the-small-business-capital-formation-advisory-committee-9/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good morning. I&rsquo;m pleased to speak with the Small Business Capital Formation Advisory Committee. As is customary, I&rsquo;d like to note that my views are my own as Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and I am not speaking on behalf of my fellow Commissioners or the staff.</p>
<p>I want to welcome the four new members to the Committee. I thank each of you for your willingness to serve, and for bringing your important perspectives on behalf of investors.</p>
<p>Today, I understand the Committee will focus on three topics, ranging from venture capital fundraising to exemptions for private fund advisers, and lastly the challenges faced by new fund managers.</p>
<p>With regards to the first topic, venture capital funds play an important role in alternative capital raising. Their advisers also give advice to startups and entrepreneurs themselves.</p>
<p>Small and early-stage funds often start out raising money from friends and family. Success, though, often means eventually outstripping those friends&rsquo; and families&rsquo; available capital. That&rsquo;s why both relationship-based fundraising and public advertising can play critical roles at different stages.</p>
<p>Together, these fundraising methods have helped develop our vibrant private markets alongside our robust public markets. I believe Congress understood this by including in the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940 certain exemptions from adviser registration and from being an investment company. Today, the $30 trillion private fund sector&mdash;private equity, private credit funds, hedge funds, venture capital&mdash;in aggregate surpasses the size of the U.S. banking sector.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-prepared-remarks-small-business-capital-formation-advisory-committee-111324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>In addition, I understand the Committee also will hear about challenges facing new fund managers. A core principle of our securities laws is about fairness and access. Regardless of anyone&rsquo;s background, color, gender, or geography, anyone who wishes to access our capital markets should have the same opportunities to do so. I look forward to hearing about how the SEC can best support those who are just starting out in the fund management business.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<title>DTCC’s FICC Enhances VaR Calculator Capabilities, As Firms Prepare For The U.S. Treasury Clearing Requirements - New Cross Margining And Repo Calculator Functionalities Will Enhance Users’ Understanding Of Risk Management And Margin Requirements</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/dtccs-ficc-enhances-var-calculator-capabilities-as-firms-prepare-for-the-us/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/dtccs-ficc-enhances-var-calculator-capabilities-as-firms-prepare-for-the-us/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the premier post-trade market infrastructure for the global financial services industry, today announced the launch of enhancements to its interactive, public-facing Value at Risk (VaR) calculator adding cross-margining and repo transaction functionalities. These enhanced risk tools are intended to support firms as they prepare for the expansion of U.S. Treasury Clearing in 2025 and 2026.</p>
<p>The calculator functionality, developed for the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation&rsquo;s (FICC) Government Securities Division (GSD), provides users with estimated calculations of potential cross-margining reductions at FICC as well as other enhancements.</p>
<p>The new tools follow a significant surge in FICC's GSD total volume activity, which is now clearing a record-setting USD$8.8 trillion in average daily activity as of October. By providing users with access to new tools, firms can enhance their understanding of GSD&rsquo;s risk management and margin requirements capabilities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;FICC is the leading provider of trade comparison, netting and settlement for U.S. Treasury transactions, and we continue to innovate and provide increased transparency to meet the needs of the industry as the markets evolve,&rdquo; said Laura Klimpel, Managing Director, Head of DTCC's Fixed Income and Financing Solutions. &ldquo;FICC is laser-focused on providing the highest level of service and value to our diverse set of clients.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cross-margining VaR calculator enables users to estimate the potential cross-margin reduction on a sample portfolio containing GSD cash positions and CME Group futures solely based on FICC&rsquo;s cross-margining methodology. Participants can determine whether they can take advantage of greater margin savings on a combined portfolio, including eligible positions at GSD and future contracts.</p>
<p>Traders can use these tools collectively to calculate all available margins across multiple accounts using portfolio management to offset trades, which helps with capital efficiencies and may serve to reduce the need for unnecessary position liquidation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our risk management team is focused on creating new capabilities that support greater transparency for market participants. These enhancements represent a significant step forward to better understanding and managing members&rsquo; obligations while ultimately safeguarding the Treasury Market,&rdquo; said Tim Hulse, Managing Director, Financial Risk &amp; Governance at DTCC.</p>

<p><span><span class="x-el x-el-span c2-3i c2-3j c2-3 c2-59 c2-3r c2-3o c2-5a c2-5d" style="text-decoration: underline;">SSImple</span>, the innovative FinTech that advances compliance with expected FMSB and FCA requirements through automated SSI solutions in support of T+1 settlement, today announced the successful closure of its latest funding round. With 16 firms live on its platform, SSImple is experiencing accelerated demand for its SSI service.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As part of its strategic expansion, SSImple welcomes Keith Tippell as Chief Commercial Officer. Effective immediately, Mr Tippell brings over two decades of experience in capital markets and FinTech leadership, most recently serving as Chief Product Officer at CLS Group, with prior senior roles at Droit Financial Technologies, SWIFT, and Markit Group (now a part of S&amp;P Global).&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Bill Meenaghan, CEO at SSImple, said: "This latest funding milestone, alongside Keith's welcome appointment, marks a significant moment for SSImple. Keith's proven track record and deep industry knowledge make him an asset as we scale. Since launching, we have clearly demonstrated product fit with 16 firms now live, formed partnerships with several established providers, including EquiLend and Delta Capita, and earned recognition as a 'FinTech One to Watch'. With Keith on board, we're well-positioned to drive our mission forward."</span></p>
<p><span>Keith Tippell, SSImple's new Chief Commercial Officer, said: "I'm pleased to join SSImple at such an exciting time. Fully automating the SSI process has evolved into a key priority for the industry, and I look forward to working with SSImple to transform how SSIs are managed as settlement cycles shorten and regulatory compliance becomes more urgent."</span></p>
<p><span>The announcement comes as the financial sector prepares for significant regulatory changes. In July, the Financial Markets Standards Board (FMSB) issued a recommendation advocating for SSI automation, urging member firms to annually attest to these guidelines &ndash; likely expected by the end of 2025. Additionally, the UK Accelerated Settlement Taskforce has underscored the necessity of SSI automation in its interim report, aiming to expedite the UK securities settlement cycle from T+2 to T+1. Furthermore, FMSB's recommendation will soon be integrated into the Financial Conduct Authority's (FCA)'s 'Post-Trade Code of Conduct.'&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The total amount raised has not been disclosed.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://ses.prsts.de/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.quincy-data.com/1/01020193252f1683-12bb28fe-85e6-41b4-a333-1e84b65d8af8-000000/DiUEDDUI45nYIDm_x6jGVLKt_Bacofuy2Qgtk9Jdx6w=379" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Quincy Data</a>, the leading ultra-low latency market data technology provider, today announced a time synchronization service covering major US financial exchanges that is precise to sub-nanoseconds. Quincy&rsquo;s Time Synchronization as a Service (TSaaS) provides a plug-and-play solution for precise time distribution across the New Jersey and Chicago metro regions. As trading firms seek greater precision and resilience, Quincy's TSaaS simplifies the complexity of building advanced time distribution systems in-house.</p>
<p>Quincy Data co-founder Bob Meade commented: &ldquo;Quincy Data is uniquely positioned to provide a unified and resilient time synchronization service across multiple exchange trading locations. We leveraged our deep experience in ultra-low latency engineering to provide a service many firms can utilize.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quincy Data co-founder Stephane Tyc said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s expensive for individual firms to build and very challenging to maintain these extremely precise systems. The idea of a shared service is at the very heart of what Quincy Data provides its clients.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pursuit of ultra-low latency in the current trading environment increasingly demands time measurement with sub-nanosecond accuracy. The Quincy Data service addresses two key challenges firms face trading financial markets: synchronizing clocks beyond local data centers and ensuring traceability to an official time standard. Quincy TSaaS comprises two fault-tolerant White Rabbit networks, one in the New Jersey metro area and one in the Chicago metro area, ensuring reliable sub-nanosecond precision within each metro area.</p>

<p align="left"><span>Ghana</span>&nbsp;has announced a major step forward under its agreement with&nbsp;<span>Singapore</span>&nbsp;on carbon markets by operationalising the digital trading and settlement of Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs) under Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />This development follows the May 2024 Implementation Agreement between the two countries, and marks a pivotal milestone, as Ghana strengthens its leadership in African carbon markets, while Singapore continues to establish itself as a global hub for carbon credit trading.</p>

<p>Dr. John Kingsley Krugu, Executive Director of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in Ghana commented,&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;With the work EPA and other bodies in Ghana have been doing, the country has shown it can be a pioneer in making Article 6.2 related ITMO activity a reality under its implementation agreement with Singapore."&nbsp;</em>He added,<em>&nbsp;&ldquo;We are delighted that ZERO13 is working with us to make this operational with its ITMO Trading Hub connecting to Ghana Carbon Registry.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The first projects to be activated via this digital infrastructure are Ghana&rsquo;s Article 6.2 related ITMO Projects. Generating ITMOs for trade will connect Ghana&rsquo;s environmental activities to global markets. These projects focus on multiple sectors, including sustainable land use through agroforestry, furthering Ghana's commitment to mitigating climate change.<br />&nbsp;<br />This partnership enables Singaporean companies to access high-quality carbon credits from Ghanaian projects helping to meet their emissions reduction targets while supporting economic and environmental well-being of Ghanaian communities.<br />&nbsp;<br />The Ghana Carbon Registry will be fully internationalised, with support from ZERO13&rsquo;s blockchain-enabled platform. This transformation ensures that carbon credits are securely issued, tracked, traded and settled, focussing on transparency and efficiency. Additionally, the platform will facilitate auctions for Ghanaian carbon credits. The auction mechanism will provide access to global buyers and ensure competitive pricing, maximising the value of Ghana&rsquo;s carbon credits.<br />&nbsp;<br />Hirander Misra, CEO of ZERO13, commented:&nbsp;<em>"We are delighted to be part of this collaboration and demonstrate how technology can play a crucial role in advancing climate action. By leveraging our blockchain enabled digital ITMO Trading Hub and settlement network, we are enabling secure and transparent carbon trading that supports national climate targets and economic growth as well as generating opportunities for local communities.&rdquo;</em><br />&nbsp;<br />Showcasing at COP29, the solution serves as an example of how countries can implement Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement to build effective carbon markets. By combining Ghana&rsquo;s natural resources with the sustainable finance and trading capabilities available in Singapore, the two nations are setting a precedent for international collaboration on carbon markets and climate action. These projects will not only address climate goals but also bring tangible benefits to local communities, including job creation, energy access, and environmental improvements.</p>

<title>Comment By Douglas Grant, Group CEO Of Manx Financial Group, On Introduction Of Private Stock Market, PISCES, Presenting A Threat To AIM</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The UK government is set to unveil plans for a groundbreaking private stock market tomorrow to revitalise the country's dwindling IPO pipeline. In her inaugural Mansion House speech, UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves will disclose proposals to legislate for a regulated stock exchange system named Pisces by next May. According to Treasury sources, this platform will allow investors to trade shares in private companies.</p>
<p><b>Commenting on the Government&rsquo;s introduction of private stock market, PISCES, presenting a threat to AIM, Douglas Grant, Group CEO of Manx Financial Group,</b>&nbsp;said:&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;Any mechanism that enables entrepreneurs to unlock equity is a welcome innovation. However, it's unclear why this approach would necessarily lead to an increase in IPO activity. Given that PISCES serves as an alternative to more heavily regulated stock exchanges, there is a reasonable concern that platforms like AIM might perceive it as a competitive threat, potentially affecting their market position. Additionally, a vital factor that requires consideration is the alignment of tax strategies to incentivise entrepreneur participation. Without a supportive tax framework, uptake may be limited.</i></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;One of the most promising aspects highlighted in the introduction of PISCES is the potential to enhance liquidity within capital markets by de-regulating fragmented local pension schemes. This approach has proven to be a highly effective tool in other jurisdictions, driving growth and providing more robust market dynamics. Encouraging a similar transformation could yield significant economic benefits.&rdquo;</i></p>

<title>FSB - The Importance Of Resolution Planning And Loss-Absorbing Capacity For Banks Systemic In Failure: Public Statement</title>

<p>Ensuring bank resolvability remains the most efficient way to tackle the problem of the implicit &lsquo;too big to fail&rsquo; subsidy for big banks and to avoid a bail-out by the taxpayer.<span class="fn"><a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/11/the-importance-of-resolution-planning-and-loss-absorbing-capacity-for-banks-systemic-in-failure-public-statement/#ed32c875-f67c-43ab-9b41-2efb111932f2" id="ed32c875-f67c-43ab-9b41-2efb111932f2-link">1</a></span>&nbsp;The lessons from the 2023 bank failures reinforced the need to maintain momentum and advance the work on bank resolvability and to avoid complacency.<span class="fn"><a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/11/the-importance-of-resolution-planning-and-loss-absorbing-capacity-for-banks-systemic-in-failure-public-statement/#1b26104a-c1b7-4052-81c1-44c6d75d6b8f" id="1b26104a-c1b7-4052-81c1-44c6d75d6b8f-link">2</a></span>&nbsp;That experience underscored that any financial institution that could be systemically significant or critical if it fails should be subject to a resolution regime that has the attributes set out in the FSB&nbsp;<em>Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions (Key Attributes)</em>.<span class="fn"><a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/11/the-importance-of-resolution-planning-and-loss-absorbing-capacity-for-banks-systemic-in-failure-public-statement/#4b493427-4d87-40ec-9183-3997fe66a9bd" id="4b493427-4d87-40ec-9183-3997fe66a9bd-link">3</a></span>&nbsp;The FSB&rsquo;s work on bank resolution until now has primarily focused on global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). Significant progress has been made to enhance their resolvability since the adoption of the FSB&rsquo;s Key Attributes. However, existing FSB guidance on resolution planning and resolution execution may also be relevant for other banks that may be systemically significant or critical if they fail (&ldquo;banks systemic in failure&rdquo;). The failure of such banks could also have severe consequences for the financial system or the broader economy, and authorities and such banks should be prepared for resolution. Previous FSB evaluations,<span class="fn"><a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/11/the-importance-of-resolution-planning-and-loss-absorbing-capacity-for-banks-systemic-in-failure-public-statement/#38aa26c1-b955-4549-87be-24d1d350ff3c" id="38aa26c1-b955-4549-87be-24d1d350ff3c-link">4</a></span>&nbsp;peer reviews,<span class="fn"><a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/11/the-importance-of-resolution-planning-and-loss-absorbing-capacity-for-banks-systemic-in-failure-public-statement/#2b0edc87-f4b4-4228-8681-0396318824c6" id="2b0edc87-f4b4-4228-8681-0396318824c6-link">5</a></span>&nbsp;and technical work undertaken by the FSB<span class="fn"><a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/11/the-importance-of-resolution-planning-and-loss-absorbing-capacity-for-banks-systemic-in-failure-public-statement/#ddee2f22-7847-4809-9a5c-3ea5b5766667" id="ddee2f22-7847-4809-9a5c-3ea5b5766667-link">6</a></span>&nbsp;suggest further work is needed on operationalising resolution planning for these banks. The current statement aims to clarify the importance of resolution preparedness for these banks, recognising that the principles outlined are already established for G-SIBs.</p>
<p>Following the March 2023 bank failures,<span class="fn"><a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/11/the-importance-of-resolution-planning-and-loss-absorbing-capacity-for-banks-systemic-in-failure-public-statement/#99071374-f12c-4277-8319-85559a1e547a" id="99071374-f12c-4277-8319-85559a1e547a-link">7</a></span>&nbsp;the FSB held a workshop on banks systemic in failure. This statement is informed by discussions at that workshop and other ongoing work. Below are some considerations to inform jurisdictions&rsquo; regulatory and policy frameworks for the resolution preparedness of banks systemic in failure. Besides its work on G-SIBs, the FSB will continue to consider banks systemic in failure in its future work on bank resolution planning topics.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a><span>Authorities should assess which banks may be systemically significant or critical if they fail</span></a></h4>
<p>Resolution authorities, in coordination with other relevant authorities, should assess which banks may be systemically significant or critical if they fail. Authorities should ensure they have sufficient information to make this assessment in normal times and in a crisis. This also includes banks that were not explicitly designated as systemically significant or critical prior to their failure.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><span>Authorities and banks systemic in failure should be prepared for resolution</span></h4>
<p>Authorities should have the appropriate resources, tools, and powers to, if needed, resolve banks systemic in failure. Authorities&rsquo; preparedness includes having an up-to-date assessment of the options available to conduct such resolution, and assurance that such options can be implemented quickly and effectively. &nbsp;Banks systemic in failure should ensure they are resolvable in a way that protects their critical functions without severe systemic disruption and avoids the use of taxpayers&rsquo; money.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><span>Authorities should consider the need for loss-absorbing capacity</span></h4>
<p>Loss-absorbing capacity (LAC) on the balance sheet of a bank enhances authorities&rsquo; ability to resolve the bank without severe systemic disruptions and without the use of taxpayers&rsquo; money. It also provides for an additional layer of loss-absorption that may prevent negative systemic effects and uninsured depositors from taking losses, which may forestall or reduce deposit runs.</p>
<p>At the same time, banks and banking systems in different jurisdictions have different characteristics. For this reason, jurisdictions need to consider how to best implement the concept of LAC for banks established in their jurisdictions. Some TLAC Principles for G-SIBs are relevant also for other banks systemic in failure. A number of FSB jurisdictions have already adopted external LAC requirements for banks, beyond G-SIBs, that could be systemically significant or critical if they fail, where authorities set the amount, quantity and implementation timeline on a case-by-case basis. Such LAC requirements are for instance applied to all banks (EU, Hong Kong, UK), to D-SIBs (Canada, Mexico, Switzerland), or to a subset of D-SIBs (Japan).<span class="fn"><a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/11/the-importance-of-resolution-planning-and-loss-absorbing-capacity-for-banks-systemic-in-failure-public-statement/#1a9c2d5f-26e8-4b5b-84b8-1e92549d62af" id="1a9c2d5f-26e8-4b5b-84b8-1e92549d62af-link">8</a></span></p>

<p>IOSCO has today published a&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iosco.org%2Flibrary%2Fpubdocs%2Fpdf%2FIOSCOPD772.pdf&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cmailing-lists%40iosco.org%7C6a1fb94c619443f453f408dd03b68f0f%7Cbcc6c66cdb3b48328af2cc363a097444%7C0%7C0%7C638670804819939171%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=U%2BJmfw3y9yH%2F5PIBbSJHqHeaqn%2BLiK7gvmLEnawFB0I%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Report</a>&nbsp;on Transition Plans Disclosures. Developed by IOSCO&rsquo;s Sustainable Finance Taskforce (STF), the Report sets out how transition plans disclosures can support the objectives of investor protection and market integrity, shares challenges and key findings which point towards a series of coordinated actions for IOSCO and other stakeholders to consider in the future which concern four main aspects:</p>
<ol>
<li>Where transition plans are published, encouraging consistency and comparability through guidance on transition plan disclosures,</li>
<li>promoting assurance of transition plan disclosures;</li>
<li>enhancing legal and regulatory clarity and oversight, and</li>
<li>building capacity.</li>
</ol>
<p>On consistency and comparability, stakeholders suggested additional guidance on transition plans disclosures could clarify disclosure expectations and lead towards more standardized information. They see alignment of guidance on transition plans disclosures as key so that investors can understand and compare information across different jurisdictions, even though national transition plans requirements may differ.</p>
<p>IOSCO&rsquo;s Report therefore welcomes the IFRS Foundation&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifrs.org%2Fnews-and-events%2Fnews%2F2024%2F06%2Fissb-delivers-further-harmonisation-of-the-sustainability-disclosure-landscape-new-work-plan%2F&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cmailing-lists%40iosco.org%7C6a1fb94c619443f453f408dd03b68f0f%7Cbcc6c66cdb3b48328af2cc363a097444%7C0%7C0%7C638670804819961174%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=jnjURxltFxT8bkS9OaNkhXmcE25L%2FWWX8kqF9ZCRnvw%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">plan</a>&nbsp;to develop educational material and, if needed, application guidance to support transition plans disclosures that provide investors with the information needed to make informed decisions about risks and opportunities. IOSCO encourages the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) to maintain a high level of interoperability of the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards with key jurisdictional standards as they develop this educational material.</p>
<p>To enhance clarity, IOSCO also encourages relevant standard setters to consider providing markers on what would constitute forward-looking information, in accordance with their standards and governance processes. This can support reporting entities in managing potential liability risks while disclosing much needed forward-looking, climate-related, information.</p>
<p><strong>Jean-Paul Servais, Chair of IOSCO&rsquo;s Board</strong>&nbsp;and Chair of the Belgium Financial Services &amp; Markets Authority (FSMA), said:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Climate transition plans are becoming increasingly used by companies. To help investors and issuers, IOSCO publishes today a comprehensive report on transition plan disclosures. In this respect, IOSCO welcomes the ISSB&rsquo;s announcement on developing educational materials in this area and invites them to continue their efforts with regards to alignment of standards and guidance. We will continue to engage with the ISSB in this process.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The Report highlights the five most useful components of transition plans disclosures that were suggested by market participants in IOSCO&rsquo;s outreach:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ambition and targets;</li>
<li>Decarbonization levers and action plan;</li>
<li>Governance and oversight;</li>
<li>Financial resources and human capital, and;</li>
<li>Financial implications.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Rodrigo Buenaventura, Chair of IOSCO&rsquo;s Sustainable Finance Task Force</strong>, commented:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Comparable, consistent and reliable disclosures of transition plans may have a positive effect on market participants&rsquo; ability to make informed decisions, ultimately benefiting both investors and the integrity of the capital markets. High-quality transition plans are key to navigate the transition towards lower GHG emissions, a climate-resilient global economy and are relevant to all jurisdictions, entities and investors&rdquo;</em>.</p>
<p>IOSCO intends to continue its engagement with key stakeholders, including the IFRS Foundation, while promoting market integrity and mitigating greenwashing risks with regards to transition plans, thus supporting investors&rsquo; informational needs and the ability of markets to price sustainability-related risks and opportunities and support capital allocation.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority To Consult On Extending The Time Motor Finance Firms Have To Handle Commission Complaints</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-to-consult-on-extending-the-time-motor-finance-fi/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-to-consult-on-extending-the-time-motor-finance-fi/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 fca-about">
<div class="container">
<p>The decision to consult follows the Court of Appeal&rsquo;s judgment in Hopcraft v Close Brothers Ltd, Johnson v Firstrand Bank Ltd, and Wrench v Firstrand Bank Ltd.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA will consult on extending the time firms have to respond to consumer complaints about motor finance where a non-discretionary commission was involved, and for consumers to refer them to the Financial Ombudsman Service. The proposals are expected to be published within 2 weeks and, if taken forward, would mean the complaint extension is in place by mid-December 2024. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA&rsquo;s decision to consult follows the Court of Appeal&rsquo;s 25 October judgment in Hopcraft v Close Brothers Ltd, Johnson v Firstrand Bank Ltd, and Wrench v Firstrand Bank Ltd. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Since that judgment, the FCA, as part of its close market monitoring, has undertaken extensive industry engagement. The regulator joined an industry and government discussion, convened its own industry roundtable and has spoken with 63 firms. The FCA has also discussed the judgment&rsquo;s implications with consumer representatives.</p>
<p>Motor finance firms are likely to receive a high volume of complaints in response to the recent Court of Appeal judgment. Any complaint extension would allow them time to consider how these might be efficiently and effectively handled. This would help prevent disorderly, inconsistent and inefficient outcomes for consumers making complaints, motor finance firms and the market.</p>
<p>In Hopcraft, Johnson and Wrench, the Court of Appeal decided it was unlawful for the brokers (car dealers) to receive a commission from the lender providing motor finance without obtaining the customer&rsquo;s informed consent to the payment. This required the consumer to be told all material facts, including the amount of the commission and how it was to be calculated. The judgment related to fixed commission in motor finance agreements as well as discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs), which were banned by the FCA in 2021.</p>
<p>The focus of the Court of Appeal decision is common law, rather than FCA rules or principles. Firms authorised by the FCA must meet wider legal requirements as well as regulatory rules. The interpretation of common law is rightly for the courts. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The 2 lenders involved in the cases intend to appeal. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The proposed complaint extension will cover at least the period until the Supreme Court decides whether to grant permission to appeal. The FCA will include options on the length of the proposed extension in its consultation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA will write to the Supreme Court asking it to decide quickly whether it will give permission to appeal and, if it does, to consider it as soon as possible, given the potential impact of any judgment on the market and the consumers who rely on it. If permission to appeal is granted, the FCA will consider intervening to share its expertise to assist the Court.</p>
<p>Motor finance firms will need to use the time provided to ensure they have the resources to issue final responses to complaints at the end of a proposed extension. Motor finance firms are also likely to need to consider whether they should make any financial provisions as complaints need to be handled in line with the law. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Customers who believe they have cause to complain about commission arrangements should make them as normal. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>FCA review into historical DCAs in motor finance</h2>
<p>In January this year,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/fca-undertake-work-motor-finance-market" title="FCA to undertake work in the motor finance market">the FCA launched a review</a>&nbsp;of historical motor finance DCAs across several firms. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The review seeks to understand if there was widespread misconduct related to DCAs before the 2021 ban, if consumers have lost out and, if so, the best way to make sure any compensation owed is received in an appropriate settlement in an orderly, consistent and efficient way.</p>
<p>Alongside the review, motor finance firms were given more time to provide final responses to complaints about motor finance where a DCA was involved, and consumers more time to refer their complaints to the Financial Ombudsman. This was to prevent disorderly, inconsistent and inefficient outcomes for consumers and knock-on effects on firms and the market while the FCA reviewed the issue and determined the best way forward.</p>
<p>In September,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/extension-motor-finance-complaint-handling-pause-confirmed" title="Extension to motor finance complaint handling pause confirmed">the FCA further extended this</a>&nbsp;until 4 December 2025. This was because it had taken longer than expected to get the data needed for the review. Before deciding its next steps, the FCA also wanted to take account of relevant court decisions. These included the recent Court of Appeal judgment and the outcome of the judicial review, heard in October 2024, by Barclays Partner Finance of a Financial Ombudsman decision relating to a DCA in a motor finance agreement, on which judgment is expected shortly. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA is considering what impact the Court of Appeal&rsquo;s judgment has on the review into historical DCAs in motor finance, including for both its timeline and scope. This will inevitably be heavily influenced by any decision of the Supreme Court to hear an appeal and, should it do so, its timelines.</p>

<title>Supporting Confidence In Our Credit System Through Good Consumer Outcomes, Address By ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court At The Australian Financial Security Authority Summit, 13 November 2024</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/supporting-confidence-in-our-credit-system-through-good-consumer-outcomes-addre/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul>
<li>Protecting consumers &ndash; especially financially vulnerable consumers &ndash; from harm is an enduring priority for ASIC.</li>
<li>ASIC is particularly concerned with predatory lending practices and business models we consider are designed to circumvent consumer protections.</li>
<li>We have a number of court cases seeking to crack down on this type of behaviour.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good morning to you all.</p>
<p>I would like to begin by acknowledging the Gadigal people as the traditional owners and custodians of the land we are meeting on. I pay my respects to their elders past, present and emerging &ndash; and extend that respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people here today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pleasure to be here this morning &ndash; and, on behalf of my fellow panellists, can I first thank AFSA for bringing us together for this important conversation.</p>
<p>I have been invited to open this session with some reflections on what stewardship means to ASIC and how our work &ndash; together with that of our fellow regulators &ndash; promotes confidence in the credit system.</p>
<p>To frame that discussion, I will start by briefly outlining ASIC&rsquo;s role within the credit system &ndash; and then talk about some of the work we are doing in this area.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The examples I will draw on include our work on financial hardship, which to my mind most effectively demonstrates ASIC&rsquo;s stewardship role in action. I also want to talk about some of our other work in relation to vulnerable consumers, particularly in regard to recent credit-related enforcement action.</p>
<h2>ASIC&rsquo;s role within the credit system</h2>
<p>First to ASIC&rsquo;s role in the credit system. Like each of the agencies represented on this panel, ASIC has a distinct remit &ndash; and that remit brings us each into contact with different participants in the credit system.</p>
<p>In ASIC&rsquo;s case, the participants we most often interact with are the entities that we regulate &ndash; which includes the consumer credit sector. In that sense, our role as a steward is to affect change &ndash; at the company level &ndash; to drive good consumer outcomes.</p>
<p>How does ASIC affect that change? The short answer is by promoting a culture of compliance and accountability. We have a suite of regulatory resources to achieve this &ndash; up to and including enforcement action.</p>
<p>Our resources are, of course, finite. So we must make decisions about where to direct them to achieve the maximum impact. That means identifying and targeting what we consider to be the most significant sources of harm.</p>
<p>In the face of ongoing cost-of-living pressures, it&rsquo;s fair to say we are having reported to us significant levels of credit and debt related harms. As such, protecting consumers &ndash; especially vulnerable consumers &ndash; from poor conduct across the sector is an enduring priority for ASIC.</p>
<h2>Financial hardship</h2>
<p>As you may be aware, financial hardship has been an area of sustained focus for us for some time. You are likely aware of this because one of the most effective regulatory resources we have to affect change is communication &ndash; and we have been unequivocal in our public commentary and in our engagement with lenders about the importance of the hardship obligations.</p>
<p>I want to share with you a high-level timeline of our financial hardship work. Not only because of its relevance to our discussion today. But also because it provides an example of stewardship in action &ndash; and the different regulatory and enforcement levers we have at our disposal to help achieve fairness and good consumer outcomes in the credit system.</p>
<p>In mid-2023, we began seeing evidence of increasing levels of financial distress among consumers. Through our supervisory work we also saw signs that some large lenders did not appear to be meeting their obligations to customers in financial hardship.</p>
<p>In August that year we wrote an open letter to lenders, communicating our expectations. We then commenced an extensive data collection exercise, collecting 900,000 hardship notices from 30 lenders, relating to half a million credit accounts across a two-year period.</p>
<p>We also commenced a deeper review into 10 particular home lenders. We analysed data on how notices were handled, reviewed 80 case studies and conducted site visits involving over 170 staff.</p>
<p>In the course of this work, we observed that lenders were not providing adequate information to their customers about hardship. Some failed to identify when a customer was giving a hardship notice &ndash; meaning that customers either didn&rsquo;t receive timely assistance or didn&rsquo;t receive assistance at all.</p>
<p>We also observed that the process was confusing and frustrating. So much so, that around one in three applicants (35%) dropped out on at least one occasion after giving a hardship notice.</p>
<p>We communicated these findings and our recommendations in a report released in May:<em>&nbsp;&lsquo;Hardship, hard to get help: Lenders fall short in financial hardship support&rsquo;&nbsp;</em>(<a href="https://download.asic.gov.au/media/ud5mhogp/rep783-published-20-may-2024.pdf">REP 783</a>).</p>
<p>We also provided individual written feedback to each lender in our review and asked them to prepare an action plan. We are following up to ensure those actions are taken &ndash; and are considering further regulatory action in relation to some issues we identified through the review.</p>
<p>Coinciding with the publication of our report, ASIC&rsquo;s Moneysmart website launched it&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://moneysmart.gov.au/just-ask-your-lender-for-help" title="Moneysmart's 'Just Ask' campaign">&lsquo;Just Ask&rsquo;</a>&nbsp;campaign. The objective of this campaign was both to raise consumers' awareness about their rights in relation to hardship notifications &ndash; and to break down the emotional barriers preventing them from seeking assistance.</p>
<p>We are continuing to collect hardship-related data until at least June 2025 &ndash; and will further engage with lenders where we identify indicators of poor customer outcomes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An additional and important component of our work in relation to hardship is enforcement. In September 2023, ASIC commenced civil penalty proceedings in the Federal Court against Westpac, alleging it had failed to respond to customers&rsquo; hardship notices on multiple occasions within the time required by law.</p>
<p>We took court action to underline our concerns as to the seriousness of this issue for the consumers affected, and to send a broader message to the industry about our likely approach in circumstances where the issues we had identified are not rectified.</p>
<h2>Enforcement</h2>
<p>On that note, I want to turn in more detail to the subject of enforcement &ndash; both as a means to redress specific cases of misconduct and also, as a stewardship tool, to signal a deterrence message to industry more broadly.</p>
<p>ASIC publicly communicates its enforcement priorities each year. In fact, tomorrow at the ASIC Annual Forum I will be announcing our 2025 enforcement priorities.</p>
<p>While I can&rsquo;t divulge the details now, I can say that for as long as we continue to see consumer harms in the credit sector, this will remain a focus for us.</p>
<p>We are particularly concerned with predatory lending practices and business models we consider are designed to circumvent consumer protections &ndash; and we have a number of court cases seeking to crack down on this type of behaviour.</p>
<p>In one of these cases, which commenced a fortnight ago, we allege that a lender called Oak Capital engaged in systemic unconscionable conduct by using a lending model requiring a company to be the named borrower for loans the company did not benefit from, or have any genuine interest in.</p>
<p>We alleged this structure was designed for the purpose of avoiding important consumer credit protections that would apply if the loans had been made to residential borrowers. Despite the purported business loan arrangements, the individuals seeking the loans provided their own homes as security &ndash; and, given their distressed financial circumstances, several of these individuals defaulted on their loans and Oak Capital repossessed their homes.</p>
<p>As a result of the loans being treated as unregulated, we allege Oak Capital deprived its clients of important consumer protections, including the responsible lending obligations, the right to make a hardship application and protection from being charged excessive interest.</p>
<p>In another recent case, ASIC was successful in proceedings against a company called Rent4Keeps for overcharging vulnerable consumers for essential household goods &ndash; with the Federal Court finding its business model breached the Credit Act.</p>
<p>The court found the arrangements &ndash; which were styled as &lsquo;consumer leases&rsquo; so they would fall outside of the credit protections &ndash; were in fact credit contracts, and that the interest rate cap and other requirements under the Credit Act had been breached. By breaching its obligations, hundreds of its customers were charged well above the amount that could lawfully be charged and did not receive other important consumer protections.</p>
<p>What these two cases have in common, as do several others we are investigating, is a business model that we say has been designed to avoid consumer credit protections.</p>
<p>We have also taken recent action in relation to unlicensed lending practices by car dealerships, and in relation to debt management firms.</p>
<p>Finally, another significant recent enforcement outcome is the case we took against Harvey Norman and Latitude.</p>
<p>Last month the Federal Court found that Harvey Norman Holdings Limited and Latitude Finance Australia had engaged in misleading conduct and made false or misleading representations in relation to a national advertising campaign promoting a 60-month interest-free and no deposit payment method.</p>
<p>ASIC was concerned the advertisements masked the fact consumers were required to take out a credit card, such as the Latitude GO Mastercard, to purchase goods &ndash; and that many may have been unaware of the financial arrangements they were entering into. Namely, a continuing credit contract, requiring them to pay an establishment fee and/or monthly account service fees &ndash; and, in certain circumstances, other types of fees and interest.</p>
<p>These matters are but a small subset of the work we are doing in relation to enforcement of the consumer credit protections. Unfortunately we find there is no end of demand for our attention.</p>
<h2>Promoting confidence in the credit system</h2>
<p>Finally, to address the second part of the question we are here today to discuss: how does all of this promote confidence in the credit system? To answer that, it&rsquo;s worth considering what erodes confidence.</p>
<p>When things go wrong, when consumers are harmed, when they find themselves in debt for products they&rsquo;re being overcharged for &ndash; that erodes confidence at the individual level.</p>
<p>But what erodes confidence in the system itself is when the sector in question falls short of community expectations &ndash; and we need not look too far into the past to see examples of this.</p>
<p>As the lessons from recent history teach us, sustaining a culture of compliance is easier &ndash; and better for all &ndash; than the effort required to correct the course after the fact.</p>
<p>To that end, ASIC continues to collaborate with our peer regulators, including AFSA, APRA and the ATO, to act within our respective remits to promote confidence and good outcomes in the credit system.</p>
<p>Thank you and I look forward to continuing this conversation with my fellow panellists.</p>

<title>ISDA derivatiViews: Finding Contractual Provisions In Stressed Markets</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-derivativiews-finding-contractual-provisions-in-stressed-markets/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When trouble strikes, firms need to get a grip on their derivatives exposures quickly. That can mean having to scour hundreds of pages of paper or PDF documents to determine what options are available, a grueling process that can take time. But in volatile, fast-moving markets, delays cost money. There is a better way. A digital approach to documentation allows firms to zero in on critical clauses at the push of a button. And the latest upgrades to the ISDA MyLibrary digital documentation platform mean that process has become easier than ever before.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.isda.org/isda-solutions-infohub/mylibrary/">MyLibrary is an online hub</a>&nbsp;that houses core ISDA documentation in digital form, including the 2002 ISDA Master Agreement, the 2021 ISDA Interest Rate Derivatives Definitions and the 1998 FX and Currency Option Definitions. Launched in 2021, the platform now hosts over 135 derivatives documents and document versions, giving users the ability to access and navigate commonly used agreements in one place.</p>
<p>As part of a series of recent improvements, the MyLibrary search function has been significantly enhanced, allowing users to rapidly identify all occurrences of specific terms across documents, meaning firms can find the critical provisions, rights and obligations associated with their trades even more quickly than before. Users can also now search by date, ensuring they can, within seconds, drill down to the prevailing primary and ancillary documents at the time a particular trade was executed and digitally bookmark key passages. Both these developments will improve efficiency and reduce risk at times when key contractual terms need to be identified swiftly.</p>
<p>Just think about the alternative. A firm would need to pull together the original document or definitions and all the relevant supplements that prevailed at the time the trade was agreed, then trawl through what could be hundreds of pages to find the pertinent provisions. Bookmarking would basically involve a highlighter pen and sticky notes. That would take manpower and time at a point when every second counts.</p>
<p>Combined with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/isda-solutions-infohub/isda-create/">ISDA Create</a>, a digital platform for the negotiation and execution of derivatives contracts that captures and stores the resulting legal data, firms can access the specific details of their negotiated trades within a few clicks of a mouse, giving them a complete picture of their exposures.</p>
<p>Having reviewed its rights, a firm might opt to take the nuclear option of terminating a trade with a counterparty, but that process has become incredibly complicated in recent years &ndash; something that became clear when Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank failed last year. Specifically, new mandatory margining and collateral segregation requirements for non-cleared derivatives, plus the implementation of bank resolution regimes and the potential for temporary stays on termination, created acute complexities that banks would have been navigating for the first time, potentially slowing their response.</p>
<p>As a remedy, we recently launched the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/isda-close-out-framework/">ISDA Close-out Framework</a>&nbsp;&ndash; essentially, an online decision tree that sets out the questions firms would need to ask, the steps they would need to take and the order in which they would need to take them when dealing with a termination. We&rsquo;ll shortly be launching a series of &lsquo;tabletop&rsquo; exercises, in which senior executives from different parts of a firm will work through a hypothetical termination scenario, using the Close-out Framework as a reference tool. As regulators increasingly focus on internal bank processes for managing the default of a counterparty, we hope this will be a useful preparatory resource to help firms plan for the worst.</p>
<p>A critical part of the close-out process is the physical delivery and receipt of termination notices, but this has long been problematic if firms have moved offices without updating the address details in their documentation. A more recent issue emerged during the pandemic lockdowns, making it extremely difficult to deliver or receive notices.</p>
<p>Our response is the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/isda-solutions-infohub/isda-notices-hub/">ISDA Notices Hub</a>&nbsp;&ndash; an online platform that will enable the instantaneous delivery and receipt of critical termination notices, eliminating risk exposures and potential losses that can result from delays in terminating derivatives contracts. We&rsquo;re currently working on building the platform, which will launch next year on S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence&rsquo;s Counterparty Manager platform.</p>
<p>This is all part of an effort to create a digital solution for managing terminations &ndash; from the review of documents to sending termination notices and navigating the close-out process. Together, these solutions will allow firms to cut errors and risk and redeploy resources, making derivatives markets safer and more efficient, even in the most turbulent of times.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Survey of up to eighty large domestic banks and twenty-four U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks. The Federal Reserve generally conducts the survey quarterly, timing it so that results are available for the January/February, April/May, August, and October/November meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee. The Federal Reserve occasionally conducts one or two additional surveys during the year. Questions cover changes in the standards and terms of the banks' lending and the state of business and household demand for loans. The survey often includes questions on one or two other topics of current interest.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Board of IOSCO congratulates the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) on achieving an important milestone of finalizing their <em>International Standard on Sustainability Assurance (ISSA) 5000, General Requirements for Sustainability Assurance Engagements and Proposed Conforming and Consequential Amendments to Other IAASB Standards</em>.</p>
<p>IOSCO notes the extensive and thorough outreach program conducted by the IAASB throughout the lifecycle of the development of ISSA 5000 and were pleased to have actively participated in many of their activities over this period.</p>
<p>IOSCO reiterates its support for this work and commends the IAASB for its timely development of the Standard in response to the public need for assurance standards to cover all sustainability assurance providers.</p>
<p>The final Standard is responsive to the key considerations and observations set out by IOSCO in its 2023 report and public statement. IOSCO believes the Standard can support high-quality assurance over sustainability-related information and may enhance consistency, comparability and reliability of sustainability-related information provided to the market. The final Standard, together with the IAASB&rsquo;s plan to develop implementation support materials and other capacity-building efforts, can contribute to enhancing trust in the sustainability-related information provided to investors.</p>
<p><strong>Jean-Paul Servais</strong>, Chair of IOSCO, said: &ldquo;When I began my mandate as IOSCO Board Chair, I emphasized the need for speed in developing a comprehensive international regulatory toolkit for sustainability-related disclosures and the assurance thereof. A strong assurance framework for sustainability-related reporting needs to be focused on the public interest and should be profession &ndash; and framework &ndash; agnostic. I commend the IAASB for delivering sustainability assurance standards well on time with a view to enable the assurance of 2024 corporate disclosure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;IOSCO will continue to play a key role in promoting global consistency in the assurance of sustainability-related information&rdquo;, he added.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In recognition of Financial Literacy Month&rsquo;s theme &ldquo;Money on your Mind? Talk about it.&rdquo;, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) urges Canadians to talk openly about financial plans and goals with family members and loved ones to help prevent financial abuse.</p>
<p>According to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/investor-tools/investing-basics/research/#index2024" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CSA's 2024 Investor Index</a>, 36 per cent of Canadians are aware of at least one instance of senior financial abuse &ndash; a seven per cent increase from 2020. Among the most common types of abuse respondents were aware of, were fraudulent investment opportunities, pressure to sign a document that wasn&rsquo;t understood, exploiting a power of attorney for financial gain, and cashing in investments without permission.<br /><br />Beyond financial loss, CSA research also shows that victims of financial fraud experience loss of trust and confidence, higher stress and feelings of anger and depression.<br /><br />"Financial fraud and abuse can have devastating consequences that reach far beyond financial implications," said Stan Magidson, CSA Chair and Chair and CEO of the Alberta Securities Commission. "By having candid conversations about finances, families can break the taboo around discussing money and build important understanding, support and trust that can help safeguard their loved ones&rsquo; well-being."</p>
<p><strong>To help prevent the financial abuse of those you care for, the CSA encourages you to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Have open and honest conversations:</strong>&nbsp;Use open-ended questions to talk about financial goals, future wishes or possible issues or concerns. Keep an open mind and demonstrate patience, which can turn a potentially awkward conversation into a positive discussion that builds understanding and trust.</li>
<li><strong>Raise awareness of the red flags of investment fraud:</strong>&nbsp;Discuss common warning signs like unregistered individuals and investment firms, high-pressure sales tactics, promises of risk-free investments and unexpected offers (particularly those received via social media, dating or chat apps or text message). 
<ul>
<li><strong>Tool to help:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/investor-alerts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sign up to receive investor alerts from the CSA</a>&nbsp;to stay up to date about current threats.</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today launched a consultation on its draft Guidelines that will specify proportionate retail diversification methods to be eligible for the preferential risk weight under the standardised approach for credit risk.&nbsp;The Consultation paper follows the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-04/ba5d5cf5-220c-4531-811f-6e0a17ed88c2/EBA%20Work%20programme%202024%20-%20republished%20post%20final%202024-2026%20SPD%20-%20clean.pdf"><span>recommendations</span></a><span>&nbsp;from the&nbsp;EBA Advisory Committee on Proportionality for 2024 in the credit risk area The consultation runs until 12 February 2025.</span></p>
<p>In its draft Guidelines the EBA is setting out criteria to assess under which circumstances, retail exposures can be considered as diversified under the credit risk standardised approach for determining capital requirements in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR). The requirement to have a diversified portfolio, (i.e. that a portfolio consists of a significant number of exposures with similar characteristics) ensures that the risks credit institutions will have to bear for such exposures are reduced. In addition, the requirement to be diversified is mandatory for retail exposures to be assigned the preferential retail risk weight under the Standardised Approach for credit risk.</p>
<p>As a starting point, the EBA is considering the 0.2% granularity criterion set out in the Basel framework, according to which no individual exposure in the retail portfolio should exceed 0.2% of the retail portfolio. Under the EBA&rsquo;s proposal, institutions with exposures above the 0.2% granularity criterion will, however, still be considered sufficiently diversified, as long as no more than 10% of their retail portfolio exceeds the 0.2% threshold. This adjustment ensures a proportionate and harmonised approach, which takes into account the significant number of smaller institutions in EU. In addition, the approach taken is simple, which allows the calculation to be done by all institutions and is thereby proportionate to the size of institutions and their retail portfolios.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Consultation process</h4>
<p>Comments to the consultation paper can be sent by clicking on the "send your comments" button on the EBA's consultation page. The deadline for the submission of comments is 12 February 2025.</p>
<p>The EBA will hold a virtual public hearing on this consultation paper on Monday 16 December 2024, from 15:00 to 16:00 CET. The EBA invites interested stakeholders to register using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/public-hearing-gl-retail-diversification-methods-under-article-1231-regulation-eu-no-5752013">this link</a> by Thursday 12 December 2024 at 16:00 CET. The dial-in details will be communicated to those who have registered for the meeting.</p>
<p>All contributions received will be published following the end of the consultation, unless requested otherwise.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<p>The draft Guidelines have been developed according to Article 123(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR), as amended by Regulation (EU) 2024/1623. &nbsp;</p>

<title>What Roles Should The Private Sector And The Federal Reserve Play In Payments?, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher J. Waller, At The Clearing House Annual Conference 2024, New York, New York</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you for inviting me to speak here today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20241112a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;The Clearing House is a great place to talk about the evolution of clearing and settlement of payments in the United States. The key question I want to address today is, what roles should the private sector and the Federal Reserve play in payments?</p>
<p>As a strong believer in the benefits of a capitalist system, I hold the view that it is generally the private sector that can most reliably and efficiently provide goods and services to the economy. And I apply this view to the payments ecosystem.</p>
<p>It is that perspective that underlies a question I often ask when forming my positions on the appropriate role the Federal Reserve should play in a wide variety of initiatives: What is the fundamental market inefficiency that would be solved by government intervention and can only be solved by government intervention? If there isn't a satisfactory answer, then I believe government shouldn't intervene in private markets. Does this mean I believe the Federal Reserve should not be involved in payments? No. While I generally believe that government shouldn't directly compete with the private sector, there are situations where government involvement is needed to solve for market inefficiencies that may arise because of things like incomplete markets, coordination problems, or a lack of resilience.</p>
<p>As a policymaker, I have applied that same question to issues ranging from bank regulation to monetary policy. For an example in the payments area, three years ago there was an increase in public discussion about creating a new payment instrument called a central bank digital currency (CBDC). The Federal Reserve Board was compiling a report and seeking public comment on the potential benefits and risks of the idea. In a speech I gave in August 2021, I asked, what problem would a CBDC solve? In other words, what market failure or inefficiency demands this specific intervention?<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20241112a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;In more than three years, I have yet to hear a satisfactory answer as applied to CBDC.</p>
<p>Given today's audience and my position serving as the chair of the Board's payments committees, I want to focus on the important roles the private sector and the Federal Reserve play in our ever-evolving payment system. To set the stage for that discussion, I think it is helpful to recap some history around payments and clearing in the United States.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20241112a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>In the early decades following the country's founding, banks generally had state charters. While state banknotes and checks circulated locally as payment instruments, there were difficulties clearing and settling checks across states. One way of describing this is to say that the early U.S. payment system suffered from incomplete markets. The Second Bank of the United States was created in 1816 and, due to its federal charter, it was able to create a national system for clearing checks and banknotes. This in turn led to a more complete national clearing and settlement process.</p>
<p>When the charter for the Second Bank lapsed, clearing and settlement of banknotes and checks fell back to state-chartered banks. Many of the earlier inefficiencies resurfaced. For example, porters in New York City would deliver checks and exchange them for gold or other coins and then transport that "specie" to the payee. Hauling these money bags around New York posed obvious risks, and these risks multiplied by the mid-19th century when the number of banks in New York grew rapidly. As this audience is well aware, the New York Clearing House Association (NYCH) was founded in 1853 and served as a central location for the clearing process, which soon evolved, with certificates replacing coins. Furthermore, by being part of a common infrastructure, all members had a reasonably good idea of the quality of each other's balance sheets. In modern economic language, the NYCH became a coordination mechanism that improved clearing by getting banks to clear and settle payments in a well-organized manner. It also reduced asymmetric information about the quality of member balance sheets. By performing this function for New York banks, which constituted a relatively large share of the U.S. financial system, the clearing and settling of payments improved nationally. In this sense, the NYCH was the closest thing the United States had at that time to a central bank.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20241112a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a></p>
<p>While this was an improvement, not all important financial intermediaries were members of the NYCH or other such private arrangements. That is, there were gaps. And financial panics, sometimes driven by gaps and problems in check clearing, were a regular feature of the latter 19th and early 20th century.</p>
<p>The Panic of 1907 was a classic example of that. Depositors and investors lost confidence in certain New York banks that had been combined into large, complex, and opaque trust companies that were not members of the NYCH. This resulted in runs on those trusts, which led to broader liquidity problems. Although the NYCH had the ability to provide liquidity to those trusts, the provision of that liquidity was delayed. It appears that at the time, the NYCH was, reasonably, observing some form of Bagehot's dictum when deciding whether to provide liquidity. Under that dictum, you want to know that the institution to which you're providing liquidity is solvent. If it isn't, then the liquidity extension could be akin to throwing good money after bad. But because the trust companies at the time weren't member institutions, the clearinghouse didn't have a good enough understanding of their balance sheets to know whether they were solvent.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20241112a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;Some banks refused to clear checks from other institutions, which led to an erosion of depositor confidence and more failures. This historical example points to another aspect of a payment system that is important&mdash;resilience of the system.</p>
<p>These problems highlighted by the 1907 panic&mdash;coordination failures and a lack of resilience&mdash;could have been mitigated with the help of a central bank. Paul Warburg, an influential banker at the time, argued that such a central bank could "establish and maintain a perfect system of credit, enabling the general banks to transform cash credits into actual cash with such absolute ease and certainty that the use of cash credit, instead of actual cash, will not cease, no matter what may happen."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20241112a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a></p>
<p>In 1913, Congress agreed and created the Federal Reserve. It positioned the Federal Reserve at the center of the banking system by establishing a nationwide check-clearing system and a telegraph wire transfer service that is now known as Fedwire&reg;. The Fed was also intended to function as a lender of last resort so that suspension of payments would no longer be necessary. In the 1970s, the Fed promoted more efficient check-clearing by adding the automated clearinghouse service. Our job in providing these services and carrying out our responsibilities was and continues to be to make sure the payment system functions efficiently and resiliently, promoting the kind of confidence that is vital for a modern economy.</p>
<p>The lesson from this history, as relevant now as ever, is that the payment system has been one of those areas in which the best efforts of the private sector have sometimes fallen short. The decentralized and diverse nature of banks in the United States is a feature that goes back to the 1800s and has the merits of promoting competition and a vibrant economy. However, when engaging in clearing and settling payments, coordination problems and information asymmetries across banks can be, and were, destabilizing. While the private sector made advances in resolving those issues, the Panic of 1907 showed that those steps were not sufficient. As successful as the NYCH was for its members, it could not protect its members and the economy from risks in the growing share of finance occurring outside its walls. This contributed to the motivation to establish the Federal Reserve and its role in payments.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, and we are once again in an era of rapid change and innovation in money and payments. Some of this will not pan out. Some of this change is about delivering services already available but doing so with new technologies. And some of it is leveraging new technology to rethink existing payment, clearing, and settlement structures. How will all of this come together? And what will be the respective roles of the private sector and the Federal Reserve? Let's break it down, keeping in mind my principle that the Federal Reserve should focus on addressing issues that the private sector cannot address alone and, in doing so, promote an efficient and resilient U.S. payment system.</p>
<p>I'll start by discussing the important roles that the private sector now plays in the payment system and in the evolution of payments under way. The private sector connects consumers and businesses to the payment system, with financial institutions competing to provide services to their customers. Such competition can lead to better products and services for consumers as profit-seeking competitors look for opportunities to win over customers including through the adoption of new technologies. I have noted my concern that some see these new technologies as an opportunity for the public sector to play a&nbsp;<em>bigger</em>&nbsp;role in payments, which may crowd out private investment. I believe this would be a policy mistake and a better approach is one in which the private sector continues to have a significant footprint, with the role of government limited.</p>
<p>One important reason for that is that the private sector, through competition, is typically best situated to sort out good ideas from bad ideas, rather than central banks or other public-sector institutions choosing winners and losers. At the early stages of innovation, the true value-added of the application of new technologies is murky. Market competition helps sort that out and typically leads to a wider range of products that can be better suited to the needs of consumers.</p>
<p>But just as was the case in the time of Warburg, there remain problems in payments that can't be fully resolved by the private sector. And just as we have done throughout history, the Federal Reserve stands ready to support the evolution in payments and do so primarily through our operational role in the payment system, by providing core clearing and settlement infrastructure on which the private sector can innovate. Notably, the Fed has the unique ability to provide the infrastructure to reliably settle interbank obligations using balances at the central bank, which enhances the stability of the banking system and the broader economy, reflecting the lessons learned in 1907 and through earlier banking panics.</p>
<p>Compared with many other countries where a small number of large banks dominate, the United States has thousands of banks and credit unions. Connecting those many organizations to a payment network requires a significant amount of coordination. One recent example of an area in which we're playing such a coordination role is in instant payments. The role we're playing with FedNow is to help with that coordination problem using our existing connections to those thousands of institutions. And that approach is consistent with my overall view of the appropriate role of government&mdash;to narrowly address problems like those of coordination that can't always be efficiently solved by the private sector alone. In doing so, we complement the private sector and promote responsible and efficient innovation in the broader market.</p>
<p>With respect to new and emerging technologies in finance, I can think of two ways in which the private sector is uniquely positioned to develop and deploy them while the government is not well suited to do so. First is the question of innovation risk&mdash;the investment in new payment technologies is large and comes with risk of failure. Private-sector entities, risking their own funds and seeking to turn a profit, will have a greater incentive to accurately gauge demand for these technologies and bring those products to market faster. Second, despite the current fascination around the world with industrial policy, rarely can the government match the ability of the private sector to efficiently allocate resources and explore how well new technologies can address actual shortcomings in the current payment system. It is too early to tell whether some of the new technologies will relieve significant frictions in the payment system, but it is going to be the private sector, betting with its own money, that is best positioned to explore this question.</p>
<p>If problems emerge, as they did with check clearing in the 19th century, then government can play a constructive role in overcoming them. Well before this point, however, it makes sense for the public and private sectors to look down the road together and engage in dialogue about potential issues and opportunities that might arise. For example, through the Bank for International Settlements, the Fed is engaged with the private sector to explore how tokenization technology might be used to facilitate cross-border payments in a faster and cheaper manner. This project brings together multiple central banks and private-sector financial firms in collaboration to potentially facilitate a better-functioning monetary system.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20241112a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;That process of working together to promote the efficiency and safety of the payment system, as the Federal Reserve has done for decades, can lead to outcomes that benefit households, businesses, and the overall economy.</p>
<p>American entrepreneurship and technical prowess have generated exciting innovations in payments, and they will continue to do so. The role of the Federal Reserve is to support that initiative and engage with the private sector to promote innovation while guarding against risks to financial stability. We've managed this balancing act before and will continue to do so. And, together, we will ensure that the payments ecosystem continues to move forward for the benefit of households and businesses.</p>

<title>The EBA Publishes Methodology, Draft Templates, And Key Milestones For Its 2025 EU-Wide Stress Test</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-eba-publishes-methodology-draft-templates-and-key-milestones-for-its-2025/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-eba-publishes-methodology-draft-templates-and-key-milestones-for-its-2025/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today released the final methodology, draft templates, and template guidance for the 2025 EU-wide stress test, along with the milestone dates for the exercise. The methodology and templates cover all relevant risk areas and incorporate feedback received from the industry. The stress test exercise will formally start in January 2025, following the release of the macroeconomic scenarios, with the results scheduled for publication in early August 2025.</span></p>
<p>The 2025 EU-wide stress test adopts a constrained bottom-up approach, incorporating some top-down elements. Balance sheets are assumed to remain constant, with the primary focus being the evaluation of the impact of adverse shocks on banks&rsquo; solvency. Participating banks will be required to estimate the progression of common risk factors (credit, market, counterparty, and operational risks) under a baseline and an adverse scenario. Additionally, banks must project how these scenarios will affect key income streams. For net fee and commission income, securitisation risk weights, and the credit loss trajectory of sovereign exposures, banks will use pre-defined parameters. In addition, the projections of net interest income will be centralised. The methodology also defines the sample of banks involved in the exercise.</p>
<p>The draft stress test templates and guidance published today might need some minor technical adjustments before their final publication at the launch.</p>
<p><span>Key Milestones for the 2025 EU-wide Stress Test:</span></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Launch of the exercise: second half of January 2025</li>
<li>First submission of results to the EBA: end of April 2025</li>
<li>Second submission to the EBA: early June 2025</li>
<li>Final submission to the EBA: early July 2025</li>
<li>Publication of results: beginning of August 2025</li>
</ul>
<p>Compared to the previous stress test, the timeline has been adjusted to accommodate the feedback received from the industry and the entry into force of the revised Capital Requirements Regulation and Capital Requirements Directive (CRR3/CDR VI).</p>
<h4>Background</h4>
<ol>
<li>The aim of the EU-wide stress test is to assess the resilience of EU banks to a common set of adverse economic developments, identifying potential risks, informing supervisory decisions, and increasing market discipline.</li>
<li>The EBA conducts the stress test in a bottom-up fashion with some top-down elements, using consistent methodologies, scenarios, and key assumptions developed jointly with other authorities.</li>
<li>The exercise is coordinated by the EBA in cooperation with the European Central Bank, the European Systemic Risk Board, and the Competent Authorities from all relevant national jurisdictions.</li>
<li>To give banks sufficient time to prepare, the EBA published the methodology and templates well ahead of the formal launch, when the relevant macroeconomic scenarios will be released.</li>

<title>CFTC Awards $4M To Two Whistleblowers</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-awards-4m-to-two-whistleblowers/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-awards-4m-to-two-whistleblowers/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced&nbsp;it is awarding nearly $4 million&nbsp;to two whistleblowers&nbsp;who provided&nbsp;information&nbsp;leading&nbsp;to&nbsp;the successful enforcement of a&nbsp;covered action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Information from both whistleblowers formed the basis for the CFTC's investigations underlying the covered action. One whistleblower provided information earlier in time and the other reported that the violative practices had continued. The initial whistleblower was awarded a higher award amount based on the timeliness of the reporting, among other factors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Timely reports to the CFTC are critical for enforcement,&rdquo;&nbsp;said Director of Enforcement Ian McGinley. &ldquo;They help prevent further harm to customers or market participants and&nbsp;hold&nbsp;wrongdoers accountable to the fullest extent possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The violations resolved in the covered action related to the integrity of the markets the CFTC oversees and of the investigations it conducts.&nbsp;Each whistleblower provided specific, credible, and timely assistance to the CFTC that led to the charges being successfully resolved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We encourage all whistleblowers to come forward as soon as possible, since the timeliness&nbsp;can&nbsp;affect the&nbsp;award determination,&rdquo; said Whistleblower Office Director Brian Young. &ldquo;This is a perfect example of how the&nbsp;whistleblower&nbsp;rules&nbsp;allow for increased awards for timely initial reports and additional assistance while also providing&nbsp;a decreased award for&nbsp;those who unreasonably delay reporting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Counsel to the Director William Durbin of the CFTC Whistleblower Office handled this award.&nbsp;</p>
<p>About the CFTC&rsquo;s Whistleblower Program</p>
<p>The Whistleblower Program was created under Section 748 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. Since issuing its first award in 2014, the CFTC has granted approximately $390 million in whistleblower awards. Those awards are associated with enforcement actions resulting in over $3.2 billion in monetary sanctions. The CFTC issues awards related not only to the agency&rsquo;s enforcement actions, but also in connection with related actions brought by other domestic or foreign regulators, if certain conditions are met.</p>
<p>The Commodity Exchange Act provides confidentiality protections for whistleblowers. Regardless of whether the CFTC grants an award, the CFTC will not disclose any information that could reasonably be expected to reveal a whistleblower&rsquo;s identity, except in limited circumstances. Consistent with this confidentiality protection, the CFTC will not disclose the name of the enforcement action in which the whistleblower provided information, or the exact dollar amount of the award granted.</p>
<p>Whistleblowers may be eligible to receive between 10 - 30 percent of the monetary sanctions collected. All whistleblower awards are paid from the CFTC&rsquo;s Customer Protection Fund, which was established by Congress, and is financed entirely through monetary sanctions paid to the CFTC by violators of the CEA. No money is taken or withheld from injured customers to fund the program.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Anyone with information related to potential violations of the CEA or the CFTC&rsquo;s rules and regulations can submit a tip electronically by filing a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whistleblower.gov/overview/submitatip">Form TCR</a>&nbsp;(tip, complaint or referral) online.</p>

<title>New Rules To Strengthen Resilience Of UK’s Financial Sector</title>

<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>UK financial regulators have confirmed new rules to bolster the resilience of technology and other third parties providing key services to financial firms.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>Financial firms and financial market infrastructures (FMIs), such as payment systems, have become increasingly reliant on the services of a small number of third party providers, known as critical third parties. While these third parties can enhance competitiveness for the sector, disruption or failure to one of them&mdash;such as a cyber-attack or power outage&mdash;could affect a large number of consumers and firms, and threaten the stability of the UK financial system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is why, in 2023, the government gave regulators new powers to oversee the resilience of the services these third parties provide the sector, that may cause risks to financial stability. Today, the Financial Conduct Authority, Bank of England and Prudential Regulation Authority have set out how they intend to use their new powers, having consulted widely and working closely with industry to inform the design of the regime. The new rules align closely with international standards and similar regimes, like the EU&rsquo;s Digital Operational Resilience Act.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The final rules, when implemented, will not only strengthen the resilience of the services that critical third parties provide to individual firms, but will improve the resilience of the UK financial services sector as a whole. By strengthening resilience and promoting market stability, this will ensure the UK is an attractive place to do business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The government will decide which third parties should fall under the new regime based on advice from regulators.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new rules do not reduce the responsibility of financial firms and FMIs in making sure they are resilient to operational shocks and for their management of third-parties, in-line with our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/ps21-3-building-operational-resilience" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">existing outsourcing and operational resilience rules</a>.</p>
<p>The regulators welcome engagement from industry over the coming months as the regime is implemented.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<li>The final rules and policy will come into effect on 1 January 2025.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Critical third parties once designated will not be overseen in their entirety by the regulators, but the third-party services they specifically provide to the financial services sector will be overseen.</li>
<li>The rules will require critical third parties, once designated, to: 
<ul>
<li>provide regular assurance, information and notifications to the financial regulators on their services</li>
<li>undertake various forms of resilience testing and scenario-based exercises, including collaborating on some with their firms and FMIs</li>
<li>report major incidents like cyber-attacks, natural disasters and power outages&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<li>In December 2023, the financial regulators published&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2023/november/boe-pra-fca-issue-joint-proposals-to-increase-resilience-of-financial-sector" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">an extensive consultation<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;with the sector, which received broadly supportive feedback from over 60 respondents in the industry.&nbsp;</li>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/tel-aviv-stock-exchange-dimri-construction-and-development-opens-trading-in-celeb/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Management of Y.H. Dimri Construction and Development opened trading this morning in celebration of its joining TASE&rsquo;s flagship index, TA-35.</p>
<p>Founded as a family business 35 years ago, Dimri operates in the real estate sector, focusing primarily on residential development and construction in Israel alongside income-generating real estate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Operating out of Its headquarters in the city of Netivot, Southern Israel, Dimri has 300 employees and in the first half of 2024 garnered revenues of close to NIS 1 billion.</p>
<p>Dimri became a public company and joined TASE in May 2004, with a share value of NIS 200 million. Over the years, the Company has earned investor confidence and grown through capital and debt offerings to the public.</p>
<p>Dimri&rsquo;s current market cap of NIS 7 billion propelled it into TASE's flagship TA-35 Index, making it the only construction company currently included in this prestigious index. The share&rsquo;s yield over the past 5 years reached 340%.</p>
<p>Currently, the shares of 48 construction companies with a total market cap of NIS 65 billion are traded on TASE, alongside 120 bond series of construction companies with a total market cap of NIS 24 billion.</p>
<p><strong>Ygal Dimri, CEO and owner of Y.H. Dimri&nbsp;</strong>said, "Joining the TA-35 index is a significant and proud moment for us. As a company that started in Netivot three decades ago, Y.H. Dimri has come a long way&mdash;from a small local venture to managing and executing large-scale projects nationwide. This achievement reflects our vision, confidence in the Israeli market, dedication, and our commitment to quality, safety, and advanced technology. We see it as one more step in our continued growth as a leading Israeli real estate company."</p>
<p><strong>Yaniv Hirsch, Head of Indices Marketing at TASE,</strong>&nbsp;said, "The company's inclusion in TASE's flagship indices enables the Israeli public to continue gaining exposure to your firm through public savings, pension and provident funds, which are largely invested in the TASE indices. The investing public has demonstrated its confidence in the company, which benefits from your success, even more so now that you have joined the TA-35 Index. We wish you continued growth, expansion, and advancement in your field. May you continue to realize your vision of building and developing Israel and creating jobs, for the benefit of investors and the Israeli economy."</p>

<title>BME Welcomes Inmocemento</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bme-welcomes-inmocemento/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li><span>The company, which is the second to join the main market of the Spanish stock exchange this year, debuts with a valuation of 1.9 billion euros and a reference price of 4.25 euros per share</span></li>
</ul>
<p>BME today welcomed Inmocemento. The company has debuted at a reference price of 4.25 euros per share, which implies a stock market valuation of 1.9 billion euros. This is the second IPO in Spain this year, following Puig's listing in May. If BME's growth market companies (BME Growth and BME Scaleup) are added, 25 companies have already been listed on the Spanish financial markets this year.</p>
<p>Inmocemento was formed in a process of structural modification of the group of companies whose parent company is FCC, listed on the Spanish Stock Exchange. As of today, FCC shareholders have received the same number of shares in Inmocemento as they had in FCC. Inmocemento started trading at 12 noon.</p>
<p>The Inmocemento group focuses its activity on the real estate business through the development of rental assets and real estate development and land management, as well as on the cement business through the development of the manufacturing and marketing of cement and its derivatives.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are delighted to welcome Inmocemento, which after the spin-off will have the advantages of being a listed company in its own right, such as reputation, visibility, the ability to finance itself on a recurring basis and access to national and international investors. The stock exchange offers listed companies a wide range of possibilities depending on their needs and future plans,&rsquo; explains Javier Hernani, CEO of BME.</p>
<p>Jos Dijsselhof, CEO of SIX and Chairman of BME, said: &lsquo;The arrival of a new company on the stock exchange is always good news. After two of the world's largest IPOs of the year on the SIX markets in Switzerland and Spain, we are delighted to welcome Inmocemento to the Spanish stock exchange. Each new listing on the financial markets encourages more companies to follow this path, which is positive for the business fabric and the economy as a whole&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company has started trading with the ticker symbol&nbsp;<span>&ldquo;IMC&rdquo;.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Liquidnet, a leading technology-driven agency execution specialist, today announced the release of SmartDark, its latest algorithm for its equities platform, designed to enhance how institutional traders can execute their trades through prioritized routing with larger executions and better price stability.</p>
<p><b>Alan Polo, Head of Sales and Trading, Americas</b>, said: &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s markets remain volatile and complex for buy-side traders to navigate.&nbsp;Although many algorithms in the market boast exceptional performance, the reality is that an algorithm's effectiveness depends entirely on the quality of the liquidity it can reach. SmartDark is a great illustration of our ability to develop innovative solutions for the buy-side that help traders access liquidity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Available in the U.S., SmartDark&nbsp;incorporates a variety of yield and quality metrics to give traders an optimal blend of targeted liquidity-seeking strategy and maximum liquidity exposure, resulting in the opportunity to trade on high quality venues with better price stability.</p>
<p><b>Scott Kartinen, Head of Global Algo Products,</b>&nbsp;commented: &ldquo;Our algorithms are one of our core differentiators and we&rsquo;re proud to offer a new addition to our lineup. As one of the few unconflicted, agency-only brokers with expertise in lit, dark, and block markets, we are in a unique position to craft execution strategies that effectively navigate complex markets and secure the liquidity buy-side traders need. We&rsquo;re excited to see SmartDark aid our Members in executing their orders more efficiently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The algorithm sits within the Liquidnet Dark space and leverages the existing framework to offer a new tool to enhance traders&rsquo; execution abilities. Liquidnet Dark has an average block execution size of 28,000 shares for all trades crossed by Liquidnet and an overall block participation rate of 44%<sup>1</sup>.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Approaches USD 100,000 Milestone Boosted by Trump's Election</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Following Donald Trump's election victory, Bitcoin's price has surged, reaching a record high of nearly $85,000 on Monday, with an intraday peak at $84,986.15. Since Election Day, Bitcoin has climbed over 10%, driven by a combination of FOMO and a short squeeze.</p>
<p>Petr Kozyakov, Co-founder and CEO of Mercuryo, a prominent payment infrastructure platform in the digital token space, highlights how innovations in crypto payments are motivating people to utilize their assets.<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;The cryptocurrency market is engulfed by wave after wave of FOMO as bitcoin seemingly charts an inexorable path towards $100,000. While critics of the space will decry what they perceive as wild speculation, the evolution of the digital token economy will be powered forward as the space reaches a market capitalisation of $3.1 trillion.<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;We&rsquo;re also witnessing a philosophical shift among a new generation who trade crypto. Many of these buyers have a belief that life is short and the point is to spend their profits. The availability of sophisticated products enabling consumers to make purchases, anywhere; anytime, are being delivered by partnerships between traditional payment giants such as Mastercard and innovative platforms in the cryptocurrency space. The seamless off-ramping of digital tokens will fuel spending among a new generation of tech-savvy consumers who intuitively recognise the power of blockchain technology to change the world.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><span>Jurisdictions have made progress implementing the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) disclosures standards, strengthening interoperability with other sustainability disclosure frameworks, and developing global assurance and ethics standards for such disclosures.</span></li>
<li><span>The large majority of FSB jurisdictions have regulations, guidelines or strategic roadmaps in place for climate-related disclosures. Most FSB jurisdictions have also set or proposed disclosure requirements based on ISSB Standards and the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Disclosures (TCFD).</span></li>
<li><span>Report calls for more work to address challenges with using the ISSB standards for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and for companies in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs).</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) published today its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/11/achieving-consistent-and-comparable-climate-related-disclosures-2024-progress-report/">2024 progress report on Achieving Consistent and Comparable Climate-Related Disclosures</a>, drawing on a survey of FSB member jurisdictions and input from standard-setting bodies and international organisations.</p>
<p>Global efforts are now focused on supporting jurisdictions in adopting, applying, or otherwise being informed by the two disclosure standards issued by the ISSB in 2023. Work is underway, by the ISSB and other organisations, to provide implementation support and capacity building to address challenges faced by SMEs and by companies in EMDEs in using these standards. Significant progress has also been achieved in interoperability between the ISSB Standards and other regional and jurisdictional disclosure frameworks, as well as in connectivity with financial reporting and prudential reporting requirements.</p>
<p>Nineteen out of 24 FSB member jurisdictions have regulations, guidelines or strategic roadmaps in place for climate-related disclosures. Seventeen FSB jurisdictions have set or proposed voluntary or mandatory disclosure requirements based on the ISSB standards and the recommendations by the TCFD. Moreover, several jurisdictions have taken concrete steps towards introducing assurance requirements to enhance the reliability and usefulness of climate-related disclosures.</p>
<p>The FSB report summarises the key findings of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ifrs.org/content/dam/ifrs/supporting-implementation/issb-standards/progress-climate-related-disclosures-2024.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Progress Report on Corporate Climate-related Disclosures</a>, which has also been published today. The IFRS Foundation&rsquo;s report concludes that companies&rsquo; progress in disclosing climate-related financial information using the TCFD recommendations or the ISSB Standards is encouraging, but more progress is necessary.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h2>
<p>Addressing the financial risks from climate change is a key priority of the FSB. High-quality, consistent, and comparable firm-level disclosures are essential for assessing and managing these risks and for increasing transparency at the domestic and international levels.</p>
<p>In July 2021, the FSB published a comprehensive&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2021/07/fsb-roadmap-for-addressing-climate-related-financial-risks/">Roadmap to address climate-related financial risks</a>, outlining the key actions to be taken by standard-setting bodies and other international organisations over a multi-year period in four key policy areas: firm-level disclosures, data, vulnerabilities analysis, and regulatory and supervisory practices and tools.</p>
<p>Progress on firm-level disclosures of their climate-related financial risks was initially based on the recommendations developed by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">TCFD</a>. With the release of the ISSB&rsquo;s inaugural sustainability-related disclosure standards in 2023, the TCFD has been disbanded. The FSB continues to monitor work to strengthen the relevance, reliability and comparability of climate-related financial disclosures through its progress report on climate-related disclosures. Following an FSB request in October 2023, the monitoring of progress on companies&rsquo; climate-related disclosures has been taken over by the IFRS Foundation.</p>
<p>The report released today by the FSB includes input from its member jurisdictions and the following standard-setting bodies: International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB), International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA), Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS).</p>
<p>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. The FSB also conducts outreach with approximately 70 other jurisdictions through its six Regional Consultative Groups.</p>
<p>The FSB is chaired by Klaas Knot, President of De Nederlandsche Bank. The FSB Secretariat is located in Basel, Switzerland and hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>

<title>Europex – Association of European Energy Exchanges: Assessment Of Potential Impacts Of Regional Virtual Hubs On The Forward Markets</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The EU electricity market reform has mandated the European Commission to assess the impact of virtual trading hubs on the liquidity of electricity forward markets. A new study conducted by Compass Lexecon on behalf of Energy Traders Europe, Eurelectric and Europex reveals that these hubs are likely to deter, rather than enhance, the liquidity of forward markets in Central and Southern Europe. Based on the quantitative analysis, the three associations call on policymakers to consolidate existing forward markets and prioritise proxy hedging via existing instruments over virtual trading hubs to increase forward market volumes, keep transaction costs stable and ultimately spare consumers greater energy costs.</p>

<title>GLEIF Welcomes BOCOM Fintech As Latest Validation Agent, Signaling Increasing LEI Adoption Across APAC  - BOCOM Fintech Will Explore Innovative LEI And VLEI Applications In Trade Finance And E-Commerce To Enhance Cross-Border Identification And Authentication Capabilities For Chinese Enterprises</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/gleif-welcomes-bocom-fintech-as-latest-validation-agent-signaling-increasing-le/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/gleif-welcomes-bocom-fintech-as-latest-validation-agent-signaling-increasing-le/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) today announces that BOCOM Fintech, a Shanghai-based subsidiary of the Bank of Communications (BOCOM), has been officially approved as the latest Validation Agent in the Global LEI System. The approval follows support from the Beijing National Institute of Financial Standardization Co., Ltd. (NIFS).</p>
<p>BOCOM Fintech&rsquo;s Validation Agent status represents a significant milestone for LEI adoption in China and the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region. As a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank of Communications, identified by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) as a global systemically important bank (G-SIB), BOCOM Fintech is dedicated to advancing China&rsquo;s digital transformation. It will leverage the LEI to streamline cross-border identification, simplify Know Your Customer (KYC) processes and document requirements for offshore businesses, expedite identity verification, reduce compliance risks, and enhance the overall customer experience.</p>
<p>BOCOM Fintech is also actively exploring new applications of the LEI and its digital counterpart, the verifiable LEI (vLEI).&nbsp; These include 'one single system' cross-border trade financing solutions and cross-border e-commerce compliance solutions, which aim to promote paperless trade while ensuring transparency in cross-border transactions.</p>
<p>Leveraging its strategic location in Shanghai&rsquo;s Lin-gang Special Area, BOCOM Fintech will continue to advocate for the LEI as an 'international passport' for legal entities, providing substantial benefits for local businesses expanding globally and foreign enterprises entering the Chinese market. Supporting this progress, Shanghai local authorities recently introduced a comprehensive package of 50 measures to bolster the local application of the LEI. These measures encourage companies in the Lin-gang Special Area to use the LEI for cross-border verification and key trade documents, such as electronic bills of lading, electronic warehouse receipts, and electronic invoices.</p>
<p>Tang Yi, President of BOCOM Fintech, said: "By becoming a Validation Agent in the Global LEI System, we are better positioned as a FinTech company and aim to contribute more effectively to China&rsquo;s economic opening-up. We are firmly committed to exploring innovative applications of the LEI in anti-money laundering (AML), maritime trade, and cross-border e-commerce, thus promoting digital finance and economic development." Zhou Xichong, Executive Director and General Manager of NIFS, said: " The Global LEI System provides a robust foundation for advancing global digital finance by standardizing data formats. As a new Validation Agent, BOCOM Fintech will play a pivotal role in promoting the adoption of LEIs in China. NIFS will collaborate closely with GLEIF and BOCOM Fintech to explore LEI and vLEI applications in cross-border payments, international trade, and counterparty identification and verification. This collaboration aims to foster international cooperation in financial regulation and strengthen global economic risk identification."</p>
<p>Alexandre Kech, CEO of GLEIF, said: "We welcome BOCOM Fintech as the latest Validation Agent. This step represents the strong participation and support to foster trust and transparency in the global economy. By exploring new LEI and vLEI applications, BOCOM Fintech will contribute to building a new global ecosystem for organizational digital identity, bringing tangible benefits to local businesses, enhancing regional integration, and promoting economic development."</p>
<p>GLEIF&rsquo;s Validation Agent Framework enables financial institutions and other supervised organizations involved in legal entity identity verification and validation to obtain and maintain LEIs for their clients in cooperation with accredited LEI Issuers.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On 21 October 2024, ACER received a proposal&nbsp;from Nominated Electricity Market Operators (NEMOs) to amend the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsHVwRXBVAHUkwNBQUAHVYPUQYdUFpUUxpWA1BTAFUND1MABwUdUlwCUg8EDAYdVA5QUx0GW1dRGgwGCw8ZAlFSBlAAAFECAQJVRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">single intraday coupling (SIDC) products methodology</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is the methodology about?</span></p>
<p>The SIDC products methodology is defined by the Capacity Allocation and Congestion Management (<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsGAFMHVgdVAUwJDgVaHVZdAVUdUw9SXxpXVgpUAFICAAFTAlIdUlwCUg8EDAYdVA5QUx0GW1dRGgwGCw8ZAlFSBlAAAFECAQJVRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CACM</a>) Regulation. The methodology specifies the types of products that can be traded within the EU&rsquo;s continuous single intraday market and in intraday auctions (IDAs). Here, trading begins the day before delivery and continues through the day of delivery, supporting real-time adjustments to supply and demand across borders.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why amend the methodology?</span></p>
<p>In&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtUBwVTVVkBUkxYBlZWHVZcAQ8dUwhUURpQVgMEAVdXVgYEVVIdUlwCUg8EDAYdVA5QUx0GW1dRGgwGCw8ZAlFSBlAAAFECAQJVRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">September 2024</a>, ACER amended the single day-ahead coupling (SDAC) products methodology (where trades occur the day before delivery) to allow the introduction of 15-minute trading products (<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsDAwYABQIHAkxdVQFaHVYIVwAdClwGAhoGXFADA1cCVFRXBVMdUlwCUg8EDAYdVA5QUx0GW1dRGgwGCw8ZAlFSBlAAAFECAQJVRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Decision 13/2024</a>). The proposed changes for the SIDC products methodology aim to align with this update, allowing the introduction of 15-minute trading products in both day-ahead and intraday markets.</p>
<p>Harmonising the rules across both markets is necessary to comply with the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtQBQQBBwdQUUwOBAYGHVZaAAMdCg1SVxpTAAtTDVEEUQMCUwcdUlwCUg8EDAYdVA5QUx0GW1dRGgwGCw8ZAlFSBlAAAFECAQJVRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">EU Electricity Regulation</a>&nbsp;and reduce entry barriers for market participants trading short-term products. These updates will enable participants to trade electricity in 15-minute intervals throughout the day, enhancing market flexibility.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the next steps?</span></p>
<p>ACER expects to decide on the amended methodology by April 2025.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contact information</span></p>
<p>Interested parties may contact ACER on this matter at&nbsp;<a>ACER-ELE-2024-012@acer.europa.eu</a>&nbsp;by 11 December 2024 at the latest.</p>

<title>Governments Must Eliminate Financial Transactions Taxes To Unlock Investment And Reduce Volatility, Says The WFE</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/governments-must-eliminate-financial-transactions-taxes-to-unlock-investment-and/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/governments-must-eliminate-financial-transactions-taxes-to-unlock-investment-and/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The World Federation of Exchanges, the global trade body for exchanges and clearing houses (The WFE), has published a paper analysing whether Financial Transactions Taxes (FTTs) inflict harm on economies.<br /><br />The paper shows how FTTs create numerous distortions, harm investor outcomes, prevent companies from raising capital, particularly from listing, and make hedging against risk more costly. Additionally, The WFE demonstrates how implementing an FTT is a poor way to regulate financial markets as the effect FTTs have on trading patterns is, at best, unproven and, at worst, completely counterproductive. The 250 market infrastructures that comprise our membership see the impact of these taxes on the trades going through their order books, which can be taken as a proxy for the general health, confidence and buoyancy of the broader market and economy.&nbsp;<br /><br />The paper explains the reasons why FTTs are defective, namely due to their impact on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increased Transaction Costs: FTTs raise the costs associated with trading financial assets, which can reduce net returns for investors and discourage both short-term and long-term investments.</li>
<li>Market Liquidity and Efficiency: FTTs can reduce trading volume and market liquidity, leading to wider bid-ask spreads, slower price discovery, and increased market volatility, which negatively impacts overall market efficiency.</li>
<li>Distorted Investment Behaviour: FTTs incentivise investors to alter their strategies to avoid taxed assets, potentially leading to suboptimal investment choices and a shift towards riskier or less regulated markets.</li>
<li>Corporate Financing: FTTs indirectly increase the cost of capital for companies, making it more expensive to finance new projects, which can stifle innovation and economic growth.</li>
<li>Global Investment Shifts: The implementation of FTTs can cause investors to move their capital to jurisdictions with lower or no transaction taxes, reducing investment in regions with higher taxes.</li>
<li>Reducing Risk: It is the stifling of trading that is dangerous and counterproductive, allowing uncontrollable pressures to build up, as clearly demonstrated by the failure of fixed exchange rates in the later twentieth century. Encouraging trading, on the other hand, ensures that asset prices remain fresh, thereby reducing the risk of bubble, including those fuelled by cheap credit in the banking system. It also ensures that liquidity is maximised for those who wish to change the composition of their portfolios from time to time.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><strong>Nandini Sukumar, CEO of the World Federation of Exchanges, commented,&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;The logic that, by raising transaction costs, an FTT curbs supposedly harmful trading and reduces volatility and asset mispricing is severely misguided. In fact, it has the reverse effect by discouraging informed traders, meaning there are fewer buyers and sellers to trade at the ideal price. This makes plain the counterintuitive nature of this tax. Regulators should learn from the US example, where the stock commission deregulation and consequent decline in transaction costs led to decreased price volatility. The effect of regulation can spread from the financial market to the broader economy, so this must be addressed for the benefit of investors and businesses too. Removing FTTs will lead to growth and lower volatility.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Richard Metcalfe, Head of Regulatory Affairs at the World Federation of Exchanges, commented,</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;It is dangerous to experiment with FTTs, as history has shown. To see this, you only need to look at how Swedish equity traders and issuers voted with their feet in response to a series of FTT introductions and rises in the 1980s, and then returned and surged once they were repealed. Policymakers must take heed of the significant economic drawbacks these taxes impose, especially since existing taxes (notably on income and capital gains) already raise revenue from financial businesses, on the same basis as other economic activity, while allowing the economy to continuously price assets and risks, to the benefit of business managers and investors.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /><br />Read the full paper&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://world-exchanges.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=48ddcbc11eb58f141a51219ea&amp;id=690059a57d&amp;e=979576350c" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Fines Metro Bank £16m For Financial Crime Failings</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has fined Metro Bank PLC (Metro) &pound;16,675,200. &nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>Between June 2016 and December 2020, Metro failed to have the right systems and controls to adequately monitor over 60m transactions, with a value of over &pound;51bn, for money laundering risks. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Metro automated the monitoring of customer transactions for potential financial crime in June 2016. However, its system did not work as intended. An error in how data was fed into the system meant transactions taking place on the same day an account was opened, and any further transactions until the account record was updated, were not monitored. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Junior staff did raise concerns about some transaction data not being monitored in 2017 and 2018, but these did not result in the issue being identified and fixed. Even once a fix had been put in place in July 2019, Metro did not have a mechanism to consistently check that all relevant transactions were being fed into the monitoring system until December 2020, over 4 and a half years after the system was implemented. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Therese Chambers, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight, commented: &lsquo;Metro's failings risked a gap being left in our defence against the criminal misuse of our financial system. Those failings went on for too long.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Since the firm&rsquo;s identification of the issues with its transaction monitoring system in April 2019, Metro has put in place processes to remediate the issues identified. The FCA continues to supervise firms to ensure that they have the right systems and controls to manage financial crime risks.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>

<li>Read our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/final-notices/metro-bank-plc-2024.pdf" title="Final Notice 2024: Metro Bank PLC">Final Notice</a>.</li>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority - Enforcement Regulatory Disclosure Review: Outcome</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-enforcement-regulatory-disclosure-review-outco/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>Following a review, we have improved our disclosure processes in regulatory enforcement cases.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>In&nbsp;<em>Seiler and others v FCA</em>&nbsp;[2023] UKUT 00133, the Upper Tribunal recommended that we should review certain elements of the disclosure process in regulatory enforcement cases. This relates to disclosure of evidence as part of any regulatory case.</p>
<p>We have completed the review and have made a number of changes to our processes.</p>
<p>Most significantly, we are:</p>
<ul>
<li>taking a broader approach to disclosure which will mean our review of documents is not focused only on identifying potentially undermining material</li>
<li>enhancing our existing training on disclosure to include additional specialist training for those managing and overseeing disclosure exercises</li>
<li>providing additional training for staff and more detailed guidance on quality assurance</li>
<li>clarifying the roles and responsibilities of staff and managers involved in disclosure, and</li>
<li>giving greater emphasis to the importance of disclosure in measuring and rewarding staff performance</li>
</ul>
<p>We are required to disclose all documents on which we rely to build regulatory enforcement cases, as well as any other material which in our opinion might undermine our decision to take action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under our new broader approach, we will disclose all material that is relevant to the facts of the matter, save where it is disproportionate, not in the public interest, or otherwise inappropriate to do so. This will include all material that is potentially undermining as well as supportive material. Disclosure reviews will be aimed at identifying all the relevant material and will not be focused on only looking for potentially undermining material. This will reduce the risk that we mistakenly fail to disclose a document.</p>
<p>Overall, the aim of our changes is to improve the quality of our disclosure by providing greater support for case teams.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will closely monitor the effectiveness of the changes we are making, and will conduct a further review in approximately 12 months&rsquo; time to assess whether we should take further steps to improve our processes.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), the leading global financial centre in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia (MEASA) region, today announced the full redemption and on-schedule repayment of a USD 700mn sukuk. This marks a significant milestone in implementing its sustainable financing strategy and commitment to responsible financial management.</p>
<p>The repayment of the sukuk reflects DIFC&rsquo;s financial strength and the result of robust financial policies that enhance the efficiency of the Centre&rsquo;s debt and financing portfolio. These financial policies reduce borrowing costs, mitigate refinancing risks, focus on cash generation from core activities, and ensure financial stability in the medium and long term.</p>
<p><span>His Excellency Essa Kazim, Governor of DIFC</span>, said: &ldquo;DIFC has fully repaid its 2014 sukuk on schedule which reflects our financial strength. Over the past ten years, we have invested in high-quality commercial infrastructure, and this has helped position DIFC as the region&rsquo;s preferred centre for business and finance. We continue to develop our real estate offering to meet high levels of demand from companies looking to establish or grow their presence in the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sukuk was raised through DIFC Investments to fund the expansion of the Centre with real estate infrastructure and development of new retail attraction Gate Avenue. DIFC maintained rational spending on all its projects and new developments, improved and diversified its revenue, and optimised the use of financial instruments.</p>

<p>Effective liquidity risk management is crucial for protecting investors, maintaining orderly markets and reducing systemic risk.</p>
<p><strong>Jean-Paul Servais</strong>, Chair of IOSCO&rsquo;s Board and Chairman of the Belgium Financial Services &amp; Markets Authority (FSMA), said:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Today marks another landmark in our commitment to strengthening the stability and resilience of the investment fund sector, which builds on IOSCO&rsquo;s close collaboration with the FSB following the release of their revised recommendations and guidance on anti-dilution liquidity management tools last year&rdquo;.</em></p>
<p>Originally published in 2018, IOSCO&rsquo;s Liquidity Risk Management (LRM) Recommendations were published in response to the FSB&rsquo;s 2017 Policy Recommendations to Address Structural Vulnerabilities from Asset Management Activities that aimed to address structural vulnerabilities from liquidity mismatch in open-ended funds. Today&rsquo;s Revised LRM Recommendations take into consideration the FSB&rsquo;s revised Recommendations to Address Structural Vulnerabilities from Liquidity Mismatch in Open-Ended Funds (&ldquo;Revised FSB Recommendations&rdquo;) from December 2023, as well as recent market events such as the COVID-induced market volatility and those following the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>The proposals consist of 17 recommendations organized into a revised structure with six sections, namely the CIS Design Process, Liquidity Management Tools and Measures, Day-to-Day Liquidity Management Practices, Stress Testing, Governance and Disclosures to Investors and Authorities.</p>
<p>The key proposed revisions to the LRM Recommendations correspond to the targeted revisions from the Revised FSB Recommendations and can be grouped into four main areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Categorizing open-ended funds (OEFs) based on the liquidity of their assets</li>
<li>Encouraging investment managers to implement a broad set of liquidity management tools (LMTs) and other liquidity management measures.</li>
<li>Emphasizing the importance of anti-dilution LMTs to mitigate material investor dilution and potential first-mover advantage arising from structural liquidity mismatch in OEFs.</li>
<li>Incorporating new guidance on quantity-based LMTs and other liquidity management measures.</li>
</ul>
<p>The accompanying Implementation Guidance, also for consultation, sets out technical elements focusing on open-ended funds, such as the determination of asset and portfolio liquidity and considerations relating to the calibration and activation of LMTs and other liquidity management measures.</p>
<p><strong>Christina Choi</strong>, Chair of IOSCO&rsquo;s Committee for Investment Management (C5) said:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Effective liquidity risk management is vital for safeguarding investors and ensuring the stability of our financial markets. Our revised recommendations build on the good work of the FSB and IOSCO in 2023 and also draws from lessons learned from recent market challenges, setting out robust parameters for asset managers to consider as they look to improve their liquidity management practices&rdquo;.</em></p>
<p>The proposed Revised LRM Recommendations and the proposed Implementation Guidance incorporate IOSCO&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Anti-dilution Liquidity Management Tools &ndash; Guidance for Effective Implementation of the Recommendations for Liquidity Risk Management for Collective Investment Schemes</em>&nbsp;published in 2023 and should be read in conjunction with each other for completeness.</p>
<p>Consultation feedback is requested by&nbsp;<strong>11 February 2025</strong>. IOSCO aims to publish its Final Report in the first half of 2025.</p>

<title>Decision By The Nasdaq Stockholm Disciplinary Committee Regarding Citigroup Global Markets Europe AG</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/decision-by-the-nasdaq-stockholm-disciplinary-committee-regarding-citigroup-glob/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/decision-by-the-nasdaq-stockholm-disciplinary-committee-regarding-citigroup-glob/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Disciplinary Committee of Nasdaq Stockholm (the &ldquo;Exchange&rdquo;) has found that Citigroup Global Markets Europe AG (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) has breached the Nasdaq Nordic Member Rules (the &ldquo;Rulebook&rdquo;) and therefore ordered the Company to pay a fine of SEK 6,000,000.</p>
<p>On May 2, 2022 the Exchange&rsquo;s Trading Surveillance function identified a significant price drop in a number of financial instruments and indices, including equities, futures and Exchange Traded Products (the &ldquo;Market Event&rdquo;) traded on markets operated by Nasdaq Nordic. The price drop lasted for approximately seven minutes before correcting to roughly the same levels as before the drop. During the price drop, the indices in Denmark, Finland and Sweden were down approximately 6.5%, 7% and 8%, respectively. The Exchange&rsquo;s analysis showed that the Company was the major seller in the market, and thereby triggered the Market Event.</p>
<p>The Exchange argued before the Disciplinary Committee that the Company violated the Rulebook by not having in place sufficient pre-trade controls, by submitting non-genuine orders to the Exchange, by failing to properly monitor its trading activity, by failing to keep contact information provided to the Exchange up to date and by not immediately notifying the Exchange of a material deviation from the provisions of the Rulebook.</p>
<p>The Disciplinary Committee states that it is evident that the Company's trading control system did not prevent an individual trader from executing erroneous orders with a total value of 189 billion dollars, and that the warnings the trader received in the system could easily be dismissed. According to the Disciplinary Committee, the Company did not have the required trading control systems considering the nature and scope of its operations. The Disciplinary Committee sees no reason to doubt that the Market Event was initiated and predominantly caused by the actions of the Company's trader and the deficiencies in the Company's control system.</p>
<p>The Disciplinary Committee notes that the Company has violated five sections of the Rulebook. The Disciplinary Committee takes a particularly serious view of the deficiencies in the Company's internal control and the effects that the erroneous orders on May 2, 2022, as far as can be assessed based on the case material, had on the market. The Disciplinary Committee sets the fine at SEK 6,000,000.</p>
<p>The Disciplinary Committee&rsquo;s decision is available at:</p>

<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has banned Leigh Mackey from working in financial services and fined him &pound;1,102,879 for misleading the FCA and misusing funds due to insurers.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>Between 12 September 2011 and 8 December 2019, Mr Mackey had sole management control of Inspire Insurance Services Ltd (Inspire), an insurance broker for the construction sector.</p>
<p>Mr Mackey used funds due to insurers to support Inspire&rsquo;s operating costs and to pay for personal living expenses instead of paying insurers.</p>
<p>By his own admission, Mr Mackey accepts that, due to his actions, Inspire owes insurers over &pound;660,000. Estimates by Inspire&rsquo;s liquidator are significantly higher, suggesting a shortfall of over &pound;2.2m.</p>
<p>Mr Mackey was not truthful with the FCA. Inspire submitted regulatory reports over 4 years stating it had carried out required client asset audits. Mr Mackey admits it failed to carry these out.</p>
<p>Therese Chambers, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA said:</p>
<p>'Mr Mackey helped himself to insurer funds to prop up his business and personal finances. This fine and ban shows how seriously we take individuals who abuse their position for personal gain and risk damaging the integrity of the UK&rsquo;s financial system.'</p>

<title>HKEX Publishes Connect Paper - Ten Years Of Connect - Connecting China And The World</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect was launched on 17 November 2014, opening a bridge for two-way traffic  between the securities markets of Mainland China and Hong Kong. This innovative, creative and pioneering  initiative allowed investors to use local brokerages to buy and sell eligible stocks in cross-border markets  through local exchanges and clearing houses, establishing a new model of mutual market access.</p>
<p>With the launch of Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect, Bond Connect, and Swap Connect over the next  decade, the Connect programmes have expanded from stocks to bonds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs),  and interest rate swaps, establishing a safe and convenient channel for Mainland Chinese and international  investors to conduct cross-border investment and risk management.</p>
<p>The smooth operation and continuous optimisation of Connect programmes has created a successful  paradigm for multi-level connectivity between China and international financial markets in terms of systems,  products, and services, while growing product diversity, trading volumes and investor participation.</p>
<p>Despite the complexity of the global financial environment, the success of the Connect programmes  has expanded the depth and breadth of China&rsquo;s capital market openness and strengthened Hong Kong&rsquo;s  superconnector status, enhancing the vitality and resilience of Hong Kong&rsquo;s capital markets and consolidating  its status as an international financial centre.</p>
<p>In April 2024, the State Council of China issued &ldquo;Several Opinions on Strengthening Supervision and Risk  Prevention and Promoting the High-quality Development of the Capital Market&rdquo; (named as &ldquo;New Nine Articles&rdquo;).</p>
<p>This document highlighted the need for expanding and optimising the cross-border interconnection  mechanism of the capital market, setting the direction for the future development of mutual market access  between Mainland China and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>This report reviews the development of the Connect programmes over the past decade, analyses the main  drivers behind their success, and identifies ways to further enhance the Connect programmes in the future.</p>

<title>Tradeweb And Tokyo Stock Exchange Collaborate To Expand Liquidity In Japanese ETFs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Tradeweb Markets Inc. (Nasdaq: TW), a leading, global operator of electronic marketplaces for rates, credit, equities and money markets,&nbsp;and Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE), one of the largest stock exchanges in the world, today announced their collaboration to offer institutional investors enhanced access to liquidity in Japanese exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The launch of a new direct link between Tradeweb and TSE&rsquo;s request-for-quote (RFQ) platform, CONNEQTOR, allows Tradeweb buy-side clients to include CONNEQTOR liquidity providers when launching a trade enquiry on the Tradeweb Japan-listed ETF marketplace. Global X Japan executed the first transaction using this new connectivity.</p>
<p>Enrico Bruni, Head of Europe and Asia Business at Tradeweb, said: &ldquo;This exciting collaboration between Tradeweb and TSE&rsquo;s CONNEQTOR platform demonstrates our focus on linking liquidity pools for the benefit of institutional investors looking to transfer risk with a higher degree of certainty. We are in the business of enhancing clients&rsquo; execution experience, and we look forward to bringing more time and cost efficiencies to investors trading Japanese ETFs, both locally and globally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moriyuki Iwanaga, President of Tokyo Stock Exchange, said: &ldquo;CONNEQTOR has been developed as a platform to enable investors to trade ETFs "faster and cheaper". We hope that the new connection with Tradeweb will promote investment in the Japanese market by allowing investors outside Japan, who have had difficulty using CONNEQTOR, to easily access ETFs listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange from overseas. TSE will continue to strive to provide and develop a highly convenient market environment, where investors can enjoy better prices and smoother execution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With Tradeweb&rsquo;s direct link to CONNEQTOR, clients can submit orders from the Tradeweb user interface to CONNEQTOR&rsquo;s list of market makers &ndash; in addition to Tradeweb&rsquo;s network of liquidity providers &ndash; and receive the best two-way quote back. Clients will continue to benefit from innovative functionality, such as Tradeweb&rsquo;s rules-based automated execution tool, AiEX, and the post-trade infrastructure of TSE, where transactions with CONNEQTOR market makers will be cleared and settled.</p>
<p>Jooyoung Yun, CIO of Global X Japan, said: &ldquo;We are very supportive of new initiatives that facilitate greater access to the Japanese ETF market. Tradeweb and CONNEQTOR have responded to the needs of institutional investors in bringing greater connectivity and flexibility, as well as straight-through-processing improvements to Japanese ETF trading.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The collaboration with TSE builds on Tradeweb&rsquo;s award-winning offering that allows buy-side traders to transact Asia, Europe and U.S.-listed ETFs, while benefitting from multi-dealer liquidity, greater pre-trade transparency and competitive pricing. Clients can also leverage Tradeweb&rsquo;s new generation of automated trading via its AiEX tool, as well as advanced functions such as time release. Tradeweb is a global leader in ETF RFQ execution, revolutionising trading in this asset class since the launch of its first ETF platform in Europe in 2012, in the U.S. in 2016, and in Asia in 2018. Between Q1 and Q3 2024, Tradeweb reported global ETF trading volumes exceeding USD 1 trillion. Over the same period, institutional ETF volumes transacted by Asia clients on Tradeweb&rsquo;s RFQ marketplace increased by 30% year-over-year.<br /><br />Since its launch in February 2021, CONNEQTOR has aimed to improve the speed of ETF trading in Japan, allowing investors to trade at real-time best price quoted, while reducing transaction costs and improving operational efficiency. CONNEQTOR is used by more than 250 institutional investors, and they can trade ETFs by requesting simultaneous quotes from market makers around the world, without having counterparty risks. Its monthly trading value reached a record high of JPY 295.5&nbsp;billion (USD&nbsp;1.93 billion), and an average daily trading value of JPY 13.4&nbsp;billion (USD&nbsp;87 million),&nbsp;a 97% increase over the previous year in&nbsp;July&nbsp;2024.</p>

<p>SIX considers the acquisition of Aquis to be a compelling strategic opportunity which will complement its strategy to scale the exchange business beyond its home markets. The combined resources and capabilities of SIX and Aquis create a Pan-European Exchange across traditional primary exchange and MTF businesses. Both companies share a common philosophy regarding capital markets innovation, liquidity and offering choice to users, which will further strengthen the ability of SIX to serve customers in Switzerland, Spain and across Europe. Furthermore, the unique value proposition of combining Aquis&rsquo; next-generation technology solutions business with SIX&rsquo;s capabilities unlocks recurring revenue streams. In addition, it provides the opportunity to create a competitive pan-European listing venue for growth companies by combining Aquis&rsquo; and SIX&rsquo;s growth listing segments.</p>
<h4><span>Strategic Rationale</span></h4>
<ul>
<li>Aquis offers SIX the opportunity to build on its existing trading offering, adding Aquis&rsquo; MTF business to SIX&rsquo;s existing primary exchange and data businesses, extending SIX&rsquo;s pan-European presence beyond its home markets. &nbsp;</li>
<li>SIX&rsquo;s clients and shareholders benefit from the combined group&rsquo;s enhanced capabilities and pan-European access to exchange services, accompanied by new growth opportunities and thus strengthened Swiss and Spanish financial centres.</li>
<li>SIX shares Aquis&rsquo; strong commitment to capital markets innovation and believes Aquis has a similar philosophy with respect to liquidity, offering choice to users and challenging pan-European incumbents in all parts of the exchange value chain.</li>
<li>By combining Aquis&rsquo; next-generation technology solutions business with SIX&rsquo;s multi-asset class trading, data and post-trade footprint, a unique value proposition unlocks recurring revenue streams.</li>
<li>The combination with Aquis, whose infrastructure facilitates SMEs and growth companies in accessing capital markets, is expected to create the opportunity for a competitive pan-European listing venue, complementing SIX&rsquo;s existing growth listing segments.</li>
<li>SIX expects Aquis to provide the opportunity to create an increasingly attractive offering for retail brokers by extending SIX&rsquo;s universe of tradable securities and improving execution quality for retail liquidity across Europe.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Bj&oslash;rn Sibbern, Global Head of Exchanges at SIX,</span>&nbsp;said: &ldquo;We believe that combining Aquis with SIX's platform is a compelling opportunity to bring together two businesses with a shared commitment to capital markets innovation. The combination will add Aquis&rsquo; strong offering to our traditional primary exchange and data businesses, complementing SIX&rsquo;s existing growth listing segments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As part of SIX, Aquis will continue to operate under its existing brand and business model with maximum agility while benefitting from our resources, scale and further investment, enhancing Aquis&rsquo; ability to continue to develop its business. We look forward to welcoming the Aquis team to SIX and continuing to build a diverse, pan-European Exchange Innovator.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Alasdair Haynes, CEO of Aquis</span>, said: &ldquo;I am immensely proud of the business we have built over the past 12 years. Since launching as a start-up subscription based exchange in 2012, Aquis has become a diversified multi-product European exchange group that creates and facilitates more efficient markets for a modern economy.&nbsp; This has only been possible through continuous technology-led innovation and the tireless efforts of our people.</p>
<p>Aquis has a clear path of growth ahead; however, the board recognises there are always some operational, commercial and market risks associated with the timing of future value creation. The cash offer de-risks this future value creation and provides Aquis shareholders with certain value at a material premium.</p>
<p>As part of SIX, we have an exciting opportunity to accelerate the development of our business and compete more effectively on the European stage, while retaining our entrepreneurial spirit. SIX shares our deep commitment to capital markets innovation and together we will be better placed to assist SMEs and growth companies in accessing capital markets.&rdquo;</p>
<h4><span>Transaction Summary</span></h4>
<p>Under the terms of the offer, each Aquis shareholder will be entitled to receive 727 pence per share in cash. The offer values the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Aquis at approximately &pound;207 million based on treasury stock methodology, and implies an enterprise value of approximately &pound;194 million.</p>
<p>The offer provides value for Aquis shareholders at a premium of approximately 68 per cent to the 6-month volume weighted average price of 433 pence per Aquis share on 8 November 2024 (being the last trading day before the commencement of the offer period) and 120 per cent to the closing price of 330 pence per Aquis share on 8 November 2024.</p>
<p><span>This summary should be read in conjunction with, and is subject to, the full text of the full announcement which has been issued by Aquis through the UK&rsquo;s Regulatory News Service (RNS) under Rule 2.7 of the UK's City Code on Takeovers and Mergers, together with the appendices to the full announcement.</span></p>

<p>A dual Russian-Swedish national was sentenced today to 12 years and six months in prison for his operation of the longest-running bitcoin money laundering service on the darknet.</p>
<p>According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, from 2011 through 2021, Roman Sterlingov, 36, was involved in operating Bitcoin Fog, the darknet&rsquo;s longest-running cryptocurrency &ldquo;mixer.&rdquo; Over the course of its decade-long operation, Bitcoin Fog gained notoriety as a go-to money laundering service for criminals seeking to hide their illicit proceeds from law enforcement and processed transactions involving over 1.2 million bitcoin, valued at approximately $400 million at the time the transactions occurred. The bulk of this cryptocurrency came from darknet marketplaces and was tied to illegal narcotics, computer crimes, identity theft, and child sexual abuse material.</p>
<p>In March 2024, after a one-month trial, a jury found Sterlingov guilty of money laundering conspiracy, money laundering, operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, and money transmission without a license in the District of Columbia.</p>
<p>In addition to his term of imprisonment, Sterlingov was sentenced to pay a forfeiture money judgment in the amount of $395,563,025.39, and forfeiture of seized cryptocurrencies and monetary assets valued at approximately $1.76 million. In addition, Sterlingov was ordered to forfeit his interest in the Bitcoin Fog wallet, totaling approximately 1,345 bitcoin and currently valued at more than $103 million.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roman Sterlingov ran the longest-running bitcoin money laundering service on the darknet, and today he paid the price,&rdquo; said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. &ldquo;In the deepest corners of the internet, he provided a home for criminals of all stripes, from drug traffickers to identity thieves, to store hundreds of millions of dollars in illicit proceeds. Today&rsquo;s sentence reflects the Department&rsquo;s&nbsp;determination to dismantle the criminal networks that enable criminal actors to flourish and ensure consequences for the criminals operating them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roman Sterlingov laundered over $400 million in criminal proceeds through Bitcoin Fog, his cryptocurrency &lsquo;mixing&rsquo; service that was open for business to criminals looking to hide dirty money,&rdquo; said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department&rsquo;s Criminal Division. &ldquo;Through his illicit money laundering operation, Sterlingov helped criminals launder proceeds of drug trafficking, computer crime, identity theft, and the sexual exploitation of children. Today&rsquo;s sentencing underscores the Justice Department&rsquo;s commitment to holding those who facilitate criminal activity fully accountable for their crimes. I am especially proud of the dedicated investigators and prosecutors who worked tirelessly to unmask and prosecute the Bitcoin Fog scheme.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As proven at trial, Roman Sterlingov created and used an online tool to process hundreds of millions in illegal transactions, enabling darknet drug dealers and those who sell child sexual abuse material, to operate,&rdquo; said U.S. Attorney Matthew M. Graves for the District of Columbia. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s sentence sends an unmistakable message: those who help criminals with online payments for their illegal activities will face serious penalties. This prosecution also provides more proof that we have the skilled investigators and talented prosecutors needed to hold those who operate these darknet sites accountable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clearly, Sterlingov&rsquo;s attempt to shroud his illicit activities in a cloak of anonymity ultimately failed against the sophisticated collaborative work of our Criminal Investigation special agents and partners,&rdquo; said Chief Guy Ficco of IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI). &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s significant prison term and hundreds of millions in financial sanctions against the defendant emphasizes the seriousness of this conviction and should serve as a stark notice that this type of criminal activity will not be tolerated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The prosecution of Roman Sterlingov and the sentence imposed today should serve as a warning to cybercriminals,&rdquo; said Assistant Director in Charge David Sundberg of the FBI. &ldquo;The FBI will not hesitate to use all tools at its disposal and will leverage our extensive partnerships to disrupt the cybercriminal ecosystem and the individuals who provide the key services that facilitate criminal activity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The IRS-CI District of Columbia Cyber Crime Unit and FBI Washington Field Office investigated the case. The Justice Department&rsquo;s Office of International Affairs and FBI&rsquo;s Virtual Asset Unit provided invaluable assistance. Additional assistance was provided by Japanese, Swedish, Danish, Romanian, and UK authorities, as well as Europol.</p>
<p>Trial Attorneys Jeff Pearlman and C. Alden Pelker of the Criminal Division&rsquo;s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) and Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher B. Brown for the District of Columbia are prosecuting the case. Pelker is a member, and Brown is a former member, of CCIPS&rsquo; National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team. Former CCIPS Paralegal Specialist Dr. Divya Ramjee and Paralegal Specialist Angela De Falco for the District of Columbia provided valuable assistance.&nbsp;</p>

<title>As Crypto Heads Into Bull Run Investors Are Spending Their Profits Rather Than Choosing To HODL: Petr Kozyakov, Co-Founder And CEO Of Mercuryo</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The impending Trump administration is anticipated to benefit the digital assets market. Donald Trump is expected to adopt a more lenient approach to regulation and has promised to transform America into "the crypto capital of the planet."</p>
<p><span>Petr Kozyakov, Co-founder and CEO of Mercuryo, a leading payment infrastructure platform in the digital token space, has commented on how innovation in crypto payments is encouraging people to spend their assets rather than HODL.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;As the cryptocurrency space enters another bull market &ndash; coinciding with Donald Trump&rsquo;s victory in the US election &ndash; the time-honoured philosophy of HODL may be receding. A new wave of product innovation in the digital token space is providing those who trade crypto with a seamless and secure means of spending their newfound crypto wealth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While in the past the process of &lsquo;off-ramping&rsquo; cryptocurrency holdings often left holders of digital assets at the mercy of shady intermediaries, exorbitant fees and snail-pace payment processing, times have changed. Established giants from the traditional payment world such as Mastercard are working in partnership with pioneers in the Web3 space to offer payment products that have a level of consumer protection that is on a par with traditional payment products. We will surely see increasing use of these innovative crypto payment products and off-ramping tools in a bull run that has already taken Bitcoin to a new all-time high near $77,000.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization Announces New Proficiency Model Partnership With Fitch Learning</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/canadian-investment-regulatory-organization-announces-new-proficiency-model-part/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/canadian-investment-regulatory-organization-announces-new-proficiency-model-part/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) has named Fitch Learning as its new service provider, partnering to assist CIRO&rsquo;s move towards an assessment-centric proficiency model for Approved Persons of investment dealers.</p>
<p>The development of a new and enhanced Proficiency Model has been a multi-year strategic initiative for CIRO that will ensure our registrants meet high proficiency standards that will equip them with the necessary knowledge, skills and behaviours to effectively perform their job. The new model will ensure that these standards are both relevant for today&rsquo;s evolving financial industry and offer the necessary flexibility to adapt to future changes.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, CIRO published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ciro.ca/news-room/publications/rule-amendments-request-comments-proposed-proficiency-model-approved-persons-under-investment-dealer" target="_self" title="Rule amendments - Request for comments - Proposed Proficiency Model - Approved Persons under the Investment Dealer and Partially Consolidated Rules">request for comments</a>&nbsp;on proposed amendments to rules to reflect the new proficiency model. These proposed rules are not yet final and subject to approval by the Canadian Securities Administrators.</p>
<p>"We&rsquo;re excited to take the next step in evolving our Proficiency Model,&rdquo; said Elsa Renzella, Senior Vice-President, Enforcement and Registration. &ldquo;CIRO is committed to creating an innovative proficiency model based on our competency profiles, to ensuring relevance and responsiveness as the financial industry transforms, and to delivering this model in an efficient and cost-effective way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fitch Learning works with businesses and organizations offering professional designations and credentials around the world, specifically helping develop future leaders in the financial services industry. Fitch was selected from a competitive field of proposals for their approach to user experience and breadth of financial industry expertise.</p>
<p>Andreas Karaiskos, CEO of Fitch Learning, expressed, &ldquo;We are delighted to partner with CIRO to deliver critical services and infrastructure that will underpin the regulator&rsquo;s new proficiency model.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Karaiskos further elaborated, &ldquo;Our end-to-end solution will facilitate syllabus development, exam delivery, and the creation of educational portals tailored for candidates, firms, and CIRO.&rdquo;</p>
<p>CIRO regulates more than 33,000 Investment Dealer Approved Persons across Canada with assets under administration of over $4 trillion. The Proficiency Initiative includes the development of nine bilingual examinations and corresponding syllabi, the establishment of an exam delivery platform and portals. This new Proficiency Model will be rolled out by January 1, 2026.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we transition to a new assessment-centric approach, we are grateful to our existing and long-serving education partner the Canadian Securities Institute (CSI), for its many years of collaboration to deliver exceptional education solutions to Canada&rsquo;s industry,&rdquo; said Renzella.</p>
<p>CIRO is working with the CSI to ensure a smooth transition to the new model.</p>
<p>This partnership with Fitch Learning signals CIRO&rsquo;s commitment to innovation, efficiency, and excellence in setting a new proficiency standard for the Canadian financial services industry.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Invesco Advisers For Making Misleading Statements About Supposed Investment Considerations</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-charges-invesco-advisers-for-making-misleading-statements-about-supposed-inv/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Invesco Advisers, Inc. for making misleading statements about the percentage of company-wide assets under management that integrated environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors in investment decisions. The Atlanta-based registered investment adviser agreed to pay a $17.5 million civil penalty to settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, from 2020 to 2022, Invesco told clients and stated in marketing materials that between 70 and 94 percent of its parent company&rsquo;s assets under management were &ldquo;ESG integrated.&rdquo; However, in reality, these percentages included a substantial amount of assets that were held in passive ETFs that did not consider ESG factors in investment decisions. Furthermore, the SEC&rsquo;s order found that Invesco lacked any written policy defining ESG integration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As stated in the order, Invesco saw commercial value in claiming that a high percentage of company-wide assets were ESG integrated. But saying it doesn&rsquo;t make it so,&rdquo; said Sanjay Wadhwa, Acting Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;Companies should be straightforward with their clients and investors rather than seeking to capitalize on investing trends and buzzwords.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The order charges Invesco with willfully violating the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Without admitting or denying the order&rsquo;s findings, Invesco agreed to cease and desist from violations of the charged provisions, be censured, and pay the aforementioned $17.5 million civil penalty.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Jonathan T. Menitove of the Asset Management Unit and Richard Rodriguez of the Atlanta Regional Office with assistance from Robert K. Gordon. It was supervised by Ruth Hawley of the San Francisco Regional Office, Stephen E. Donahue of the Atlanta Regional Office, and Andrew Dean and Corey Schuster of the Asset Management Unit.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li><b><i>Fixed income-based Relative Value gains, Macro declines as US interest rates rise, geopolitical uncertainty remains</i></b></li>
<li><b><i>HFR releases Special Report: Presidential Politics and Hedge Funds</i></b></li>
</ul>
<p>Hedge funds posted declines in October on mixed strategy performance as investors positioned for the US Presidential election and as corporate earnings ranged widely from strong to weak, coupled with the continued escalation of military conflicts in the Middle East and Eastern Europe. The HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index (FWC)<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;declined -0.7 percent in October, while the HFRI Asset Weighted Composite Index fell -0.6 percent for the month, according to data released today by HFR. Performance gains of +0.6 percent in the HFRI Relative Value Index were more than offset by declines in the HFRI Macro (Total) Index, which fell -2.0 percent in October.</p>
<p><b>HFR LAUNCHES SPECIAL REPORT: PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS AND HEDGE FUNDS</b></p>
<p>HFR is pleased to present a special research report featuring in-depth quantitative analysis on the performance of hedge funds through the lens of which US political party administration held the office of the president during specific time frames. This unique and insightful special report includes a complete historical comparison of presidential terms since 1990 across many financial, economic and political cycles. The report is available for complimentary download at&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.hfr.com/product/presidential-politics-and-hedge-fund-performance" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.hfr.com/product/presidential-politics-and-hedge-fund-performance</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;This deep dive into hedge fund performance, viewed through the lens of presidential terms and the rising and falling stock of the main political parties, is a valuable tool for anyone looking to understand the historical trends and be as informed as possible as they look towards the future,&rdquo; said Kenneth J. Heinz, President of HFR.</p>
<p>The recently launched HFRI Multi-Manager/Pod Shop Index declined -0.46 percent for the month as managers positioned for election volatility, while the HFR Cryptocurrency Index advanced an estimated +3.5 percent, increasing its YTD return to +21.7 percent through October.</p>
<p>Hedge fund performance dispersion contracted in October, as the top decile of the HFRI FWC constituents advanced by an average of +3.8 percent, while the bottom decile fell by an average of -7.3 percent, representing a top/bottom dispersion of 11.1 percent for the month. By comparison, the top/bottom performance dispersion in September was 13.1 percent. In the trailing 12 months ending October 2024, the top decile of FWC constituents gained +49.4 percent, while the bottom decile declined -12.2 percent, representing a top/bottom dispersion of 61.1 percent. Approximately forty-five percent (45%) of hedge funds produced positive performance in October.</p>
<p>Fixed income-based, interest rate-sensitive strategies led strategy performance in October, as US interest rates increased and equities declined heading into the early November US Presidential election, with the HFRI Relative Value (Total) Index gaining an estimated +0.6 percent for the month. RVA strategy performance was led by the HFRI RV: FI-Sovereign Index, which advanced +1.0 percent for the month, followed closely by the HFRI RV: FI-Asset Backed Index, which added +0.9 percent, increasing its YTD 2024 return to +8.4 percent.</p>
<p>Event-Driven (ED) strategies, which often focus on out-of-favor, deep value equity exposures and speculation on M&amp;A situations, reversed recent monthly gains with a decline in October, as the HFRI Event-Driven (Total) Index fell -0.35 percent. ED sub-strategy declines were led by the HFRI ED: Activist Index, which fell -2.6 percent, though these were partially offset by gains in the HFRI ED: Credit Arbitrage Index, which advanced +3.45 percent, as managers positioned for a building M&amp;A cycle through year-end, resulting from clarity on US presidential election, and improving economic outlook.</p>
<p>Equity Hedge (EH) funds, which invest long and short across specialized sub-strategies, also declined in October with the HFRI Equity Hedge (Total) Index falling an estimated -0.7 percent for the month to bring the YTD return to +9.6 percent, which leads all main strategy indices YTD 2024. EH sub-strategy declines were led by the HFRI EH: Quantitative Directional Index, which declined -2.0 percent for the month, though remains the leading area of performance across all sub-strategies with a YTD return of +14.3 percent through October.</p>
<p>Macro strategies led declines in October as US interest rates increased and investors positioned for the US Presidential Election, with the HFRI Macro (Total) Index falling -2.0 percent. Macro sub-strategy declines were led by the HFRI Macro: Systematic Diversified Index, which posted a monthly decline of -3.3 percent on weakness in quantitative, systematic, trend-following exposures. Partially offsetting these declines, the HFRI Macro: Discretionary Thematic Index gained +0.15 percent for the month.</p>
<p>Liquid Alternative UCITS strategies also declined in October, as the HFRX Absolute Return Index posted a narrow decline of -0.07 percent while the HFRX Global Hedge Fund Index fell -0.66 percent. Strategy declines were led by the HFRX Macro Index, which fell -1.75 percent, while the HFRX Relative Value Index posted a narrow decline of -0.21 percent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hedge funds posted mixed strategy performance in October as the US election rose to a dramatic crescendo to begin November, with performance most directly impacted by rising interest rates, corporate earnings reports which ranged widely from strong to weak, and small, broad-based equity market declines. Hedged fixed income-based Relative Value Arbitrage strategies successfully navigated this environment, while directional Equity and Event strategies posted mixed performance,&rdquo; stated Kenneth J. Heinz, President of HFR. &ldquo;With clarity on the US election results, investors and managers are actively adjusting exposures to their expectations for priority policy shifts on international trade, manufacturing, immigration, energy, security with these changes resulting in significant impacts for monetary and fiscal policy, supply chains, M&amp;A and geopolitical risk. It is likely that institutional investors seeking to maximize their exposure to these powerful trends and opportunities, while minimizing risk and uncertainty, will increase exposure to hedge funds which have demonstrated both historically and recently through these market cycles, their strategy&rsquo;s robustness as a mechanism for achieving these portfolio objectives in 2025.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Warsaw Stock Exchange Group generated sales revenue at a high PLN 112.1 million in Q3 2024, a year-on-year increase of 5.7%. The Group&rsquo;s EBITDA increased by 7.2% year on year to PLN 42.5 million in Q3 2024 and the net profit attributable to the equity holders of the parent entity reached PLN 42.0 million, a year-on-year increase of 5.7%. The growth rate of expenses was lower than the growth rate of revenue for a second consecutive quarter, which improved the profit margins. The Group&rsquo;s expenses increased by only 3.9% year on year in Q3 2024.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>PLN 250.4 billion &ndash; record-high EOB turnover value in Q1-3 2024 (27.8% YoY)</span></li>

<li><span>PLN 121.8 million - EBITDA in Q1-3 2024 adjusted for a one-off&nbsp;<span>[1]</span>&nbsp;(2.8% YoY)</span></li>
<li><span>PLN 114.7 million - net profit in Q1-3 2024 adjusted for a one-off (3.1% YoY)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Growing turnover and liquidity</span></p>
<p>The Warsaw Stock Exchange maintained its position among the top European markets in Q3 2024. According to the Federation of European Securities Exchanges (FESE), GPW reported EOB equity turnover growth of 35% year on year, one of the best results in Europe. GPW ranked second among European exchanges by velocity with a ratio of 37.2%.</p>
<p>GPW Main Market EOB turnover reached PLN 79.3 billion in Q3 2024, a 29% increase year on year. The average daily EOB equity turnover value was PLN 1.22 billion, an increase of 27% year on year. Investors remained very active in October, when average daily GPW Main Market equity turnover value was PLN 1.25 billion.</p>
<p>GPW Main Market EOB equity turnover value reached a record high of PLN 250.4 billion in January-September 2024, an increase of 27.8% year on year, representing the best first nine months of the year in the history of the Warsaw Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>The growing turnover and high liquidity in Q3 confirm that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is an important capital market in Europe. Our performance is the result of the strong equity market and improving cost control. A highlight of recent weeks was the new listing of the Żabka Group: the fourth largest IPO in the history of GPW and the fourth largest IPO in Europe this year. We expect that this new listing will encourage other companies to be floated on the stock exchange in Warsaw, and that another significant IPO will take place later this year,</em>&rdquo; said Tomasz Bardziłowski, President of the Management Board of the Warsaw Stock Exchange.</p>
<p><span>Record-high revenue</span></p>
<p>The Warsaw Stock Exchange Group&rsquo;s revenue reached a record-high level of PLN 351.1 million in Q1-3 2024, a year-on-year increase of 6.7%. The GPW Group&rsquo;s EBITDA was PLN 116.0 million in Q1-3 2024, down 2.1% year on year. Net profit attributable to the equity holders of the parent entity reached PLN 108.9 million in Q1-3 2024, down 2.2% year on year. EBITDA adjusted for a one-off event increased by 2.8% year on year to PLN 121.8 million in Q1-3 2024, and net profit attributable to the equity holders of the parent entity adjusted for the one-off increased by 3.1% to PLN 114.7 million.</p>
<p>In Q3 2024 alone, the GPW Group&rsquo;s revenue amounted to PLN 112.1 million, an increase of 5.7% year on year. Revenue from the financial market increased by 9.3% year on year to PLN 71.8 million, while revenue from the commodity market increased by 1.6% year on year to PLN 36.2 million. Revenue from information services on the financial and commodity markets increased by 13.9% to PLN 16.7 million.</p>
<p>The Group&rsquo;s operating expenses grew at a lower rate than revenue for a second consecutive quarter. Expenses increased by 3.9% year on year to PLN 77.5 million in Q3 2024. The reduced growth rate of expenses was the result of strict control over external service charges.</p>
<p>The GPW Group&rsquo;s EBITDA amounted to PLN 42.5 million in Q3 2024, an increase of 7.2% year on year. Net profit attributable to the equity holders of the parent entity increased by 5.7% year on year to PLN 42.0 million in Q3 2024.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>We are proud of the performance of the GPW Group in Q3. The solid growth of revenue is a result of favourable conditions on the domestic equity market and growing sales of information services, combined with stable revenue in the commodity segment and continued control over expenses. The growth rate of expenses remained below the growth rate of revenue for the second quarter in a row, which improves our profit margins,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;said Marcin Rulnicki, Member of the Management Board of the Warsaw Stock Exchange.</p>
<p><span>Product development</span></p>
<p>The Warsaw Stock Exchange is consistently expanding its range of financial instruments to better address the diverse needs of investors. Tracker structured certificates based on the EURO STOXX 50 Net Return and STOXX Europe 600 Oil &amp; Gas Net Return stock indices were newly listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange in Q3 2024. Tracker certificates are investment products which track and replicate the behaviour of the underlying at a ratio of 1:1. These instruments are dedicated primarily to investors with a long investment horizon.</p>
<p>Nine new stocks from the New York stock exchanges Nasdaq and NYSE have been listed on GlobalConnect since July, including Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, JP Morgan Chase, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Netflix, Nvidia, and Visa. GlobalConnect currently lists 25 stocks, including 10 US stocks. Foreign stocks are traded on GPW in Polish zloty.</p>
<p>In July, GPW Benchmark started to publish three new stock market indices: WIGind, WIGmed, and WIG.MS-ECM. WIGind (WIGindustry) includes industrial companies other than energy and mining companies. WIGmed (WIGmedicine) includes medical operators, such as hospitals, clinics, manufacturers of drugs, medical equipment and supplies, and biotechnology companies. WIGind and WIGmed, together with the existing WIGtechTR, form a sub-family of cross-sector indices. The family of macro-sector indices, which includes WIG.MS-BAS, WIG.MS-FIN, and WIG.GAMES5, expanded in July with the new index WIG.MS-ECM. WIG.MS-ECM includes five of the most liquid e-commerce stocks: Allegro, Asbis, Dino, Eurocash, and Pepco.</p>
<p>August 2024 was a record-breaking month in the history of ETFs listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. The ETF turnover value reached an all-time high of PLN 167 million. Two new ETFs have been available on GPW since September: BETA ETF Nasdaq-100 3x lev and BETA ETF Nasdaq-100 2x short. These are leveraged instruments dedicated primarily to active investors.</p>
<p><span>GPW WATS budget update</span></p>
<p>The Exchange Management Board decided to update the GPW WATS budget. The planned budget for the production of WATS version V1 supporting the GPW and BondSpot markets is now PLN 133.9 million. The production of version V2 for the BondSpot All2All market by the end of 2025 and the analysis of version V3 for derivatives trade in H2 2025 are currently valued at PLN 19 million.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>The updated budget will ensure the completion of the production process and the implementation of the system in accordance with the precise, detailed terms of reference. It also covers the design and production, on the basis of WATS, of a new platform for the BondSpot All2All market, whose framework is currently being discussed, and the start of the analysis of version V3. Updating the budget at the final stage of the project allows for very precise planning of the necessary capital expenditure,</em>&rdquo; said Sławomir Panasiuk, Vice-President of the Management Board of the Warsaw Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The scheduled date for the production launch of the new system is 10 November 2025. The decision was taken by the GPW Management Board in July on the recommendation of the GPW WATS Implementation Committee, which plays a key role in overseeing and coordinating all aspects of the implementation of the new system.</p>
<p><span>15 years of Catalyst</span></p>
<p>Catalyst, the specialised market for corporate, municipal, and government bonds, celebrated its 15<span>th</span>&nbsp;anniversary in September 2024. Since its launch in 2009, Catalyst has become a key platform for Polish companies and local governments, enabling them to raise capital, while it offers investors a wide range of debt instruments.</p>
<p>Catalyst now lists 693 series of bonds denominated in PLN issued by 137 entities and 44 series of bonds in EUR issued by 16 entities. The total value of bonds listed on Catalyst exceeds PLN 1.3 trillion. In September, KGHM introduced its debt instruments on Catalyst. The PLN 1 billion series C bond issue was one of the largest corporate bond issues introduced on Catalyst in recent years.</p>

<p>In September, the Warsaw Stock Exchange appointed the Issuer Council, a platform for dialogue between issuers, investors, and regulators. Its mission is to improve market efficiency and to promote long-term development strategies of Polish companies by sharing knowledge and experience with the Exchange&rsquo;s governing bodies. The Council&rsquo;s activities focus on three key areas: improving transparency, promoting the capital market, and building investor confidence. The Council will actively initiate changes to support the development and stability of the market, and its members will be ambassadors of these positive efforts, shaping the future of the capital market in Poland.</p>
<p><span>Promotion of investor education</span></p>
<p>The Parkiet Challenge competition co-organised by GPW and the newspaper&nbsp;<em>Gazeta Giełdy i Inwestor&oacute;w Parkiet</em>&nbsp;has made a comeback to the Warsaw trading floor. The sixth edition of the competition is a unique opportunity for all those who want to improve their knowledge of the Warsaw Stock Exchange and test their investment skills. The Parkiet Challenge offers a chance to gain hands-on experience in the world of investing, using virtual money and based on genuine market valuations. The main part of the competition will last until 22 November and the grand finale will be held on 4 December at GPW&rsquo;s headquarters. Dozens of thousands of participants have taken part in previous editions of the competition.</p>
<p>The first-ever summer investment competition in the history of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, &ldquo;Holidays on the Stock Exchange&rdquo;, organised in cooperation with the editors of Bankier.pl, attracted a record number of participants. More than 6,000 people took part in the competition, concluding almost 100,000 virtual transactions worth nearly PLN 108 million.</p>
<p>In October, the GPW Foundation opened registration for the 23<span>rd</span>&nbsp;edition of the Online School Exchange Game (SIGG) addressed to students of secondary schools and senior grades of primary schools. This educational project aims to educate young people in the capital markets, spark interest in the stock exchange and, above all, in opportunities for investment and long-term savings. The SIGG enables young people to learn about investing in a practical way, providing a valuable addition to Business and Management classes. More than 25,000 school students and over 1,200 teachers have registered to participate in this year&rsquo;s SIGG. Registration for the 23<span>rd</span>&nbsp;edition of the Online School Exchange Game is open until 11 November.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Singapore Exchange (SGX Group) today released its market statistics for October 2024. Derivatives daily average volume (DAV) rose to an all-time high, boosted by increased trading activity across multiple asset classes through China&rsquo;s Golden Week holiday. The Singapore stock market showed its resilience against a backdrop of softer regional growth.</p>
<p>Key highlights:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Record derivatives DAV:&nbsp;</span>Derivatives DAV surged 48% year-on-year (y-o-y) in October to a record 1.58 million contracts, while total traded volume climbed 52% y-o-y to 31.3 million contracts. Gains were broad-based, with equity index futures volume up 61% y-o-y at 19.9 million contracts, foreign exchange (FX) futures volume up 63% y-o-y at 5.32 million contracts and commodity derivatives volume up 25% y-o-y at 5.58 million contracts, demonstrating the strength of SGX Group&rsquo;s multi-asset offering.</li>
<li><span>Record China A50 index futures activity through Golden Week:</span>&nbsp;The volume of&nbsp;<a>SGX FTSE China A50 Index Futures &ndash; the world&rsquo;s most liquid international futures for Chinese equities &ndash;&nbsp;</a>rose to an all-time high of 14.9 million contracts in October, with DAV at a record&nbsp;827,997 contracts. Open interest reached a single-day record of 1.26 million contracts on 8 October. There was also heightened activity during the overnight T+1 sessions, as global investors managed their China exposures before the cash market&rsquo;s reopening.</li>
<li><span>Commodities volume growth:</span>&nbsp;Stronger demand to manage and navigate China risk also drove commodity trading activity&nbsp;in October. The volume of SGX SICOM rubber derivatives, the global pricing benchmark for natural rubber, increased 64% y-o-y to 423,666 contracts amid heightened volatility, marked by a growing base of market participants. With China's markets closed during the first five trading days of the month, market participants continued to access SGX Commodities with DAV of bellwether iron ore derivatives reaching 102,131 lots while DAV of SICOM rubber derivatives climbed to 15,139 lots &ndash; a record for Golden Week.</li>
<li><span>Growth in FX futures hedging:</span>&nbsp;Total FX futures traded volume gained 53% y-o-y in October to a notional US$362.7 billion as&nbsp;U.S. Treasury bond yields climbed, setting the stage for November&rsquo;s elections and Federal Reserve meeting. SGX USD/CNH FX Futures were a standout, with volumes up 50% y-o-y at 3.11 million contracts (notional US$311.5 billion), fuelled by China&rsquo;s measures to bolster economic stability following stimulus efforts in September. SGX INR/USD FX Futures volume increased 76% y-o-y to 1.75 million contracts. DAV of SGX KRW/USD FX Futures climbed 150% y-o-y to a record US$361 million notional, with open interest up 400% y-o-y at US$745 million.</li>
<li><span>Singapore stock market remains flight-to-quality venue:</span>&nbsp;Securities market turnover value rose 36% y-o-y in October to S$26.9 billion, with securities daily value (SDAV) also up 36% y-o-y at S$1.22 billion. The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) moved within a narrow 90-point range during the month to 3,558.88, taking its year-to-date gains to 9.8%. Retail investors net bought S$210 million of cash equities in October, reversing outflows from the previous month, while institutional outflows were moderate compared with ASEAN venues, underscoring the Singapore market&rsquo;s resilience. On 16 October, SGX Securities welcomed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/media-centre/20241016-sgx-securities-welcomes-food-innovators-holdings-limited-catalist">Food Innovators Holdings Limited</a>, which is engaged in the restaurant leasing and subleasing business, to Catalist.</li>
<li><span>New securities product launches:</span>&nbsp;SGX Securities<span>&nbsp;</span>listed new daily leverage certificates (DLC) linked to the U.S. Magnificent Seven stocks in October, with structured certificates planned for the coming months that will further expand its suite of structured products. For the month, the market turnover value of DLCs doubled month-on-month (m-o-m) to S$382 million, while turnover of structured warrants increased 123% m-o-m to S$512 million, bringing the total to the highest since March 2022. On 30 October, SGX Securities broadened its offering of Singapore Depository Receipts with the launch of five new contracts with Hong Kong underlyings.</li>

<title>Solving The Right Problems: Remarks To FINSIA - The Regulators 2024 - Remarks By ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland At FINSIA – The Regulators In Sydney On 8 November 2024.</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul>
<li>ASIC is committed to making our financial system fair and safe for all Australians.</li>
<li>Our strategic priorities reflect emerging issues in our operating environment that put consumers, investors, and the financial system at greatest risk.</li>
<li>All regulators face difficult choices about which problems to prioritise.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good afternoon.</p>
<p>Let me begin by acknowledging the Traditional Owners of the land on which we meet today, the Gadigal people of the Eora nation, and paying my respects to Elders past and present.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank FINSIA for the opportunity to be here today to discuss ASIC&rsquo;s strategic priorities. We recognise the important role that you play in working to enhance the professionalism of Australia&rsquo;s financial services sector.</p>
<p>I would also like to recognise my fellow regulators speaking today. One of the things that has struck me since joining ASIC is the amount of effort we all put into ensuring that our work is aligned where appropriate.</p>
<p>I think Australians &ndash; and New Zealanders for that matter &ndash; can feel confident that we are working together to solve the big problems in our financial system.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to spend the next few minutes talking about problems, because in one sense, one of the key challenges we all face as regulators is choosing which problems to prioritise in our work.</p>
<p>As Australia&rsquo;s integrated corporate, markets, financial services, and consumer credit regulator, we cover a lot of ground at ASIC, so perhaps unsurprisingly, there&rsquo;s no shortage of problems that come across our desks.</p>
<p>Problems are, however, an opportunity for change and improvement &ndash; and that&rsquo;s why they play a key role in our process of setting strategic priorities.</p>
<h2>How we prioritise</h2>
<p>In identifying the most important problems for ASIC to focus on &ndash; those that that put consumers, investors, and the financial system at greatest risk &ndash; we start with the data.</p>
<p>We analyse all the complaints, intelligence, and reports that come through to us &ndash; including more than 11,000 reports of misconduct that we finalised from the public last financial year<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/solving-the-right-problems-remarks-to-finsia-the-regulators-2024/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>But just as importantly, we talk to other regulators &ndash; including the ones you&rsquo;ll hear from today &ndash; as well as industry bodies, consumer advocates, and experts involved in our various consultative panels.</p>
<p>We then consider this intelligence against the key trends in our regulatory environment.</p>
<h2>The problems we&rsquo;re seeing</h2>
<p>So, what are some of the key trends we&rsquo;re looking at?</p>
<p>The first is the financial pressure that many Australians have faced in recent years.</p>
<p>Higher inflation, higher interest rates, and higher rental prices have strained household budgets.</p>
<p>While there are signs that some of these pressures may be easing<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/solving-the-right-problems-remarks-to-finsia-the-regulators-2024/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>, many Australians have been doing it tough - and when they have asked for help, they have not always been heard.</p>
<p>Complaints to AFCA are at a record high<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/solving-the-right-problems-remarks-to-finsia-the-regulators-2024/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>, including complaints about financial hardship assistance.</p>
<p>Our own surveillance into home lenders&rsquo; responses to people in financial hardship found some lenders&rsquo; processes were so difficult that one in three Australians dropped out at least once<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/solving-the-right-problems-remarks-to-finsia-the-regulators-2024/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>We are also conscious that some people see this economic environment as a business opportunity, so we are particularly interested in the emergence of business models that seek to avoid consumer credit laws, or purport to help people to manage their debts.</p>
<p>On top of this, we&rsquo;re also seeing the effects of climate change across our financial system.</p>
<p>Around eight in 10 Australians have experienced a natural disaster since 2019<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/solving-the-right-problems-remarks-to-finsia-the-regulators-2024/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>, and according to the Actuaries Institute, 1.6 million households are now experiencing insurance affordability stress<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/solving-the-right-problems-remarks-to-finsia-the-regulators-2024/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>&nbsp;&ndash; where insurance premiums cost more than four weeks&rsquo; of gross household income.</p>
<p>As we face more frequent and more severe extreme weather events, the high number of Australians making insurance claims has already exposed cracks in the system - as our recent work on claims handling shows<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/solving-the-right-problems-remarks-to-finsia-the-regulators-2024/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>. Insurers increasingly need to be ready to respond to spikes in claims as business as usual &ndash; rather than treating them as extraordinary events.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, new technologies are changing the ways in which consumers navigate financial services markets.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence use is accelerating, and changes in payments technology mean that money moves through &ndash; and sometimes out of &ndash; our financial system much more rapidly.</p>
<p>These developments create both opportunities and risks for consumers.</p>
<p>For example, scammers used technology to steal $2.7 billion from Australians last year<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/solving-the-right-problems-remarks-to-finsia-the-regulators-2024/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>While we have made a significant dent in this through the National Anti-Scam Centre, and ASIC&rsquo;s work to take down investment scam websites, the international criminal groups that are behind the most serious scam activity continue to find new ways to rip off Australians, including by washing funds through cryptocurrency exchanges<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/solving-the-right-problems-remarks-to-finsia-the-regulators-2024/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>.</p>
<h2>How we&rsquo;re tackling them</h2>
<p>What this creates is an environment where consumers are at an increased risk of poor outcomes.</p>
<p>In response, we have developed five strategic priorities for 2024-25:</p>
<ul>
<li>To improve consumer outcomes &ndash; which includes our work on financial hardship and credit issues</li>
<li>To address financial system climate change risk &ndash; which includes our continued interest in how insurers are handling claims after major events</li>
<li>To pursue better retirement outcomes and member services &ndash; which is not limited to our work on member services in super; it also includes work on models of financial advice that result in erosion of superannuation</li>
<li>To advance digital and data resilience and safety &ndash; which includes our work on the use of AI by licensees and disruption of investment scams, and</li>
<li>To drive consistency and transparency across markets and products &ndash; which includes the work we are doing to understand changes in public and private markets.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope to get an opportunity to speak in more depth about some of the actions we are taking under these priorities in our panel discussion later, but I would note that it&rsquo;s no accident that improving consumer outcomes is first and foremost among them.</p>
<p>Consumer protection is in our DNA at ASIC, and we are committed to making our financial system fair and safe for all Australians. That&rsquo;s not only reflected in our forward-looking strategic priorities &ndash; it&rsquo;s also reflected in our strong track record of enforcement outcomes in recent years.</p>
<p>And I hope that focus strikes a chord with many in the room today, because high standards of professional practice are surely ultimately about producing good outcomes for your customers.</p>

<title>Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/federal-reserve-issues-fomc-statement-49/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/federal-reserve-issues-fomc-statement-49/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Since earlier in the year, labor market conditions have generally eased, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low. Inflation has made progress toward the Committee's 2 percent objective but remains somewhat elevated.</p>
<p>The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.</p>
<p>In support of its goals, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent. In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.</p>
<p>In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.</p>
<p>Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Thomas I. Barkin; Michael S. Barr; Raphael W. Bostic; Michelle W. Bowman; Lisa D. Cook; Mary C. Daly; Beth M. Hammack; Philip N. Jefferson; Adriana D. Kugler; and Christopher J. Waller.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) is providing an update to interested parties on the status of its work to introduce binding authority for an independent dispute resolution service.</p>
<p>On November 30, 2023, the CSA issued for comment a proposed regulatory framework for an independent dispute resolution service &ndash; anticipated to be the Ombudsman for Banking Services and Investments (OBSI) &ndash; whose decisions would be binding. The comment period closed on February 28, 2024, and the CSA has been reviewing the responses it has received.</p>
<p>As work continues on introducing binding authority, the CSA plans to issue a further publication for comment in the second half of 2025 that includes the CSA&rsquo;s proposed approach to oversight.</p>
<p>The CSA, the council of the securities regulators of Canada&rsquo;s provinces and territories, coordinates and harmonizes regulation for the Canadian capital markets.</p>
<p>The British Columbia Securities Commission did not participate in this media advisory due to publication restrictions related to the B.C. provincial election.</p>

<title>Remarks at Securities Enforcement Forum D.C. 2024, Sanjay Wadhwa, Acting Director, SEC Division Of Enforcement, Washington D.C., Nov. 6, 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good afternoon. Thank you to Bruce Carton for the invitation to speak today and for the kind introduction. I appreciate the opportunity to be able to talk to you about the work of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement.</p>
<p>As is customary, my remarks today are in my official capacity as Acting Director of the Division of Enforcement, and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Commission, the Commissioners, or other members of the staff.</p>
<p>As you may know, I became Acting Director of Enforcement roughly four weeks ago. But I have been with the SEC for over 21 years, including serving as Deputy Director of Enforcement since Aug. of 2021, and in that and all my prior roles, it&rsquo;s been a privilege to help advance the Division&rsquo;s investor protection mission over the past two decades.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take the opportunity today to discuss some of our work over the past fiscal year, which ended September 30th. We won&rsquo;t be releasing Enforcement&rsquo;s numbers until later this month, so I can&rsquo;t discuss those today, but I think you&rsquo;ll see that the numbers reflect another productive year for the Division.</p>
<p>Numbers, of course, only tell one part of the story. They don&rsquo;t capture the full impact of the enforcement actions filed or the remedies obtained, either individually or cumulatively, in terms of investor protection or changing industry behavior.</p>
<p>So, today I&rsquo;d like to discuss the impact that some of our actions have had throughout the industry, focusing on three areas where we were very active this past fiscal year: (i) our proactive off-channel communications initiative; (ii) whistleblower protection cases; and (iii) cases in which the Commission recognized and credited parties&rsquo; cooperation with the Division&rsquo;s investigations.</p>
<p>Perhaps no recent Enforcement initiative has gotten more attention than our ongoing off-channel communications initiative, colloquially known as the WhatsApp initiative, to ensure that regulated entities, including broker-dealers, investment advisers, and credit ratings agencies, comply with the recordkeeping<span>&nbsp;</span>requirements of the federal securities laws.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/wadhwa-remarks-securities-enforcement-forum-110624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Compliance with those requirements is essential to investor protection and well-functioning markets; conversely&nbsp;<i>noncompliance</i>&nbsp;thwarts effective oversight of the industry, harming investors.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/wadhwa-remarks-securities-enforcement-forum-110624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>In fiscal year 2024, the Commission brought recordkeeping cases resulting in over $600 million in civil penalties against more than 70 firms, including the Commission&rsquo;s first cases charging recordkeeping violations against municipal advisors.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/wadhwa-remarks-securities-enforcement-forum-110624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;Since December 2021, that initiative has resulted in charges against more than 100 firms and over $2 billion in penalties.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/wadhwa-remarks-securities-enforcement-forum-110624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;The firms all admitted that their conduct violated the recordkeeping requirements.</p>
<p>In April of this year, I discussed some of the factors we consider when assessing what penalty to recommend in a particular action.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/wadhwa-remarks-securities-enforcement-forum-110624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>We consider the size of the firm and the regulated parts of its business to ensure that the penalty is adequate to serve as a deterrent against future violations.</p>
<p>We look at the scope and scale of the violations. How many off-channel communications were there and by how many individuals?</p>
<p>We consider precedent. The SEC has now issued dozens of settled orders in these matters since December 2021. These precedents are part of an individualized determination; but they are not a substitute for it.</p>
<p>We consider a firm&rsquo;s efforts to comply with its recordkeeping obligations and to prevent off-channel communications, focusing, for example, on timely adoption of meaningful technological or other solutions.</p>
<p>We also consider whether a firm self-policed, self-reported, remediated, or took other steps to meaningfully cooperate with our investigation.</p>
<p>As I noted, consideration of those factors has resulted in combined civil penalties of more than $2 billion since 2021. The robust penalties have gotten a lot of attention.</p>
<p>But I think the better take-away from the scale of the initiative, both in terms of the dollar amount of penalties and number of firms charged, is that it has shone a light on how widespread noncompliance was when it came to this practice. And, given how far back in time this practice went, it was not the result of folks working remotely during the pandemic.</p>
<p>And I think the best measure of the success of the initiative is how it has changed industry behavior and spurred proactive compliance by market participants. We&rsquo;re seeing that in the number of firms that are improving their policies and procedures and implementing remedial measures. And we&rsquo;re seeing it in the number of firms that are self-reporting violations.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/wadhwa-remarks-securities-enforcement-forum-110624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;Recognizing those proactive efforts, the Commission has recently resolved charges against several firms with reduced penalties or even no penalties at all.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/wadhwa-remarks-securities-enforcement-forum-110624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;Thanks to those improved efforts at compliance, countless investors will be protected from strengthened oversight of registered entities.</p>
<p>Another area where we know that our message is being heard is when it comes to ensuring that market participants do not impede would-be whistleblowers from contacting the SEC, in violation of the Dodd-Frank whistleblower protection rule.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s whistleblower program plays a critical role in our ability to effectively detect wrongdoing, protect investors and the marketplace, and hold violators accountable. But that program only works if whistleblowers have unfettered ability to share with the SEC information about possible securities law violations. However, all too often we have seen, for example, confidentiality agreements and employment agreements by various advisory firms and public companies that impede that ability, including by limiting customers&rsquo; ability to voluntarily contact the SEC<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/wadhwa-remarks-securities-enforcement-forum-110624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;or by requiring employees to waive the right to a monetary award for participating in a government investigation.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/wadhwa-remarks-securities-enforcement-forum-110624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;So this past fiscal year, and the year prior, the Commission brought a series of enforcement actions to address widespread violations.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/wadhwa-remarks-securities-enforcement-forum-110624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p>There was a similar series of actions addressing this issue some years back. And I think for a while there was better compliance, but then things slipped and we&rsquo;re back here. So, this time around the Commission authorized what I view to be fittingly robust remedies, including the largest penalty on record for a standalone violation of the whistleblower protection rule.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/wadhwa-remarks-securities-enforcement-forum-110624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;It is my hope that these enforcement actions will have a significant deterrent effect and will lead to greater and sustained proactive compliance. The outlook is promising, judging by the many client alerts about this topic and the frequency with which the issue is discussed on panels at conferences like this.</p>
<p>A few minutes ago, I mentioned the number of firms that are self-reporting violations and taking remedial action in the off-channel communications cases. Of course, those are not the only cases where we&rsquo;ve seen market participants self-reporting and otherwise cooperating with our investigations. We have been talking very deliberately about the benefits of cooperation for several years now. At the West Coast iteration of this event, about six months ago, former Director Grewal discussed at length what parties can do to best position themselves when advocating for cooperation credit from the SEC.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/wadhwa-remarks-securities-enforcement-forum-110624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>
<p>I encourage you all to review the speech if you haven&rsquo;t seen it. The speech distilled the message we have been very clearly conveying for some time: &ldquo;work with us and we&rsquo;ll work with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In fiscal year 2024, we saw those efforts bear a lot of fruit, with market participants really stepping up their self-policing, self-reporting, remediation, and other cooperation. We saw this throughout the securities industry, in cases involving public companies,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/wadhwa-remarks-securities-enforcement-forum-110624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;investment advisers,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/wadhwa-remarks-securities-enforcement-forum-110624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;broker-dealers,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/wadhwa-remarks-securities-enforcement-forum-110624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;and individuals,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/wadhwa-remarks-securities-enforcement-forum-110624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>&nbsp;and in matters involving a range of violations, such as material misstatements,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/wadhwa-remarks-securities-enforcement-forum-110624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>&nbsp;fraud<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/wadhwa-remarks-securities-enforcement-forum-110624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a>, recordkeeping violations,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/wadhwa-remarks-securities-enforcement-forum-110624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>&nbsp;and controls failures related to cybersecurity.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/wadhwa-remarks-securities-enforcement-forum-110624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></p>
<p>That has continued in the new fiscal year. Just last week the Commission resolved several actions with JPMorgan and acknowledged that firm&rsquo;s self-reports, remedial measures, and voluntary payments of over $100 million to harmed investors.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/wadhwa-remarks-securities-enforcement-forum-110624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a></p>
<p>It benefits everyone when market participants step up like this. It benefits the firms who will likely resolve an SEC investigation more quickly and with reduced sanctions; it benefits the Division to resolve cases more quickly and efficiently so we can focus resources elsewhere; but most importantly, it benefits investors who are no longer at risk from the conduct at issue and who are protected from improved proactive compliance efforts going forward.</p>
<p>It has therefore been encouraging to see market participants respond to our emphasis on cooperation over the past several years.</p>
<p>There has been a bit of a common refrain from the defense bar, likely including at this conference, that folks don&rsquo;t know what to do to get cooperation credit or what the benefit is. Now, I recognize that we don&rsquo;t have a formal policy that guarantees certain outcomes based on certain conduct. But based on what we&rsquo;re seeing at the Division, our message is clearly being heard, and market participants and their counsel &ndash; at least those who are paying attention &ndash; are responding.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>And that, of course, is a major purpose behind our enforcement actions and remedies. To be sure, an important part of it is to hold bad actors accountable. But a crucial purpose is to deter future violations and promote compliance throughout the industry. And I believe our enforcement actions are doing that, as I have discussed. Our recordkeeping initiative, whistleblower protections cases, and the cases where we message the benefits of cooperation are just some examples of where we are seeing this, but every enforcement action the Commission brings sends ripples, some bigger than others, of deterrence and compliance across the industry.</p>
<p>So, while I know that those top-line numbers will get a lot of attention when we release our fiscal year 2024 report later this month, I will also be thinking about the individual and cumulative impact of those enforcement actions across the securities industry and what it all means for investors.</p>
<p>And with that, I am happy to discuss some additional topics in a more informal fireside format.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<title>Canadian Securities Regulators Publish Report On Continuous Disclosure Reviews</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) today published its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asc.ca/-/media/ASC-Documents-part-1/Regulatory-Instruments/2024/11/6181483-CSA-Staff-Notice-51-365-Cont-Discl-Review-Program-2024-and-2023.ashx">biennial report</a>&nbsp;on its Continuous Disclosure Review Program (CD Review Program). This report provides an overview of the CSA&rsquo;s CD Review Program results and highlights key findings and outcomes over the past two fiscal years.<br /><br />The report is an important resource intended to help public companies and their advisors understand and comply with their continuous disclosure obligations. The goal of the CSA CD Review Program is to assess reporting issuers&rsquo; compliance with securities laws and help them improve the completeness and quality of their disclosures.</p>
<p>Report highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial reporting and disclosure during economic uncertainty and technological advancements. 
<ul>
<li>Given the evolving and uncertain economic environment, issuers need to carefully evaluate the impact of increased estimation uncertainty on the financial statements, management&rsquo;s discussion and analysis (MD&amp;A) and other disclosure requirements.</li>
<li>Issuers adopting new technology will also need to consider whether disclosures regarding the use of and variety of evolving risks associated with new technology is necessary. Disclosure considerations related to the use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems are highlighted for issuers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The outcomes of the reviews. 
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;In fiscal 2024, 66 per cent of review outcomes resulted in substantive comments requiring improved and/or amended disclosure, refiling of documents, filing of missing documents, and some of the issuers were referred to enforcement, cease-traded or placed on the default list.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Areas where disclosure could be improved. 
<ul>
<li>The report details common deficiencies that were identified over the past two fiscal years and offers guidance and disclosure examples of how to improve disclosure on select topics.</li>
<li>Topics include business combinations, expected credit losses, overly promotional disclosure such as AI washing and greenwashing, and mineral project disclosure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul type="disc">

<li><span><i>Chief Operating Officer&nbsp;
Julie Holzrichter&nbsp;to Step Down and Assume Advisory Role</i></span></li>
<li><span><i>
Suzanne Sprague&nbsp;to Succeed Holzrichter</i></span></li>
</ul>
<p>CME Group, the world's leading derivatives marketplace, today announced that its Board will extend Chairman and Chief Executive Officer&nbsp;
Terry Duffy's&nbsp;contract through&nbsp;December 31, 2026.</p>
<p>The company also announced&nbsp;
Lynne Fitzpatrick&nbsp;will take on the expanded role of President and Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, its Chief Operating Officer&nbsp;
Julie Holzrichter&nbsp;has decided to step down from her role to begin serving as an advisor to the company.&nbsp;
Suzanne Sprague&nbsp;will succeed Holzrichter as Chief Operating Officer and Global Head of Clearing.</p>
<p>"On behalf of CME Group, I want to congratulate and thank Julie for her many contributions," said CME Group Chairman and Chief Executive Officer&nbsp;
Terry Duffy. "I have worked closely with Julie for more than three decades and, during that time, she has been a valued colleague, instrumental and effective leader and, most importantly, a good friend to me and so many others within our company and industry.

<title>Euronext Publishes Q3 2024 Results</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/euronext-publishes-q3-2024-results/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="BodyText1">Euronext, the&nbsp;leading pan-European market infrastructure, today publishes its results for the third quarter 2024.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Q3 2024 revenue and income was up +10.0% at &euro;396.3 million:</span> 
<ul>
<li>Strong performance of non-volume related revenue representing 58% of total revenueand income (compared to 60% in Q3 2023) and covering 153% of underlying operating expenses, excluding D&amp;A<a href="https://www.euronext.com/en/about/media/euronext-press-releases/euronext-publishes-q3-2024-results#_ftn1"><span>[1]</span></a>&nbsp;(vs. 148% in Q3 2023): 
<ul>
<li>Custody and Settlement revenue grew to &euro;63.1 million (+7.1%), driven by higher assets under custody, dynamic settlement activity and continued double digit growth of value-added services;</li>
<li>Advanced Data Services revenue grew to &euro;61.2 million (+10.4%), driven by continued demand for fixed-income and power trading data, dynamic non-professional usage and audit fees. It also represents a full quarter contribution of GRSS;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Listing revenue grew to &euro;56.4 million (+3.2%), reflecting continued strong performance of corporate services and debt listing. Euronext recorded 13 new equity listings and remained the leading venue for equity listings in Europe;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Technology Solutions reported &euro;25.7 million of revenue (-6.5%),&nbsp;<a>due to the termination of Borsa Italiana legacy services in March 2024 following the migration to Optiq</a>;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trading revenue grew to &euro;136.9 million (+15.7%), driven by record results in fixed income and FX trading and solid growth in cash and power trading;</li>
<li>Clearing revenue grew to &euro;35.2 million (+19.3%), powered by the expansion of Euronext Clearing to Euronext&rsquo;s cash markets, and dynamic fixed income and commodities clearing.&nbsp;Net treasury income for Euronext Clearing&nbsp;was at &euro;13.5 million (-1.7%). Increase in collateral following the financial derivatives clearing migration on 9 September and higher return on cash held was offset by client portfolio rebalancing on repo clearing and by the introduction of the VaR-based margin methodology in Q4 2023;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>Underlying operating expenses excluding D&amp;A<span>1</span>&nbsp;were &euro;150.5 million (+2.7%)</span>. Continued cost discipline and the positive impact of seasonality on recurring expenses offset the cost of growth investments. Euronext upgrades its underlying operating cost guidance for full year 2024 to &euro;620 million.</li>
<li><span>Adjusted EBITDA<span>1</span>&nbsp;was &euro;245.8 million (+15.1%) and adjusted EBITDA margin was 62.0% (+2.7pts).</span></li>
<li><span>Adjusted net income<span>1</span>&nbsp;was &euro;180.8 million (+23.4%) and adjusted EPS was &euro;1.74 (+26.1%),&nbsp;</span>positively impacted by high results from equity investments.</li>
<li><span>Reported net income was &euro;159.5 million (-4.2%),&nbsp;</span>reflecting the negative comparison base related to the &euro;41.6 million capital gain received in Q3 2023 for the disposal of Euronext&rsquo;s 11.1% stake in LCH SA.</li>
<li><span>Net debt to EBITDA</span><a href="https://www.euronext.com/en/about/media/euronext-press-releases/euronext-publishes-q3-2024-results#_ftn2"><span>[2]</span></a><span><span>&nbsp;</span>was at 1.5x at the end of September 2024</span>.</li>

<li><span>&ldquo;Growth for Impact 2024&rdquo; financial targets achieved&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="Bullet2">Euronext achieved its &ldquo;Growth for Impact 2024&rdquo; financial guidance one full quarter in advance. Euronext revenue reached +4.1% CAGR<span>2020PF-2024LTM</span>, compared to +3% to +4% CAGR<span>2020PF-2024e</span>&nbsp;targeted. Despite inflation, Euronext continued its trademark cost discipline. Euronext reached adjusted EBITDA growth of +5.3% CAGR<span>2020PF-2024LTM</span>, compared to +5% to +6% CAGR<span>2020PF-2024e</span>&nbsp;targeted.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Continued bolt-on acquisitions to diversify Euronext&rsquo;s business model</span> 
<ul>
<li>In September 2024, Euronext acquired Substantive Research, an industry-leading pioneer providing in-depth transparency on product and pricing comparison for investment research spend, market data and investment research content.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>In October 2024, Euronext acquired substantially all the business of the Acupay Group, a global leader in financial reporting, corporate actions, cross-border tax relief, and securities processing. The acquisition further expands Euronext Securities services offering to investors and issuers and also strengthens Euronext&rsquo;s non-volume related revenue streams.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="Bullet2"><span>St&eacute;phane Boujnah, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext, said:</span></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Our Q3 2024 results demonstrate our ability to generate strong organic growth. We delivered double-digit topline growth thanks to the excellent performance of our diversified trading business, our successful clearing expansion in Europe and solid performance of non-volume related activities. We maintained strong cost discipline on recurring expenses and we continued to invest in growth. Consequently, we grew our adjusted EBITDA by +15.1% compared to last year, to &euro;245.8 million. Supported by strong results from equity investments, we grew our adjusted net income to a&nbsp; record level of &euro;180.8 million. Our adjusted EPS grew by +26.1% to &euro;1.74.</em><br /><em>Once again, we have demonstrated exceptional execution capabilities. We have finalized the migration of our derivatives markets to Euronext Clearing, the final step of the Borsa Italiana Group integration. We have over performed the &euro;115 million guidance for the total run-rate EBITDA synergies related to the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition to reach &euro;121 million. This is twice the amount targeted at the closing of the transaction in April 2021. We&nbsp;achieved more synergies than targeted, and spent less costs for the integration than anticipated.</em><br /><em>Thanks to our strong performance, we reached our &ldquo;Growth for Impact 2024&rdquo; financial targets a full quarter in advance. Euronext is now present on the entire trading value chain, from pre-listing to post trade and solutions.&nbsp;We are perfectly positioned to accelerate growth, through innovation and efficiency. Our integrated clearing capabilities enable us to bring a set of innovative products to the market, some of which are already live. Alongside these organic initiatives, we continued to strengthen our non-volume related business with strategic bolt-on acquisitions.</em><br /><em>I am looking forward to share how we will innovate for growth over the next three years at our investor day on 8&nbsp;November 2024.&rdquo;</em></p>

<li><span>Q3 2024 revenue and income</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="BodyText10">In Q3 2024, Euronext&rsquo;s revenue and income amounted to &euro;396.3 million, up +10.0% compared to Q3 2023, driven by the strong performance of trading and post-trade activities, resulting from a dynamic trading environment for most asset classes and the positive contribution of the Euronext Clearing European expansion for cash instruments at the end of November 2023, as well as solid organic growth in non-volume related businesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyText10">On a like-for-like basis and at constant currencies, Euronext revenue and income was up +9.7% in Q3 2024 compared to Q3 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyText10">Non-volume related revenue accounted for 58% of Group revenue in Q3 2024, slightly down compared to Q3 2023 due to the record performance in fixed-income trading and strong performance across most of the other volume-related activities. The&nbsp;underlying operating expenses excluding D&amp;A coverage by non-volume related revenue ratio was at 153% in Q3 2024, compared to 148% in Q3 2023.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Q3 2024 adjusted EBITDA</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="BodyText10">Underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation increased by +2.7% to &euro;150.5&nbsp;million, reflecting continued cost control and the positive impact of seasonality which offset accelerated growth investments. On a like-for-like basis, underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation increased by +2.1% compared to Q3 2023.</p>
<p class="BodyText10">Consequently, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter totalled &euro;245.8 million, up +15.1% compared to Q3 2023. This represents an adjusted EBITDA margin of 62.0%, up +2.7 points compared to Q3 2023. On a like-for-like basis, adjusted EBITDA for Q3 2024 was up +14.9%, and adjusted EBITDA margin was up +2.8 points compared to the same perimeter in Q3 2023.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Q3 2024 net income, share of the parent company shareholders</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="BodyText10">Depreciation and amortisation accounted for &euro;47.2 million in Q3 2024, +12.8% more than in Q3 2023 due to ongoing migration projects. PPA related to acquired businesses accounted for &euro;20.2 million and is included in depreciation and amortisation.</p>
<p class="BodyText10">Adjusted operating profit was &euro;224.7 million, up +15.0% compared to Q3 2023. On a like-for-like basis, adjusted operating profit was up +14.9% compared to Q3 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyText10">&euro;30.2 million of non-underlying expenses, including depreciation and amortisation, were reported in Q3 2024, related to the implementation of the &ldquo;Growth for Impact 2024&rdquo; strategic plan and the PPA of acquired businesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyText10">Net financing income for Q3 2024 was &euro;2.9 million, compared to a net financing income of &euro;1.5 million in Q3 2023. This results from higher interest income due to higher interest rates, offsetting the cost of debt.</p>
<p class="BodyText10">Results from equity investments accounted for &euro;23.4 million in Q3 2024, reflecting the dividend from Euroclear received in Q3 2024. As a reminder, in Q3 2023, Euronext reported &euro;54.4 million in results from equity investments, reflecting the &euro;41.6 million gain on the sale of Euronext&rsquo;s stake in LCH SA and the dividend received from Euroclear.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyText10">Income tax for Q3 2024 was &euro;52.5 million. This translated into an effective tax rate of 23.8% for the quarter, compared to 22.0% in Q3 2023. The tax rate in Q3 2024 and Q3 2023 was positively impacted by non-taxable income.</p>
<p class="BodyText10">Share of non-controlling interests mainly relating to the Borsa Italiana Group and Nord Pool amounted to &euro;8.8 million in Q3 2024.</p>
<p class="BodyText10">As a result, the reported net income, share of the parent company shareholders, decreased by -4.2% for Q3 2024 compared to Q3 2023, to &euro;159.5 million. This represents a reported EPS of &euro;1.54 basic and &euro;1.53 diluted in Q3 2024, compared to &euro;1.57 basic and &euro;1.56 diluted in Q3 2023. Adjusted net income, share of the parent company shareholders was up +23.4% to &euro;180.8 million. Adjusted EPS (basic) was up +26.1% in Q3 2024, at &euro;1.74 per share, compared to an adjusted EPS (basic) of &euro;1.38 per share in Q3 2023. This increase reflects higher profit and a lower number of outstanding shares over the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first half of 2023.</p>
<p class="BodyText10">The weighted number of shares used over the first nine months of 2024 was 103,649,167 for the basic calculation and 104,036,188 for the diluted calculation, compared to 106,563,821 and 106,844,622 respectively over the first nine months of 2023. The difference reflects the share repurchase programme carried out in H2 2023. In Q3 2024, Euronext reported a net cash flow from operating activities of &euro;237.4 million, compared to &euro;174.5 million in Q3 2023, reflecting higher positive changes in working capital from CCP activities at Euronext Clearing and the sale of the 11.1% share in LCH SA in Q3 2023. Excluding the impact on working capital from Euronext Clearing and Nord Pool CCP activities, net cash flow from operating activities accounted for 95.5% of EBITDA in Q3 2024.</p>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/euronext-announces-its-new-strategic-plan-innovate-for-growth-2027/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Euronext, the leading European capital market infrastructure, today released its new three-year strategic plan, &ldquo;Innovate for Growth 2027&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Innovate for Growth 2027&rdquo; sets out the Group&rsquo;s ambition to leverage Euronext&rsquo;s presence on the entire capital markets value chain in Europe to accelerate growth through innovation and efficiency. Euronext announces an updated capital allocation policy with a focus on shareholders&rsquo; returns and strategic flexibility. In line with this new capital allocation policy, Euronext will launch a &euro;300 million maximum share repurchase programme on 11 November 2024.</p>
<p>St&eacute;phane Boujnah, CEO and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext, said:</p>
<p>&rdquo;Euronext today is fundamentally different from Euronext in 2020. And, for the past four years, Euronext has profoundly transformed capital markets in Europe. We have achieved our &ldquo;Growth for Impact 2024&rdquo; targets a full quarter in advance, thanks to strong integration capabilities, solid organic growth and continuous cost discipline. Euronext now covers the entire capital markets value chain in Europe, with a global outreach. We are fully equipped to take advantage of tailwinds and capture opportunities on both volume and non-volume businesses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Innovate for Growth 2027&rdquo; frames Euronext&rsquo;s potential for the acceleration of our growth.</p>
<p>Our strategy relies on three priorities: (i) accelerate growth in non-volume business, (ii) expand the FICC1 trading and clearing franchise and (iii) build upon our leadership in trading. Our strategy will provide a stronger value proposition for investors, issuers and market participants globally.</p>
<p>ESG will continue to be embedded in all our businesses, and we will scale up our ESG ambition, with a Net Zero commitment to be set by 2027.</p>
<p>We have consolidated and offered best-in-class technology across European capital markets. Now, we will enhance our operational excellence and innovation capabilities through AI.</p>
<p>This plan is an inflection point for Euronext towards faster organic growth. Our financial guidance reflects our ambition to accelerate our growth and invest to seize future opportunities. Euronext&rsquo;s organic revenue growth is expected to be above 5% on average per year between 2023 and 2027. Adjusted EBITDA growth is expected to be above 5% on average per year between 2023 and 2027. We will keep a strong focus on costs and will continue to invest for future growth.</p>
<p>The Group will continue to execute external growth opportunities, in line with its investment criteria of ROCE above WACC in years 3 to 5. We are announcing today an updated capital allocation policy with attractive returns for shareholders and strategic flexibility.</p>
<p>By 2027, Euronext will be larger, stronger and more diversified. Our leadership will be extended to new activities and asset classes in Europe. The Group will be positioned as the unique and most efficient gateway to European capital markets for listing, trading, clearing, settlement and custody. By 2027, Euronext will be the undisputed backbone of the European Savings and Investments Union.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>2027 financial targets:</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&ndash; Revenue and income is expected to grow above 5% CAGR2023-2027E;</p>
<p>&ndash; Adjusted EBITDA is expected to grow above 5% CAGR2023-2027E;</p>
<p>&ndash; CAPEX is expected to be between 4% to 6% of total revenue over the period.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Updated capital allocation principles:</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&ndash; Euronext will invest to enhance growth and strengthen its market position, and to sustain a strong cash flow generation profile;</p>
<p>&ndash; Euronext will maintain a strong balance sheet and targets a medium-term leverage ratio of 1.0x-2.0x net debt to adjusted EBITDA, with flexibility to pursue value-accretive M&amp;A. Euronext will preserve an investment grade rating by S&amp;P of at least BBB;</p>
<p>&ndash; Euronext will maintain a dividend pay-out at 50% of reported net income;</p>
<p>&ndash; Euronext will continue to pursue value-accretive M&amp;A with ROIC&gt;WACC in years 3 to 5, to reinforce and diversify its profile;</p>
<p>&ndash; Euronext will introduce a flexible approach to special returns, including share buybacks. Special returns will be periodically assessed considering Euronext&rsquo;s leverage, market developments and strategic opportunities;</p>
<p>&ndash; In line with its updated capital allocation policy, Euronext today announces the launch of a share buyback programme of a maximum of &euro;300 million (representing around 3.0% of Euronext&rsquo;s outstanding shares), starting on 11 November 2024 for a maximum duration of 12 months. This programme is enabled by Euronext&rsquo;s strong cash generation capabilities and demonstrates Euronext&rsquo;s rigorous capital allocation strategy. This programme is not expected to change Euronext&rsquo;s credit rating.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Innovate for Growth 2027&rdquo; strategic priorities:</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&ndash; Accelerate growth in non-volume business;</p>
<p>&ndash; Expand the fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) trading and clearing franchise;</p>
<p>&ndash; Build upon our leadership in trading.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Transversal enablers of Euronext&rsquo;s superior growth:</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&ndash; Empower sustainable finance through ambitious ESG commitments;</p>
<p>&ndash; Enhance operational excellence, enabled by artificial intelligence and the scalability of Euronext&rsquo;s model;</p>
<p>&ndash; Deliver value-creative M&amp;A through external growth opportunities, in line with Euronext&rsquo;s disciplined investment criteria.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>New reporting framework</span></li>
</ul>
<p>In order to align with the evolved business structure and to facilitate the analysis of performance, Euronext will introduce a new, simplified revenue presentation. From Q1 2025, consolidated revenue will be broken down into the following categories, to distinguish non-volume and volume-related revenue:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Non-volume related revenue and income</span></li>
</ul>
<p>- Capital markets and data solutions;</p>
<p>- Securities services;</p>
<p>- Net treasury income;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Volume-related revenue</span></li>
</ul>
<p>- Equity markets;</p>
<p>- Fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) markets.</p>
<p>Agenda</p>
<p>The Euronext Investor Day will be held on Friday 8 November 2024, in Paris.</p>

<title>Finansinspektionen Proposes Enhanced Preventive Work In Efforts To Prevent Investment Fraud</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>An increasing number of consumers are falling victim to investment fraud. In a report to the Government, FI proposes, among other things, enhanced work to prevent investment fraud.</span></p>
<div class="editor-content">
<p>FI regularly publishes information for consumers about how they can protect themselves from investment fraud. The report proposes several targeted educational initiatives.</p>
<p>"FI plays a key preventive role when it comes to investment fraud. We need to continue to improve our work with spreading knowledge about investment fraud and warning about dishonest actors," says Mikael Sandahl, a supervisor at FI and an expert on investment fraud.</p>
<p>The report also proposes how FI's warning list could be improved. The warning list contains names of dishonest businesses and websites and is available to both consumers and firms. FI proposes an evaluation of the warning list to determine if it is possible to extend reach of the list and make it more usable and up to date.</p>
<h2>Banks and payment service providers need to strengthen their work</h2>
<p>FI emphasises in the report the importance of banks and payment service providers also continuing their preventive work, for example by informing customers about how investment fraud is perpetrated. These firms also need to continue to strengthen consumer protection, for example by performing controls when the customer conducts transactions that deviate from normal patterns.</p>
<p>The report is limited in that it proposes measures that FI and firms under FI's supervision can take.</p>
<p>"At the same time, we want to highlight that investment fraud contains many different steps. There are other types of firms that provide services that enable investment fraud, for example when fraudsters advertise in digital channels or create websites," says Mikael Sandahl.</p>
<h2>Fraudsters are persistent in their contact</h2>
<p>During Q3 2024, FI issued warnings for 2,146 new businesses and websites. FI also receives questions daily from people exposed to investment fraud or attempts at investment fraud.</p>
<p>"Many are aware that there are fraudsters out there &ndash; and yet it still can be difficult to recognize a fraud attempt. Fraudsters can present themselves as very trustworthy. For example, there are websites where those who choose to invest can follow how their investment is growing. But, naturally, it is all fake," says Mikael Sandahl.</p>
<p>FI continues to see a trend that fraudsters are persistent in their contact. First, the fraudsters successfully trick you into transferring money for a made-up investment. They then contact you again to "help" get your money back. Often, they first want you to pay a fee, which they might say is a tax, a bank fee, a legal fee, or a commission.</p>
<p>Sometimes they say they are collaborating with a government authority. However, it is important to remember that no government authority will ever contact a consumer and offer to help them recoup money lost from an investment fraud. It is best to just hang up the phone and not answer emails that offer such so-called help.</p>
<p>Mikael Sandahl also says that your contact details can easily end up in the hands of other fraudsters.</p>
<p>"If you have ever fallen victim to a fraud, you need to be particularly vigilant about anyone who contacts you with new offers or pretends to want to help you recoup previous losses," he says.</p>
<h2>Tips for how to avoid being tricked</h2>
<p>Investment fraud occurs frequently and affects many consumers. We therefore prepare on a regular basis information about fraud and what a fraud attempt looks like. Below are some tips about how to avoid becoming a victim of an investment fraud.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Good morning, I&rsquo;m very pleased to be here today to open the 2024 National Compliance Outreach Seminar, and have the opportunity to talk about the importance of compliance with so many dedicated financial services compliance professionals, experts, and colleagues from across the Commission.&nbsp; Each of you are committed to the long-term success of strengthening compliance and protecting investors. Thank you for joining us in today&rsquo;s discussions designed to improve compliance by strengthening the lines of communication between the SEC and compliance professionals.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/cassidy-speech-2024-national-compliance-outreach-seminar-110724?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>I also want to both acknowledge and thank Mavis Kelly and her team within the Division&rsquo;s National Exam Program Office (NEPO). Without their work, today&rsquo;s National Compliance Outreach Seminar would not be possible. And to thank Susan Weis and Kevin Stemp of my office, for their assistance in preparing today&rsquo;s remarks.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve faced several years marked by a great deal of tumult and change where our markets and investors have faced a pandemic, geopolitical instability, inflation and widespread cyber threats, as well as the opportunities and challenges presented by a more diffuse work force &ndash; making discussions such as the one today all the more important.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My comments today will discuss how we in the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Examinations (EXAMS) are furthering the Division&rsquo;s mission to strengthen compliance and investor protection, as well as &nbsp;improving our communication with registrants to help promote a sound culture of compliance at your firms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before I begin my remarks, however, I need to share a disclaimer that this speech is provided in my official capacity as the Commission&rsquo;s Acting Director of the Division of Examinations, but does not necessarily reflect the views of the Commission, the Commissioners, or other members of the staff.</p>
<h2>The Challenge of Change</h2>
<p>The Division of Examinations supports the SEC&rsquo;s tripartite mission to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation. We oftentimes speak of the Division&rsquo;s mission through the lens of what we refer to as our Four Pillars, which emphasizes our work to (1) promote compliance; (2) prevent fraud; (3) monitor risk; and (4) inform policy.</p>
<p>EXAMS has a unique mission and role at the Commission. We&rsquo;re responsible for conducting examinations of financial entities that are required by law to register with the Commission.&nbsp; These registrants include a truly diverse set of financial market participants, including investment advisers, investment companies, broker-dealers, exchanges, FINRA, the MSRB, transfer agents and clearing agencies, among others&mdash;we cover a very broad waterfront.</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s market environment, not only are we conducting examinations in traditional areas, but we&rsquo;re also examining for compliance with newly effective rules, looking ahead to changes in technology, dealing with some of the same cyber issues that each of you face every day, and considering the implication of recent advances in crypto assets and artificial intelligence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In March, we&rsquo;ll mark our Division&rsquo;s 30th anniversary, and as we approach this milestone, it&rsquo;s helpful to spend a moment reflecting on how far we&rsquo;ve come. There have been immense changes since we were formed in 1995&mdash;then known as the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations (OCIE).</p>
<p>Just in the past several years, we&rsquo;ve seen a tremendous change in how both clients and professionals interact&mdash;the pandemic accelerated a shift from offices towards a more mobile, distributed business model. Clients meet virtually with their investment professionals from the convenience of their own homes and make investments in our capital markets from a computer, tablet, or smartphone. Consumers now have access to smart portfolios with dynamic rebalancing and fully automated algorithmic trading. And while these innovations are both transforming and democratizing finance&mdash;making it more affordable and accessible than ever before&mdash;they also pose challenges as we all strive to ensure robust compliance and investor protection.</p>
<p>When compared to the industry we examine, we are a fraction of a vast landscape and must leverage all tools at our disposal&mdash;including technology and communications to increase efficiency and effectiveness and ensure that industry professionals&mdash;such as all of you here today&mdash;are empowered to help provide the protection that investors rely and depend upon.</p>
<h2>A Shared Interest in Protecting Investors</h2>
<p>My message to you today is that opportunities like we have at this seminar and at similar outreach events across the country throughout the year, &nbsp;where we can discuss compliance issues in a practical way, are both important and mutually beneficial. Together we can share our experiences and promote effective compliance practices, so that you&mdash;like us&mdash;remain effective in your mission. &nbsp;Our examinations, coupled with your effective compliance programs, are essential elements of our collective shared interest in investor protection and preserving market integrity.</p>
<p>I think it is worth taking a moment to emphasize how essential all of your compliance efforts are to protecting investors. &nbsp;We cannot be everywhere all at once. Strong investor protection requires empowered compliance professionals and strong cultures of compliance within firms.</p>
<p>Promoting compliance is in our DNA. Not only is it one of the four pillars of our Division it is an important focus of our work. We recognize that a vital component of our mission is promoting and supporting compliance functions at our regulated entities. Our examinations go hand-in-hand with your robust compliance programs. Given our size relative to the markets we examine, effective industry compliance is essential to protecting investors and our work to promote and strengthen these compliance efforts is critical.</p>
<h2>Communicating to Promote and Strengthen Compliance</h2>
<p>One of the ways we promote and strengthen compliance is through our communications. Starting last year, we shifted the publication of our annual examination priorities to earlier than ever before. By announcing our priorities earlier, we are more closely aligned with the fiscal year, which drives our work, transparency and messaging. Publishing our priorities earlier also allows us to reach CCOs and compliance professionals prior to calendar year end&mdash;which we know effects internal planning and budgeting discussions at many registrants. A lot of time and effort goes into the creation of our annual priorities document, which we published two weeks ago. &nbsp;I encourage you to read the Fiscal Year 25 Priorities thoroughly and to carefully consider them in relation to your planning and the tailoring of your compliance program to your business and risks.</p>
<p>There is another important communication channel that I also want to highlight. The Division is active in publishing risk alerts. Since 2011, we have periodically issued risk alerts (many of you will already be familiar with these)&mdash;now totaling over 70 separate publications, covering a wide array of topics across our program areas.&nbsp; Our risk alerts raise awareness of compliance and industry risks and are meant to encourage firms to think about their own policies and procedures in particular areas.</p>
<p>By communicating about risks we observe during examinations in a synthesized and anonymized form, our risk alerts allow us to share key observations outside the context of an examination, so that firms can proactively assess whether they need to strengthen their compliance programs.</p>
<p>We also actively seek opportunities for outreach to communicate and engage with investors, registrants and compliance professionals to raise awareness and promote compliance through participation in regional and national seminars, workshops, conferences and events like today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By communicating our annual priorities, periodic risk alerts, and at outreach events across the nation, we aim to create a roadmap for strengthening compliance and investor protection, and seek to empower compliance professionals to lead discussions about enhancing compliance within their firms. We are always pleased when we hear CCOs say they are able to point to our communications during their internal discussions about budgets and resource allocations, because we share an interest in ensuring investors benefit from robust compliance and protections.</p>
<p class="text-align-center">* * *</p>
<p>I want to recognize and thank all the CCOs and compliance professionals for joining us today and for your commitment and work to promote and strengthen compliance within your firms and across the industry. We share a common commitment to protecting our nation&rsquo;s savers and investors, and look forward to our continued work to advance this mission, together. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Monetary Policy Summary, November 2024</h2>
<p>The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. The MPC adopts a medium-term and forward-looking approach to determine the monetary stance required to achieve the inflation target sustainably.</p>
<p>At its meeting ending on 6 November 2024, the MPC voted by a majority of 8&ndash;1 to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 4.75%. One member preferred to maintain Bank Rate at 5%.</p>
<p>There has been continued progress in disinflation, particularly as previous external shocks have abated, although remaining domestic inflationary pressures are resolving more slowly.</p>
<p>CPI inflation fell to 1.7% in September but is expected to increase to around 2&frac12;% by the end of the year as weakness in energy prices falls out of the annual comparison. Services consumer price inflation has declined to 4.9%. Annual private sector regular average weekly earnings growth has continued to fall but remained elevated at 4.8% in the three months to August. Headline GDP growth is expected to fall back to its recent underlying pace of around &frac14;% per quarter over the second half of this year. The MPC judges that the labour market continues to loosen, although it appears relatively tight by historical standards.</p>
<p>Monetary policy has been guided by the need to squeeze remaining inflationary pressures out of the economy to achieve the 2% target both in a timely manner and on a lasting basis. The Committee&rsquo;s deliberations have been supported by the consideration of a range of cases that could impact the evolution of inflation persistence. These three cases are set out further in the accompanying November Monetary Policy Report.<a id="_Hlk181735075"></a></p>
<p>In the first case, most of the remaining persistence in inflation may dissipate quickly as pay and price-setting dynamics continue to normalise following the unwinding of the global shocks that drove up inflation. In the second case, a period of economic slack may be required to normalise these dynamics fully. In the third case, some inflationary persistence may also reflect structural shifts in wage and price-setting behaviour. Each case would have different implications for how quickly the restrictiveness of monetary policy could be withdrawn.</p>
<p>The MPC&rsquo;s latest projections for activity and inflation are also set out in the accompanying November Report. This forecast is based on the second case. CPI inflation is projected to fall back to around the 2% target in the medium term, conditioned on the usual 15 day average of forward interest rates, as a margin of slack emerges later in the forecast period that acts against second-round effects in domestic prices and wages.</p>
<p>The combined effects of the measures announced in Autumn Budget 2024 are provisionally expected to boost the level of GDP by around &frac34;% at their peak in a year&rsquo;s time, relative to the August projections. The Budget is provisionally expected to boost CPI inflation by just under &frac12; of a percentage point at the peak, reflecting both the indirect effects of the smaller margin of excess supply and direct impacts from the Budget measures.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk181606189"></a>There remains significant uncertainty around the outlook for the labour market. Data are difficult to interpret and wage growth has been more elevated than usual relationships would predict. The impact of the Budget announcements on inflation will depend on the degree to and speed with which these higher costs pass through into prices, profit margins, wages and employment.</p>
<p>At this meeting, the Committee voted to reduce Bank Rate to 4.75%, reflecting the continued progress in disinflation.</p>
<p>Based on the evolving evidence, a gradual approach to removing policy restraint remains appropriate. Monetary policy will need to continue to remain restrictive for sufficiently long until the risks to inflation returning sustainably to the 2% target in the medium term have dissipated further. The Committee continues to monitor closely the risks of inflation persistence and will decide the appropriate degree of monetary policy restrictiveness at each meeting.</p>
</section><section class="page-section">
<h2>Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 6 November 2024</h2>
<p>1: Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. The latest data on these topics were set out in the accompanying&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy-report/2024/november-2024">November 2024 Monetary Policy Report</a>.</p>
<p>2: The Committee discussed the near-term global risks and their potential impact on the inflation outlook in the United Kingdom. The balance of risks to global activity, particularly stemming from China and Germany, remained to the downside in the near term. Alongside that, there were upside risks to goods and commodity prices from greater trade fragmentation and adverse geopolitical developments, including from events in the Middle East.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk181786176"></a><a id="_Hlk181772818"></a>3: Since the MPC&rsquo;s previous meeting, the market-implied path for Bank Rate in the United Kingdom had shifted up materially. For the period prior to Autumn Budget 2024, market intelligence had attributed the modest upward moves in the market-implied path largely to international factors such as stronger-than-expected economic data in the United States. For the period around the time of the Budget, the upward shift had been more material. However, market pricing had continued to remain consistent with a 25 basis point reduction in Bank Rate at this MPC meeting.</p>
<p>4: Bank staff continued to judge that the economy was growing at around &frac14;% per quarter on an underlying basis. According to the official data, GDP had grown by 0.5% in 2024 Q2, 0.2 percentage points weaker than had been expected in the August Report, and 0.1 percentage points weaker than the earlier outturn had indicated at the time of the MPC&rsquo;s previous meeting. Through the second half of 2024, GDP was projected to grow at a somewhat slower rate than in Q2.</p>
<p>5: The Committee discussed the implications of the latest activity data for the evolution of slack in the economy. There was limited evidence that aggregate demand was falling short of aggregate supply. Surveys of capacity utilisation had remained close to their historical averages, and indicators of labour market tightness, while easing of late, continued to appear relatively tight by historical standards. These developments reinforced the view that the drag on activity from the lagged transmission of past monetary tightening was unlikely to intensify over the coming year.</p>
<p>6: There had been material news to the economic outlook in Autumn Budget 2024. Taken together, the fiscal policy announcements were provisionally expected to boost the level of GDP by around &frac34;% at their peak in a year&rsquo;s time, relative to the August projections. The Committee also discussed the increase in the overall cost of employment that was likely to follow from the changes to employers&rsquo; National Insurance contributions (NICs) and the increase in the National Living Wage (NLW), and the degree to and speed with which that increase might be transmitted into prices, profit margins, wages and employment.</p>
<p>7: Twelve-month CPI inflation had fallen to 1.7% in September. The decline in CPI inflation since the start of this year had primarily reflected lower goods price inflation, with disinflation in underlying services prices having been less pronounced. Services price inflation had, however, decreased quite sharply to 4.9% in September. Most of this downside news had been concentrated in more volatile categories, and some of this was expected to unwind. Services price inflation was expected to remain broadly unchanged over the next six months. Annual growth in private-sector regular average weekly earnings had fallen back significantly since mid-2023, but it had remained relatively strong at 4.8% in the three months to August.</p>
<h3>The immediate policy decision</h3>
<p>8: The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. The MPC adopts a medium-term and forward-looking approach to determine the monetary stance required to achieve the inflation target sustainably.</p>
<p>9: Since the MPC&rsquo;s previous meeting, there had been continued disinflation. Twelve-month CPI inflation had fallen to 1.7% in September. The decline in CPI inflation since the start of the year had primarily reflected lower goods price inflation, with disinflation in underlying services prices less pronounced.</p>
<p>10: Annual growth in private sector regular average weekly earnings had fallen back significantly since mid-2023 but had remained relatively strong at 4.8% in the three months to August. Year-ahead expectations for wage growth in the DMP Survey had been flat at around 4% since May, while initial Agents&rsquo; intelligence had reported an expected range of pay awards between 2% and 4% next year.</p>
<p>11: GDP had grown by 0.5% in 2024 Q2, slightly weaker than had been expected in the August Report. GDP growth was expected to fall back to its recent underlying pace of around &frac14;% per quarter over the second half of the year.</p>
<p>12: The combined effects of the measures announced in Autumn Budget 2024 were provisionally expected to boost the level of GDP by around &frac34;% at their peak in a year&rsquo;s time, relative to the August projections. The Budget was provisionally expected to boost CPI inflation by just under &frac12; of a percentage point at its peak, reflecting both the indirect effects of the smaller margin of excess supply and direct impacts from the Budget measures.</p>
<p>13: Based on the collective steer from a wide range of indicators, the MPC judged that the labour market continued to ease but that it appeared relatively tight by historical standards.&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk181710177"></a>However, there was significant uncertainty around the labour market outlook and its impact on inflationary persistence. The combined effect of some policies announced in the Budget, particularly the increase in employer NICs and the NLW, was likely to increase the overall costs of employment. The net effect of this news on aggregate inflation would depend on the degree to and speed with which those costs would be transmitted into prices, wages, employment, or otherwise absorbed in profit margins or productivity growth. On the one hand, higher labour costs could constrain firms&rsquo; cash-flows if there was limited pass-through to pricing. This in turn could moderate wage growth and further loosen the labour market through reduced labour demand. On the other hand, the increase in labour costs could prove more inflationary if upward pressure on prices were passed on to consumers.</p>
<p>14: The Committee continued to monitor the accumulation of evidence from a broad range of indicators of inflation persistence, including evidence that could point to the three cases set out in the November Monetary Policy Report having begun to materialise.&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk181735038"></a>In the first case, most of the remaining persistence in inflation might dissipate quickly as pay and price-setting dynamics continued to normalise following the unwinding of the global shocks that drove up inflation. In the second case, a period of economic slack might be required to normalise these dynamics fully. In the third case, some inflationary persistence might reflect structural shifts in wage and price-setting behaviour.</p>
<p>15: In the November forecast,&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk181734874"></a>which was based on the second case, second-round effects in domestic prices and wages were expected to take somewhat longer to unwind than they did to emerge. The margin of slack that emerged later in the forecast period would act against those second-round effects, leading CPI inflation to fall back to around the 2% target in the medium term.</p>
<p>16: If, for example, the economy were to grow broadly as expected, but material downside news to wages and services inflation were nonetheless to emerge, this could increase the weight that the MPC would place on the first case materialising. Signs of a slowing in the disinflation process, particularly in the absence of a pickup in activity growth, could instead increase the likelihood that the MPC would place on the third case materialising.</p>
<p>17: At this meeting, eight members preferred to reduce Bank Rate to 4.75%. There had been continued progress in disinflation, particularly as previous external shocks had abated, although remaining domestic inflationary pressures were resolving more slowly. These members put different probabilities on and risks around the three cases, but they believed that a cut in Bank Rate was appropriate at this meeting. They would continue to assess the range of evidence over time.</p>
<p>18: One member preferred to maintain Bank Rate at 5%. For this member, structural factors in wage and price-setting dynamics continued to draw out the underlying disinflation process, and CPI inflation was projected to remain above the 2% target until the end of the forecast period. Wage developments might continue to be more robust than projected as firms and workers incorporated past and upcoming adjustments in the National Living Wage and National Insurance contributions. This, along with prospects for more robust demand associated with the Budget, was likely to support pricing opportunities for firms. In the face of these uncertainties, maintaining the current level of Bank Rate would allow time to evaluate whether these upside pressures would materialise.</p>
<p>19: Based on the evolving evidence, a gradual approach to removing policy restraint remained appropriate. Monetary policy would need to continue to remain restrictive for sufficiently long until the risks to inflation returning sustainably to the 2% target in the medium term had dissipated further. The Committee would continue to monitor closely the risks of inflation persistence and would decide the appropriate degree of monetary policy restrictiveness at each meeting.</p>
<p>20: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bank Rate should be reduced by 0.25 percentage points, to 4.75%.</li>
</ul>
<p>21: Eight members (Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Swati Dhingra, Megan Greene, Clare Lombardelli, Huw Pill, Dave Ramsden and Alan Taylor) voted in favour of the proposition. Catherine L Mann voted against the proposition, preferring to maintain Bank Rate at 5%.</p>
<h3>Operational considerations</h3>

<div class="container">
<p>Between February 2017 and June 2019, Raymondip Bedi and Patrick Mavanga, defrauded at least 65 investors out of &pound;1,541,799. The group cold-called consumers, directing them to a professional-looking website where they were offered high returns for fake investments in crypto.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Raymondip Bedi pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud, conspiracy to breach the general prohibition under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and money laundering offences at an earlier hearing.</p>
<p>Patrick Mavanga pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud, conspiracy to breach the general prohibition under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and possession of false identification documents with an improper intention at an earlier hearing.</p>

<p><span><a href="http://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/http:%2F%2Fcapital.com/1/0102019305c1d7df-ded24385-7a59-4a05-a937-9c08ed0b0890-000000/piew5ExQolem8woXu0OUSl34Iqc=399"><span><span>Capital.com</span></span></a></span><span>, the high-growth global trading platform and fintech group whose trading volumes surpassed USD$1trn in 2023, today announced total client trading volumes reached over $450 billion in Q3 2024, a 20% increase from Q2 2024, affirming the company&rsquo;s steady growth trajectory. Over the same period, new user accounts were up by 9%, and the total number of trades executed on the platform grew by 19% to 31 million from the previous quarter.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>"Our Q3 results highlight the sustained growth of our platform as we continue to deliver the best trading experience for our clients globally. Supported by our strong track record and growth metrics, we have ambitions to further diversify our product offering and develop pioneering technologies that enhance efficiency across our award-winning platform,&rdquo; said <strong><span>Dana Massey, Chief Marketing, Product &amp; Technology Officer, Capital.com</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>Increased trading in Q3 was driven by strong interest in indices, commodities, and FX markets. Index trading was particularly robust, accounting for approximately 53% of all trading volumes, supported by significant activity from clients across the Middle East, followed closely by Europe. Commenting on clients&rsquo; trading behaviour in Q3, <strong><span>Daniela Sabin Hathorn, Senior Market Analyst, Capital.com</span></strong>, said:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;With anticipation for the US presidential elections building in Q3 we've seen increased interest in indices and FX pairs, specifically those that included the dollar. The capital injection on behalf of China to revive its struggling economy was also a key driver of the momentum in equities throughout the month of September as traders pushed aside concerns about growth in China. Other key events include the market meltdown and then, following the subsequent recovery in stocks, the worse-than-anticipated jobs data during the summer months, which triggered the Sahm rule and brought on concerns about the Federal Reserve being too restrictive for too long. As economic data has improved, so has sentiment in equity markets, with the key global indices starting Q4 close to record highs.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Building on the platform&rsquo;s strong client engagement and trading activity in the last quarter, Capital.com is ramping up its investment in technology, with plans to double its technology &amp; engineering in the next 12 months. To support its clients with a diverse range of products and solutions, the company is hiring 200 new professionals across its global network of offices.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;As a tech-first company, expanding our engineering team is crucial to scaling our services and meeting the demands of our growing global client base,&rdquo; added <strong><span>Massey</span></strong>. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking to bring on top talent from around the world across engineering, technology support, and development to ensure Capital.com remains at the forefront of fintech innovation.&rdquo;</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Capital.com&rsquo;s hiring drive is focused on key areas including Java and Angular Software Engineering, DevOps, QA Engineering, Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), Incident Management, Tech Support, IT Services, Data Engineering, Database Administration, and Engineering Management. These roles offer both in-office and remote opportunities across London, Warsaw, Limassol and the company's other key tech hubs globally, providing an agile and collaborative environment for innovation.</span></p>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ipc-and-leapxpert-partner-for-federated-messaging-governance-and-compliance/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>IPC, the leading provider of secure, compliant communications and multi-cloud connectivity solutions for financial markets, has partnered with LeapXpert, the responsible business communication pioneer, to provide enhanced messaging communications capture, governance and compliance capabilities to regulated financial businesses.</p>
<p>In an increasingly digital workplace with growing use of messaging channels alongside traditional telephony communication, LeapXpert solutions address the key financial industry challenge of managing effective surveillance and associated regulatory compliance obligations such as data recordkeeping. Specifically, LeapXpert focuses on creating a federated messaging environment for frictionless, cross-platform messaging between multiple users and apps. A centralized, highly interoperable communication platform, accessed through a Single Professional Identity (one contact number) streamlines messaging functionality, providing an enhanced communication experience, robust communications governance and compliance with recordkeeping requirements from the SEC, CFTC, ESMA, FCA and other regulators.</p>
<p>IPC has been at the forefront of technology innovation in trading communications systems for more than 50 years. Its market-leading communications technologies, product innovation and strategic partnerships with specialist service providers like LeapXpert reflects a focus and commitment to improving the trading experience for all stakeholders. LeapXpert solutions can be integrated within IPC&rsquo;s Unigy, Trader Voice, Unified Comms &amp; Mobile capture solutions, creating a unique and highly differentiated industry solution.</p>
<p>James Tonks, SVP Partner Development, IPC commented: &ldquo;This collaboration represents the future of compliant communication. The use of messaging channels is accelerating. Telephone networks are already federated; federated messaging is the next major leap in the digital enterprise communication revolution. We are excited to be able to harness the proven technology of an experienced service provider to offer a robust, frictionless and enterprise-grade messaging solution with associated governance best practice and regulatory compliance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Avi Pardo, Co-founder &amp; CBO of LeapXpert, said: &ldquo;In the fast-paced world of financial markets, seamless communication is essential. Our partnership with IPC ensures that financial institutions can effortlessly navigate the complexities of off-channel communication, staying compliant while optimizing their operations. We are excited to bring our expertise in communications to IPC's extensive client base, providing a comprehensive Digital Communications Governance &amp; Archiving (DCGA) solution.&rdquo; The LeapXpert Communications Platform supports different chat features, such as one-on-one and group chats across various messaging channels, including WhatsApp, iMessage, WeChat, SMS, Telegram, Signal, and LINE. Clients stay on their preferred (or authorized) channels, while traders and employees use one platform and number across multiple channels making them much more readily accessible to clients.</p>
<p>API integration and client/employee identification and validation functionality ensures that both parties know they are speaking to a particular individual rather than a member of a team. Advanced governance with sophisticated data leakage prevention, information barriers, anti-virus and malware services means firms can more easily monitor client conversations, safeguard sensitive information and protect assets from loss and security threats and prevent data leaks.</p>

<title>"MAS' Fintech Vision" - Edited Transcript Of Fireside Chat By Mr Chia Der Jiun, Managing Director, Monetary Authority Of Singapore, With Ms Manisha Tank, Broadcaster &amp; TV Presenter, At Singapore Fintech Festival 2024, On 7 November 2024</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/mas-fintech-vision-edited-transcript-of-fireside-chat-by-mr-chia-der-jiun/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Manisha Tank:</span><span>&nbsp;Here we go. This is your first FinTech Festival as MD. How's that feeling?</span><br /><br /><span>Chia Der Jiun:&nbsp;</span><span>Very exciting. It's great to be part of this group. It's really good to be invigorated by the energy of the space, the energy of the people, the energy of the community here. They're all creators, innovators, founders, people doing new things, exciting things, so it's really good to be part of this.</span><br /><br /><span>Manisha Tank:</span><span>&nbsp;The new prime minister &ndash; well, not so new anymore &ndash; had come to the FinTech Festival some years ago, and had described it as feeling like a rock concert. It rather does, so thank you to Vanessa, who's our resident DJ. It does feel really pumped and energised.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>Thinking of pumped and energised, there were lots of people who were flicking through phones, I noticed, in the audience yesterday, and one of the reasons was, of course, they were following results coming from the US presidential election. Obviously, I'd like to get some of your reflections as we wake up this morning to President Trump in the US for the next four years.</span><br /><br /><span>Chia Der Jiun:</span><span>&nbsp;It was quite spectacular. The results were quite unambiguous, and I saw that the shift towards Trump was quite unambiguous across all the states practically, and across most demographic groups. It's quite a clear result. It does reflect that certain issues are very important to the American voters. Certainly, I think the economy is top of mind &ndash; cost of living, state of the economy, immigration &ndash; these are very important issues to the American economy.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>I think what matters to all of us now is the direction of policies going from here. This has been well discussed. I think the markets have already pretty much summed it up, what's been happening. We know that equity markets have been up at record highs or near record highs, and this reflects optimism around tax cuts, making them permanent, optimism around deregulation. We also see that the dollar is high, and the yield curve has steepened a little bit, so expectation about inflation remaining sticky because policy is having an inflationary bend. The dollar is high, the yield curve is steepened, and Bitcoin is up. We know why that is so, it is part of a deregulatory sentiment. All this is hugely important, whether, and how big an impact some of these policies will have on growth and inflation. For the global economy, potentially, some of these policies can be restrictive on growth, particularly trade policies, and inflationary, but there are other policies that are pro-growth and potentially pro-supply side. So, tax cuts, if they invigorate more investment, if technology also invigorates more investment, these can be potentially helpful to productivity. We'll have to see.</span><br /><br /><span>The sequencing of the policies matter. Some policies will have very near term and quick impact, while other policies like deregulation and tax cuts may take time for investments to potentially help with the supply side. We are watching very closely, because this matters greatly not just for us, but everyone else.</span><br /><br /><span>Manisha Tank:</span><span>&nbsp;It definitely seems very clear cut, the House and the Senate as well, also going the Republican direction, so there is that consistency.</span><br /><br /><span>Queen Maxima has just joined us here in front row. Thank you so much. If we could just give her a rousing welcome.</span><br /><br /><span>Chia Der Jiun:&nbsp;</span><span>And Ravi (Menon) as well, who was occupying this seat just last year.</span><br /><br /><span>Manisha Tank:</span><span>&nbsp;We were having certain conversations backstage, and that is a lot of what all of this is about. It's about partnerships, collaborations and important conversations. Speaking of which, let's get back to it.</span><br /><br /><span>One of the things I want to talk to you about is MAS&rsquo; overall vision for the FinTech sector and the impact that all of the great change is going to have on the delivery of financial services.</span><br /><br /><span>Let's first of all get your thoughts on the overall vision.</span><br /><br /><span>Chia Der Jiun:</span><span>&nbsp;Maybe I will just speak around three words &ndash; firstly, community; secondly, collaboration; and third, on our capabilities.</span><br /><br /><span>On community, I think this week&rsquo;s Festival speaks for itself &ndash; 900 speakers, tens of thousands of participants. There is a very thriving community of FinTech startups and firms in Singapore and now all around the region coming together for this event, so this is one clear manifestation of this network and this community.</span><br /><br /><span>Ravi announced the launch of the GFTN yesterday, and that signals a new level of ambition to widen, broaden, deepen this network globally, and therefore to pull these networks together. So, I think that would be hugely beneficial for the ecosystem that we have here, and, of course, the community here at the FinTech Festival. I think that signals a new level of ambition and achievement for the community, so I think that is important.</span><br /><br /><span>Two is collaboration. Now, we started the journey with encouraging experimentation and innovation through setting up sandboxes, and that was hugely beneficial. But really, you get to benefit with innovation, one project at a time, right? So, the impact is a little bit, shall we say, bespoke. Now we are thinking about how to multiply that and have that benefit at scale. With now a different mode of collaboration, we are actively forming consortia with industry, with federal regulators, policy makers, coming together to solve problems. So that has been most evident in several areas. And certainly, we have had this in the sustainability area, we have had this in the digital assets area, which is currently where we are focusing a lot of our time. So, industry consortia, over 20 financial institutions, industry associations, standard setters and international organisations, policy makers, all coming together trying to solve problems for digital assets. We can talk more about that later. Also, for AI, it has been a collaborative approach through the industry to try to understand the risks better and start to identify the issues. So that has been our approach, and I think that has been helpful in scaling the impact.</span><br /><br /><span>Third, I will just say capabilities. There are a couple of areas where we think is going to be hugely impactful, and we have focused our attention on those. We are taking steps to put in place the building blocks to help the industry grow, and overcome some of these challenges and pain points. Payments is one area, and it has been a long-standing area over many years. We have been putting in place the building blocks to get this to work. The vision, of course, is low cost, accessible, fast domestic payments, but also cross-border payments. So that has been a multi-year mission and objective, and we are continuing to build on that. The space of asset tokens is also something we are investing heavily on, trying to make progress together with industry. AI as well, and we can talk about that later, and of course, sustainability.</span><br /><br /><span>Manisha Tank:</span><span>&nbsp;Well, let's dig deeper into some of those. And before we do, interestingly, you talked about the community and how important that was. If anyone sees Ravi Menon or anyone who is involved with GFTN, you will see them wearing a big round badge. And you educated me this morning that it's flags of the world, many of them, we joked about, possibly more than the World Bank. But I think that underpins how important community is, it&rsquo;s a global community, right?&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>Chia Der Jiun:</span><span>&nbsp;Yes, it&rsquo;s a badge of ambition on Ravi&rsquo;s chest, as well as Sopnendu&rsquo;s.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>Manisha Tank:</span><span>&nbsp;Okay, so let's dig a little bit deeper. I want to talk about global payments. So particularly digital currencies, cross-border. Just when you think payments are fast, they get faster. There's always another platform offering some form of added value, but I think it's important for us to understand how Singapore is going to remain competitive in a landscape that's so dynamic.</span><br /><br /><span>Chia Der Jiun:</span><span>&nbsp;So, you know, we've taken this quite a lot, right? It started with putting in place some of the things such as a national digital identity, layering on that fast payment rails, and then schemes that allow very easy look up and also acceptance of QR codes, PayNow link ups and so on. So, it works very well.</span><br /><br /><span>I&rsquo;ve got a slide to show you where we are with this. And so, this is domestic payments. It looks like penetration is fantastic. Sign-ups are above 90%, merchants&rsquo; adoption of QR codes is near 100% so it looks to be near ubiquitous? It is ubiquitous, but it's not seamless. And the problem that now we need to solve is interoperability. So, although a lot of people have onboarded these and can use a single QR code, but a merchant may not have onboarded multiple, different&nbsp; payment schemes, and so if I'm only on one payment scheme, then I can only accept customers of that one payment scheme. And what we want to do is make them interoperable. Because across schemes, we know that penetration is an asset. So, if you can make that interoperable, then you can walk in with one payment scheme or two payment schemes, and you can pay any merchant. So that's the vision, and we're trying to take steps towards that. And so, what is happening now is that NETS Group and Liquid Group will be launching an interoperable QR payment solution, they will operate and offer separate solutions. With this, merchants don't have to onboard very many different schemes for them to accept a wide base of customers. So that's the vision, to make it much more seamless. So that's on the domestic front.</span><br /><br /><span>Cross border has been a different challenge. We have started this journey doing cross border linkages, one at a time. The first one was with Thailand. You know, my esteemed colleague, Governor Sethaput will be speaking next, and Thailand was our very first bilateral linkage between the FAST payment systems between the two countries. And I think it took two years to get that done. And of course, now, we've got several bilateral linkages with Malaysia, India and so on, but it takes time to put this out, and resources. What we've embarked on, the ASEAN countries together with the BIS Innovation Hub, is to work on scaling this in a multilateral way. This is called Project Nexus, and we think it's a game changer, because it is a central switch, and it's a central framework of standards, single framework standards, so that you don't have to form bilateral linkages. Everyone just connects to the central switch and the single framework, and then you can access the whole network. So, I think that's a massive game changer. It will connect up our region quickly, and it can also be the node connecting to other networks in other regions. So this, I think, has the potential to transform cross border payments and make it much more accessible in a low cost, fast way.</span><br /><br /><span>So, that's the vision. I have a slide on this as well that shows where some of the bilateral linkages are currently. But with Nexus, you know, we can widen the network extensively and reach other regions as well. So that's on payments, and that's where we are.</span><br /><br /><span>It was just announced yesterday by the BIS, that the Nexus Scheme Organisation will be set up in Singapore. There is a lot of work to be done. We&rsquo;re happy to host the Nexus Scheme Organisation and hope to drive that network.</span><br /><br /><span>Manisha Tank:</span><span>&nbsp;Excellent. I suppose it helps that you already have that existing infrastructure, and that's a multilateral infrastructure to build on. Let's move on to a report that was produced by McKinsey. This is about the tokenised market. In this report, we learned that the total tokenised market capitalisation is expected to reach USD 2 trillion by 2030. The question is, what is MAS&rsquo; vision for tokenisation and what strategic developments can the market expect by that time?&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>Chia Der Jiun:</span><span>&nbsp;The potential is there [for asset tokenisation]. I think everyone sees the potential. And in Project Guardian, we work with a variety of global financial institutions, and also those in Singapore. They've experimented and piloted across different kinds of assets. They've tokenised them, they've settled them, exchanged them across fixed income, FX, funds and so on. They know that it works, and the economic benefits are also clear to all the participants. It's going to cut duplication, cut cost, increase speed, but cut time, The use cases are also very clear across multi currencies, payment settlement, treasury management, collateral management, and, of course, security settlement. The use cases are also quite clear.</span><br /><br /><span>The challenge is how to get to that potential. This is a collaborative approach for the industry, and there&rsquo;s an industry consortium, there&rsquo;s Project Gurdian and also Global Layer One. The idea is &ndash; tell us what are the problems that need to be solved in order to scale this, to get this to commercial scale. We have been taking these real pain points, real issues that industry tells us that needs to be solved, and that is where we focused our attention &ndash; on how to solve them.</span><br /><br /><span>I&rsquo;ve got a slide to illustrate this. We have to think about problem at three layers. First is at the token layer, where you can represent any asset. You can represent fixed income, you can represent FX, you can represent the fund, you can represent a security, any asset, as a token. But in order to have this exchange, what I call fixed income token, what is the data and attributes it should embody? It should be recognisable to you when exchange it with you, so that we both agree that this is a fixed income token, and we agree that it has attributes that I wish to sell to you and that you wish to buy. That requires work, and industry frameworks and standards are needed, so that we achieve this degree of harmonisation and understanding of regulations for exchange. We have done some of that work already, and the first publications have come up &ndash; frameworks for fixed income, framework for funds. But more work remains ahead, and that is critical work.</span><br /><br /><span>The second layer is at the settlement layer. When we exchange tokens, we won't exchange a fixed income token for a fund token directly. We will have to intermediate this to a form of digital money that is on chain, so a high-quality settlement asset. I think people will talk about, you know, this could be central bank digital currency, could be tokenised bank deposits backed by the balance sheet of a bank, or it could be a stablecoin. That is the next area that we have to work on, to ensure that we do put in high quality settlement assets into this ecosystem.</span><br /><br /><span>We are making a contribution by having set up a stable coin regulatory framework describing the attributes of what a well-regulated, sound stablecoin looks like, and should have these attributes. We are inviting people to make use of this and issue stablecoins that comply with this regulation. There is a lot of interest in this. The regulatory attributes are finalised, and we are now working on legislation.&nbsp; It is not quite ready, but we are having conversations with those issuers.</span><br /><br /><span>Last, is at the infrastructure layer, the chain layer. Here, is a little bit of an unregulated space, and what the industry participants tell us is they need more out of this. Firstly, it needs to be interoperable, so the network set up around chains, and the public chains available today and that many may use, they need to be interoperable across networks, and potentially across different chains as well, so that the tokens and the liquidity around the tokens are not fragmented, it can be connected. Second, this infrastructure has to be compatible with compliance, enabling these tokens and the participants around them to comply with laws and regulations. That is hugely critical to make this programmable and compliance by design. That is where Global Layer One &ndash; another industry consortium that has been set up, with a core group of global banks, also market infrastructure providers coming in, working on these problems, and trying to solve them. These are the things that we are working on. We are very excited about the promise in asset tokenisation and these are steps that we are actively taking.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>Manisha Tank:</span><span>&nbsp;It's interesting actually, that was a bit of a theme yesterday as well. You talked about harmonisation. Sometimes, on this stage, we can have very abstract conversations, and part of your mission is to make sure that we bring all of those abstract conversations into a real-world practicality, and we can understand the challenges around that.</span><br /><br /><span>Speaking of which, let's talk about Generative AI. This is a huge talking point, and this is a technology that can significantly impact businesses and therefore the world. So, the obvious question really, is around how MAS is going to be able to navigate that and also, what are your thoughts actually? How are you managing this? You can't really, but what are your thoughts on the expectations of financial institutions when it comes to how they're expected to use GenAI?</span><br /><br /><span>Chia Der Jiun:</span><span>&nbsp;We're walking in step with each other. I think the issue is you don't want them to get too far ahead of the regulator, but you don't want the regulator to get too far ahead of the industry either. The sense of coming in too early with regulation that is not quite mature and not quite fully considered. So MAS has been taking these cautious steps. And again, it's been a collaborative approach that we're taking.</span><br /><br /><span>The first thing that we did with GenAI or AI is not to come in with regulations, but to set up industry consortium again. The focus and the purpose is to build up capabilities, both in the industry and in the regulator, that's really important. The AI journey, of course, is not new, it's probably at least 10 years in the making. What is new is GenAI, but the financial industry is very familiar with AI, traditional machine learning-based ones, and we have developed new processes and governance around how to manage AI. So, the trick now, is with GenAI. What is the delta? What is new? What needs to be done about it? The first step was to set up a consortium &ndash; we called it Project MindForge. We get industry together, sit down with us, and then we work through, what are the risks here? We go through the whole life cycle of this, from data collection, data processing, governance, down to development, deployment, monitoring, performance, and so on. What are the risks around the whole life cycle of that? Can we come together and agree on the common taxonomy and inventory of these risks so that we have a common language to engage each other on? So, that was the very first step, and that resulted in a publication, so we've done that. We did identify some of the additional risks in GenAI. We all know about the greater difficulty in terms of explainability and verification for GenAI. We know the issues around the hallucination accuracy, we know some of the risks around prompt injection attacks, for instance, data leakage and so on. So, it's additional risks that have to be taken into account. Then, the next stage, we're working now with the consortium is &ndash; knowing the risks, what does it mean for governance? That's what we need to do now, and the next stage is to publish some good practices in the area of governance, around the use of GenAI.</span><br /><br /><span>On the regulatory front, we started a step later, but now the process is in train, and we're working towards a set of guidance on model risk management, covering both the data as well as the model development, and subsequently the model deployment and monitoring work that has to be done to use this well, use this sustainably, and use this responsibly.</span><br /><br /><span>Manisha Tank:</span><span>&nbsp;Okay, still a lot of development and evolution, though, to go on there, so that feedback loop, I would guess, is very important, and the kind of feedback that you'll get at events like this as well will be, I think, feeding into that conversation a little bit further. I think we're going to speak about [and] I'm sure you will speak about it many times in many panels in the coming years.</span><br /><br /><span>Let's move on to previous years because you have had experience in the Ministry of what was then the Ministry of Environment and Water, but now essentially a Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, and sustainability is something that is very close to all of our hearts here in Asia. We only have to turn on the news every day to see the impact that climate change is having on our world, and it's very close by with our neighbouring countries, those in those multilateral groups that you talked about, and we've seen recent typhoons, this kind of thing, so it's very present in people's minds, but to get behind the kind of innovation and changes we need to see, we need sustainable finance.</span><br /><br /><span>So, I wanted to get some of your reflections on really, where you sit in terms of what is required and MAS&rsquo; role. What is the transformative role, do you think, of sustainable finance? And again, how is Singapore putting itself at the centre of that conversation?&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>Chia Der Jiun:</span><span>&nbsp;That's a critical question for all of us. It's an area where I think we have to remain hopeful, and we have to remain committed. There will be ups and downs with this and we have to see the trajectory of global policy on this.</span><br /><br /><span>But clearly, I think the momentum on the side of corporates and financial institutions remains on track. I think the momentum on the side of investors also remains broadly on track. So, we've seen, for instance, sustainable funds inflows continuing to grow, certainly so in the last year, growing quite healthily, around 10%. We're still seeing demand for sustainable loans and bonds growing, so I think that's also positive. We're seeing also policy directions still trending in the right direction. So, some of these, for instance, Singapore has announced its intention to raise the carbon tax over seven years, and other countries in this region have also mentioned the intention to introduce carbon taxes. So, these are all trending in the right direction. I think we'll have to keep the momentum there.</span><br /><br /><span>In terms of how the private sector and the financial community needs to work at this, I think we'll have to think about it in a few levels.</span><br /><br /><span>One, is that the capabilities need to be continually developed. We don't want capabilities to be a bottleneck. So, one of the first things that we have done, is to study the skills that are required in this area, so that when you do your loans and your bonds and are providing financial services across the board, you are able to have that layer of expertise that allows you to do so and to advise clients, whether they're corporates or investors on how to do so sustainably.</span><br /><br /><span>So, we've identified the skills that are needed, and there's now the initiative with the whole industry to really roll out the training that's needed to upskill the financial sector professionals, so that they're able to do all the structuring. So that's the first thing, and it will take, you know, the next couple of years to get this fully done, but there's already a great new structure of expertise here, and they're providing a lot of this into the region. The second thing is that we've got to keep momentum going through some regulatory actions. So, certainly, mandated climate disclosures will be part of it. They won't reach all corners of the economy quickly enough, I think that's the main issue. You always start with largest companies, the listed companies, and it will take time to filter through the supply chain and down to the smallest companies. And so, it will be some years away, but necessary to start this journey and keep the momentum.</span><br /><br /><span>Then, on the financial institutions side, it is also important for them to start the journey in terms of building the capability, in terms of how to engage their financing chain &ndash; not just the supply chain, but across all customers. And the way we prompt their thinking is to ask them to undertake transition planning, that they should all get started on this journey. We are not telling them the ambition level they should set, that is for them to consider, but really start the journey, build up the capabilities. Have these conversations with your supply chain, with your facilities, how are you decarbonising and what other pathways there are? So that is an important step to take.</span><br /><br /><span>Coming back to this point about disclosures, and that it is not going permeate every corner of the economy very quickly, there is a residual data gap that is a huge issue. So, banks would have difficulty engaging their customers, and customers have difficulty engaging the supply chains in terms of gathering all of that data. And so, it is an issue, and I think it is something that we all have to apply our minds to. I think the community here would be very helpful if they could apply their minds to this and find models to do this. So, MAS and GFTN have made a small contribution in this area. We&rsquo;ve talked about this before, we launched Gprnt &ndash; this is an attempt to simplify, automate this data collection, enable even small companies to be able to start this journey of gathering data on their kind of exposures, and reporting them in a simple and automated way. But we need more help with this.</span><br /><br /><span>Manisha Tank:&nbsp;</span><span>Yes, they need more help with this. So, feedback loop, it would be great if everybody contributes. We don&rsquo;t have much time left, so I just wanted to finish on one quick little question. So, I had a question about quantum, but we won&rsquo;t have time to cover it. I want to just put a question to the audience. Raise your hand if you think you know what quantum is all about? Like, literally, two or three hands up. Thank you, to those of you. I think what it underlines is either you're too shy to raise your hand, or it is an acknowledgement that we still have so much to learn.</span><br /><br /><span>So, while you are here, MD, what would you most like to learn at this year's SFF?</span><br /><br /><span>Chia Der Jiun:</span><span>&nbsp;I've arranged to do a walk around after our session today. I&rsquo;ll stay of course, for Governor Sethaput and Queen Maxima&rsquo;s sessions, but I want to get a good feel about what the latest ideas are and what people are seeing and pushing and, you know, dreaming of. So, I think that's important. I don't have a particular area that I'm going to look at. I&rsquo;m going to be very open minded, and I&rsquo;m here to learn and absorb.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>Manisha Tank:&nbsp;</span><span>That's great.</span><br /><br /><span>Chia Der Jiun:</span><span>&nbsp;I might just leave one word about quantum. I think it's not too early. I think that's the thing that most people have in their minds. Because quantum computers are still in the lab, let&rsquo;s be very clear about this, still in the lab and not at commercial grade and scale. But is it too early? No, it's not too early, especially on the security front. So, we have been warned about hackers already doing harvesting of data so that they can break it later when quantum technology is fully available. So, it's not too early, we have to look into security, post quantum encryption, as well as quantum key distribution. MAS is experimenting with those. In terms of use cases, quantum is going to give you that compute power that is just exponentially greater than classical computers, and so, it's not too early to think about how potential use cases could be there. It's not there yet, but useful to start the journey.</span><br /><br /><span>Manisha Tank:</span><span>&nbsp;Well, if you want the resources to learn about quantum, this is the place to do it. We&rsquo;ve got various stages where you can deal with it. But in the meantime, MD, I just want to say thank you so much. I know you&rsquo;ve got a full slate and that you&rsquo;ll be meeting lots of people today, so it was great to have this conversation with you.&nbsp;</span></p>

<title>ASIC Seeks Feedback On Proposed Guidance On Sustainability Reporting Regime</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-seeks-feedback-on-proposed-guidance-on-sustainability-reporting-regime/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-seeks-feedback-on-proposed-guidance-on-sustainability-reporting-regime/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC has today released a draft regulatory guide on the sustainability reporting regime for consultation with stakeholders.</p>
<p>From 1 January 2025, many large Australian businesses and financial institutions will need to prepare annual statutory sustainability reports containing climate-related financial disclosures.</p>
<p>The draft Regulatory Guide 000&nbsp;<em>Sustainability reporting</em>&nbsp;(Draft RG 000) includes guidance on who must prepare a sustainability report, how the regime will interact with existing legal obligations and how ASIC will administer the sustainability reporting requirements. This includes specific guidance on ASIC&rsquo;s approach to granting relief from the regime and use of its new directions power.</p>
<p>Draft RG 000 also addresses specific issues in relation to the contents of the sustainability report and sustainability-related financial disclosures outside the sustainability report.</p>
<p>ASIC Commissioner Kate O&rsquo;Rourke said: &lsquo;Our focus for this regulatory guide is to assist preparers of sustainability reports to comply with their obligations so that users are provided with high-quality, decision-useful, climate-related financial disclosures that comply with the law and the sustainability standards.&rsquo;</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s Consultation Paper 380&nbsp;<em>Sustainability reporting</em>&nbsp;(CP 380) seeks stakeholder feedback on the draft guide, whether any ASIC legislative instruments that grant relief in relation to financial reporting or audit requirements should be extended to sustainability reporting and any other areas where ASIC should support the introduction of the sustainability reporting regime.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We want industry to engage with our draft guidance and what we are proposing. Their feedback will help us to ensure that we can effectively support the implementation of the sustainability reporting regime,&rsquo; Ms O&rsquo;Rourke said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We recognise that there will be a period of transition whilst entities build their capability, as reflected in the phasing in of requirements and modified liability provisions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;During this transition period, we will take a proportionate and pragmatic approach to supervision and enforcement.&rsquo;</p>
<p>ASIC is urging all reporting entities to prepare for the new climate disclosure regime. Feedback on CP 380 is due by 19 December 2024.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>Treasury Laws Amendment (Financial Market Infrastructure and Other Measures) Act 2024&nbsp;</em>(Cth) requires mandatory climate reporting for large businesses and financial institutions in Australia through amendments to the&nbsp;<em>Corporations Act 2001</em>&nbsp;(Cth) and the&nbsp;<em>Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001&nbsp;</em>(Cth).</p>
<p>The mandatory climate reporting requirements will be phased in over the next three years across three groups of reporting entities, with the first reporting cohort required to prepare annual sustainability reports for financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2025.</p>
<p>The second and third reporting cohorts are required to prepare annual sustainability reports for the financial years commencing on or after 1 July 2026 and 1 July 2027 respectively.</p>
<p>Industry stakeholders can refer to&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/sustainability-reporting/" title="Sustainability reporting">sustainability reporting</a>&nbsp;on the ASIC website for more information.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>(Excerpt)</p>
<p>(Wednesday, October 23, 2024, 10:08&nbsp;pm to 10:17&nbsp;pm)</p>
<dl><dt>Q.</dt><dd>
<p>An employee of the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) is now subject to a criminal investigation for suspected insider trading. Could you explain what measures you are considering for this case and provide some personal comments?</p>
</dd><dt class="ans">A.</dt><dd>
<p>There was an insider trading case involving a TSE employee, and there was also a case involving a Financial Services Agency (FSA) employee. Employees of the FSA and the TSE, who hold a supervisory position of markets, are facing investigations by the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission (SESC). Those in a position to secure trust in the Japanese financial market ended up facing criminal investigations. These facts are truly regrettable.<br />The FSA will fully cooperate with the SESC's investigation of the employee and will take strict measures based on the investigation results. We know that the TSE will also cooperate with the SESC's investigation of the relevant employee and will take strict measures based on the investigation results.<br />Then, we need to take recurrence prevention measures thoroughly in consideration of the results of the SESC's investigations and other factors, and will make further efforts to secure trust in the Japanese financial market through such measures.<br />Any future measures will be based on the results of the current investigations.</p>

<title>Senate Economics Legislation Committee, Supplementary Budget Estimates - Opening Statement By ASIC Chair Joe Longo At The Senate Economics Legislation Committee, Supplementary Budget Estimates, 7 November 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/senate-economics-legislation-committee-supplementary-budget-estimates-opening/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/senate-economics-legislation-committee-supplementary-budget-estimates-opening/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I am pleased to appear before the Committee once more. I am joined today by Deputy Chair Sarah Court, and fellow Commissioners Kate O&rsquo;Rourke, Alan Kirkland and Simone Constant, as well as CEO Greg Yanco, Executive Director Enforcement and Compliance Chris Savundra and Chief Financial Officer Peter Dunlop.</p>
<h2>ASIC&rsquo;s transformation journey</h2>
<p>As this is our last Estimates hearing for this year, it would be timely to provide a brief update for the Committee on ASIC&rsquo;s transformation since I commenced as Chair in 2021.</p>
<p>Over the past three years we have been deliberate in our approach to transform ASIC into a modern, confident and ambitious regulator.</p>
<p>Our progress can be measured by the way we have systematically implemented the recommendations of the Financial Regulator Assessment Authority&rsquo;s 2022 report on the review into ASIC&rsquo;s effectiveness and capability.</p>
<p>Our transformation has included the most significant organisational redesign of the agency in 15 years &ndash; resulting in better collaboration across teams and quicker times for matters to progress to enforcement and compliance action.</p>
<p>As a result of this work, we are better placed to respond to the rapidly changing domestic and global market including increased market volatility, advances in AI, data and cyber risks and the flow of capital from public to private markets.</p>
<p>We must continually review, transform, and improve how we focus our efforts for greatest impact.</p>
<h2>Recent inquiries</h2>
<p>The FRAA&rsquo;s four broad recommendations related to a substantial uplift in ASIC&rsquo;s use of data and technology, better stakeholder engagement, measuring effectiveness and capability and broadening our mix of skill sets.</p>
<p>This work is closely aligned with our vision and our priorities.</p>
<p>Many of these recommendations are consistent with what we have heard from our stakeholders over this time and the work of a number of parliamentary inquiries which have appropriately sought to ensure the role we are performing is having an impact.</p>
<p>These inquiries include ASIC&rsquo;s powers in relation to insurers and claims handling, the ASX CHESS replacement program and the professional services industry.</p>
<p>We always welcome parliamentary scrutiny as a key mechanism for driving continuous improvement and transformation.</p>
<p>I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge stakeholder contributions to each of these inquiries &ndash; they reflect a deep interest in ensuring ASIC is equipped to be the best it can be.</p>
<p>We have listened carefully at what has been said and acknowledge there are further areas we need to address.</p>
<h2>FRAA recommendations</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to report we have implemented 19 of the FRAA&rsquo;s 22 areas for improvement.</p>
<p>Some key initiatives now embedded in our operations and contributing to ASIC being a more effective regulator include:</p>
<ul>
<li>innovative new surveillance systems</li>
<li>enhanced data capabilities for strategic planning</li>
<li>a program of more quality engagement with our stakeholders &ndash; being led by the Commission; and</li>
<li>a revamp of our strategic planning process to include longer-term priorities.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are three initiatives that remain our highest priority relating to people, data and technology, and impact assessment.</p>
<p>In our transformation we have made significant progress in these three areas. These are critical, long-term initiatives that require ongoing effort to fully embed.</p>
<h2>The future</h2>
<p>I am optimistic about ASIC&rsquo;s future.</p>
<p>A transformation of this scale has had some short-term impacts, but as a result of the efforts of our people and the renewal that has occurred at Commission and executive level, we are well placed for the next phase.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s mission to be a modern, confident and ambitious regulator is being borne out in a number of regulatory firsts and the enforcement action we have taken in recent months against some of Australia&rsquo;s largest corporations and institutions.</p>
<p>In addition, we have protected vulnerable Australians from harm through our scams work, and our Better Banking report which resulted in $28 million being refunded to consumers including First Nations consumers, and more than 200,000 customers being moved into low-fee accounts.</p>
<p>These are matters we&rsquo;d be happy to discuss in greater detail today.</p>
<h2>Sustainability reporting regime</h2>
<p>Before I conclude, Chair, I wanted to mention that ASIC will today release the draft regulatory guide on the sustainability reporting regime for consultation with stakeholders.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been saying for some time - environmental, social and governance issues are driving the biggest changes to financial reporting and disclosure standards in a generation.</p>
<p>The draft Regulatory Guide is therefore an important document for entities who will need to prepare an annual statutory sustainability report as it sets out their obligations and how ASIC will administer the new requirements.</p>
<p>We encourage stakeholder feedback on the draft guide.</p>
<p>We look forward to answering the Committee&rsquo;s questions.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) Regional Consultative Group for the Middle East and North Africa (RCG MENA) met today in Saudi Arabia. The meeting was hosted by the Saudi Central Bank (SAMA), at its headquarters in Riyadh.</p>
<p>Technological innovation featured prominently on the agenda. Participants took stock of the advances relating to artificial intelligence (AI) in the financial sector and exchanged experiences on how AI is being applied by both supervisors and financial institutions. While the use of AI can generate efficiencies and create value, it also introduces new risks. In this regard, participants look forward to the FSB&rsquo;s forthcoming report on the financial stability implications of AI. Eddie Yue, co-chair of the RCG for Asia and Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, attended this meeting to bring in the perspectives of the Asia region, drawn from the RCG Asia workshop in October on the financial stability implications of AI, tokenisation and crypto-assets.</p>
<p>The pervasive role of technology in the financial system has also contributed to the increased frequency and elevated severity of operational and cyber incidents. Recognising that these risks to operational resilience can also arise from reliance on external providers, members discussed their approaches to third-party risk management and cyber incident reporting. They welcomed the FSB&rsquo;s public&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/10/format-for-incident-reporting-exchange-fire-consultation-report/">consultation on a Format for Incident Reporting Exchange (FIRE)</a>&nbsp;and its potential to address&nbsp;<a>challenges arising from the need for financial institutions to report operational incidents to multiple authorities.&nbsp;</a>Together, FIRE and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/12/final-report-on-enhancing-third-party-risk-management-and-oversight-a-toolkit-for-financial-institutions-and-financial-authorities/">FSB&rsquo;s toolkit for enhancing third-party risk management and oversight</a>&nbsp;can reduce fragmentation, facilitate communications and coordination within and across jurisdictions, and ultimately enhance operational resilience and incident response.</p>
<p>Members exchanged views on global and regional market developments, including perspectives on the financial stability outlook. Topics addressed included the management of the gradual easing in inflation expectations and the role of technology and social media in influencing depositor behaviour.</p>
<p>Finally, members received an update on the FSB&rsquo;s work programme and expressed their views on the proposed areas of focus for 2025, bringing their regional perspective to the discussion.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h2>
<p>The FSB RCG for the Middle East and North Africa is co-chaired by Governor Ayman Al-Sayari, Saudi Central Bank, and Governor Hassan Abdalla, Central Bank of Egypt. Membership includes financial authorities from Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, T&uuml;rkiye and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>The FSB has six Regional Consultative Groups, established under the FSB Charter, to bring together financial authorities from FSB member and non-member countries to exchange views on vulnerabilities affecting financial systems and on initiatives to promote financial stability.<span class="fn"><a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/11/fsb-mena-group-discusses-artificial-intelligence-cyber-risk-and-operational-readiness/#02e59f6a-1c13-4636-8159-616e8edbf634" id="02e59f6a-1c13-4636-8159-616e8edbf634-link">1</a></span>&nbsp;Typically, each Regional Consultative Group meets twice each year.</p>
<p>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. The FSB also conducts outreach with approximately 70 other jurisdictions through its six Regional Consultative Groups.</p>
<p>The FSB is chaired by Klaas Knot, President of De Nederlandsche Bank. The FSB Secretariat is located in Basel, Switzerland and hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>
<ol class="wp-block-footnotes">
<li id="02e59f6a-1c13-4636-8159-616e8edbf634">The FSB Regional Consultative Groups cover the following regions: Americas, Asia, Commonwealth of Independent States, Europe, Middle East and North Africa, and sub-Saharan Africa.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/11/fsb-mena-group-discusses-artificial-intelligence-cyber-risk-and-operational-readiness/#02e59f6a-1c13-4636-8159-616e8edbf634-link">↩︎</a></li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Tradeweb Markets Inc. (Nasdaq: TW), a leading, global operator of electronic marketplaces for rates, credit, equities and money markets, today reported total trading volume for the month of October 2024 of $54.7 trillion (tn)<a href="https://www.tradeweb.com/newsroom/media-center/news-releases/tradeweb-reports-october-2024-total-trading-volume-of-$54.7-trillion-and-average-daily-volume-of-$2.35-trillion/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>[1]</span></a>. Average daily volume (ADV) for the month was $2.35tn, an increase of 34.1 percent (%) year-over-year (YoY). Excluding the impact of the ICD acquisition, which closed on August 1, 2024, total ADV for the month of October was up 18.4% YoY.</p>
<p>In October 2024, Tradeweb records included:</p>
<ul>
<li>ADV in European government bonds<br /><br /></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">October 2024 Highlights</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>rates</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>U.S. government bond ADV was up 34.9% YoY to $220.8 billion (bn). European government bond ADV was up 26.3% YoY to $53.4bn.<br /> 
<ul>
<li>U.S. government bond volumes were supported by record volume in our institutional business, as well as strong growth in wholesale and retail volumes. Growth was supported by increased adoption across a wide range of protocols, heightened activity across a diverse set of client types, and favorable market conditions. Strong European government bond market activity, as well as a growing client base, contributed to record European government bond volumes on the platform.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Mortgage ADV was up 28.2% YoY to $248.6bn.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> 
<ul>
<li>To-Be-Announced (TBA) volumes hit a new record, fueled by continued strong dollar-roll activity and increased macro-rate volatility. October also set a record for the number of specified pool lists executed on the platform, underscoring the growing adoption of our offering.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Swaps/swaptions &ge; 1-year ADV was down 9.4% YoY to $416.6bn and total rates derivatives ADV was up 5.9% YoY to $793.2bn.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp; 
<ul>
<li>Swaps/swaptions &ge; 1-year activity was down due to a 40% YoY decline in compression activity, which carries a lower fee per million. Quarter-to-date compression activity as a percentage of swaps/swaptions is trending lower than 3Q24. Strong risk trading volume in swaps/swaptions was driven by volatile markets in the run up to the UK budget and the U.S. election. Clients continued to utilize the request-for-market (RFM) protocol for risk transfers. Emerging markets swaps growth remained strong.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span><span>credit</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Fully electronic U.S. credit ADV was up 32.7% YoY to $7.4bn and European credit ADV was up 17.6% YoY to $2.5bn. 
<ul>
<li>U.S. credit volumes were driven by increased client adoption, most notably in request-for-quote (RFQ), portfolio trading and Tradeweb AllTrade&reg;. Tradeweb captured 17.3% and 7.0% of fully electronic U.S high grade and U.S. high yield TRACE, respectively, as measured by Tradeweb. European credit volumes were driven by record volumes in Tradeweb&rsquo;s Automated Intelligent Execution tool (AiEX) and Tradeweb AllTrade&reg;.<br /><br /></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Municipal bonds ADV was down 16.7% YoY to $394 million (mm).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp; 
<ul>
<li>Municipal bonds ADV was down YoY given lower tax-loss harvesting compared to the prior year as well as subdued secondary volumes due to record new issuance in October.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Credit derivatives ADV was up 13.0% YoY to&nbsp;$13.6bn.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp; 
<ul>
<li>Increased hedge fund and systematic account activity, along with heightened credit volatility, led to increased swap execution facility (SEF) and multilateral trading facility (MTF) credit default swaps activity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span><span>equities&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>U.S. ETF ADV was down 9.0% YoY to $6.5bn and European ETF ADV was up 10.8% YoY to $2.8bn. 
<ul>
<li>European ETF volumes were higher as clients continued to embrace our automated request-for-quote (RFQ) trading tools. U.S. secondary market volumes were muted due to investor sentiment leading up to the U.S. election.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span><span>money markets&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Repo ADV was up 28.7% YoY to $678.4bn. 
<ul>
<li>A continued increase in client activity on Tradeweb&rsquo;s repo trading platform drove elevated global repo activity. The combination of elevated funding rates, an unwind of the Fed&rsquo;s balance sheet, and current rates market activity continued to shift more assets from the Fed&rsquo;s reverse repo facility to money markets. Retail money markets activity remained strong, as investors adjusted to the potential for continued rates cuts.<br /><br /></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Money Markets ADV was up YoY to $294.6bn. 
<ul>
<li>Other money markets volume growth was driven by the inclusion of ICD volumes in October 2024.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

With AMD, Exegy achieved a 49% latency reduction, the lowest tick-to-trade latency of any previously published benchmark. The prestigious award win comes from Waters Technology, which has a long and distinguished track record of recognizing excellence across the capital markets, technology, data and linked service industries. This unique, off-the-shelf solution greatly reduces time-to-production, FPGA development costs and addresses the need for speed and agility in capital markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Olivier Cousin, Director of FPGA Solutions of Exegy, commented:&nbsp;"It&rsquo;s inspiring to see how the same nxFramework flow, designed for the standardization of FPGA development, can be finetuned to achieve record-breaking latency performance like that of the STAC-T0 benchmark. Purpose-built for flexibility, combined with highly-optimized IPs &ndash; nxFramework makes record-setting performance possible while maintaining an unparalleled ease of use. Customers can now experience this exceptional performance 'out-of-the-box,' allowing them to focus their valuable time and resources entirely on their unique trading strategies."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The results of the STAC-T0 test showcase how Exegy&rsquo;s nxFramework, in collaboration with AMD, pushed the very limits of the technology needed for ultra-low latency trading in capital markets. This innovation combines hardware acceleration, FPGA flexibility, and low-latency networking to ensure precise and reproducible performance, enabling clients to achieve the fastest trade execution speeds possible using industry-standard hardware and a standardized FPGA toolkit. This is crucial for staying competitive and can dramatically reduce the time it takes to get a firm&rsquo;s strategies to market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The nxFramework provides a groundbreaking blueprint that ensures firms can move quickly into production with limited resources, without compromising on performance. The solution provides clients with scalability and flexibility, allowing internal teams to focus on their unique business logic that differentiates them in the market and maximizes their value.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>"The last quarter century has been an incredible journey, and it was an honor to lead this organization from a startup to a position of global leadership. None of this could have been possible without the skill and dedication of our management team, employees, and board of directors,&rdquo; said Mr. McVey. &ldquo;Most importantly, I am grateful for the tremendous support we enjoy from our dealer and investor clients around the world. The future of MarketAxess is bright and I am confident under Chris' leadership we will continue our track record of innovation and growth to create lasting improvements for global fixed income markets. I look forward to my continued involvement on the Board of MarketAxess Limited as we continue to expand our reach in international financial markets."</p>
<p>Mr. Hernandez previously served as a Director from 2006 to 2019 and rejoined the MarketAxess Board in September 2023. Mr. Hernandez, who is designated as an independent Director, currently serves as the Chair of the Board&rsquo;s Compensation and Talent Committee.

<p>&ldquo;We delivered significantly improved financial results in the third quarter, as we continued to make progress in executing our strategy.</p>
<p>The initial roll-out of X-Pro to our international client base is underway. In the third quarter, we delivered several hundred basis points in market share gains in U.S. credit portfolio trading compared to second quarter 2024 levels. Additionally, a record 74% of our portfolio trading volume was executed on X-Pro in September. We are looking to build on these gains in the coming quarters with the initial launch of our targeted block trading solutions last month, designed to minimize market impact and optimize trading success. Additionally, we are enhancing our dealer liquidity solutions by extending our suite of automation services to our dealer clients.</p>
<p>In summary, we exited the quarter in September with a constructive market backdrop, characterized by strong market volumes, a robust new issue calendar and an increase in the velocity of trading in U.S. high-grade. We believe we are well positioned to deliver continued growth in the coming quarters.&rdquo;</p>

The increase in total credit commission revenue was driven principally by&nbsp;<b>24%</b>&nbsp;growth in U.S. high-grade commission revenue on a&nbsp;<b>39%</b>&nbsp;increase in U.S. high-grade TRACE market ADV. The decline in variable transaction fees per million (&ldquo;FPM&rdquo;) to&nbsp;<b>$148.97</b>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<b>$154.85</b>&nbsp;in the prior year was mainly due to product and protocol mix-shift, principally lower levels of U.S. high-yield activity and increased portfolio trading, partially offset by the higher duration of bonds traded in U.S. high-grade, principally driven by an increase in the weighted average years to maturity.&nbsp;<b></b>The decrease in fixed-distribution fees was principally driven by the consolidation of two global dealers and migrations to variable fee plans, partially offset by the addition of new dealer fixed fee plans.</li>

<p><b>Non-GAAP financial measures and other items</b></p>
<p>To supplement the Company&rsquo;s unaudited financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;), the Company uses certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance, including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (&ldquo;EBITDA&rdquo;), EBITDA margin and free cash flow. We define EBITDA margin as EBITDA divided by revenues. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities excluding the net change in trading investments and net change in securities failed-to-deliver and securities failed-to-receive from broker-dealers, clearing organizations and customers, less expenditures for furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements and capitalized software development costs. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken into consideration with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide additional information regarding the Company&rsquo;s operating results because they assist both investors and management in analyzing and evaluating the performance of our business. See the attached schedule for a reconciliation of GAAP net income to EBITDA, GAAP net income margin to EBITDA margin and GAAP net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities to free cash flow.</p>
<p>Please refer to Tables 6 &amp; 7&nbsp;<b></b>for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures.</p>

<p><b>General Notes Regarding the Data Presented</b></p>
<p>Reported MarketAxess volume in all product categories includes only fully electronic trading volume. MarketAxess trading volumes and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&ldquo;FINRA&rdquo;) Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (&ldquo;TRACE&rdquo;) reported volumes are available on the Company&rsquo;s website at&nbsp;<a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.marketaxess.com%2Fvolume&amp;esheet=54147732&amp;newsitemid=20241105557526&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=investor.marketaxess.com%2Fvolume&amp;index=3&amp;md5=e006a0287401bab6bc7cee2d4acce72a" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">investor.marketaxess.com/volume</a>.</p>
<p>For periods beginning with January 2024, the Company has made changes to the market volume data used to calculate estimated market share for Municipal and U.S. Government Bonds. For Municipal Bonds, the Company previously used estimates, derived from data issued by the Municipal Securities Rule Making Board (&ldquo;MSRB&rdquo;), including estimates for new issuance, commercial paper and variable-rate trading activity, and excluded these volumes from the estimated market volume data. While the Company still uses estimates, the new methodology for identifying and excluding these volumes from the market volume data is now based on MSRB &ldquo;flags&rdquo; to identify new issuance, commercial paper, and variable-rate volumes. For U.S. Government Bonds, the previous data source for estimated market volumes was the Federal Reserve Bank&rsquo;s Reported Primary Dealer U.S. Treasury Bond Trading Volumes, which was reported on a one-week lag. The new source for U.S. Government Bond trading volumes is FINRA&rsquo;s U.S. Treasury TRACE data. The Company believes that the refined methodology used for Municipal Bonds, and the new data source for U.S. Government Bonds, provides more accurate measures of estimated market volumes and estimated market share. Prior comparable periods have been recast retrospectively for both Municipal and U.S. Government Bonds to conform to the updated presentation of the data. The new estimated market volume data is also available on the Company&rsquo;s website at&nbsp;<a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.marketaxess.com%2Fvolume&amp;esheet=54147732&amp;newsitemid=20241105557526&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=investor.marketaxess.com%2Fvolume&amp;index=4&amp;md5=5eeaba7e20e139ca58bf07e58604ec7b" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">investor.marketaxess.com/volume</a>.</p>

<title>Tehran Securities Exchange: Kish Invex Hosts Iran Financial Markets</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><i>The 11<sup>th</sup> international exhibition of " Exchange, Bank, Insurance and Privatization" kicked off on 4 November 2024.</i></p>
<p>The opening ceremony of the event was held with the presence of senior capital market executives and economic officials, as well as markets&rsquo; players in Kish Island. The Kish Invex 2024 consists of the introduction panels of the country's investment opportunities and the international exchange, bank, insurance and privatization exhibition.</p>
<p>Dr. Mahmoud Goudarzi, the CEO of Tehran Securities Exchange (TSE), some of the board members and the accompanying delegation from TSE took part in the events and visited the exhibition booths in order to exchange points of view, concerns and suggestions.</p>
<p>As part of a panel alongside Kish Invex, Goudarzi announced the new plans and methods of TSE to help finance and supply the working capital of projects in the national capital market. &ldquo;We have decided to implement the ideas to change the conventional methods of financing in the past two years. The experts visited city by city to identify the financing capacities of different regions. The share of capital market in financing the economic activities is roughly 12 percent in the entire country. It should not be overlooked that in our country financing projects is greatly dominated by the bank-oriented model, a model virtually outmoded for years among most of the developed countries. The plan is now to identify investment capacities, and support them to be financed.&rdquo;, he stated and added that &ldquo;In the meetings and visits, we identified the unfinished and pending liquidity-requiring projects, and introduced the very attractive model of Project Public Company. Through this channel, we have issued some good amount for underwriting of the projects, and in the first step, two effective liquidity absorptions were handled for separate projects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the sidelines of the exhibition, TSE unveiled four new tech-based systems with the aim of improving the efficiency and development of the market: Brokerage Affairs and Inspection System, Integrated Market Platform (SIBA), Issuers&rsquo; Business Intelligence, and Extensive Surveillance System (SANJESH).</p>
<p>The Brokerage Affairs and Inspection System has been redesigned with the aim of increasing the agility and accuracy in the supervisory and administrative processes of brokers. This new version provides a platform for better and more efficient interaction with brokerage companies by using some smart features.</p>
<p>SIBA has been developed with the aim of mechanizing main processes of market operations, including market management requests, the wholesale and block transactions, handling new instruments, as well the IPOs. By reducing bureaucracy, this system helps increase the speed and accuracy of the market operations and improves interactions with relevant institutions.</p>
<p>The Issuers&rsquo; Business Intelligence provides users with quick access to the updated information and records of listed companies through providing comprehensive dashboards and customized financial reports.</p>
<p>SANJESH will make transactions&rsquo; monitoring processes significantly simpler, more accurate, and more efficient by recording real-time information and providing automatic alerts. Via connecting to other related platforms, SANJESH facilitates access to up-to-date data for market surveillance managers and helps improve supervisory decisions.</p>
<p>The event will be held until 7 November 2024 in the Kish International Exhibition Center.</p>

<title>SET Market Report For October 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/set-market-report-for-october-2024/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/set-market-report-for-october-2024/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The U.S. presidential election on November 5 has driven short-term stock market volatility, with unpredictable voting outcomes and sharp policy differences between Republican and Democratic candidates fueling investor uncertainty. Recent polls from late October showing Trump leading Harris for the first time since the candidate switch have raised concerns about renewed U.S.-China trade tensions. These shifts are already reverberating through global markets, with potential implications for U.S. inflation, the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s delayed rate cuts, and dollar appreciation, triggering early signs of foreign capital outflows from Asian equity markets.</p>
<p class="Default"><b>SET Senior Executive Vice President Soraphol Tulayasathien</b> said that the Thai bourse has gained momentum from favorable domestic factors, including a clearer political landscape following the new Prime Minister's appointment, stronger-than-expected Thai economic growth, and increased institutional investment driven by stock market-related measures. Domestic institutional buying rebounded to its highest level since March 2020, bolstered by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)&rsquo;s decision to cut the benchmark rate by 25 basis points in a 5:2 split vote. Despite the SET Index&rsquo;s gains for two consecutive months, the market faced valuation pressures as analysts revised down their 12-month forward earnings forecasts for listed companies.</p>
<p><b>Key highlights for October</b><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<ul>
<li>At the end of October 2024, the SET Index closed at 1,466.04 points, up 1.2 percent from the previous month, considered higher than the average return of other stock indices in the region. The SET index rose 3.5 percent from the end of 2023.</li>
<li>Compared to the end of last year, Technology group emerged as the only industry group that outperformed the SET Index.</li>
<li>SET&rsquo;s and mai&rsquo;s average daily trading value in October 2024 rose 16.0 percent YoY to THB 54.75 billion (approx. USD 1.62 billion). For the first 10 months of 2024, the daily trading value averaged at THB 47.33 billion, a decrease of 14.5 percent YoY.</li>
<li>In October 2024, there were four newly listed companies, with Phuk Phak Praw Rak Mae pcl (OKJ), Medeze Group pcl (MEDEZE) and T.Man Pharmaceutical pcl (TMAN) listed on SET, and Thai Auto Tools and Die pcl (TATG) listed on mai.</li>
<li>The Thai stock exchange&rsquo;s forward P/E ratio at the end of October 2024 was 16.1 times, above the Asian stock markets&rsquo; average of 12.9 times. The historical P/E ratio stood at 17.8 times, exceeding the Asian stock markets&rsquo; average of 13.7 times. </li>
<li>Dividend yield ratio at the end of October 2024 was 3.23 percent, higher than the Asian stock markets&rsquo; average of 3.10 percent.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Derivatives Market</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Thailand Futures Exchange (TFEX)&rsquo;s daily trading volume in October 2024 averaged 509,144 contracts, down 28.0 percent from the previous month largely due to the decrease in trading volume of SET50 Index Futures and Single Stock Futures. For the first ten months of 2024, TFEX&rsquo;s daily trading volume dropped 12.3 percent over the same period last year to 478,270 contracts mainly due to the decline in trading volume of Single Stock Futures and SET50 Index Futures. </li>

<title>Fonterra’s Intention To Move To NZX Main Board</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Fonterra has today announced its intention to move its Shareholders&rsquo; Market from a private market operated by NZX to the NZX Main Board in January 2025. This decision opens a pathway for other co-operatives to list on the Main Board and demonstrates NZX&rsquo;s ability to offer a market accessible to a range of corporate structures. NZX confirms that this will have no impact on NZX&rsquo;s FY2024 earnings guidance. </span></p>
<p><span> It may have an impact on NZX&rsquo;s FY2025 earnings guidance. However, any earnings impact will be dependent on a variety of factors, including the underlying performance of the business, revenue levels from trading of Fonterra on the NZX Main Board and related data requirements, as well as cost savings initiatives. FY2025 guidance will be released to the market in February 2025. </span></p>

<title>US Office Of The Comptroller Of The Currency Designates Three Senior National Bank Examiners</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today designated Dewayne Lott, Ron Pasch, and Tanya Smith as Senior National Bank Examiners.</p>
<p>The Senior National Bank Examiner designation recognizes examiners who have distinguished themselves through high-quality performance and service as field examiners, subject matter experts, and advisors on highly complex and technical bank supervision issues. This is the highest honor bestowed to national bank examiners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the OCC&rsquo;s 161-year history, only a select few examiners have earned the distinguished designation of Senior National Bank Excaminer,&rdquo; said Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael J. Hsu. &ldquo;I am honored to recognize three outstanding examiners on achieving this prestigious recognition and joining this elite group.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Mr. Lott&rsquo;s more than 20 years at the OCC, he has distinguished himself by his diligence, tenacity, and skill in supervising banks with unique issues that are uncommon in the traditional banking industry. He has served in a variety of roles across several lines of business and is currently the Examer-in-Charge of Cenlar Federal Savings Bank. Mr. Lott has demonstrated strong technical expertise, particularly in mortgage banking, and has supported the supervision of community, midsize, and large banks. With his breadth of experience and wide career network, he has proven to be an invaluable advisor to agency executives, other regulators, and field examiners.</p>
<p>Having served as an OCC bank examiner for more than 38 years, Mr. Pasch is highly regarded for his technical knowledge across a wide range of topics. He has served as a Community Reinvestment Act Specialist, a Commercial Credit Team Lead, a capital markets expert in Bank Supervision Policy, an Examiner-in-Charge for three large bank teams, and a large bank Deputy Comptroller. Mr. Pasch is also recognized for his commitment to providing career opportunities for others and his consistent focus on developing a high-performing examiner workforce by supporting training initiatives and knowledge-sharing programs.</p>
<p>Ms. Smith has served as an OCC bank examiner for more than 25 years and has been recognized for her work and collaboration with internal and external stakeholders in supervising banks of all sizes, including those with an international presence, to ensure the safety and soundness of the federal banking system. She has demonstrated strong leadership in her roles as a Deputy Comptroller in Large Bank Supervision and Examiner-in-Charge, currently serving as Examiner-in-Charge of Citibank. Ms. Smith&rsquo;s strong leadership has been evident in the resolution of complex enforcement cases, her effective management of the OCC&rsquo;s London office, including during the pre- and post-Brexit period, and in setting strategic priorities and expectations during the 2023 market disruption.</p>

<title>ISDA: Ark 51 Adopts CDM For CSA Data Extraction</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-ark-51-adopts-cdm-for-csa-data-extraction/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-ark-51-adopts-cdm-for-csa-data-extraction/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ISDA has announced that Ark 51, an artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytics service developed by legal services provider DRS, has used the Common Domain Model (CDM) to convert information from ISDA&rsquo;s regulatory initial margin (IM) and variation margin (VM) credit support annexes (CSAs) into digital form.</p>
<p>Ark 51 is a contract and risk management system that uses AI to extract key data from legal agreements, including IM and VM CSAs. The CDM transforms that data into a machine-readable format that can be quickly and efficiently exported to other systems, cutting the resources associated with manual processing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The CDM is a brilliant concept that enables data to be transformed into a digital output &ndash; this aligns well with our Ark 51 platform, which extracts data from PDF documents. It is important to continue the community-driven effort to further develop the CDM and digitize documents for data analytics purposes,&rdquo; said Paul Hands, Chief Technology Officer of DRS.</p>
<p>DRS is the latest entity to adopt the CDM,&nbsp;<a href="https://cdm.finos.org/">a free-to-use data standard for financial products, trades and lifecycle events</a>, to reduce the operational, liquidity and counterparty risks associated with key collateral management processes. As well as digitizing key elements of regulatory IM and VM CSAs, ISDA has demonstrated how the CDM could be applied to collateral representation, margin and settlement processes, margin call issuance and response messages, and cash collateral interest processing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are delighted that Ark 51 has mapped its AI capabilities for IM and VM CSAs into CDM output. This will allow firms to better analyze CSA-related data, and the output can be used to streamline the onboarding of legacy documents to new technology platforms, increasing efficiencies and reducing operational risks within the collateral management ecosystem,&rdquo; said Scott O&rsquo;Malia, Chief Executive of ISDA.</p>
<p>The CDM is an open-source data standard hosted by FINOS. More information is&nbsp;<a href="https://cdm.finos.org/">available here</a>.</p>
<p>Find out more about ISDA&rsquo;s collateral initiatives using the CDM by clicking&nbsp;<a href="http://www.isda.org/2023/02/16/isda-collateral-initiatives/">here</a>.</p>
<p>More information on all ISDA&rsquo;s digital solutions is available on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/isda-solutions-infohub/">ISDA Solutions InfoHub</a>.</p>

<title>Purdue University/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer: Farmer Sentiment In October Rebounded Ahead Of The U.S. Election</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/purdue-universitycme-group-ag-economy-barometer-farmer-sentiment-in-october-re/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/purdue-universitycme-group-ag-economy-barometer-farmer-sentiment-in-october-re/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Farmer sentiment saw an unexpected surge in October ahead of the upcoming&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;election, according to the latest&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4294201-1&amp;h=3309456537&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fageconomybarometer%2F&amp;a=Purdue+University%2FCME+Group+Ag+Economy+Barometer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Purdue University/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer</a></span>. The index rose to 115, marking a 27-point increase from September. This boost in sentiment was primarily driven by a rise in producers' confidence in the future, with the Future Expectations Index jumping 30 points to 124. While the Current Conditions Index also improved, reaching 95, it still reflected farmers' concerns that economic conditions this year are worse than last year and weaker than the barometer's base period of 2015-16 during the early days of a multiyear downturn in the&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;farm economy. Despite current challenges, the October survey indicated some optimism among producers that economic conditions may strengthen, avoiding an extended downturn in the farm economy. This month's survey was conducted from&nbsp;Oct. 14-18, 2024.</p>
<p>"Examining responses to the barometer's individual questions helps us understand the producers' shift toward a less pessimistic view of the&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;agricultural economy," said&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4294201-1&amp;h=276822242&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fageconomybarometer%2Fteam%2Fjim-mintert%2F&amp;a=James+Mintert" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">
James Mintert</a></span>, the barometer's principal investigator and director of&nbsp;Purdue University's&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4294201-1&amp;h=1365149727&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fhome%2F&amp;a=Center+for+Commercial+Agriculture" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Center for Commercial Agriculture</a></span>.</p>
<p>In October, only 53% of producers anticipated challenging times for the&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;agricultural economy in the year ahead, a decrease from 73% in September. Similarly, concerns about the next five years eased, with just 33% of producers expecting tough times ahead, down from 48% the previous month. Additionally, fewer producers expect worsening financial conditions on their farms over the next 12 months, dropping to 23% in October from 38% in September.</p>
<p>"While producer sentiment improved in October, many respondents indicated they are still feeling financial strain due to the deterioration of their financial situation throughout 2024," said Mintert. "Over half of the producers we surveyed reported that their farm's financial condition was worse than a year ago, which underscores the ongoing challenges producers face despite their more optimistic outlook for the year ahead."</p>
<p>Each month's survey ends with an open-ended question, allowing respondents to share their thoughts and concerns. For October, politics emerged as a frequent topic of discussion, likely influenced by the upcoming elections. Many producers expressed worries about potential policy changes impacting their farms and the agricultural economy, with regulation, environment and taxes featured prominently alongside price concerns. When specifically asked about their worries for the upcoming year, respondents continued to point to higher input costs and lower output prices as their primary concerns. The trend of producers' decreasing concern over interest rates continued this month, with only 15% citing it as a top worry in October, down from 26% in late 2023.</p>
<p>One of the most surprising findings from this month's survey was the increase in the Farm Financial Performance Index. This index measures producers' expectations regarding their farm's financial performance over the next 12 months compared to the past year. In October, the index surged to 90, reflecting a 22-point jump from September and falling just 2 points shy of last year's level. Though not solely accountable for the rise in the index, contributing factors likely include high fall crop yields and a stress-free harvest season in the Corn Belt and Plains states. The index's improvement also suggests a growing optimism among farmers about their financial outlook, with expectations for better performance in 2025 compared to 2024. Producers seem to view 2024's weak income prospects as transitory, as there was also a modest improvement in the Farm Capital Investment Index, which reached 42 &mdash; a 7-point increase from September.</p>
<p>Both Farmland Value Expectation indices rose this month, indicating that producers are maintaining a level of optimism about the agricultural economy's future strength, which could, in turn, support farmland values. The Short-Term Farmland Value Expectations Index, which often correlates with financial performance expectations and the Current Conditions Index, climbed to 120, 25 points higher than the September reading. The long-term index improved to 159, up from 147 the previous month.</p>

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>First set of results since new shareholders assumed management control </b> </li>
</ul>
<p>INFINOX Capital Limited (INFINOX), a globally recognized, multi-regulated brokerage firm, reported a 117% YOY increase in pre-tax profits, according to Companies House filings released today.</p>
<p>Founded in 2009 in a Pret a Manger in London, INFINOX has grown exponentially since inception by focusing on client relations and its core offering - MT4 and MT5. Both are part of INFINOX&rsquo;s IXO Prime brand which offers liquidity and institutional services to brokers, money managers, professional clients and fintech companies. The business has significantly restructured the leadership and operations teams in the last 12 months, achieving a 70% reduction in administration costs.</p>
<p>The new leadership team has been appointed to steer the company towards its strategic growth ambitions, with the transition including the departure of Robert Berkeley and continued leadership of Jay Mawji as CEO. Jana Zdravecka has joined as Executive Director, Daniel Skowronski as Director and Lee Holmes has returned in an executive management role.</p>
<p>INFINOX&rsquo;s Companies House filings reveal revenues of &pound;3.6m, administrative expenses of &pound;2.4m and overarching profits of &pound;0.9m&nbsp; - a significant improvement on the &pound;5.2m loss from twelve months prior. INFINOX&rsquo;s net assets for the year ended 31st March 2024 have also risen to &pound;2.4m from &pound;1.4m the previous year.</p>
<p>This is the first set of results since the new shareholders assumed management control of the wider INFINOX group earlier this year. Since then, the shareholders have supported the group considerably, including a significant sponsorship deal with BWT Alpine F1 Team and Alpine Endurance Team. The impact of this support is underlined by group-wide Key Performance Indicators, including a 245% increase in actual revenue and 415% rise in net deposits.</p>
<p>With a successful year behind it, INFINOX plans to reinvest significantly in the business over the next 12 months, especially in its technology infrastructure to enhance client service capabilities.</p>
<p><b>Jay Mawji, the CEO of INFINOX Capital (INFINOX) said: </b><i>&ldquo;Our steadfast commitment to doing the simple things very well may seem boring to some &ndash; but we see it as vital to our recipe for success. The strong performance from our FCA business and impressive KPIs for the wider group indicate that our strategy is working and with the investment and resources from the new shareholders we are well positioned to achieve our ambitions&rdquo;</i></p>

<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced that October 2024 marked its highest volume month in its history with a record 209 million contracts traded across futures and options.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The extent of trading activity during October highlights the depth, breadth and liquidity of the global exchange network we have built over the last two decades and the unique role that benchmarks such as Brent and Euribor play in underpinning the management of risk across markets,&rdquo; said Trabue Bland, SVP of Futures Markets at ICE. &ldquo;Against a backdrop of risk and uncertainty across multiple fronts geographically, customers are utilizing the combination of the liquidity and precision of our global benchmarks and related contracts to manage risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition, October marked the highest volume month for commodity and energy trading at ICE with a record 117 million and 108 million futures and options contracts traded respectively, as well as the highest volume month ever for interest rate trading at ICE with 85 million futures and options traded.</p>
<p>ICE&rsquo;s highest volume month on record prior to this was March 2020.</p>
<p>During October, ICE&rsquo;s global benchmark Brent, the largest and most liquid oil market in the world used to price three quarters of internationally traded crude oil, witnessed its largest volume month in its history with a record 38.2 million Brent futures and options traded. While Euribor, the benchmark for managing short term euro-related interest rate risk, similarly had its highest volume month ever with a record 50.5 million futures and options traded.</p>

<title>DataLend: October 2024 Securities Lending Revenue Up 9% YoY To $818 Million - Rate Cut And Election Posturing Boosts U.S. Debt Revenue</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p dir="ltr"><span>The global securities finance industry generated $818 million in revenue for lenders in October 2024, according to DataLend, the market data service of fintech EquiLend. The figure represents a 9% increase from the $751 million generated in October 2023.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Global broker-to-broker activity, where broker-dealers lend and borrow securities from each other, totaled an additional $202 million in revenue in October, down 7% year-over-year.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Equity revenue increased globally by a margin of 3% due to a 6% increase in global balances relative to 2023. Despite a lack of deal names or standout &ldquo;Specials,&rdquo; revenue in the U.S. rose 7%, with the healthcare and industrial sectors being the biggest contributors. Equity revenue in EMEA ticked up by 2% as a 13% increase in balances offset a 9% decline in fees year-over-year. In Asia-Pacific, equity revenue was roughly flat.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>As the market has adjusted for the introduction of the rate-cutting cycle in the U.S., government debt was the standout asset class in October. Global revenue generated by government bonds increased 39% year-over-year largely due to a 22% increase in balances. With the U.S. presidential election looming, lending revenue for U.S.-issued sovereign debt was up a massive 59% as both fees and balances climbed relative to 2023.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Corporate debt lending saw moderate annual gains, with revenue increasing 2% globally. Fees for corporate bonds fell 20% year-over-year, but revenue increased due to a 24% jump in balances.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The top five earning securities in October were the United States Treasury bond</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>4.125% 15/08/44&nbsp;</span><span>(US912810UD80),&nbsp;</span><span>Tempus AI Inc. (TEM US),&nbsp;</span><span>Cassava Sciences Inc. (SAVA US), iShares iBoxx $ Inv Grade Corporate Bond ETF (LQD US)&nbsp;</span><span>and Spirit Airlines Inc.</span><span>&nbsp;(SAVE US)</span><span>. The five securities in total generated $54 million in revenue for the month.</span></p>

<title>MarketAxess Announces Trading Volume Statistics For October - Second Consecutive Month Of Record Total Trading ADV On Continued Strong Market Volumes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span class="bw-dateline-wrapper">&nbsp;</span>MarketAxess Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: MKTX), the operator of a leading electronic trading platform for fixed-income securities, today announced trading volume and preliminary variable transaction fees per million (&ldquo;FPM&rdquo;) for October 2024.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><b>Chris Concannon, CEO of MarketAxess, commented:</b></p>
<p>&ldquo;We delivered the&nbsp;<b>second straight month of record total trading ADV in October</b>&nbsp;, driven by continued robust market volumes and strength in our international businesses. Our rates business also generated&nbsp;<b>record</b>&nbsp;ADV in October, surpassing the previous monthly record set during a period of extreme market volatility in March 2020.</p>
<p>While we are disappointed with the absolute level of market share in U.S. high-grade in October, we were pleased to see&nbsp;<b>record</b>&nbsp;trading volumes, an increase in U.S. high-yield estimated market share compared to September and an increase in our preliminary total credit fee capture during the month. Most importantly, our preliminary total credit variable commission revenue in October was slightly above September levels. We believe the decline in our high-grade market share was driven by lower portfolio trading and a client shift to large block trading in the market. Large portfolio trades in the market and the mix of activity across U.S. high-grade TRACE can generate significant swings in market share without materially impacting revenue generation.</p>
<p>We are continuing the roll-out of X-Pro to our global client base and we now have our block solution in the market, which we believe will be integral to the success of our &ldquo;high-touch&rdquo; strategy.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>General Notes Regarding the Data Presented</b></p>
<p>Reported MarketAxess volume in all product categories includes only fully electronic trading volume. MarketAxess trading volumes and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&ldquo;FINRA&rdquo;) Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (&ldquo;TRACE&rdquo;) reported volumes are available on the Company&rsquo;s website at&nbsp;<a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.marketaxess.com%2Fvolume&amp;esheet=54147142&amp;newsitemid=20241104063311&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=investor.marketaxess.com%2Fvolume&amp;index=1&amp;md5=9dbb977b0eb3a45433ef4b77767134f3" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">investor.marketaxess.com/volume</a>.</p>
<p>For periods beginning with January 2024, the Company has made changes to the market volume data used to calculate estimated market share for Municipal and U.S. Government Bonds. For Municipal Bonds, the Company previously used estimates, derived from data issued by the Municipal Securities Rule Making Board (&ldquo;MSRB&rdquo;), including estimates for new issuance, commercial paper and variable-rate trading activity, and excluded these volumes from the estimated market volume data. While the Company still uses estimates, the new methodology for identifying and excluding these volumes from the market volume data is now based on MSRB &ldquo;flags&rdquo; to identify new issuance, commercial paper, and variable-rate volumes. For U.S. Government Bonds, the previous data source for estimated market volumes was the Federal Reserve Bank&rsquo;s Reported Primary Dealer U.S. Treasury Bond Trading Volumes, which was reported on a one-week lag. The new source for U.S. Government Bond trading volumes is FINRA&rsquo;s U.S. Treasury TRACE data. The Company believes that the refined methodology used for Municipal Bonds, and the new data source for U.S. Government Bonds, provides more accurate measures of estimated market volumes and estimated market share. Prior comparable periods have been recast retrospectively for both Municipal and U.S. Government Bonds to conform to the updated presentation of the data. The new estimated market volume data is also available on the Company&rsquo;s website at&nbsp;<a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.marketaxess.com%2Fvolume&amp;esheet=54147142&amp;newsitemid=20241104063311&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=investor.marketaxess.com%2Fvolume&amp;index=2&amp;md5=e63d8bac3be3d1d28657bda429079b88" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">investor.marketaxess.com/volume</a>.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Enhances Access To Market Data And Investment Research To Support Growth</title>

<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has set out a package of measures to reinforce the UK&rsquo;s leading position in the bond, derivatives and asset management sectors, supporting growth.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>New transparency rules for bonds and derivatives markets will give investors more information and reduce costs for firms. And under new proposals, asset managers for pooled investment funds will be given greater flexibility in how they pay for investment research, making it easier to buy insight and analysis across borders.</p>
<p>This is part of the FCA&rsquo;s ongoing work strengthening wholesale markets, while ensuring investors have access to the right information to make decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jon Relleen, director of supervision, policy and competition at the FCA, said: 'We want UK markets to be efficient and to support economic growth. Putting more information in the hands of investors and giving investment firms greater access to research to inform their strategies will bolster UK markets.</p>
<p>&rsquo;We want to seize opportunities to enhance and streamline our rules and support the competitiveness of sectors in which the UK is already a recognised world leader.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>Bond and derivatives trade information</h2>
<p>The UK is the world leader in bond and derivatives markets. The FCA aims to cement that position by ensuring investors have access to better, quicker and clearer data at a fair price, which helps these markets work efficiently: &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Greater transparency, in terms of timeliness and content of the information published to the market. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Lower compliance costs for trading venues and investment firms by simplifying the regime.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Higher quality post-trade data, which will support the creation of a consolidated tape for bonds in the UK. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h2>New payment options for investment research</h2>
<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/ps24-9-payment-for-optionality-investment-research" title="PS24/9: Payment optionality for investment research">July 2024</a>, the FCA finalised rules allowing institutional investors more flexibility in paying for investment research. Following feedback from industry, the FCA proposes to extend those freedoms to pooled investment funds and allow fund managers to combine payments for research with trade execution, subject to certain guardrails. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<ol>
<li>The new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/ps24-14-improving-transparency-bond-and-derivatives-markets" title="PS24/14: Improving transparency for bond and derivatives markets">bond and derivatives transparency rules</a>&nbsp;will not come into force until 1 December 2025. &nbsp;</li>
<li>The FCA is also establishing a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/markets/data-reporting-services-providers/bond-consolidated-tape" title="Bond consolidated tape">bond consolidated tape</a>, to ensure that data is not only of higher quality and available on a more timely basis, but it is also accessible in a cost-effective way. &nbsp;</li>
<li>The FCA recently set out&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/ps24-9-payment-for-optionality-investment-research" title="PS24/9: Payment optionality for investment research">rules</a>&nbsp;giving institutional investors greater flexibility in how they pay for research. The FCA is now&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/consultation-papers/cp24-21-investment-research-payment-optionality-fund-managers" title="CP24/21: Investment research payment optionality for fund managers">proposing</a>&nbsp;to extend this flexibility to asset managers of alternative investment funds and undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS).</li>

<title>HKEXTto Digitalise ETP Servicing Capabilities With Online Platform</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="spanHeading"><span>Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) is pleased to announce today (</span><span>Tuesday</span><span>) plans to digitise and automate the in-kind creation and redemption process for relevant exchange-traded products (ETP) in 2025 through the adoption of a web-based platform,&nbsp;</span><span>subject to technical readiness and regulatory approval.</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading">This platform will be integrated into the ETP creation and redemption process, connecting key ETP participants with the use of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and smart contracts, and will help increase overall ETP market efficiency, supporting the continued growth of secondary market activity for ETPs.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">HKEX&rsquo;s Head of Exchange Traded Products, Jean-Francois Mesnard-Sense, said: &ldquo;Speed and efficiency are critical in an increasingly dynamic market environment. With ETP being one of our fastest-growing products, HKEX is pleased to introduce this new digital enhancement. It will not only streamline operations for our market participants, but also drive more liquidity in the product ecosystem, supporting the vibrancy of our ETP marketplace and strengthening Hong Kong&rsquo;s role as an international financial centre.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="spanHeading">This latest enhancement is part of the Group&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to further elevate the attractiveness and competitiveness of its international ETP ecosystem, replacing several manual, paper-based processes currently present with a goal to simplify the creation and redemption procedures of ETPs and boost market activity.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">HKEX has continued to support the development of the ETP market in recent years with measures including the introduction of the ICSD ETF settlement model in Hong Kong in 2019, the implementation of a new spread table and a new continuous quoting market-making regime in 2020, as well as the inclusion of ETFs in Stock Connect in 2022.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">Since 2020, HKEX&rsquo;s ETP business has grown 29 per cent a year, with average daily turnover reaching HK$17.9 billion in the first ten months of 2024, above the full-year ADT trading record set in 2023. As at the end of October 2024, there were 194 HKEX-listed ETPs and 26 issuers participating in Hong Kong&rsquo;s ETP market.</p>

<title>ISDA Wins Regulation Asia’s Industry Association Of The Year And Best Regulatory Reporting Solution Awards</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-wins-regulation-asias-industry-association-of-the-year-and-best-regulatory/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-wins-regulation-asias-industry-association-of-the-year-and-best-regulatory/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ISDA has been named Industry Association of the Year for the second year running by Regulation Asia at its seventh annual Awards for Excellence. The association also won Best Regulatory Reporting Solution for its Digital Regulatory Reporting (DRR) initiative.</p>
<p>The Industry Association of the Year award recognizes trade groups that have shown outstanding leadership in supporting regulatory reform, addressing compliance challenges and promoting financial stability, including through the development of industry standards and best practices.</p>
<p>The panel of judges highlighted several ISDA initiatives to respond to market and regulatory developments and improve industry efficiency, including the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/06/27/isda-publishes-framework-to-prepare-for-close-out-of-derivatives-contracts/">launch of the ISDA Close-out Framework</a>&nbsp;to help firms prepare for potential terminations of collateralized derivatives contracts and continued regulatory engagement in China and India, including the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/03/04/isda-publishes-whitepaper-charting-the-next-phase-of-indias-otc-derivatives-market/">publication of a paper</a>&nbsp;that makes a series of market and policy recommendations to encourage the further development of India&rsquo;s derivatives market. The judges also pointed to efforts to support banks in their implementation of Basel III and development of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/02/12/climate-scenario-analysis-in-the-trading-book-phase-ii/">climate scenario analysis for the trading book</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;ISDA&rsquo;s continued leadership and regulatory advocacy, along with its commitment to creating innovative industry solutions to regulatory challenges, set a new benchmark for industry associations. Its focus on global regulatory alignment and standardization and its educational and professional development programs have been truly beneficial to the market,&rdquo; said one judge on the Regulation Asia Awards panel.</p>
<p>ISDA also won the Best Regulatory Reporting Solution award for the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/isda-solutions-infohub/isda-digital-regulatory-reporting/">DRR</a>, which uses the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/isda-solutions-infohub/cdm/">Common Domain Model (CDM)</a>&nbsp;&ndash; an open-source data standard for financial products, trades and lifecycle events &ndash; to transform industry-agreed interpretations of regulatory reporting rules into machine-executable code. ISDA has extended the DRR to five additional jurisdictions this year, including Australia, Japan and Singapore, bringing lower costs and greater accuracy to the reporting process. In total,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/07/08/isdas-commitment-on-data-reporting/">ISDA has pledged to support 11 reporting rule sets</a>&nbsp;in nine major jurisdictions and to maintain the DRR as those rules evolve in future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;ISDA&rsquo;s solution stands out for its forward-thinking design and ability to reduce the time, resources and cost needed to implement regulatory reporting requirements. Through automation and a commitment to high data standards, ISDA sets a new benchmark in regulatory compliance,&rdquo; said a judge on the Regulation Asia Awards panel.</p>
<p>In addition to these two awards, ISDA was also named Industry Association of the Year for the second consecutive year in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/09/27/isda-wins-globalcapitals-industry-association-of-the-year-award-2024/">GlobalCapital Global Derivatives Awards 2024</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re really pleased that Regulation Asia has recognized ISDA&rsquo;s work to make derivatives markets safer and more efficient with two awards. Over the past year, we&rsquo;ve continued to focus on developing solutions to shared industry problems to increase efficiency and reduce risks and costs. ISDA&rsquo;s DRR is one example, which will reduce implementation and maintenance costs and improve accuracy in reporting, so we&rsquo;re very proud that this initiative has been recognized,&rdquo; said Scott O&rsquo;Malia, ISDA Chief Executive.</p>

<p>Project Guardian is an international collaboration of industry and regulators, led by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, that explores the use of fund and asset tokenisation.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>We welcome the first industry-led Project Guardian report on tokenisation in the asset management sector, delivered through Project Guardian&rsquo;s asset and wealth management workstream.</p>

<p>In the report, firms set out an ambitious, phased vision for the use of distributed ledger technology (DLT) in asset management.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The report also discusses potential industry and regulatory standards needed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>scale tokenisation use-cases</li>
<li>enable firms and investors to benefit from the technology</li>
</ul>
<p>We will continue working with Project Guardian members and the sector to support the development and adoption of asset tokenisation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2025, we are going to collaborate with the Monetary Authority Singapore (MAS) to explore the regulatory considerations for tokenisation within the asset and wealth management sector. Our review will consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>regulatory and supervisory principles that could apply to tokenisation use-cases to support consumers and the integrity of our markets</li>
<li>any potential regulatory barriers to continuing maturity of tokenisation concepts</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our work in Project Guardian</h2>
<p>We are a member of Project Guardian&rsquo;s policymaker group and are taking part in the asset and wealth management workstream.</p>
<p>Throughout 2024, the MAS, FCA and broader Guardian policymaker group have worked with Singapore, UK and international firms within the Guardian membership to develop the use-cases explored in this report, including at the Point Zero Forum in Zurich. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA and the Treasury are also observers on the industry-led Technology Working Group of the government&rsquo;s Asset Management Taskforce that is considering the implementation of fund tokenisation in the UK. &nbsp;</p>

<title>Hedge Funds’ Holdings Will be Classified as Free Float in Tel Aviv Stock Exchange-Listed Companies</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/hedge-funds-holdings-will-be-classified-as-free-float-in-tel-aviv-stock-exchang/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/hedge-funds-holdings-will-be-classified-as-free-float-in-tel-aviv-stock-exchang/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE:&nbsp;<strong>TASE</strong>) published for public comments a proposal to recognize hedge fund holdings as part of companies' free float calculations, aligning with international market practices.</p>
<p>As part of the amendment, the holdings of a hedge fund which holds up to 15% of the share capital in a company and have no right to appoint a director or a representative in the company's board, will be recognized as free float holdings. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As of today, TASE guidelines&rsquo; does not recognize the holdings of hedge funds as free float holdings. Consequently, hedge fund that holds 5% or more of a company's share capital is considered an interested party, what could adversely affect the company and therefore prevented the hedge funds, in some cases from increasing their investments in the companies they believed in.</p>
<p>A hedge fund that would like its holdings to be classified as free float holdings is required to declare, by December 1 of each year, that it complies with the definition of a hedge fund, as prescribed in the Regulations&nbsp;promulgated under the&nbsp;Joint Investments&nbsp;in&nbsp;Trust Law, and manages the funds of 20 investors minimum.</p>
<p>The hedge funds, similar to institutional investors, manage monies on behalf of others and significantly contribute to the capital market. The proposed amendment is a significant step in the development of the Israeli capital market. The recognition of the hedge funds holdings as a free float will further enhance liquidity on the capital market, increase the free float holdings in companies for the purpose of inclusion in TASE indices, and enable the hedge funds to act more efficiently in the capital market.</p>

<title>New At The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange - Block Trade Facility TASE Launches Protected Block Trade Facility, Expanding Trading Capabilities This Is Part Of TASE’s Strategy Of Upgrading The Israel Capital Market And Aligning It With Global Standards</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-at-the-tel-aviv-stock-exchange-block-trade-facility-tase-launches-protecte/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-at-the-tel-aviv-stock-exchange-block-trade-facility-tase-launches-protecte/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>The Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange</strong>&nbsp;(TASE:&nbsp;<strong>TASE</strong>) announced the launch of a new trading platform that facilitates the pre-arranged and protected execution of large-scale transactions on TASE, commenced November 3, 2024, having been approved by the Israel Securities Authority.</p>
<p>The system, which uses a block order, will enable the execution of pre-arranged transactions on TASE in a manner that precludes a price impact and the leak of the information to other parties that could potentially interfere with their execution. By offering investors additional tools, TASE realizes its strategy of standing on par with leading international exchanges that employ various mechanisms for the execution of protected large-scale transactions in securities.</p>
<p>At present, pre-arranged transactions can be executed in one of two ways: on TASE, in any of the securities traded thereon - a pre-arranged transaction that is susceptible to third-party interference, or as an off-exchange transactions (excluding derivatives) that is unsusceptible to third-party interference.</p>
<p><strong>When executing a matching transaction&nbsp;</strong>(on-exchange) - customers can coordinate on a bilateral basis the execution of a transaction on TASE and submit buy and sell orders through the order book. Matching orders executed constitute a matching transaction. TASE&rsquo;s existing trading method, which grants preference based on price and timing, provides no assurance of the transaction being performed with the counterparty. The matching orders are not interference-proof and could be matched with the order of a third party.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>In an off-exchange transaction -&nbsp;</strong>customers can coordinate a transaction on a bilateral basis and report the transaction to the TASE Clearing House, through the TASE members, as an off-exchange transaction in securities, excluding derivatives.</p>
<p><strong>About the Block Trade Facility</strong></p>
<p>As part of its ongoing efforts to upgrade the capital market and in response to the interest expressed by multiple market participants in&nbsp;<strong>protected pre-arranged&nbsp;</strong>transactions, TASE has developed a platform that enables, for the first time, the execution of such transactions, also on TASE. The BTF (Block Trade Facility) system, which uses a new&nbsp;<strong>Block</strong>&nbsp;order, has several characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Protection -&nbsp;</strong>The transaction will be bilaterally coordinated between the counterparties and will be conducted between them without interference.</li>
<li><strong>Minimum order size -&nbsp;</strong>A liquid and deep order book is a top priority for TASE, and therefore a minimum order size is prescribed. The proposed minimum size is designed to ensure that only large-scale orders are submitted in the block facility, which would allow institutional to submit a large order without interference.</li>
<li><strong>Reference price -&nbsp;</strong>This parameter is based on market data, whereas the&nbsp;<strong>BTF Order Price Collar</strong>&nbsp;is determined as a percentage, effectively restricting selling and buying orders to its range. TASE believes that it is necessary to set a reference price and&nbsp;<strong>Price Collar</strong>&nbsp;for block trades to prevent their prices from drastically deviate from the current prices in the order book.&nbsp;<strong>For derivatives -&nbsp;</strong>TASE believes that, in line with global practices, it is not feasible to set a reference price and price collar for derivatives, as their prices are prone to significant fluctuations during the trading day, and since pre-arrange transactions in derivatives are already available, which do not include a reference price mechanism (in practice, these are non-protected block trades).</li>
<li><strong>Hidden -&nbsp;</strong>The order will not be presented in the order book.</li>
<li><strong>Dissemination -&nbsp;</strong>The transaction will be&nbsp;<strong>disseminated&nbsp;</strong>on TASE&rsquo;s IT systems immediately upon its execution.</li>
</ul>
<p>The block trade facility offers multiple advantages for the execution of protected pre-arranged orders in all possible aspects, starting from&nbsp;<strong>no execution risk</strong>, eliminating the operational risk that arises from unprotected orders and exposes the parties to a partial execution of the transaction, through to&nbsp;<strong>regulatory advantages,&nbsp;</strong>as it eliminates the need for approval by the public institution&rsquo;s extraordinary transactions committee, which is often required for off-exchange transactions.&nbsp; The design of the block trade facility is intended to provide the institutional investors significant regulatory advantages over off-exchange transactions.&nbsp;<strong>In addition, the block trade facility</strong>&nbsp;<strong>reduces the credit risk involved in the execution</strong>&nbsp;of off-exchange transactions and enhances&nbsp;<strong>transparency</strong>, as the transactions are immediately published.</p>
<p>The TASE Staff&rsquo;s discussions with the market participants suggest further added values for the local capital market -</p>
<p><strong>The price of non-protection -</strong>&nbsp;In the absence of a protected block trade facility, brokers are required to price the risk by increasing the spreads, which raises the end-customer&rsquo;s acquisition costs.</p>
<p><strong>Competition -</strong>&nbsp;The substantial risk involved in a matching transaction means that non-bank TASE members are unable to handle the exposure involved in a guaranteed price, which is required by foreign customers. This undermines their competitive standing with foreign customers and forces them to conduct such transactions off-exchange or to avoid them altogether.</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility with generally accepted global practices</strong></p>
<p>Many global exchanges address their customers&rsquo; need to execute large-scale transactions, while preventing price impact and information leaks. The leading exchanges have developed various mechanisms for conducting large-scale transactions in shares and/or derivatives that provide such protection to the customers.</p>
<p>For instance, certain European exchanges define a minimum order size for RFQ or block platforms. The regulator in Europe has defined a LIS (Large in Scale) parameter that distinguishes between large-scale transactions and &ldquo;standard&rdquo; transactions, at the individual security level. The establishment of this parameter was motivated by the exemption of large-scale transactions from pre-trade transparency and their often-delayed publication.</p>
<p>A position paper drawn up by the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, which quotes applicable academic studies, suggests that&nbsp;<strong>block&nbsp;</strong>trades (upstairs markets) do not undermine the trading in the order book (downstairs market), but rather complement it. Trading data collected from various exchanges, such as Euronext, Toronto, ASX and NYSE, support a similar conclusion. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Block trade platforms are currently available in leading international exchanges&nbsp;- both for shares, such as in Euronext, the SIX in Switzerland, and Nasdaq Nordic, and for derivatives, such as the derivatives&rsquo; exchanges in the United States (CME), Australia (ASX) and Canada (TMX).</p>

<title>ISDA derivatiViews: A Clear Plan For Voluntary Carbon Trading</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-derivativiews-a-clear-plan-for-voluntary-carbon-trading/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-derivativiews-a-clear-plan-for-voluntary-carbon-trading/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As world leaders head to Azerbaijan for COP29 next week, they must confront the urgent task of keeping the Paris Agreement objectives on track and accelerating the reduction of carbon emissions. This is an unprecedented global challenge, and governments cannot do it on their own &ndash; they need to leverage global capital markets to raise the funding that is needed. The voluntary carbon market could play a big role, but this requires robust and consistent standards. It will also involve the public and private sectors working together, and we&rsquo;ve identified five key areas where that work should start.</p>
<p>First, we need a globally consistent definition of a ton of carbon that is adopted by all market participants and aligned with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which sets out how countries can cooperate to reach their climate targets. Linked to this is the need for a robust, independent system that uses scientific evidence to verify and audit the integrity of voluntary carbon credits (VCCs). These are non-negotiable prerequisites for an effective carbon market &ndash; there can be no shortcuts if the market is to work effectively.</p>
<p>Second, a sound legal framework is critical to create greater certainty and confidence in the trading of these products. ISDA has explored the key legal issues relating to VCCs in several jurisdictions and we set out&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2021/12/01/legal-implications-of-voluntary-carbon-credits">steps to create greater legal certainty in a series of whitepapers</a>. We&rsquo;ve also developed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/book/2022-isda-verified-carbon-credit-transaction-definitions/">standard documentation, which we published in late 2022</a>, creating a single contractual framework that can be used for any carbon standard or registry.</p>
<p>Third, greater clarity is needed on the accounting treatment for VCCs. At present, there are no specific provisions relating to carbon credits under US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or International Financial Reporting Standards.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2023/10/19/accounting-for-carbon-credits/">ISDA has explored the key accounting issues for this market</a>, and we continue to advocate for an aligned approach that would allow consistent treatment of VCCs.</p>
<p>Fourth, the development of a liquid forward market would send valuable price signals to buy- and sell-side firms, enabling them to gauge supply and demand and manage their risk. A vibrant secondary market will help to secure long-term investment in carbon removal technologies and nature-based solutions, while also facilitating greater pricing transparency.</p>
<p>Finally, the development of a global regulatory framework must be an urgent area of focus. There is no need to reinvent the wheel &ndash; policymakers should be mindful of existing rules for trading in the secondary market, which are sufficiently robust and fit for purpose. We must also be ready for the big policy measures that lie ahead, such as the EU&rsquo;s Carbon Adjustment Mechanism, which will introduce a levy for carbon emitted during the production of certain goods imported into the EU. This will be a transformational change, putting carbon pricing right at the center of global trade policy.</p>
<p>As COP29 unfolds, ISDA&rsquo;s five recommendations offer a pathway to a vibrant, efficient voluntary carbon market. By placing a high premium on integrity and transparency, this market can play a key role in the transition to net zero. I was pleased to present our recommendations at a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/09/27/iosco-sustainable-finance-task-force-scott-omalia-remarks/">recent meeting of the Sustainable Finance Task Force of the International Organization of Securities Commissions</a>, and we will continue to work with policymakers and market participants to take them forward.</p>
<p><span>Read the speech:&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/09/27/iosco-sustainable-finance-task-force-scott-omalia-remarks/"><span><em>Act Now: The Need for Public-Private Sector Collaboration on Climate Risk and Carbon Markets</em></span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<title>ICE Mortgage Monitor: Record Levels Of Tappable Equity, Fed Rate Cuts Could Spur Resurgence In Home Equity Withdrawals</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="bw-subheadline-wrapper">
<ul>
<li>As of the end of Q3 2024, U.S. mortgage holders held $17.2T in equity, of which $11.2T is &lsquo;tappable,&rsquo; meaning it can be borrowed against with the homeowner maintaining a 20% equity stake in their home</li>
<li>The average homeowner with a mortgage now has $319K of equity in their home, of which $207K is tappable</li>
<li>Though Q3 withdrawals hit a two-year high &ndash; both collectively and individually among second lien products ($27B) and cash-out refinances ($21B) &ndash; the total represented just 0.42% of available tappable equity</li>
<li>Borrowers have been withdrawing equity at less than half the 10-year average 0.92% extraction rate, with second lien products 26% below typical levels and cash-outs 69% below the norm</li>
<li>The past 10 quarters have seen half the equity extraction to be expected in a &lsquo;normal&rsquo; market, meaning $476B has gone untapped and not flowed back through the broader economy</li>
<li>In recent quarters, introductory rates on HELOCs have topped 9.5%, more than doubling the $167 March 2022 monthly interest-only payment needed for a $50K withdrawal to a high of $413 in January 2024</li>
<li>Recent Federal Reserve cuts to short-term interest rates &ndash; more directly tied to HELOC than 30-year mortgage offerings &ndash; have already made equity withdrawals modestly more affordable and attractive</li>
<li>If both market expectations for an additional ~1.5 pp in additional Fed cuts and current spreads hold true, we could see HELOC rate offerings in the low 7% range by the end of 2025</li>
<li>That would drop the monthly payment needed to withdraw $50K in equity back down below $300; still notably higher than the historical average, but more than 25% below recent highs</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today released its November 2024&nbsp;<a href="https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com/resources/data-reports" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">ICE Mortgage Monitor Report</a>, based on the company&rsquo;s robust mortgage, real estate and public records data sets.</p>
<p>This month&rsquo;s Mortgage Monitor dives deep into ICE&rsquo;s latest Q3 2024 homeowner equity data, reporting on both quarterly and annual growth in mortgage holders&rsquo; housing wealth. Though 30-year interest rates remain volatile, recent and anticipated short-term rate cuts by the Federal Reserve have the potential to positively impact equity-based lending. As Andy Walden, ICE Vice President of Research and Analysis explains, though the cost to borrow against a homeowner&rsquo;s equity is notably higher than prior to the Fed&rsquo;s most recent tightening cycle, this dynamic is poised to change in the year ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While growth in total mortgage holder equity is slowing along with home prices, Q3&rsquo;s $17.2T, up 5% from last year, represents another seasonally adjusted record high,&rdquo; said Walden. &ldquo;Of that total, $11.2T is available to homeowners with mortgages to borrow against while maintaining a 20% equity stake in their homes. On average, that works out to roughly $207K in tappable equity per homeowner. And we did see a bump in equity withdrawals in Q3, with cash-out refi extractions rising on what had been downwardly trending 30-year rates and second-lien home equity products getting a boost from rate cuts late in the quarter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In total, U.S. mortgage holders withdrew $48B of home equity in the third quarter. This was the largest such equity withdrawal volume in the two years since the Federal reserve first initiated their latest tightening cycle. Both the $27B equity withdrawn via second lien products and the $21B withdrawn via cash-out refinances also marked their own individual two-year highs in Q3. Still, homeowners remain historically reluctant to borrow against their home equity. Just 0.42% of available tappable equity was withdrawn in Q3 2024, well below the 0.92% average extraction rate in the decade preceding the latest round of Fed increases.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Despite a two-year high for equity withdrawals in the third quarter, homeowners are still tapping their housing wealth at less than half the rate they have historically,&rdquo; Walden added. &ldquo;Second lien withdrawal rates are currently running more than a quarter below &lsquo;normal&rsquo; and cash-out refi withdrawals are still down almost 70%. Over the past 10 quarters homeowners have extracted $476B in equity, exactly half the extraction we&rsquo;d expect to see under more normal circumstances. That equates to nearly a half a trillion untapped dollars that hasn&rsquo;t flowed back through the broader economy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elevated interest rates have been a deterrent to homeowner equity utilization in recent quarters, as 30-year mortgage rates climbed at times into the high 7% range, curtailing cash-out refinance activity, and the average introductory rate on second lien home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) rose above 9.5%. However, the Federal Reserve recently began to cut short term interest rates, to which HELOC rates are closely pegged, with additional cuts expected on the horizon. As Walden points out, this could make equity withdrawals both more affordable and more attractive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since the Fed began its latest cycle of rate hikes, the monthly payment needed to withdraw $50K via a HELOC more than doubled, from as low as $167 per month back in March 2022 to $413 in January of this year,&rdquo; Walden said. &ldquo;The market&rsquo;s currently pricing in another 1.5 percentage points of cuts through the end of next year. If that comes to fruition, and current spreads hold, it&rsquo;ll have positive implications for both new equity lending as well as for consumers with existing HELOCs, with the payment on a $50K withdrawal falling back down below $300 per month. While still notably above the 20-year average of $210, that represents a more than 25% reduction from recent highs. Given borrowers&rsquo; recent sensitivity to even slight rate drops, this could serve to entice additional HELOC utilization, especially with mortgage holders sitting on record stockpiles of equity and locked into their current homes via low first lien rates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Based on the latest ICE Mortgage Futures as well as industry consensus forecasts, mortgage rates are not expected to see the full 1.5pp projected Fed rate decline flow through to 30-year offerings, which could tighten the spread between 30-year mortgage and HELOC rates and tip the needle toward equity utilization via HELOCs for a subset of mortgage holders.</p>

<title>SET Launches New Financial Statement Analysis Tool To Boost Investor Insights</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li>The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) introduces a new five-dimension financial analysis feature to provide investors with comprehensive perspectives on listed companies' sales, net profits, cash cycle, asset quality, and debt-servicing ability. <b>&nbsp;</b></li>
<li>The new feature goes live today on SET website at <a href="http://www.set.or.th/"><b>www.set.or.th</b></a> to strengthen long-term, quality and insightful investment decisions.<b></b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>SET Executive Vice President Rungtip Charoenvisuthiwong </b>highlighted that SET remains focused on enhancing investor knowledge and promoting fundamental-based investment decisions. This new tool offers insights into crucial indicators of listed companies&rsquo; financial health across five key dimensions: sales quality, net profit quality, cash cycle, asset quality, and debt-servicing ability.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amid today's heightened market competition and evolving business complexities, profit growth indicators alone cannot provide adequate assessment for investors. Analytical tools that offer multi-dimensional perspectives and signal key financial flags on corporate performance are therefore essential for investment decisions. The new financial statement analysis tool consolidates interrelated metrics from the statement of financial position, the statement of comprehensive income, the statement of cash flows, and financial ratios into a single interface for easier analysis and interpretation. While the tool features built-in analytical guidelines, investors are encouraged to also consider industry-specific factors in their decision-making,&rdquo; SET Executive Vice President said.</p>
<p>In collaboration with expert partners under the Industry Analysis Reports by Business Sector Initiative, SET has provided sector-specific analysis reports on SET-listed and mai-listed companies, available at https://www.settrade.com/th/research/businessanalysis. This ongoing effort aims to provide listed companies and investors with useful information for enhanced investment analysis and decision-making capabilities, contributing to the sustainable development of Thailand&rsquo;s capital market.</p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US"><span>Finbridge Global is a global platform that enables financial institutions and investors to search, compare, and assess fintech companies from across the world at the product level, reducing the due diligence process. The collaboration will see Finbridge Global introduce the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) to verify the identity of listed fintech providers on the platform, promoting increased transparency, security, and accountability. In addition, Finbridge Global will provide and manage LEIs for fintechs on its platform through its partnership with LEI Worldwide.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US"><span>An LEI is a unique ISO-standardized 20-character code assigned to a legal entity. Each LEI links to a verified company identity record held in the Global LEI Index, an open, globally recognized data bank that is free for all to access. This enables anyone to verify that an organization is indeed who it claims to be. To date, over 2.7 million LEIs have been issued globally.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US"><span>Use of the LEI will deliver benefits for all participants across the rapidly-scaling Finbridge Global ecosystem. Fintech providers benefit from a globally recognized and trusted verified identity to demonstrate their commitment to transparency and enhance their credibility, enabling them to connect to the wider marketplace more quickly and efficiently.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US"><span>For financial institutions and investors, the LEI streamlines due diligence and procurement processes by enabling the unambiguous digital identification of potential fintech partners or prospects. LEI data can also be used to map corporate structures and relationships, enabling better understanding of the interconnections between legal entities, allowing the broader risks posed by organizations operating internationally to be more accurately assessed.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US"><span>Alexandre Kech, CEO, GLEIF, comments: "While the dynamism of the global fintech sector is helping to transform the delivery of financial services, many potential partnerships are inhibited as financial institutions and investors lack the information needed to meet stringent due diligence requirements. Integrating the LEI into the Finbridge Global platform addresses this challenge by setting a new standard of trust that accelerates and enhances KYC and KYB processes&mdash;promoting faster onboarding and enabling financial institutions and investors to operate with confidence. This is a catalyst for broader fintech adoption worldwide, ensuring all organizations can seize new opportunities while safeguarding their reputations and credibility."</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US"><span>Barbara Gottardi, CEO and founder, Finbridge Global, comments: "We're excited to collaborate with GLEIF to&nbsp;address the growing challenges of identity verification and fraud in the financial industry and beyond. By embedding LEIs into our platform, we offer financial institutions and investors a frictionless and instant means of verifying that fintech companies are who they say they are, while preserving data privacy and confidentiality. This is a pivotal step toward creating a unified, globally recognized identity management system that speeds up the establishment of new partnerships, while elevating industry standards.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></p>

<title>Securities Commission Malaysia: PLCs Show Progress In Adopting Malaysian Code On Corporate Governance Best Practices  - CG Monitor 2024 Urges Improvements In Board Refreshment, Stakeholder Engagement, And Sustainability Governance</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/securities-commission-malaysia-plcs-show-progress-in-adopting-malaysian-code-on/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/securities-commission-malaysia-plcs-show-progress-in-adopting-malaysian-code-on/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Malaysian public listed companies (PLCs) showed progress in the adoption of the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance (MCCG), according to the Securities Commission Malaysia&rsquo;s (SC) Corporate Governance Monitor (CG Monitor) 2024.</p>
<p>The CG Monitor, released today, measures the adoption of the MCCG best practices, based on Corporate Governance reports issued by PLCs for financial years ending 2022 and 2023. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Encouragingly, 30 out of the 48 best practices recorded adoption levels of above 90%, highlighting the commitment of many PLCs to sound corporate governance.</p>
<p>The 2024 report, however, underscores three critical areas that require further improvement: refreshing board composition, enhancing shareholder participation through physical/hybrid AGMs, and deeper integration of sustainability governance practices.</p>
<p>The SC Chairman Dato&rsquo; Mohammad Faiz Azmi emphasised the importance of corporate governance in driving resilient markets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corporate Governance must evolve to meet new challenges and drive long-term resilience. Companies should align their governance with strategic priorities by integrating sustainability, enhancing stakeholder engagement, and renewing leadership to stay agile.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As Malaysia strives towards a more inclusive and sustainable economy, the SC will continue to support companies in adopting practices that deliver long-term value for both businesses and the wider community,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The report showed that only 18% of PLCs have adopted the nine-year tenure limit for Independent Non-Executive Directors, highlighting the need for more proactive measures in refreshing board composition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The retention of long-serving directors for up to 12 years through the two-tier voting process remains prevalent.</p>
<p>PLCs are encouraged to leverage the resources from the Institute of Corporate Directors Malaysia (ICDM), whose Directors Registry now lists 1,007 board-ready individuals. This offers PLCs a valuable pool of qualified candidates with fresh perspectives, ensuring boards remain dynamic and capable of addressing evolving governance challenges.</p>
<p>The CG Monitor 2024 also found that over 50% of PLCs continued to conduct virtual or hybrid AGMs this year. &nbsp;</p>
<p>However, as announced by the SC in August<a href="file://C:/Users/HLS/Downloads/4%20Nov%202024%20-%20PLCs%20Show%20Progress%20in%20Adopting%20MCCG%20Best%20Practices.pdf#_ftn1"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a>, all PLCs must conduct physical or hybrid general meetings starting 1 March 2025. This shift is expected to enhance shareholder engagement, enabling more meaningful participation and interaction at AGMs.</p>
<p>Notably, sustainability governance has seen a significant uplift, with more than 96% of PLCs now adopting practices that focus on board and management oversight of sustainability issues.</p>
<p>These include clearer communication of sustainability strategies and targets, and ensuring boards remain informed about relevant sustainability developments. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There remain areas for improvement, such as incorporating sustainability into performance evaluations of boards and senior management and appointing a dedicated person to manage sustainability efforts strategically. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The recently launched National Sustainability Reporting Framework (NSRF)<a href="file://C:/Users/HLS/Downloads/4%20Nov%202024%20-%20PLCs%20Show%20Progress%20in%20Adopting%20MCCG%20Best%20Practices.pdf#_ftn2"><sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup></a> will further strengthen these practices, while the PACE initiative will provide resources such as policy guidance and capacity-building programmes to help PLCs meet sustainability reporting requirements effectively.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s CG Monitor also features insights from Professor Mak Yuen Teen on Malaysia&rsquo;s improving corporate governance landscape, as well as from the Institute of Corporate Directors Malaysia on the importance of improving disclosure of board and senior management remuneration. &nbsp;</p>

</ul>
<p><span>Deepening liquidity of tokenised assets through formation of commercial networks</span></p>
<p>2<span> </span>MAS has, under Project Guardian, convened over 40 financial institutions, industry associations and international policymakers<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2024/mas-announces-plans-to-support-commercialisation-of-asset-tokenisation#1">[1]</a></span>&nbsp;across seven jurisdictions to carry out industry trials on the use of asset tokenisation in capital markets. To-date, more than 15 industry trials have been conducted in six currencies across multiple financial products<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2024/mas-announces-plans-to-support-commercialisation-of-asset-tokenisation#2">[2]</a></span>.&nbsp;<br /><br />3<span> </span>As Project Guardian participants commercialise their products and services following successful industry trials, MAS is facilitating commercialisation to take place in a coordinated, networked manner.&nbsp; By connecting a broader set of participants&rsquo; products and services across multiple currencies and assets, greater improvements in capital raising, secondary trading, asset servicing and settlement of tokenised assets may be realised. This will deepen liquidity across primary and secondary markets for tokenised asset transactions. To this end, Citi, HSBC, Schroders, Standard Chartered and UOB have formed the Guardian Wholesale Network industry group, with the intent of establishing a multi-member network to commercialise their respective asset tokenisation trials and scale usage.<br /><br /><span>Developing ecosystem of market infrastructures to facilitate seamless cross border transactions</span><br /><br />4<span> </span>MAS launched the&nbsp;<a class="mas-link" href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2023/mas-partners-financial-industry-to-expand-asset-tokenisation-initiatives" target="_blank"><span class="mas-link__text">Global Layer One (GL1)&nbsp;</span><span class="mas-icon mas-glyphs-external--link">&nbsp;</span></a>initiative in 2023 to foster the development of foundational digital infrastructures<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2024/mas-announces-plans-to-support-commercialisation-of-asset-tokenisation#3">[3]</a></span>, upon which commercial networks could be deployed.&nbsp; Since the launch, a core group of global banks, BNY, Citi, J.P. Morgan, MUFG and Societe Generale-FORGE have been leading efforts to define the business, governance, risk, legal and technology requirements of the GL1 Platform.&nbsp;<br /><br />5<span> </span>To build on this, GL1 is expanding its scope to support the development of an ecosystem of compatible market infrastructures, enabling tokenised assets to be traded seamlessly across borders. Specifically, GL1 will undertake the following additional activities:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Control Principles&nbsp;</span>&ndash; Alignment on governance, risk management controls<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2024/mas-announces-plans-to-support-commercialisation-of-asset-tokenisation#4">[4]</a></span>&nbsp;and settlement arrangement conventions for cross border transactions. This provides clarity on roles, responsibilities and controls needed to safeguard market integrity and financial stability.</li>
<li><span>Specifications</span>&nbsp;&ndash; Development of specifications for market infrastructures and asset lifecycle<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2024/mas-announces-plans-to-support-commercialisation-of-asset-tokenisation#5">[5]</a></span>. This encourages interoperability between diverse systems.</li>
<li><span>Compliance by Design&nbsp;</span>&ndash; Creation and provision of templates including programmable compliance<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2024/mas-announces-plans-to-support-commercialisation-of-asset-tokenisation#6">[6]</a></span>&nbsp;checks to build an ecosystem of compatible service providers. This accelerates onboarding for new participants.</li>
</ul>
<p>6<span> </span>To support these developments, MAS is pleased to announce the addition of new industry participants, including Euroclear and HSBC. GL1 will also set-up a new market infrastructure working group, comprising global financial market infrastructure providers, that will focus on digital asset securities control principles.<br /><br /><span>Industry Frameworks for Implementation of Tokenisation</span><br /><br />7<span> </span>To facilitate broad based acceptance and implementation of tokenised assets by financial institutions, two industry frameworks developed by Project Guardian industry group<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2024/mas-announces-plans-to-support-commercialisation-of-asset-tokenisation#7">[7]</a></span>&nbsp;members were published today.&nbsp;</p>

This provides an industry guide to implementing tokenisation in Debt Capital Markets, strengthen industry capabilities and catalyse adoption of tokenised fixed income solutions.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a class="mas-link" href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/publications/monographs-or-information-paper/2024/guardian-funds-framework" target="_blank"><span class="mas-link__text">Guardian Funds Framework (GFF)</span>&nbsp;<span class="mas-icon mas-glyphs-external--link">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;&ndash; GFF provides a set of recommendations for industry best practices for tokenised funds. This includes the Guardian Composable Token Taxonomy to facilitate development of tokenised investment vehicles comprising multiple assets, simplifying the process of incorporating new tokenised funds, and help achieve efficiencies in fund settlement.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Access to Common Settlement Facility for Tokenised Assets</span><br /><br />8<span> </span>Common settlement assets are instruments which are mutually agreed upon by transacting parties to execute financial transactions. To promote confidence in the settlement of tokenised assets in financial markets, regulated and credible forms of tokenised money are needed as common settlement assets, thereby reducing settlement risk and market fragmentation. MAS is therefore facilitating financial institutions&rsquo; access to common settlement assets including S$ wholesale CBDC for market testing purposes. The initial test network (SGD Testnet) will offer three key features:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Settlement facility</span>&nbsp;&ndash; Issuance, transfer and redemption of S$ wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC), with potential extensions to other forms of central bank and commercial bank liabilities.</li>
<li><span>Programmability&nbsp;</span>&ndash; Automated and conditional triggers for tokenised transactions, including the use of&nbsp;<a class="mas-link" href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/publications/monographs-or-information-paper/2023/purpose-bound-money-whitepaper" target="_blank"><span class="mas-link__text">Purpose Bound Money</span>&nbsp;<span class="mas-icon mas-glyphs-external--link">&nbsp;</span></a>.</li>
<li><span>Interoperability</span>&nbsp;&ndash; Facilitate linkages with existing financial market infrastructures.</li>
</ul>
<p>9<span> </span>The SGD Testnet would be made available to eligible financial institutions<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2024/mas-announces-plans-to-support-commercialisation-of-asset-tokenisation#8">[8]</a></span>&nbsp;in Project Guardian and Project Orchid, enabling financial institutions to settle transactions with S$ wholesale CBDC. The first set of participating financial institutions includes DBS, OCBC, Standard Chartered and UOB. Participating use cases include payments and securities settlement.<br />&nbsp;<br />10<span> </span>Mr Leong Sing Chiong, Deputy Managing Director (Markets and Development) of MAS, &ldquo;MAS has seen strong interest in asset tokenisation in recent years, notably in fixed income, FX, and asset management. We are encouraged by the keen participation from financial institutions and fellow policymakers to co-create industry standards and risk management frameworks to facilitate commercial deployment of tokenised capital markets products, and scale tokenised markets on an industry wide basis.&rdquo;<br /><br /></p>

<title>"Tokenisation In Financial Services: Pathways To Scale" - Opening Keynote Address By Mr Leong Sing Chiong, Deputy Managing Director (Markets &amp; Development), Monetary Authority Of Singapore, At The Layer One Summit On 4 November 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Ladies and Gentlemen, Good Morning.</span><br /><br /><span>Introduction</span><br /><br /><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>It gives me great pleasure to join you at the inaugural Layer One Summit.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>In 2023, at the Singapore FinTech Festival, MAS held up a possible future state of financial services, where financial assets can be transacted seamlessly across multiple trading venues through digital assets, digital money and interoperable digital networks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><span><br />Benefits of tokenisation</span><br /><br /><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>We saw the potential for tokenisation in financial services, where tokenised financial assets, can be exchanged directly on a programmable platform without the need for intermediaries.</span><br /><br /><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>In allowing for the simultaneous exchange of two assets in real-time, and enabling the exchange of information and value to happen in a single step, this can help eliminate settlement risk, duplicative reconciliation, and increase the efficiency of transaction processing.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>5.</span><span> </span><span>With a programmable platform that allows for pre-determined conditions to be encoded with the tokenised asset(s), this can also facilitate greater straight-through processing in capital market transactions, and greater efficiency in asset servicing.&nbsp;</span><br /><span><br />Industry showcase of benefits of asset tokenisation<br />&nbsp;</span><br /><span>6.</span><span> </span><span>We are seeing greater momentum towards tokenisation in financial services. Let me provide some examples of industry pilots which have been progressing well under MAS&rsquo; asset tokenisation initiative, or Project Guardian.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>7.</span><span> </span><span>First, on FX,&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Imagine a scenario where a corporate treasury can initiate and receive payments around the clock (24/7), seamlessly bridging across multiple locations in an increasingly global business landscape. This is precisely what Ant International is striving to achieve through tokenisation to serve their 1.2 billion buyers and 2 million sellers across 200 countries.&nbsp;<br /><br /></li>
<li>Ant International is leveraging tokenised deposits of its partner banks such as HSBC and DBS, for real-time payments, across various currencies.<br /><br /></li>
<li>The beneficiary within Ant International&rsquo;s network can receive its funds in its domiciled currency, for instance US Dollar, in the form of a tokenised deposit.<br /><br /></li>
<li>This is made possible through an FX provider which provides a price quote and liquidity for the currency pair.&nbsp;<br /><br /></li>
<li>The originating currency, for instance Singapore dollar, is then swapped instantaneously through a smart contract to US Dollar. The smart contract also incorporates an automatic anti-money laundering check to meet regulatory compliance requirements.<br /><br /></li>
<li>This illustrates how tokenisation can transform how corporate treasuries manage multi-currency assets while offering the promise of faster, more seamless treasury position management, eliminating delays and significantly enhancing overall operational efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<p>8.<span>&nbsp;</span>For Funds,&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>UBS and Swift, in partnership with Chainlink, are collaborating on an end-to-end payment orchestration capability to automate fund subscription and redemption processes.<br /><br /></li>
<li>This industry trial showcases that tokenisation can automate payment initiation and confirmation processes, provide real-time update on payment status, while riding on existing processes and standards for Fund Distributors and Fund Administrators. This can greatly reduce operational risks and costs.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>9.<span>&nbsp;</span>Bringing both Funds and FX together,&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>&nbsp;</span>A solution developed by Citi and Fidelity International combined the properties of two distinct asset classes -&nbsp; tokenised Money Market Funds (MMFs) and FX swaps.&nbsp;<br /><br /></li>
<li>This solution seamlessly combined yield generation of tokenised MMF tokens with real-time digital currency risk hedging. Today, FX hedging is generally carried out separately from the money market fund investments.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>10.<span> </span>Central banks have also been particularly active in exploring the use and development of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Central bank pilots have ranged from multi-CBDC arrangements, programming compliance for cross-border use cases, and the use of wholesale CBDCs in the settlement of tokenised securities.<br /><br />11.<span> </span>All these efforts point to the fact that interest and investment in asset tokenisation is deepening across asset classes, jurisdictions and currencies.&nbsp;<br /><br />12.<span> </span>However, my sense is that we have reached an inflexion point.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the significant efforts of various players to push the boundaries of tokenisation in financial services, no one has really succeeded in achieving scale.&nbsp; Many promising use cases have not yet gained industry wide traction.&nbsp; Further, there is a need for supporting infrastructure to enable good use cases to scale beyond individual networks.<br /><br /><span>Pathways to scale</span><br /><br />13.<span> </span>For tokenisation to scale and achieve industry wide adoption, we need to see tokenised activity span across assets, across key currencies, across networks, and also to interoperate with existing systems.&nbsp;<br /><br />14.<span> </span>We think there are four jigsaw puzzle pieces that need to come together to support industry-wide deployment of tokenised assets: 1) Liquidity, 2) Foundational Infrastructure 3) Standardised Frameworks and Protocols 4) Common Settlement Assets.<br /><br />15.<span> </span>First, enhancing liquidity.<br /><br />16.<span> </span>When we survey the current digital and tokenisation landscape, we see a real dichotomy. On the one hand, there are good reasons to believe in the potential for leveraging this technology to reap efficiency benefits for wholesale markets. On the other hand, the proliferation of disparate tokenisation efforts has resulted in market fragmentation, and increased funding and opportunity costs. To ensure that tokenisation is viable, we need deeper liquidity across primary and secondary markets.<br /><br />17.<span> </span>To address this, MAS is facilitating industry&rsquo;s efforts to establish commercial networks for payments, capital raising, and secondary trading of tokenised assets.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>An example of this is the formation of the Guardian Wholesale Network Industry Group by Citi, HSBC, Schroders, Standard Chartered and UOB. They are collaborating on the development of a multi-member network to scale their respective asset tokenisation trials.&nbsp;<br /><br /></li>
<li>The involvement of multiple participants, support for multi-asset and multi-currency transactions can engender deeper liquidity across primary and secondary markets for tokenised asset transactions.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>18.<span> </span>We welcome more commercial networks to be set up to drive greater activity in tokenised assets and payments.&nbsp;<br /><br />19.<span> </span>Second, developing foundational digital infrastructure.<br /><br />20.<span> </span>To support the formation of commercial networks, and to enable seamless transactions of tokenised assets across such networks, there is a need for a base layer foundational digital infrastructure that can meet the needs of regulated financial institutions. Today, such foundational digital infrastructures lie on a spectrum:</p>
<ul>
<li>At one end, public permissionless blockchains have attracted many types of users and applications.&nbsp; But the overall governance of such structures suffers from the lack of accountability, anonymity of service providers, and legal uncertainty over who&rsquo;s responsible for the blockchain performance and resiliency.&nbsp;<br /><br /></li>
<li>Some financial institutions have developed their own private permissioned blockchains to offer digital asset services to their customers. These set-ups are generally designed to meet the applicable legal and regulatory frameworks. But they suffer from a lack of interoperability, leading to fragmentation.<br /><br /></li>
<li>So, if not public blockchain, nor private permissioned networks, then what? We think the answer perhaps lies in between: public, permissioned networks.&nbsp;<br /><br />o Public permissioned networks are built on similar principles of openness and accessibility as the public internet, but with robust built-in safeguards for its use as a network for value exchange.&nbsp;<br /><br />o<span>&nbsp;</span>For example, while the network may be accessible to financial institutions that meet eligible criteria, the governing rule may restrict membership to regulated financial institutions only.&nbsp; This means developing a public blockchain equivalent infrastructure, but serving regulated wholesale financial markets.</li>
</ul>
<p>21.<span> </span>With this objective in mind, MAS launched the Global Layer One (GL1) initiative last year, to foster the development of a public permissioned foundational digital infrastructure, upon which commercial networks could be deployed.&nbsp;<br /><br />22.<span> </span>Since the launch, MAS and a core group of global banks, namely BNY, Citi, J.P. Morgan, MUFG and Societe Generale-FORGE, have been leading efforts to define the business, governance, risk, legal and technology requirements of the GL1 Platform. These 5 banks represent participation from the G3 currencies, for a start.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>23.<span> </span>Beyond global banks, foundational digital infrastructures can also support today&rsquo;s global market infrastructure players, including global exchanges and custodians, on which high volumes of financial assets are traded, settled and custodised.&nbsp; This will enable a larger universe of tokenised assets to be traded seamlessly across borders.</p>
<ul>
<li>In this regard, I would like to welcome Euroclear and HSBC as new industry participants to the GL1 initiative.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>24.<span> </span>With these new participants, GL1 will also expand its scope of work in the coming year to encompass the following areas:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Developing platform requirements to deploy financial applications such as cross-border payments and collateral management.&nbsp; It will also design an appropriate business model to ensure that the GL1 platform can be financially sustainable.&nbsp;<br /><br /></li>
<li>Ecosystem development, which includes (i) the development of risk and governance principles, and settlement arrangements on market infrastructures and (ii), asset lifecycle specifications and programmable compliance templates for tokenised assets.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>25.<span> </span>As we make further progress on advancing the GL1, we welcome broader participation from other banks, custodians, financial market infrastructure service providers and policymakers who are able and keen to contribute to this endeavour.<br /><br />26.<span> </span>Third, there is a need for common industry standards to facilitate broad based industry adoption of tokenised assets.&nbsp;<br /><br />27.<span> </span>The absence of globally accepted taxonomies and standards in relation to digital assets, increases the costs of adoption as financial institutions would need to invest and support different types of technologies.<br /><br />28.<span> </span>This can be addressed through industry frameworks.</p>
<ul>
<li>For instance, in fixed Income, MAS has worked with global industry associations such as International Capital Market Association (ICMA), Capital Market and Technology Association (CMTA) and the Global Financial Markets Association (GFMA), to develop a Guardian Fixed Income Framework which we are publishing today.&nbsp;<br /><br />o<span>&nbsp;</span>The framework integrates the bond data taxonomy, token standards and design principles for tokenised securities, allowing for a standardised approach towards tokenisation in the fixed income market.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In Asset and Wealth Management, MAS is also publishing today a non-prescriptive set of standards and industry best practices for tokenised funds, or the Guardian Funds Framework.&nbsp;<br /><br />o<span>&nbsp;</span>The report provides recommendations for establishing a framework for the tokenisation of the fund lifecycle and activities, including asset servicing, and on-chain share register archetypes and data.&nbsp;<br /><br />o<span>&nbsp;</span>The framework also proposes a composable technical standard, which demonstrates how new tokenised assets, which are a composite of multiple asset classes, can be readily created. This gives fund managers the ability to provide investors with more customised investment options at lower cost and greater flexibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>29.<span> </span>The final piece of the jigsaw puzzle is developing common settlement assets.&nbsp;<br /><br />30.<span> </span>To ensure settlement of tokenised assets in financial markets, regulated and credible forms of tokenised money is needed.</p>
<ul>
<li>The cash leg of most tokenised asset transactions generally involves tokenised commercial bank money, or tokenised bank liabilities. These are issued by commercial banks and carry the credit risks of the issuing bank.&nbsp;<br /><br /></li>
<li>Apart from tokenised bank liabilities, common settlement assets can also be used to settle tokenised asset transactions. A common settlement asset is one that is agreed by transacting parties, and can be credit-risk free such as a wholesale CBDC. The use of such common settlement assets can help to reduce settlement risk and market fragmentation.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Our view is that when asset tokenisation activity grows and eventually hits critical mass in key asset classes, this will drive demand for wholesale CBDCs as a common settlement asset.</li>
</ul>
<p>31.<span> </span>Hence, MAS will be launching a Singapore Dollar (SGD) Testnet, to enable financial institutions&rsquo; access to common settlement assets for market testing purposes.</p>
<ul>
<li>The SGD Testnet will offer three features, namely&nbsp;<br /><br />o<span>&nbsp;</span>A Settlement facility where wholesale CBDC can be issued, transferred and redeemed by financial institutions<br /><br />o<span>&nbsp;</span>Programmability to automate and programme conditional triggers for transactions involving tokenised assets&nbsp;<br /><br />o<span>&nbsp;</span>Interoperability which facilitates linkages with existing financial market infrastructures&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The SGD Testnet will be made available to eligible financial institutions participating in MAS&rsquo; digital asset and digital money initiatives, including Project Guardian and Project Orchid.&nbsp;<br /><br /></li>
<li>The first set of participating FIs to access the SGD Testnet includes DBS, OCBC, Standard Chartered and UOB.<br /><br /></li>
<li>We welcome more FIs to come forward with interesting use cases and utilise the SGD Testnet.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Conclusion</span></p>
<p>32.<span> </span>In conclusion, asset tokenisation can deliver significant efficiency gains to be reaped in the financial services industry, particularly in wholesale financial markets.&nbsp;<br /><br />33.<span> </span>Increasingly, we are seeing more FIs which are keen to deploy asset tokenisation solutions commercially. This augurs well for future growth.&nbsp;<br /><br />34.<span> </span>Given this growing interest, it is imperative that we develop pathways and tools to scale the adoption of asset tokenisation to reap network effects.&nbsp;<br /><br />35.<span> </span>The initiatives that I have mentioned today are important steps that we see in helping the industry to achieve scale, namely&nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull;<span>&nbsp;</span>Wholesale commercial networks&nbsp;<br />&bull;<span>&nbsp;</span>Foundational digital infrastructure&nbsp;<br />&bull;<span>&nbsp;</span>Common industry tokenisation standards and taxonomies&nbsp;<br />&bull;<span>&nbsp;</span>Common settlement assets&nbsp;</p>
<p>36.<span>&nbsp;</span>These initiatives represent pathways to help to scale vertically, from an asset class perspective, as well as horizontally, at a digital foundational infrastructure level.&nbsp;<br /><br />37.<span> </span>Viewed holistically, we see a possible future architecture of a globally scalable tokenised asset infrastructure that can enable interoperability across commercial networks, while powering tokenised asset transactions seamlessly across borders and markets.&nbsp;<br /><br />38.<span> </span>This will not be an overnight phenomenon, and will require a whole-of-industry effort and commitment. It will also require close collaboration with policymakers:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Through Guardian and GL1, we engaged early on central banks, regulatory bodies, international standards setting bodies, including the Banque de France, European Central Bank, Japan Financial Services Agency (FSA), Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and staff of the IMF early on to incorporate their insights and experience in this space.&nbsp;<br /><br /></li>
<li>Today, I would like to take the opportunity to also welcome staff of the World Bank and Deutsche Bundesbank to the Project Guardian Policymaker Group.<br /><br /></li>
<li>The role of this policymaker group is important as they help provide inputs on governance arrangements, guidance on how GL1 infrastructures can be developed in line with global standards, and advice on appropriate regulatory guardrails for tokenised asset transactions.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>39.<span> </span>While this conference is called the Layer One Summit, we are in some ways only really at Everest base camp. There is still some way to go before we get from base camp to the Summit.&nbsp; But with these building blocks in place, we hope that they serve as the necessary tools for the industry achieve tokenisation at scale, and scale the Summit.<br /><span></span><br />40.<span> </span>I look forward to the sharing of great insights these two days, and wish you all a fantastic Singapore FinTech Festival week. Thanks very much!</p>

<title>RegTech As Key Enabler Of Market Integrity In Future oO Finance - Opening Remarks At SFC Anti-Money Laundering And Counter-Financing Of Terrorism - RegTech Forum 2024 - Ms Julia Leung, Hong Kong Securities And Futures Commission Chief Executive Officer, 4 November 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good morning, Joseph, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. A warm welcome to the SFC Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism Regtech Forum 2024. Let&rsquo;s call it &ldquo;SFC Regtech Forum&rdquo; in short.</p>
<p>Last week, I had the opportunity to visit Saudi Arabia for a second time this year to foster capital market connectivity. It was inspiring to engage in dialogues with our Middle East and global counterparts on the future of finance encompassing fintech, digitalisation and artificial intelligence (AI), which will be pivotal to future-proof our financial markets. I&rsquo;m sure many of you also had a chance to attend the Hong Kong FinTech Week last week, where much excitement was generated over innovation, fintech, AI, tokenisation and even more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, our theme today, Regtech or regulatory technology, is also about innovation. Regtech is a major type of fintech and also accounts for the most use cases of AI-powered solutions in the financial sector so far. I believe it has a major role to play in the future of finance as an enabler of regulatory compliance, effectively helping to prevent financial crimes and safeguard investors&rsquo; interests.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In line with Securities Market Law, as well as guidelines pertaining scoring listed securities issuers, corporate governance score of listed issuers has been calculated.</p>
<p>The list of 360 listed companies subject to the corporate governance guidelines, based on the information disclosed in the Comprehensive Information Disclosure System of Issuers and the questionnaire sent by the auditor and legal inspector and credit rating agencies licensed by the Securities and Exchange Organization, has been calculated and made available to the public for the first time.</p>

<p>Accordingly, companies have been evaluated and scored based on four criteria in this ranking: board of directors and CEO, general meeting of shareholders, accountability and disclosure of information, and sustainability reporting.</p>

<p>Benchmarked to 2019, the Fiserv Small Business Index provides a numeric value measuring consumer spending, with an accompanying transaction index measuring customer traffic. Through a simple interface, users can access data by region, state, and/or across business types categorized by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). Computing a monthly index for 16 sectors and 34 sub-sectors, the Fiserv Small Business Index provides a timely, reliable and consistent measure of small business performance even in industries where large businesses dominate.</p>

<div> Sub-Saharan Africa, IMF, Executive Board, election, expansion<br />
Summary:<br />
IMF expands Executive Board to 25 directors, including 3 from Sub-Saharan Africa, addressing the region's representation and improving its voice. <div>
<p>IMF member countries have successfully elected an expanded Executive Board of 25 Executive Directors, including three representing Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>The completion of the Fund&rsquo;s 2024 Regular Election of Executive Directors on October 25, 2024, was the final step in the creation of an additional chair dedicated to Sub-Saharan Africa, following the call by the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) during the 2023 Annual Meetings in Marrakech to improve Sub-Saharan Africa&rsquo;s voice and representation and the overall balance of regional representation at the Board (<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2023/10/14/pr23353-chairs-statement-forty-eighth-meeting-of-the-imfc">see Press Release 23/353</a>).</p>
<p>On July 16, 2024, the IMF Board of Governors issued a resolution to increase the number of Executive Directors from 24 to 25 with the 25<span>th</span>&nbsp;chair intended for Sub-Saharan Africa (<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2024/08/02/pr-24299-imf-board-of-governors-issues-resolution-to-create-a-25th-chair-at-the-imf-exec-board">see Press Release 24/299</a>). This resolution received overwhelming approval from the Fund&rsquo;s membership, more than the required 85 percent majority of the total voting power.</p>
<p>The expansion was implemented with the 2024 Regular Election of Executive Directors when the 45 Sub-Saharan Africa member countries, previously organized into two constituencies, were reorganized into three new constituencies: Central and Eastern Africa, Southern Africa, and West Africa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a historic milestone for the IMF and for Africa,&rdquo; said Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva. &ldquo;Not only does the addition of a third African chair to our Board reflect the continent's tremendous progress in developing its human and economic potential, it will also strengthen Africa&rsquo;s voice and bring the IMF closer to the people we serve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Executive Board was last expanded 32 years ago in 1992 with the addition of two new chairs to represent new member countries after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The new Board&rsquo;s term commences on November 1, 2024.</p>

</ul>
<p>Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe: CBOE) today reported financial results for the third quarter of 2024.<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>"In the third quarter, Cboe reported strong diluted EPS of $2.07, record net revenue of $532.0 million and record adjusted diluted EPS<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;of $2.22, highlighting the solid progress we continued to make in sharpening our strategic focus," said Fredric Tomczyk, Cboe Global Markets Chief Executive Officer. "Through the first three quarters of the year, Cboe has grown net revenue by 9%, diluted EPS by 4%, and adjusted diluted EPS1 by 14%. The broad-based contribution speaks to the complementary nature of Cboe's ecosystem with Derivatives net revenue up 11%, Cash and Spot Markets up 9% and Data and Access Solutions up 6% on a year-to-date basis. I am excited as we move forward as an organization with a refined strategic framework that will help ensure we are well-aligned with secular market trends to drive growth and opportunity in the years ahead."</p>
<p>"Cboe reported strong 11% year-over-year net revenue growth to drive solid diluted EPS and record quarterly adjusted diluted EPS<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;results&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;third&nbsp;quarter,"&nbsp;said&nbsp;Jill&nbsp;Griebenow,&nbsp;Cboe Global Markets Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. "Derivatives net revenue was up a strong 13% year-over-year in the third quarter as&nbsp;Cboe produced record volumes across our derivatives platform. Cash and Spot Markets performance was also strong, producing 12% net revenue gains as compared to the third quarter of 2023, and Data and Access Solutions delivered 6% year-over- year net revenue growth for the quarter. Given the year-to-date trends and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we are raising our organic total net revenue growth<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;range for 2024 to 7-9%, up from our prior guidance of 6-8%. In conjunction with our increased revenue guidance, we are increasing our full year adjusted operating expense guidance<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;range to $798 to $808 million, up from our prior guidance range of $795 to $805 million. Moving forward, we are&nbsp;well&nbsp;positioned&nbsp;to&nbsp;allocate&nbsp;capital across our organization to the highest-return&nbsp;initiatives,&nbsp;helping&nbsp;deliver long-term shareholder value."</p>

<li>Total operating expenses were $224.6 million versus $209.3 million in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of $15.3 million.

<li>The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was 29.3 percent as compared with 22.9 percent in the third quarter of 2023.

The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;was 29.2 percent, up 2.8 basis points when compared with 26.4 percent in last year's third quarter.

<ul type="disc">
<li>Organic total net revenue growth<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;is expected to be in the range of 7 to 9 percentage points, up from previous guidance calling for 6 to 8 percentage points in 2024.</li>

<li>Adjusted operating expenses<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;in 2024 are expected to be in the range of $798 to $808 million, up from previous guidance of $795 to $805 million. The guidance excludes the expected amortization of acquired intangible assets of $89 million; the company reflects the exclusion of this amount in its non-GAAP reconciliation.</li>
<li>Reaffirms depreciation and amortization expense for 2024 is expected to be in the range of $43 to $47 million, excluding the expected amortization of acquired intangible assets.</li>
<li>Minority investments are expected to contribute a $40 to $46 million benefit in 2024 to non-operating (expenses) income, up from previous guidance of $37 to $43 million.

The company believes that there is uncertainty and unpredictability with respect to certain of its GAAP measures, primarily related to acquisition-related&nbsp;revenues and costs that would be required to reconcile to GAAP revenues less cost of revenues, GAAP operating expenses and GAAP effective tax rate, which preclude the&nbsp;company from providing accurate guidance on certain forward-looking GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations.

<p><b>Cautionary&nbsp;Statements Regarding&nbsp;Forward-Looking&nbsp;Information</b></p>
<p>This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. You can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as "may," "might," "should," "expect," "plan," "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "predict," "potential" or "continue," and the negative of these terms and other comparable terminology. All statements that reflect our expectations, assumptions or projections about the future other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements, which are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us, may include projections of our future financial performance based on our growth strategies and anticipated trends in our business. These statements are only predictions based on our current expectations and projections about future events. There are important factors that could cause our actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.</p>
<p>We operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible to predict all risks and uncertainties, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.</p>
<p>Some factors that could cause actual results to differ include: the loss of our right to exclusively list and trade certain index options and futures products; economic, political and market conditions; compliance with legal and regulatory obligations; price competition and consolidation in our industry; decreases in trading or clearing volumes, market data fees or a shift in the mix of products traded on our exchanges; legislative or regulatory changes or changes in tax regimes; our ability to protect our systems and communication networks from security vulnerabilities and breaches; our ability to attract and retain skilled management and other personnel, increasing competition by foreign and domestic entities; our dependence on and exposure to risk from third parties; global expansion of operations; factors that impact the quality and integrity of our and other applicable indices; our ability to manage our growth and strategic acquisitions or alliances effectively; our ability to operate our business without violating the intellectual property rights of others and the costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights; our ability to minimize the risks, including our credit,&nbsp;counterparty investment, and default risks, associated with operating a European clearinghouse; our ability to accommodate trading and clearing volume and transaction traffic, including significant increases, without failure or degradation of performance of our systems; misconduct by those who use our markets or our products or for whom we clear transactions; challenges to our use of open source software code; our ability to meet our compliance obligations, including managing potential conflicts between our regulatory responsibilities and our for-profit status; our ability to maintain BIDS Trading as an independently managed and operated trading venue, separate from and not integrated with our registered national securities exchanges; damage to our reputation; the ability of our compliance and risk management methods to effectively monitor and manage our risks; restrictions imposed by our debt obligations and our ability to make payments on or refinance our debt obligations; our ability to maintain an investment grade credit rating; impairment of our goodwill, long-lived assets, investments or intangible assets; the impacts of pandemics; the accuracy of our estimates and expectations; litigation risks and other liabilities; risks relating to digital assets, including winding down the&nbsp;Cboe Digital spot market and transitioning digital asset futures contracts to CFE, operating a digital assets futures clearinghouse, cybercrime, changes in digital asset regulation, and fluctuations in digital asset prices. More detailed information about factors that may affect our actual results to differ may be found in our filings with the SEC, including in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and other filings made from time to time with the SEC.</p>

<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Non-GAAP Information<br /></span></b>In addition to disclosing results determined in accordance with GAAP, Cboe Global Markets has disclosed certain non-GAAP measures&nbsp;of&nbsp;operating&nbsp;performance.&nbsp;These&nbsp;measures are&nbsp;not&nbsp;in&nbsp;accordance&nbsp;with, or&nbsp;a&nbsp;substitute&nbsp;for,&nbsp;GAAP, and&nbsp;may&nbsp;be&nbsp;different from&nbsp;or&nbsp;inconsistent&nbsp;with&nbsp;non-GAAP financial&nbsp;measures&nbsp;used&nbsp;by&nbsp;other companies.&nbsp;The&nbsp;non-GAAP measures&nbsp;provided&nbsp;in&nbsp;this&nbsp;press release include adjusted revenue less cost of revenue, adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin,&nbsp;adjusted net&nbsp;income&nbsp;allocated&nbsp;to&nbsp;common&nbsp;stockholders,&nbsp;adjusted&nbsp;diluted&nbsp;earnings per&nbsp;share,&nbsp;effective&nbsp;tax&nbsp;rate&nbsp;on&nbsp;adjusted earnings,&nbsp;adjusted&nbsp;cash,&nbsp;net&nbsp;revenues in&nbsp;constant&nbsp;currency, EBITDA,&nbsp;EBITDA&nbsp;margin, adjusted&nbsp;EBITDA&nbsp;and&nbsp;adjusted&nbsp;EBITDA&nbsp;margin.</p>
<p>Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release provide additional and comparative information to assess trends in our core operations and a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by management are provided as additional information to investors in order to provide them with an alternative method for assessing our financial condition and operating results.</p>
<p><i>Amortization expense of acquired intangible assets:&nbsp;</i>We amortize intangible assets acquired in connection with various acquisitions. Amortization&nbsp;of&nbsp;intangible&nbsp;assets&nbsp;is&nbsp;inconsistent&nbsp;in&nbsp;amount&nbsp;and&nbsp;frequency&nbsp;and&nbsp;is&nbsp;significantly&nbsp;affected&nbsp;by&nbsp;the&nbsp;timing&nbsp;and&nbsp;size&nbsp;of&nbsp;our acquisitions.&nbsp;As&nbsp;such,&nbsp;if&nbsp;intangible&nbsp;asset&nbsp;amortization&nbsp;is&nbsp;included&nbsp;in&nbsp;performance&nbsp;measures, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;more&nbsp;difficult&nbsp;to&nbsp;assess&nbsp;the&nbsp;day-to- day operating performance of the businesses, the relative operating performance of the businesses between periods and the earnings power of the company. Therefore, we believe performance measures excluding intangible asset amortization expense provide investors with an additional basis for comparison across accounting periods.</p>
<p><i>Acquisition-related costs:&nbsp;</i>From time to time, we have pursued acquisitions, which have resulted in expenses which would not otherwise have been incurred in the normal course of the company's business operations. These expenses include integration costs,&nbsp;as&nbsp;well&nbsp;as&nbsp;legal, due&nbsp;diligence,&nbsp;impairment&nbsp;charges,&nbsp;and&nbsp;other third-party&nbsp;transaction&nbsp;costs. The&nbsp;frequency&nbsp;and&nbsp;the&nbsp;amount of&nbsp;such expenses vary significantly based on the size, timing and complexity of the transaction. Accordingly, we exclude these costs for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures which provide an additional analysis of Cboe's ongoing operating performance or comparisons in Cboe's performance between periods.</p>
<p><b>The tables below show the reconciliation of each financial measure from GAAP to non-GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of those items detailed below and are referred to as adjusted financial measures.</b></p>

<p><b>EBITDA&nbsp;Reconciliations</b></p>
<p>EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) and Adjusted EBITDA are widely used non-GAAP financial measures of operating performance. EBITDA margin represents EBITDA divided by revenues less cost of revenues (net revenue). It is presented as supplemental information that the company believes is useful to investors to evaluate its results because it excludes certain items that are not directly related to the company's core operating performance. EBITDA is calculated by adding back to net income interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adding back to EBITDA acquisition-related costs, change in contingent consideration, impairment of intangible assets, loss (gain) on investment, costs related to the Cboe Digital wind down, gain on sale of property held for sale, gain on Cboe Digital non- recourse notes and warrants wind down, contra-revenue associated with the Cboe Digital syndication wind down, and income from investment. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as substitutes either for net income, as an indicator of the company's operating performance, or for cash flow, as a measure of the company's liquidity. In addition, because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be calculated identically by all companies, the presentation here may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenue.</p>

<div> enforcement, investigation, AI, ASX CHESS replacement, audit<br />
Summary: ASIC updates the Committee on its enforcement activities, ongoing investigations, work on AI governance, supervision of ASX, and review of audit quality. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>I am pleased to appear before the Committee once more. I am joined today by Deputy Chair Sarah Court, and fellow Commissioners Kate O&rsquo;Rourke, Alan Kirkland and Simone Constant, as well as Greg Yanco, Chief Executive Officer, Chris Savundra in his new role of Executive Director, Enforcement and Compliance, Calissa Aldridge, Executive Director, Markets and Peter Dunlop, our Chief Financial Officer.</p>
<p>We appreciate the Committee&rsquo;s interest in the topics you have provided us ahead of this hearing, and I&rsquo;ll make a few short remarks in relation to some of these.</p>
<h2>ASIC&rsquo;s enforcement</h2>
<p>You asked us for an update on our enforcement work.</p>
<p>ASIC has had some important regulatory firsts in recent months, including the first win in a&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-173mr-asic-s-first-greenwashing-case-results-in-landmark-11-3-million-penalty-for-mercer/#:~:text=In%20a%20landmark%20case%20for,of%20its%20superannuation%20investment%20options." title="24-173MR ASIC&rsquo;s first greenwashing case results in landmark $11.3 million penalty for Mercer">greenwashing civil penalty action</a>, the first infringement notice issued to a market operator, and our first civil action against the ASX. We are taking strong action against market manipulation. We laid charges in an&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-161mr-charges-laid-in-alleged-telegram-pump-and-dump-conspiracy-following-asic-investigation/?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj91LuT3I-JAxVWXWwGHZGaHz8QFnoECBcQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fasic.gov.au%2Fabout-asic%2Fnews-centre%2Ffind-a-media-release%2F2024-releases%2F24-161mr-charges-laid-in-alleged-telegram-pump-and-dump-conspiracy-following-asic-investigation%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw1pouAXw_PYxN3lLKoRQYaS&amp;opi=89978449" title="24-161MR Charges laid in alleged Telegram &lsquo;pump and dump&rsquo; conspiracy following ASIC investigation">alleged &lsquo;pump and dump&rsquo; conspiracy</a>&nbsp;that used the messaging platform Telegram, with the defendants facing a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment and a fine of over $1 million. During our investigation ASIC took the unprecedented step of posting messages in the Telegram chat room to warn traders they may be breaking the law by seeking to organise stock price manipulation.</p>
<p>And we are pursuing large corporations. In September, ASIC&rsquo;s action resulted in&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2023-releases/23-260mr-anz-penalised-15-million-for-misleading-customers-about-available-funds/" title="23-260MR ANZ penalised $15 million for misleading customers about available funds">ANZ being ordered to pay a $15 million penalty for misleading customers</a>&nbsp;about funds being available for withdrawal without incurring fees. Last month the Full Federal Court dismissed ANZ&rsquo;s appeal against the judgment, and upheld the original finding that that ANZ breached continuous disclosure laws when undertaking a $2.5 billion institutional share placement in 2015.</p>
<p>Following an ASIC investigation, the&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-211mr-macquarie-bank-fined-a-record-4-995m-for-serious-market-gatekeeper-failure/#:~:text=Following%20an%20ASIC%20investigation%2C%20the,ever%20imposed%20by%20the%20MDP." title="24-211MR Macquarie Bank fined a record $4.995m for serious market gatekeeper failure">Markets Disciplinary Panel (MDP) issued Macquarie Bank a record $4.995 million</a>&nbsp;fine for its failure to prevent suspicious orders being placed on the electricity futures market.</p>
<p>Last week we commenced court proceedings alleging&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-234mr-asic-alleges-qbe-misled-customers-over-pricing-discounts/" title="24-234MR ASIC alleges QBE misled customers over pricing discounts">QBE Insurance Limited misled its customers</a>&nbsp;about the value of discounts offered on certain general insurance products.</p>
<p>And on Wednesday we commenced&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-243mr-asic-sues-oak-capital-alleging-unconscionable-conduct-designed-to-avoid-the-national-credit-code/?altTemplate=betanewsroom" title="24-243MR ASIC sues Oak Capital alleging unconscionable conduct designed to avoid the National Credit Code">proceedings against Oak Capital, for conduct we argue was unconscionable</a>&nbsp;and designed to avoid consumer protections under the National Credit Code.</p>
<p>ASIC has more enforcement action due over the coming months targeting behaviour that has been detrimental to customers and the market.</p>
<h2>Update on ASIC investigation in relation to ANZ&rsquo;s role in AOFM bonds</h2>
<p>Since February 2024, ASIC has been investigating suspected contraventions by ANZ in its role as joint lead manager and risk manager on an issuance of $14 billion 10-year Australian government Treasury Bonds conducted on 19 April 2023 by the Australian Office of Financial Management. Our investigation is continuing.</p>
<p>We recognise the investigation continues to attract significant public and media interest. To preserve the integrity of the investigation, it is not appropriate to provide ongoing commentary on the investigation.</p>
<p>Our investigation concerns suspected market manipulation and contraventions of a number of provisions of the ASIC Act and the Corporations Act. In August 2024, we expanded our investigation to include suspected contraventions relating to errors in ANZ&rsquo;s reporting of secondary bond market turnover data to the AOFM.</p>
<p>We are giving this investigation the highest priority given the seriousness of the alleged misconduct and the potential for the alleged conduct to impact the interest payments of the Commonwealth on the bonds issued and therefore Australian taxpayers.</p>
<p>As we have said previously, we expect to form an internal view in the first quarter of 2025 about the suspected contraventions and whether any enforcement action should be taken.</p>
<h2>Our AI work</h2>
<p>In addition to the information provided in our submission, this week we released a report on our review of&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-798-beware-the-gap-governance-arrangements-in-the-face-of-ai-innovation/" title="REP 798 Beware the gap: Governance arrangements in the face of AI innovation">AI use by retail financial services and credit providers</a>, where we found the maturity of governance and risk management practices is not keeping up with the nature and scale of AI use.</p>
<p>It is clear that work needs to be done - and quickly - to ensure governance is adequate for the potential surge in consumer-facing AI.</p>
<h2>ASX CHESS replacement</h2>
<p>We continue to focus on our ASX supervision. We have reflected on our supervisory approach and have carefully considered the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations in its April 2024 Report on its inquiry into CHESS Replacement. We are enhancing our capability and expertise on technology delivery, change programs, and our overall supervisory expertise.</p>
<p>In our submission to the Committee, we noted ASX has changed the status of the CHESS replacement project from green to amber. ASX reported that this is due to delays in the product acceptance testing and the data platform build for CHESS replacement.</p>
<p>It is critical that risks are actively identified by ASX, managed and tracked, and appropriately escalated. It is important that ASX&rsquo;s risk culture requires and supports the transparent identification, reporting and escalation of risks. The replacement of CHESS is ultimately the responsibility of ASX.</p>
<p>ASIC has taken short term steps to enhance our monitoring of the CHESS replacement project, and ASIC and the RBA are closely monitoring ASX&rsquo;s governance arrangements for the CHESS Replacement program to ensure ASX manages the risks associated with the implementation.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, in August we commenced proceedings in the&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-177mr-asic-sues-asx-for-alleged-misleading-statements/" title="24-177MR ASIC sues ASX for alleged misleading statements">Federal Court against ASX for allegedly making misleading statements related to the CHESS replacement project</a>. ASX&rsquo;s statements go to the heart of trust in the integrity of our markets. When these fall short, the consequences in the market can be wide-ranging.</p>
<p>ASIC will not hesitate to take further regulatory action, including the use of our new powers under both the FMI reforms legislation and competition in clearing and settlement legislation, to hold ASX accountable for the CHESS replacement project and meeting stakeholder and community expectations.</p>
<h2>Quality of audit</h2>
<p>In addition to the information in our submission, this week we published our&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-240mr-asic-releases-fy-2023-24-financial-reporting-and-audit-report-and-launches-auditor-independence-surveillance/?altTemplate=betanewsroom" title="24-240MR ASIC releases FY 2023&ndash;24 financial reporting and audit report and launches auditor independence surveillance">annual integrated report on financial reporting and audit surveillance</a>. Our review identified improvements needed across audit approaches and financial reporting, resulting in financial adjustments of $1.88 billion and outlined ASIC&rsquo;s audit-related enforcement outcomes.</p>
<p>We recognise this committee&rsquo;s work and recommendations concerning auditing profession&rsquo;s approach to conflicts of interest. We are continuing to evolve our approach to this work. This week ASIC wrote to almost 3000 registered company auditors and the CEOs of six large auditing firms advising that we are commencing a review into auditors&rsquo; adherence with independence and conflict of interest obligations under the Corporations Act.</p>
<p>You can expect we will use our compulsory information-gathering powers where we identify an issue. It may also extend to seeking information about the systems and controls relied upon in audit engagements to ensure compliance with independence and conflicts of interest requirements.</p>
<h2>Public and private markets</h2>
<p>As a modern, confident, and ambitious regulator, we work proactively to identify and respond to developments that could affect the integrity of this system, or impact consumers and investors. Our efforts have ensured Australia has remained one of the cleanest listed equity markets in the world for the past decade, where Australian companies can do business with certainty, and Australians can be confident to invest.</p>
<p>As this Committee would know, public listings have been on the decline. At the same time, private markets globally have experienced significant growth. There are estimates that global private capital assets under management are over USD$14&nbsp;trillion &ndash; triple a decade ago. This is an estimate as there are gaps in the data to size and monitor this sector. Australian private capital funds have also experienced significant growth and are becoming an increasingly important source of funding for our economy. Major superannuation funds have over 20% of their assets invested privately.</p>
<p>This year we have been leading a conversation with market participants about the role of public and private markets. The Commission has been involved in a range of panels and roundtables recently, examining the changing dynamic between public and private markets, including the growth of superannuation, to ensure they continue to deliver good outcomes for consumers and support the efficiency of our capital markets. I would be happy to discuss these in further detail.</p>
<p>In coming weeks, we will release a discussion paper, along with ASIC-commissioned research which explores the current state of Australia&rsquo;s financial markets.</p>
<h2>ASIC&rsquo;s transformation journey</h2>
<p>Last week at a separate hearing I reflected on ASIC&rsquo;s journey of growth and transformation across the past three years, including the most significant organisational redesign of the agency in 15 years.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s transformation as an agency has continued to deliver results, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>enhanced collaboration across teams with quicker times for matters to progress to enforcement and compliance action</li>
<li>improved data analytics and surveillance capabilities, underpinned by our long-term approach to becoming a leading, digitally enabled and data-informed regulator, and</li>
<li>strengthened engagement with external stakeholders to listen to their views and set clear expectations of those we regulate.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will have seen our recent announcements about key appointments to our senior executive leadership team. Following an international search, Peter Soros will be joining ASIC in November as Executive Director Regulation and Supervision. And as you would have noted from the introductions, Chris Savundra has been appointed to the role of Executive Director Enforcement and Compliance, effective from Monday this week.</p>
<p>We will continue to focus on ASIC&rsquo;s transformation, including a strong focus on backing our dedicated people, and investing in data, systems and technology.</p>
<p>I am optimistic about ASIC&rsquo;s future. Our renewed Executive Leadership Team and focus on building a strong culture will set the agency up to evolve and respond to new challenges in our operating environment and to the threats and harms that emerge.</p>
<p>We look forward to answering the Committee&rsquo;s questions.</p>

<title>JP Morgan Affiliates To Pay $151 Million To Resolve SEC Enforcement Actions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> enforcement actions, SEC, JP Morgan, violations, penalties
Summary: JP Morgan affiliates charged by SEC for misleading disclosures, fiduciary duty breach, and prohibited transactions, leading to penalties and voluntary payments. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (JPMS) and J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc. (JPMIM) &ndash; both affiliates of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JP Morgan) &ndash; in five separate enforcement actions for failures including misleading disclosures to investors, breach of fiduciary duty, prohibited joint transactions and principal trades, and failures to make recommendations in the best interest of customers.</p>
<p>Without admitting or denying the findings in the SEC&rsquo;s orders, the two affiliates agreed to pay more than $151 million in combined civil penalties and voluntary payments to investors to resolve four of the &shy;actions. The SEC did not impose a penalty in one of the actions, taken against JPMS, because JPMS cooperated in the investigation and undertook remedial measures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;JP Morgan&rsquo;s conduct across multiple business lines violated various laws designed to protect investors from the risks of self-dealing and conflicts of interest,&rdquo; said Sanjay Wadhwa, Acting Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;With today&rsquo;s settlements, which include multiple self-reports and large voluntary payments to harmed investors, JP Morgan is being held accountable for its regulatory failures.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Conduit Private Funds Action (JPMS)</span></p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that JPMS made misleading disclosures to brokerage customers who invested in its &ldquo;Conduit&rdquo; private funds products, which pooled customer money and invested it in private equity or hedge funds that would later distribute to the Conduit private funds shares of companies that went public. The order finds that, contrary to the disclosures, a JP Morgan affiliate exercised complete discretion over when to sell and the number of shares to be sold. As a result, investors were subject to market risk, and the value of certain shares declined significantly as JP Morgan took months to sell the shares. As part of the resolution of this enforcement action, JPMS agreed to make a voluntary payment of $90 million to more than 1,500 Conduit investor accounts and to pay a civil penalty of $10 million, which will also be distributed to Conduit investors.</p>
<p>In addition to imposing the civil penalty, the SEC&rsquo;s order finds that JPMS violated Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act and imposes a cease-and-desist order and a censure. The order notes that JPMS, through counsel, self-reported to SEC staff that certain investors had complained as a result of the failure to promptly sell certain shares. The investigation was conducted by Ming Ming Yang, David Zetlin-Jones, Brian Fitzpatrick, and Lee A. Greenwood of the Asset Management Unit.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Portfolio Management Program Action (JPMS)</span></p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that, between July 2017 and October 2024, JPMS failed to fully and fairly disclose the financial incentive it and some of its financial advisors had when they recommended JPMS&rsquo;s own Portfolio Management Program over third-party managed advisory programs offered by JPMS. During the relevant period, assets under management in the program&rsquo;s strategies grew from approximately $10.5 billion to more than $30 billion.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that JPMS violated Sections 206(2) and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-7 thereunder and imposes a cease-and-desist order, censure, and a $45 million penalty. The investigation was conducted by Jessica Neiterman, Marie DeBonis, John Farinacci, Virginia M. Rosado Desilets, and Brianna Ripa of the Asset Management Unit with assistance from trial attorney Rua Kelly of the Boston Regional Office.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Clone Mutual Funds Action (JPMS)</span></p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that, between June 2020 and July 2022, JPMS recommended certain mutual fund products, called Clone Mutual Funds, to its retail brokerage customers when materially less expensive ETF products that offered the same investment portfolios were available. According to the order, when recommending the Clone Mutual Funds, JPMS and its registered representatives failed to consider these cost differences and failed to have a reasonable basis to believe that their recommendations were in the best interest of the customers. The order finds that approximately 10,500 customers made approximately 17,500 purchases of the Clone Mutual Funds during this period based on JPMS&rsquo;s recommendations.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that JPMS violated Regulation Best Interest and imposes a cease-and-desist order and a censure. The SEC did not impose a civil penalty because JPMS promptly self-reported the issue to SEC staff, conducted an internal investigation, provided substantial cooperation, and, among other remedial measures, voluntarily repaid impacted customers approximately $15.2 million. The investigation was conducted by Emmy E. Rush and Steven G. Rawlings of the New York Regional Office, with the assistance of Mr. Farinacci.</p>
<p><span>Joint Transactions Action (JPMIM)</span></p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that, in March 2020, JPMIM caused $4.3 billion in prohibited joint transactions, which advantaged an affiliated foreign money market fund for which it served as the delegated portfolio manager over three U.S. money market mutual funds it advised.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that JPMIM caused violations of Section 17(d) of the Investment Company Act and Rule 17d-1 thereunder and imposes a cease-and-desist order and a $5 million civil penalty. The investigation was conducted by Salvatore Massa, Brian Kudon, Mr. Fitzpatrick, and Mr. Greenwood of the Asset Management Unit.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Principal Trades Action (JPMIM)</span></p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that, between July 2019 and March 2021, JPMIM engaged in or caused 65 prohibited principal trades with a combined notional value of approximately $8.2 billion. Principal trades are generally prohibited to avoid undisclosed conflicts of interest unless certain conditions are met or the SEC provides exemptive relief. The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that, to conduct these trades, a JPMIM portfolio manager directed an unaffiliated broker-dealer to buy commercial paper or short-term fixed income securities from JPMS, which JPMIM then purchased on behalf of one of its clients.<a name="_Hlk174345426"></a></p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that JPMIM caused JPMS to violate Section 17(a)(1) of the Investment Company Act, violated Sections 206(3) and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-7 thereunder, and caused certain clients to violate Rule 38a-1 of the Investment Company Act.&nbsp;The order imposes a cease-and-desist order, a censure, and a $1 million civil penalty. The order notes that, upon learning about the principal trades, JPMIM notified the SEC staff and promptly provided documents, communications, and other information on a voluntary basis. The investigation was conducted by Mr. Massa, Mr. Kudon, Mr. Fitzpatrick, and Mr. Greenwood of the Asset Management Unit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Conduit Private Funds, Portfolio Management Program, Joint Transactions, and Principal Trades actions were supervised by Andrew Dean and Corey Schuster, Co-Chiefs of the Asset Management Unit. The Clone Mutual Funds action was supervised by Sheldon L. Pollock, Associate Regional Director in the New York Regional Office.</p>

<title>Report On U.S. Portfolio Holdings Of Foreign Securities At Year-End 2023</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/report-on-us-portfolio-holdings-of-foreign-securities-at-year-end-2023/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/report-on-us-portfolio-holdings-of-foreign-securities-at-year-end-2023/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The findings from the annual survey of U.S. portfolio holdings of foreign securities at year-end 2023 were released today and posted on the Treasury web site at <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/data/treasury-international-capital-tic-system/tic-forms-instructions/us-claims-on-foreigners-from-holdings-of-foreign-securities" title="https://home.treasury.gov/data/treasury-international-capital-tic-system/tic-forms-instructions/us-claims-on-foreigners-from-holdings-of-foreign-securities">https://home.treasury.gov/data/treasury-international-capital-tic-system/tic-forms-instructions/us-claims-on-foreigners-from-holdings-of-foreign-securities</a></p>
<p>The survey was undertaken jointly by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A complementary survey measuring foreign portfolio holdings of U.S. securities also occurs annually.&nbsp;Data from the most recent such survey, which reports on securities held at end-June 2024, are being processed.&nbsp;Preliminary results are expected to be reported on February 28, 2025.</p>
<h3>Overall Results</h3>
<p>This survey measured the value of U.S. portfolio holdings of foreign securities at year-end 2023 as approximately $15.3 trillion, with $11.5 trillion held in foreign equity, $3.4 trillion held in foreign long-term debt securities (original term-to-maturity in excess of one year), and $0.4 trillion held in foreign short-term debt securities.&nbsp;The previous such survey, conducted as of year-end 2022, measured U.S. holdings of approximately $14.0 trillion, with $10.3 trillion held in foreign equity, $3.3 trillion held in foreign long-term debt securities, and $0.4 trillion held in foreign short-term debt securities.&nbsp; The increase in U.S. holdings in 2023 was mainly in equity (see Table 1).</p>
<p>U.S. portfolio holdings of foreign securities by country at the end of 2023 were the largest for the Cayman Islands ($2.7 trillion), followed by the United Kingdom ($1.5 trillion), Canada ($1.4 trillion), and Japan ($1.2 trillion) (see Table 2).&nbsp; These four countries attracted 44 percent of total U.S. portfolio investment, the same as the previous year.<br />This survey is part of the International Monetary Fund&rsquo;s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey, an effort to improve the measurement of portfolio asset holdings.</p>

<title>CFTC Warns Of Potential Dangers For Messaging App Users</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-warns-of-potential-dangers-for-messaging-app-users/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission&rsquo;s Office of Customer Education and Outreach today released a customer advisory alerting messaging app users to beware of schemes to defraud them of assets, specifically crypto assets.</p>
<p>Fraudsters are exploiting the default settings of commonly used messaging apps, telephone networks, and mobile devices to lure users into crypto&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/beware_virtual_currency_pump_dump.html">pump-and-dump schemes</a>&nbsp;and other scams.</p>
<p>The customer advisory,<i>&nbsp;Use Caution Responding to Messaging Apps</i>, informs users of the default settings of WhatsApp, Telegram, and other popular messaging apps that allow scammers to add random or targeted phone numbers to group chats that are used for fraudulent activity. Similarly, default SMS text settings on smart phones allow for a greater number of spam texts that can result in fraud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People who use these apps may not be familiar with the risks and frauds commonly associated with crypto assets,&rdquo; said Melanie Devoe, director of the CFTC&rsquo;s Office of Customer Education and Outreach. &ldquo;Receiving a&nbsp;group message promising 300% or 1,000% returns with zero risk or getting in on a supposed crypto opportunity, can be enticing, but it is best to not engage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The customer advisory, provides easy actions app users should take if they receive a message from an unfamiliar person or number saying &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve been added to a messaging app&rsquo;s group chat&rdquo;:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not reply.</li>
<li>Delete the messages or group discussions, block the senders and send text messages to junk or forward it to&nbsp;7726 (SPAM).</li>
<li>Change your privacy settings to protect your information and reduce future spam.</li>
<li>Most apps, mobile carriers and devices provide ways to restrict who may contact you or block specific numbers. Check each messaging apps&rsquo; settings. Next, check your carrier&rsquo;s account app settings, and your device settings. Many major carriers also offer free SMS spam-blocking or call filtering apps that can be added to your phone.</li>
</ul>
<p>About the Office of Customer Education and Outreach</p>
<p>OCEO is dedicated to helping customers protect themselves from fraud or violations of the Commodity Exchange Act through the research and development of effective financial education materials and initiatives. OCEO engages in outreach and education to retail investors. The office also frequently partners with federal and state regulators as well as consumer protection groups. The CFTC&rsquo;s full repository of customer education materials can be found at:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect">cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect</a>.</p>
<p><i>Customer Advisory: Use Caution Responding to Messaging Apps is available in full below and&nbsp;</i><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/MessagingApps.html"><i>HERE</i></a><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p>Customer Advisory: Use Caution Responding to Messaging Apps</p>
<p>Fraudsters are contacting potential victims on their phones to try to lure them into cryptocurrency scams with promises of guaranteed returns. Spot the fraud by remembering all trades involve a risk of loss. Be suspicious of any messages you receive via WhatsApp, Telegram, SnapChat, WeChat, SMS texts, or other apps that promise guaranteed oversized returns. If you receive a suspicious message:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not reply.</li>
<li>Delete the messages or group discussions and block the senders. Send text messages to junk.</li>
<li>Review your privacy settings to protect your information and reduce future spam.</li>
</ul>
<p>Deception in the Palm of Your Hand</p>
<p>By default, messaging apps allow anyone with your phone number to call or add you to a discussion group. Scammers use this vulnerability to add random or targeted phone numbers to WhatsApp groups or Telegram chats. You might see a message that you&rsquo;ve been added to a group, then other messages follow. They might talk about trading crypto futures with leverage, &ldquo;cooperative trading projects&rdquo; (also called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/digitalassetfrauds">pump-and-dump schemes</a>), 100, 500, 1,000 percent profits,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/AITradingBots.html">advanced artificial intelligence</a>, can&rsquo;t-miss investment&nbsp;<i>programs</i>, or other supposed opportunities. You might also see testimonials from other group members. It&rsquo;s all fake, lies designed to steal your money.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t Talk to Strangers</p>
<p><i>Stranger danger&nbsp;</i>applies to your mobile device too. Responding or complaining confirms to scammers that your number is active and will only lead to more fraud attempts. The same is true for answering unknown callers. Scammers sometimes use robocalls to identify working numbers.</p>
<p>Caller ID can be easily faked. If you don&rsquo;t recognize the phone number, or message sender, do not respond. If you receive an urgent message about a financial account, or from law enforcement,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/Beware_Imposters">the CFTC</a>, or other government agencies, visit the entity&rsquo;s official website and confirm the message with customer service staff. Do not use phone numbers or links provided in the message.</p>
<p>You should only trade futures with regulated individuals and firms that follow strict qualification, supervision, and customer protection requirements. Learn more about registration at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/check">cftc.gov/check</a>. Taking financial advice from unregistered, random people online or trading with unregistered companies that don&rsquo;t have a physical presence in the United States substantially increase your fraud risk.</p>
<p>Tighten your Security</p>
<p>Most apps let you adjust your privacy settings to only allow your contacts or specific numbers to message you or see your personal information, including your picture, location, and activity status. Check and adjust your settings in each app you use. Delete unwanted groups, block the admins, and report the groups and admins to the platform.</p>
<p>For SMS and phone messages, check your carrier&rsquo;s apps and account settings. Most major carriers offer free SMS spam and call blockers. Next, adjust phone and message settings on your device, including blocking unwanted callers or silencing spam calls. Activate options to filter unknown senders and junk. If you have the option to &ldquo;delete and report junk,&rdquo; use it. If not, forward unwanted messages to 7726 (SPAM). Both options help filter and block bad actors systemwide.</p>
