<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<ul>
<li><i>Fiserv Small Business Index rose to 147</i></li>
<li><i>Small business sales grew +5.1% year over year and +0.5% month over month</i></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.fiserv.com/" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Fiserv, Inc.</a>&nbsp;(NYSE: FI), a leading global provider of payments and financial services technology, has published the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fiserv.com/en/fiserv-small-business-index.html" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Fiserv Small Business Index</a>&nbsp;for January 2025. Nationally, the seasonally adjusted Index for January was 147, a one-point increase from December. Sales growth persisting through January was a welcome start to the new year for small businesses, many of which were coming off a strong holiday season.</p>
<p>Businesses in the services sector had a particularly strong month, while retailers and wholesalers also saw year-over-year growth, albeit at a slower pace. Conversely, restaurants saw increased foot-traffic, but sales declined as consumers continued shifting to more wallet-friendly options.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Small businesses saw continued growth in January, starting 2025 off on the right foot,&rdquo; said Prasanna Dhore, Chief Data Officer at Fiserv.</p>
<p>On a year-over-year basis, small business sales (+5.1%) and total transactions (+6.5%) showed healthy growth compared to January 2024. Month-over-month sales (+0.5%) and transactions (+1.3%) also grew.</p>
<p><span>Retail</span></p>
<p>Consumer spending at small business retail remained strong with sales (+4.1%) and transactions (+5.1%) growing year over year; average ticket sizes (-1.0%) declined slightly compared to January 2024. Year over year, the fastest-growing retail categories were General Merchandise (+11.0%), Grocery (+5.6%) and Building Materials (+4.5%).</p>
<p>On a monthly basis, small business retail sales (+0.2%) and transactions (+0.8%) saw modest growth; average ticket sizes declined (-0.6%). The strongest month-over-month gains were seen across Building Materials (+1.9%), Gasoline Stations (+1.6%) and Grocery (+0.7%). After a strong holiday season, parts of Retail, including Clothing (-3.4%), Furniture (-1.9%), Motor Vehicle Parts (-0.8%) and General Merchandise (-0.1%) saw their growth slow in January.</p>
<p><span>Restaurants</span></p>
<p>Consumer spending at small business restaurants declined (-1.7%) year over year despite transactions (or foot traffic) growing (+6.5%). Negative growth was the result of lower average ticket sizes (-8.3%) compared to 2024, reflecting inflation-induced pressures, with consumers shifting to lower cost options.</p>
<p>Similarly, month-over-month restaurant sales (-1.3%) declined while total restaurant transactions (+1.8%) grew. Average ticket sizes (-3.1%) fell compared to December.</p>
<p><span>Services</span></p>
<p>With small business retail spending steady, and restaurant sales declining, consumers shifted more dollars in January to service-based businesses, which grew sales year over year (+5.5%) and month over month (+0.8%).</p>
<p>On an annual basis, the fastest-growing service categories were Professional Services (+13.4%), Food Manufacturing (+12.5%), Religious, Civic, and Professional Organizations (+10.2%), and Truck Transportation (+8.7%).</p>
<p>Compared to December 2024, Professional Services (+3.2%), Religious, Civic, and Professional Organizations (+2.5%), and Educational Services (+2.2%) saw the most growth.</p>
<p><span>Regional Trends</span></p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li>States showing the most year-over-year sales growth were Wisconsin (+13.9%), Florida (+11.9%), Georgia (+11.5%), Virginia (+10.4%) and Minnesota (+9.0%). The strongest performing states month over month were Maryland (+4.2%), Montana (+3.5%) and Iowa (+3.5%).</li>
</ul>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li>Large cities showing the most year-over-year sales growth were Atlanta (+14.3%) and Miami (+9.8%). On a monthly basis, sales growth was strongest in Boston (+2.5%), Washington DC (+2.0%) and Philadelphia (+1.8%).</li>
</ul>

<title>Cboe Announces Plans To Launch 24x5 U.S. Equities Trading</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>Cboe Global Markets (Cboe), the world's leading derivatives and securities exchange network, today announced plans to offer 24-hour, five-days-a-week (24x5) trading for U.S. equities on its Cboe EDGX Equities Exchange (EDGX), subject to regulatory review and industry developments. The proposed expansion aims to meet growing global customer demand for expanded access to U.S. equities markets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We continue to hear from market participants globally &ndash; particularly those in Asia Pacific markets like Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Singapore and Australia &ndash; that they want greater access to U.S. equities trading and need trusted venues that can offer transparency, robust liquidity and efficient price discovery,&rdquo; said Oliver Sung, Head of North American Equities at Cboe Global Markets. &ldquo;As the world&rsquo;s largest global exchange operator, Cboe is uniquely positioned to meet that demand. By leveraging our global infrastructure, leading-edge technology, and proven experience facilitating around-the-clock trading in global markets, we believe we can seamlessly support a 24x5 trading model for U.S. equities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cboe operates 27 markets across five asset classes in the U.S., Asia Pacific and Europe. Currently, it already supports extended trading hours for U.S. equities on EDGX, with early order acceptance beginning at 2:30am ET and trading available from 4:00am ET to 8:00pm ET, Monday through Friday. During its Early Hours Trading session (4:00am &ndash; 7:00am ET), average daily volumes on EDGX increased by 135% between 2022 and 2024. Cboe also offers near 24x5 trading in its proprietary S&amp;P 500 Index (SPX) options, and Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) options and futures markets, in addition to 24x5 trading in its global FX markets. The proposed 24x5 trading model for U.S. equities is expected to further expand trading opportunities for investors worldwide, enabling them to react to global macroeconomic events as they are happening, manage risk more effectively, and adjust positions around the clock.</p>
<p>To complement the planned expansion, Cboe continues to significantly increase distribution of its U.S. equities market data for APAC and European customers, recognizing real-time pricing as an essential component of the investing and trading process. Its Cboe One U.S. Equities Feed, available to customers globally, offers consolidated, real-time market data from Cboe&rsquo;s four U.S. equities exchanges &ndash; which collectively account for 21.6% of U.S. equities on-exchange trading<a href="https://ir.cboe.com/news/news-details/2025/Cboe-Announces-Plans-to-Launch-24x5-U.S.-Equities-Trading-2025-NwujmKvsxb/default.aspx#_ftn1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cboe expects extended trading hours will further increase the breadth of U.S equities market data it already offers.</p>
<p>Cboe plans to make all listed NMS stocks available for trading on EDGX for 24 hours every business day (excluding U.S. holidays), subject to regulatory review, with all trades expected to be cleared through the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC). The company plans to seek approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and will collaborate with other industry participants to ensure operational readiness for this initiative.</p>

<p>The order must be paid within 3 months, or Mr Zina will face a further 5 years in prison. The confiscation order amounts to all of Mr Zina&rsquo;s available assets.</p>
<p>Therese Chambers, the FCA&rsquo;s joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight said: 'Insider dealing harms the integrity of our markets. As well as prosecuting insider dealers, we will not allow them to keep any part of their illicit profits. We have confiscated the entirety of Mr Zina&rsquo;s assets, demonstrating that crime does not pay.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Between 2014 and December 2017, Mohammed Zina worked as an analyst at Goldman Sachs International (Goldman Sachs), joining its Conflicts Resolutions Group in 2016. In that role he came into possession of inside information relating to potential mergers and acquisitions his employer was advising on.</p>
<p>Between 15 July 2016 and 4 December 2017, Mr Zina dealt in 6 shareholdings using this inside information. The total returns from trading in these stocks was approximately &pound;140,486.</p>
<p>The trading was partly funded by 3 loans, fraudulently obtained from Tesco Bank, totalling &pound;95,000.</p>
<p>In February 2023, Mr Zina was convicted of all 9 offences and sentenced to 22 months' imprisonment. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ol>
<li>The confiscation order was made on 29 January 2025.</li>
<li>We previously published details of the defendant&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/mohammed-zina-found-guilty-insider-dealing-fraud" title="Mohammed Zina found guilty of insider dealing and fraud">conviction and sentence</a></li>
<li>Mr Zina has 3 months to pay the amount in full. Should he not do so he is liable to be sentenced to a further 5 years in prison and once released will still be liable to pay it in full, with interest. We will seek to enforce this against any available assets. &nbsp;</li>
<li>The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 allows &lsquo;benefit&rsquo; of crime to be calculated as all property obtained in the course of the criminal conduct. The calculation of Mr Zina&rsquo;s benefit from insider dealing represents the total gross value of the shares when sold rather than merely the profits achieved.</li>
<li>The court found Mr Zina&rsquo;s benefit across all his offences, including fraud, to be &pound;1,091,424.72, when adjusted for inflation. The proceeds are adjusted for inflation to reflect the value as at the time of the order, i.e. in 2025, and therefore the sums involved include an uplift.</li>
<li>The 6 shareholdings Mr Zina dealt in using inside information were: Arm Holdings plc, Alternative Networks plc, Punch Taverns plc, Shawbrook plc, HSN Inc, and Snyder&rsquo;s Lance Inc.&nbsp;</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The announced departure of Anje Stiers as Head of the Financial Markets Working Group at Europex, effective 31 January 2025, led to an extraordinary mid-mandate election by the Europex General Assembly. As a result, Jethro van Hardeveld was confirmed as the new Head of the Financial Markets Working Group. Consequently, he stepped down from his previous role as Head of the Environmental Markets Working Group, creating a second vacancy. To fill this position, Ellen De Vocht was elected as the new Head of the Environmental Markets Working Group. Both appointments took effect on 1 February 2025.</p>
<p>Jethro van Hardeveld, Director of Regulatory Policy at ICE Endex, brings over fifteen years of experience in European regulatory policy and commodity derivatives markets. Jethro has actively engaged in shaping discussions on MiFID/R, EMIR, BMR, REMIT and others. Additionally, he is a longstanding member of the Consultative Working Group of the ESMA Commodity Derivatives Task Force and the ACER Expert Group on Wholesale Energy Market Integrity and Transparency.</p>
<p>Ellen De Vocht, Head of the EU Representation Office at EEX, has extensive experience in European climate and sustainable finance policy, with a particular focus on carbon markets and the EU ETS. A dedicated member of the Europex Environmental Markets Working Group for five years, she is also a founding and leading member of the Women in Carbon Brussels Network.</p>
<p>Christian Baer, Secretary General of Europex, commented:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;We would like to express our sincere gratitude to Anje Stiers for her dedication and service to the association over the past eight years. Her leadership in the Financial Markets Working Group, the former Market Integrity and Transparency Task Force as well as the Forward Capacity Allocation Task Force has been outstanding and will be greatly missed. At the same time, we look forward to working with Ellen De Vocht and Jethro van Hardeveld in their new roles. We are delighted to keep a very high level of technical competence and talented leadership in these key positions, especially at a time when European energy policy remains high on the political agenda.&rdquo;</em></p>

<ul class="bullet-listing">
<li>
<h5>Market capitalisation of NOK 1.7 billion</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>The first transfer on Euronext Oslo B&oslash;rs this year</h5>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Euronext today congratulates Integrated Wind Solutions, an offshore wind service company, on its uplisting to Euronext Oslo B&oslash;rs (ticker: IWS). The company was listed on Euronext Growth Oslo in 2021 and this marks the first transfer this year between the Oslo markets.</p>
<p>Integrated Wind Solutions was established in July 2020 and is divided into three business segments; IWS Fleet AS being owner and operator of CSOV vessels, IWS Services being owner of companies supporting the offshore wind supply chain, as well as the financial investment in the Wind Operations and Asset Management company PEAK Wind. The company is developing a fleet of service vessels for the offshore wind industry, with all six newbuilds expected to be delivered in the first half of 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ahead of the transfer, the company raised NOK 30 million through a retail share offering for investors in Norway, Denmark, and Sweden. As a result, the company gained 700 new shareholders. At market opening, the share price was set at NOK 41.80 per share, based on the closing price on Euronext Growth Oslo on 31 January 2025. That gave the company a market capitalisation of NOK 1.7 billion this morning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lars-Henrik R&oslash;ren, CEO of Integrated Wind Solutions, said:&nbsp;<em>IWS has undergone a remarkable transformation since ordering its first two CSOV newbuildings in January 2021, later increasing to six. Three CSOVs are now in operation and continue to deliver exceptional performance for our clients. We will celebrate the naming ceremony of the fourth, IWS Starwalker &nbsp;in Denmark this week, and the remaining two CSOVs are scheduled for delivery later this year. Furthermore, IWS Services and PEAK Wind are experiencing strong growth, and the completed uplisting of our shares to Euronext Oslo B&oslash;rs is a milestone and a natural progression that reflects a new phase of the growth journey for IWS</em>.&rdquo;</p>

The Company owns 74.62% of IWS Fleet AS, which has four Commissioning Service Operation Vessels (&ldquo;CSOVs&rdquo;) delivered and two CSOVs under construction with delivery in 2025.

<title>Statement By IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva On The Passing Of Former IMF Managing Director Mr. Horst KÃ¶hler</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), issued the following statement today after news of the death of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/omd/bios/hk.htm">Mr. Horst K&ouml;hler</a>, former IMF Managing Director:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is with great sadness that we have learned of the passing of Horst K&ouml;hler, who was the eighth Managing Director of the Fund and ably led our institution between 2000 and 2004. Mr. K&ouml;hler will be remembered for his many contributions, and in particular for navigating the Fund's work through the difficult period after September 11, 2001. He mobilized the Fund and the international community to help the low-income and heavily indebted members, championing greater transparency and strong governance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During his distinguished career, he played a key role in Germany&rsquo;s unification in 1990 as Deputy Finance Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany and was instrumental in drafting the legal framework for the introduction of the euro. He served as president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, before joining the IMF as Managing Director. In 2004 he left the IMF to become president of the Federal Republic of Germany, winning the hearts of many for his principled approach. Throughout a large part of his life, he was particularly devoted to drawing the world&rsquo;s attention to the needs of the African continent &ndash; something many of us at the Fund greatly admired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On behalf of the IMF, I wish to offer our deepest condolences to Mr. K&ouml;hler&rsquo;s family &ndash; his wife Eva, his two children Ulrike and Jochen, and his grandchildren. Mr. K&ouml;hler led a life of distinguished public service, and leaves behind a profound legacy of dedication to fairness and justice and an unfailing concern for others.&rdquo;</p>

<title>CFTC Staff Issues Supplemental Letter Regarding No-Action Position On Reporting, Recordkeeping Requirements</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-staff-issues-supplemental-letter-regarding-no-action-position-on-reporting-202521/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission&rsquo;s Division of Market Oversight and the Division of Clearing and Risk today announced they have taken a no-action position regarding swap data reporting and recordkeeping regulations. This position is in response to a request from KalshiEX LLC, a designated contract market, and Kalshi Klear LLC, a derivatives clearing organization, to modify CFTC Letter No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/csl/24-15/download">24-15</a>&nbsp;to remove the condition prohibiting third-party clearing by participants and to cover fully-collateralized variable payout contracts.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The Divisions will not recommend the Commission initiate an enforcement action against KalshiEX LLC, Kalshi Klear LLC, or their participants for failure to comply with certain swap-related recordkeeping requirements and for failure to report to swap data repositories data associated with binary option transactions and variable payout contract transactions executed on or subject to the rules of KalshiEX LLC and cleared through Kalshi Klear LLC, subject to the terms of the no-action letter. The supplemental letter also removes the condition in CFTC Letter No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/csl/24-15/download">24-15</a>&nbsp;that prohibits Kalshi participants from clearing contracts through a third-party clearing member.</p>

<title>Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization Annual Compliance Report 2025: Integration, Self-Regulation And Technology - Helping Dealers Meet Regulatory Requirements And Advance Investor Protection</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/canadian-investment-regulatory-organization-annual-compliance-report-2025-integ-2025131/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/canadian-investment-regulatory-organization-annual-compliance-report-2025-integ-2025131/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) published its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ciro.ca/newsroom/publications/ciro-compliance-report-2025-helping-dealers-compliance" target="_self" title="CIRO Compliance Report for 2025: Helping Dealers with Compliance">Annual Compliance Report</a>, providing insight for dealers into emerging compliance challenges and what&rsquo;s needed to address them. CIRO&rsquo;s Annual Compliance Report helps dealers focus their supervision and risk-management efforts to comply with CIRO&rsquo;s regulatory requirements effectively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Compliance Report serves to communicate emerging issues to all dealers for awareness, preparedness, and to take the best approach to adjusting policies and procedures,&rdquo; said Andrew Kriegler, CEO, CIRO. &ldquo;By alerting dealers to potential issues faced by their industry peers, CIRO advises all members about risks and emerging compliance matters, to&nbsp;<strong>strengthen&nbsp;</strong>investor protection while responding to changes in the industry.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Staying Ahead of the Technology Curve</h2>
<p>A key theme of the report is the relationship between technologies used in the investment ecosystem and managing their risks to protect investors. Highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cybersecurity</strong>&nbsp;remains a key business risk irrespective of the size and complexity of the dealer member. Dealers are required to report cybersecurity incidents that meet certain criteria and to implement necessary controls to protect their clients. The report warns of an increase in incident reports involving third-party service providers that have impacted their clients. The report encourages dealers to review whether they have the necessary controls in place to protect clients, client information and assets, as well as their own critical operating systems, and in training personnel to fortify their cybersecurity.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto Asset Trading Platforms (CTPs)</strong>&nbsp;continue to be onboarded into CIRO membership. Compliance takes a top-down, risk-based approach to recognizing the higher inherent risk associated with CTPs. As CIRO and the CSA continue to evolve and adapt to the changing crypto ecosystem, members planning to offer crypto-assets to clients should stay informed about regulatory developments.</li>
<li><strong>Algorithmic Trading</strong>&nbsp;is a significant tool in today&rsquo;s capital markets. Implementing robust controls to validate data inputs and operations is essential to ensuring the accuracy and reliability of trading decisions&mdash;and maintaining the integrity of the capital markets. The report recommends regular reviews of algorithms to ensure their ongoing effectiveness.</li>
<li><strong>Social media</strong>&nbsp;is increasingly used as a marketing and educational tool in the finance industry. Dealers are required to establish and maintain policies and procedures on the use of social media for business purposes by their Approved Persons. The report encourages dealers to establish clear guidelines for interacting with clients and to maintain proper books and records of communications in compliance with regulatory obligations.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Integration and Compliance</h2>
<p>Integration is a key pillar of the first year of CIRO&rsquo;s inaugural Strategic Plan and annual public priorities for 2025&mdash;delivering efficiencies for the organization, members and the industry as a whole. The internal structure of CIRO&rsquo;s compliance teams is now integrated and the compliance programs have been harmonized to support the organizational goal of delivering regulation effectively and efficiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This report will help dealers with their own compliance policies and procedures so that collectively, as an industry, we can improve investor confidence and strengthen Canadian markets,&rdquo; said Kriegler.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<title>Statement By IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva On The Passing Of Former IMF Managing Director Mr. Horst KÃ¶hler</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-by-imf-managing-director-kristalina-georgieva-on-the-passing-of-former/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), issued the following statement today after news of the death of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/omd/bios/hk.htm">Mr. Horst K&ouml;hler</a>, former IMF Managing Director:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is with great sadness that we have learned of the passing of Horst K&ouml;hler, who was the eighth Managing Director of the Fund and ably led our institution between 2000 and 2004. Mr. K&ouml;hler will be remembered for his many contributions, and in particular for navigating the Fund's work through the difficult period after September 11, 2001. He mobilized the Fund and the international community to help the low-income and heavily indebted members, championing greater transparency and strong governance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During his distinguished career, he played a key role in Germany&rsquo;s unification in 1990 as Deputy Finance Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany and was instrumental in drafting the legal framework for the introduction of the euro. He served as president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, before joining the IMF as Managing Director. In 2004 he left the IMF to become president of the Federal Republic of Germany, winning the hearts of many for his principled approach. Throughout a large part of his life, he was particularly devoted to drawing the world&rsquo;s attention to the needs of the African continent &ndash; something many of us at the Fund greatly admired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On behalf of the IMF, I wish to offer our deepest condolences to Mr. K&ouml;hler&rsquo;s family &ndash; his wife Eva, his two children Ulrike and Jochen, and his grandchildren. Mr. K&ouml;hler led a life of distinguished public service, and leaves behind a profound legacy of dedication to fairness and justice and an unfailing concern for others.&rdquo;</p>

<title>CFTC Staff Issues Supplemental Letter Regarding No-Action Position On Reporting, Recordkeeping Requirements</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-staff-issues-supplemental-letter-regarding-no-action-position-on-reporting/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-staff-issues-supplemental-letter-regarding-no-action-position-on-reporting/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission&rsquo;s Division of Market Oversight and the Division of Clearing and Risk today announced they have taken a no-action position regarding swap data reporting and recordkeeping regulations. This position is in response to a request from KalshiEX LLC, a designated contract market, and Kalshi Klear LLC, a derivatives clearing organization, to modify CFTC Letter No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/csl/24-15/download">24-15</a>&nbsp;to remove the condition prohibiting third-party clearing by participants and to cover fully-collateralized variable payout contracts.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The Divisions will not recommend the Commission initiate an enforcement action against KalshiEX LLC, Kalshi Klear LLC, or their participants for failure to comply with certain swap-related recordkeeping requirements and for failure to report to swap data repositories data associated with binary option transactions and variable payout contract transactions executed on or subject to the rules of KalshiEX LLC and cleared through Kalshi Klear LLC, subject to the terms of the no-action letter. The supplemental letter also removes the condition in CFTC Letter No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/csl/24-15/download">24-15</a>&nbsp;that prohibits Kalshi participants from clearing contracts through a third-party clearing member.</p>

<title>Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization Annual Compliance Report 2025: Integration, Self-Regulation And Technology - Helping Dealers Meet Regulatory Requirements And Advance Investor Protection</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/canadian-investment-regulatory-organization-annual-compliance-report-2025-integ/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/canadian-investment-regulatory-organization-annual-compliance-report-2025-integ/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) published its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ciro.ca/newsroom/publications/ciro-compliance-report-2025-helping-dealers-compliance" target="_self" title="CIRO Compliance Report for 2025: Helping Dealers with Compliance">Annual Compliance Report</a>, providing insight for dealers into emerging compliance challenges and what&rsquo;s needed to address them. CIRO&rsquo;s Annual Compliance Report helps dealers focus their supervision and risk-management efforts to comply with CIRO&rsquo;s regulatory requirements effectively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Compliance Report serves to communicate emerging issues to all dealers for awareness, preparedness, and to take the best approach to adjusting policies and procedures,&rdquo; said Andrew Kriegler, CEO, CIRO. &ldquo;By alerting dealers to potential issues faced by their industry peers, CIRO advises all members about risks and emerging compliance matters, to&nbsp;<strong>strengthen&nbsp;</strong>investor protection while responding to changes in the industry.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Staying Ahead of the Technology Curve</h2>
<p>A key theme of the report is the relationship between technologies used in the investment ecosystem and managing their risks to protect investors. Highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cybersecurity</strong>&nbsp;remains a key business risk irrespective of the size and complexity of the dealer member. Dealers are required to report cybersecurity incidents that meet certain criteria and to implement necessary controls to protect their clients. The report warns of an increase in incident reports involving third-party service providers that have impacted their clients. The report encourages dealers to review whether they have the necessary controls in place to protect clients, client information and assets, as well as their own critical operating systems, and in training personnel to fortify their cybersecurity.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto Asset Trading Platforms (CTPs)</strong>&nbsp;continue to be onboarded into CIRO membership. Compliance takes a top-down, risk-based approach to recognizing the higher inherent risk associated with CTPs. As CIRO and the CSA continue to evolve and adapt to the changing crypto ecosystem, members planning to offer crypto-assets to clients should stay informed about regulatory developments.</li>
<li><strong>Algorithmic Trading</strong>&nbsp;is a significant tool in today&rsquo;s capital markets. Implementing robust controls to validate data inputs and operations is essential to ensuring the accuracy and reliability of trading decisions&mdash;and maintaining the integrity of the capital markets. The report recommends regular reviews of algorithms to ensure their ongoing effectiveness.</li>
<li><strong>Social media</strong>&nbsp;is increasingly used as a marketing and educational tool in the finance industry. Dealers are required to establish and maintain policies and procedures on the use of social media for business purposes by their Approved Persons. The report encourages dealers to establish clear guidelines for interacting with clients and to maintain proper books and records of communications in compliance with regulatory obligations.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Integration and Compliance</h2>
<p>Integration is a key pillar of the first year of CIRO&rsquo;s inaugural Strategic Plan and annual public priorities for 2025&mdash;delivering efficiencies for the organization, members and the industry as a whole. The internal structure of CIRO&rsquo;s compliance teams is now integrated and the compliance programs have been harmonized to support the organizational goal of delivering regulation effectively and efficiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This report will help dealers with their own compliance policies and procedures so that collectively, as an industry, we can improve investor confidence and strengthen Canadian markets,&rdquo; said Kriegler.</p>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, published today a new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-01/ESMA75-453128700-1263_Supervisory_Briefing_on_Authorisation_of_CASPs.pdf">supervisory briefing</a>&nbsp;aiming to align practices across the EU member states.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify">The briefing, developed in close cooperation with National Competent Authorities (NCAs),&nbsp;promotes convergence and prevents regulatory arbitrage, providing concrete guidance about the expectations on applicant Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs), and on NCAs when they are processing the authorisation requests.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">For example, the briefing contains clear guidance on:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Substance and governance&nbsp;</span>and the ability of CASPs offering their service in the EU to operate autonomously and with sufficient in-country personnel.</li>
<li><span>Outsourcing&nbsp;</span>and the effective limits to set regarding the externalisation of functions and services<span>.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Suitability of personnel&nbsp;</span>and the importance for CASPs, and particularly its executive management, to demonstrate effective technical knowledge of the crypto ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text-align-justify">The guidance in the briefing helps NCAs, applicants and the general public to operationalise MiCA and RTS obligations into concrete controls and checks. Consequently, it serves to maintain a strong regulatory framework characterised by a consistent, effective, and forceful supervision.</p>
<h4><span>Next Steps</span></h4>
<p>NCAs are expected to apply the principles in the supervisory briefing during authorisation procedures, as well as ensure continued adherence for CASPs once they have been authorised.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<h5>&euro;1 billion&nbsp;raised by &Icirc;le-de-France Mobilit&eacute;s</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>First bond aligned with the European EU Green Bond Standard issued by a public entity</h5>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Euronext today congratulates the admission by &Icirc;le-de-France Mobilit&eacute;s of the first Green Bond issued by a public entity aligned with the new European EU Green Bond Standard on Euronext Paris. With this inaugural admission of an EU Green Bond, Euronext reaffirms its support to stakeholders committed to the sustainable transition and its position as a leader in the sustainable bond market.</p>
<p>As the transport authority for the &Icirc;le-de-France region, &Icirc;le-de-France Mobilit&eacute;s manages one of the most extensive transport networks in the world, handling nearly 9.5 million journeys every day. To ensure carbon-free mobility by 2030, &Icirc;le-de-France Mobilit&eacute;s has been undertaking Europe&rsquo;s most ambitious program since 2016 to renew its rolling stock.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The one billion euros raised through this issuance will finance projects aligned with the European taxonomy defining sustainable activities. These projects will include, in particular, the renewal and renovation of electric rolling stock (trains, undergrounds, tram-trains, trams) and electric bikes, as well as the development of associated infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Green Bonds play a central role in financing the sustainable transition, allocating significant amounts (1 trillion euros per year) to predefined sustainable projects. The EU Green Bond Standard, which came into effect on 21 December 2024 and aligns with the European Taxonomy for sustainable activities, aims to establish a rigorous framework for these issuances, thus becoming a mark of quality and credibility for these instruments.</p>
<p>The EU Green Bond Standard ensures full transparency both before and after the issuance, as well as enhanced oversight of these operations. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) will be responsible for overseeing the certifiers providing assessments on these products.</p>
<p><span>Val&eacute;rie P&eacute;cresse, President of the &Icirc;le-de-France region, chair of &Icirc;le-de-France Mobilit&eacute;s, said:</span><em>&nbsp;&ldquo;Revolutionising transport in &Icirc;le-de-France has been my top priority. To this end, we have launched an unparalleled programme to renovate and modernise one of the largest transport networks in the world. The transport system in &Icirc;le-de-France must play a leading role in tackling the climate challenge, establishing itself as a benchmark for decarbonised mobility by 2030. Being the first public issuer in the world to launch a &euro;1 billion&nbsp; Green Bond under the &lsquo;EuGB&rsquo; Standard is both a proud achievement and a testament to the strength of our vision.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li><span><em>The combined value of all investment products tracking the NDX&reg; ecosystem globally exceeds&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$500 billion</span></em></span> </li>
<li><span><em>94 Exchange Traded Products track NDX&reg; in over 20 countries across 6 continents</em></span> </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="xn-org">Nasdaq, Inc.</span>&nbsp;(Nasdaq: NDAQ) proudly marks the 40th anniversary of the Nasdaq-100 Index&reg; (NDX&reg;), the world&rsquo;s preeminent large-cap growth benchmark. Since its inception on&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">January 31, 1985</span>, the index has redefined innovation and transformed the global investment landscape. Over the past four decades, it has evolved into a powerful symbol of growth, resilience, and the groundbreaking spirit of its constituent companies, shaping industries, inspiring entrepreneurs and investors worldwide.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq-100 Index&reg; tracks 100 of the largest, non-financial companies listed on the&nbsp;<span class="xn-org">Nasdaq Stock Market</span>. These companies have an enduring legacy of disruption in their respective markets, empowering growth and prosperity across the globe. The index has delivered a 14.25% compound annualized return since its inception, allowing investors around the world to share in that success. This exceptional performance underscores the transformative power of these businesses and their ability to drive long-term value for investors through public markets.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq-100&reg; has had over 500 members, with six original members still in the index today: Apple, Micron Technology Inc., Intel Corporation, KLA Corporation, PACCAR, and Costco Wholesale Corporation. When the Nasdaq-100&reg; first launched, the median market capitalization of a company in the NDX&reg; was&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$455 million</span>&nbsp;and the average market capitalization was&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$580 million</span>. As of&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">December 31, 2024</span>, the median market capitalization of a company in the NDX&reg; was&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$74 billion</span>, and the average market capitalization was&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$268 billion</span>.</p>
<p><span>Driving the&nbsp;<span class="xn-org">Innovation Economy Through Research</span>&nbsp;and Development</span></p>
<p>The companies in the Nasdaq-100&reg; have a history of accelerating change. As a driving force of innovation and economic growth, they spend between 600-1,200% more on research and development compared to companies residing in broad-based US large cap equity indexes1. Moreover, companies that invest more in research and development have delivered above-average performance across much of the 21st century2, and proven to be resilient over time through different market environments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;AMD congratulates Nasdaq on celebrating 40 years of the Nasdaq-100 Index,&rdquo; said Dr.&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Lisa Su</span>, Chair and Chief Executive Officer, AMD. &ldquo;We share Nasdaq&rsquo;s commitment to growth and innovation to deliver value for our stakeholders and are proud to stand alongside the trailblazing companies within this elite group. We look forward to continuing our collaboration with Nasdaq to drive technological and economic advancements in the years to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over the past 40 years, the Nasdaq-100 Index&reg; has grown into a powerful embodiment of innovation, resilience, and unparalleled growth. By providing investors with access to the groundbreaking companies shaping the global economy, the index has not only fueled innovation but also enabled the creation of generational wealth,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Adena Friedman</span>, Chair and CEO at Nasdaq. &ldquo;From trendsetting startups to global industry giants, the index is a testament to Nasdaq&rsquo;s unwavering commitment to support companies at all stages of their journey. As we celebrate this significant milestone, we are not only honored by the extraordinary achievements of the companies within the index, but also reaffirm our mission to champion innovation, empower growth and support the companies and investors that shape the future of markets worldwide."</p>
<p>"Today we celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Nasdaq-100 Index&reg;, a globally recognized benchmark of the companies accelerating our economy,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Emily Spurling</span>, Senior Vice President and Global Head of Indexes at Nasdaq. &ldquo;This milestone marks a significant moment in our journey as a transparent, rules-based index provider. By creating access to the value chain of leading technology companies across multiple industries, NDX&reg; empowers investors to support and benefit from the next generation of innovation, ensuring they are at the forefront of transformative growth."</p>
<p><span>The Expansive Nasdaq-100&reg; Global Ecosystem</span></p>
<p>The characteristics, strength, and significance of the Nasdaq-100&reg; have generated considerable investor demand for access to the index. Subsequently, a global financial ecosystem has developed around NDX&reg;, enabling investors to gain exposure through various investment vehicles tailored to market participants worldwide.</p>
<p>The combined value of all products tracking the NDX&reg; ecosystem globally exceeds&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$500 billion</span>. Among the investment vehicles growing at an accelerated rate are Exchange Traded Products, with 94 different Nasdaq-100&reg; products currently trading in over 20 countries across 6 continents. The first and largest of these is the Invesco QQQ ETF, which is the second most liquid ETF in the US and has served as a foundational financial product by providing investors with access to the Nasdaq-100&reg;3.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Congratulations&nbsp;to Nasdaq on the 40th anniversary of the Nasdaq-100 Index&reg;,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Brian Hartigan</span>, Global Head of ETFs and Index Investments, Invesco. &ldquo;The evolution of the Nasdaq-100 Index&reg; and Invesco QQQ mirrors the growth and development of technology and innovation, positioning the QQQ as one of the most important large-cap growth strategies with an ever-growing investment audience. &nbsp;We are happy that the long-standing Nasdaq and Invesco collaboration continues to contribute to success of the innovative Nasdaq-100 Index&reg;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beyond Exchange Traded Products, the NDX&reg; ecosystem has also experienced large scale growth and evolution in other asset classes, including index options and futures. From 2023 to 2024 index options that tracked NDX&reg; have seen a 39.5% volume increase in contracts. Additionally, CME&rsquo;s Nasdaq 100&reg; futures have seen their average notional value traded daily exceed&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$200 billion</span>&nbsp;in 20244. These products provide investors with additional avenues to gain exposure to the index, while continuing to trade in ways that are familiar, cost effective, or provide risk management abilities.</p>
<p>Nasdaq Global Indexes has been creating innovative, market-leading, transparent indexes since 1971. Today, there are over 10,000 indexes that span geographies, asset classes, and diverse families. The indexes are tracked by financial product sponsors across a wide spectrum of investable products and for asset managers to measure risk and performance. Nasdaq also provides exchange listing, custom index, and design solutions to financial organizations worldwide.</p>
<p>To celebrate the occasion, Nasdaq will host a special closing bell ceremony on&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">Friday, January 31, 2025</span>, commemorating this moment with its long-time clients and partners.</p>

<title>Brief Remarks On The Economy, And Perspective On Mutual And Community Banks, Federal Reserve Governor Michelle W. Bowman, At The New England CEO Summit, Portsmouth, New Hampshire</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Let me begin by saying my thoughts and prayers are with the families of the passengers and crew who perished in the tragic flight accident in Washington, D.C. Wednesday evening.</p>
<p>Thank you for the invitation to speak to you today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250131a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;It is a pleasure to be with you virtually for your CEO Summit. I always enjoy the opportunity to meet bankers from across the country, especially New England, to learn about the issues that are important to you. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) concluded its January meeting earlier this week, so I will begin by offering some brief remarks on the economy, and then share my views on a number of mutual and community bank issues, before addressing some questions that were submitted by your members in advance of today's meeting.</p>
<p><strong>Update on the Most Recent FOMC Meeting</strong><br />At our FOMC meeting this week, my colleagues and I voted to hold the federal funds rate target range at 4-1/4 to 4â1/2 percent and to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings. I supported this action because, after recalibrating the level of the policy rate towards the end of last year to reflect the progress made since 2023 on lowering inflation and cooling the labor market, I think that policy is now in a good place to position the Committee to pay closer attention to the inflation data as it evolves.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to 2025, in my view, the current policy stance also provides the opportunity to review further indicators of economic activity and get clarity on the administration's policies and their effects on the economy. It will be very important to have a better sense of the actual policies and how they will be implemented, in addition to greater confidence about how the economy will respond.</p>
<p><strong>Brief Remarks on the Economy</strong><br />The U.S. economy remained strong through the end of last year, with solid growth in economic activity and a labor market near full employment. Core inflation remains elevated, but my expectation is that it will moderate further this year. Even with this outlook, I continue to see upside risks to inflation.</p>
<p>The rate of inflation declined significantly in 2023, but it slowed by noticeably less last year. Without having seen the December data released this morning, I estimate that the 12-month measure of core personal consumption expenditures inflation&mdash;which excludes food and energy prices&mdash;likely remained unchanged at 2.8 percent in December, only slightly below its 3.0 percent reading at the end of 2023. Progress has been slow and uneven since the spring of last year mostly due to a slowing in core goods price declines.</p>
<p>After increasing at a solid pace, on average, over the initial three quarters of last year, gross domestic product appears to have risen a bit more slowly in the fourth quarter, reflecting a large drop in inventory investment, which is a volatile category. In contrast, private domestic final purchases, which provide a better signal about underlying growth in economic activity, maintained its strong momentum from earlier in the year, as personal consumption rose robustly again in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Some measures of consumer sentiment appear to have improved recently but are still well below pre-pandemic levels, likely because of higher prices. And since housing, food, and energy price increases have far outpaced overall inflation since the pandemic, lower-income households have experienced the negative impacts of inflation hardest, especially as these households have limited options to trade down for lower-cost goods and services.</p>
<p>Payroll employment gains rebounded strongly in December and averaged about 170,000 per month in the fourth quarter, a pace that is somewhat above average gains in the prior two quarters. The unemployment rate edged back down to 4.1 percent in December and has moved sideways since last June, remaining slightly below my estimate of full employment.</p>
<p>The labor market appears to have stabilized in the second half of last year, after having loosened from extremely tight conditions. The rise in the unemployment rate since mid-2023 largely reflected weaker hiring, as job seekers entering or re-entering the labor force are taking longer to find work, while layoffs have remained low. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has remained close to the pre-pandemic level in recent months, and there are still more available jobs than available workers. The labor market no longer appears to be especially tight, but wage growth remains somewhat above the pace consistent with our inflation goal.</p>
<p>I hope the revision of the Bureau of Labor Statistics labor data, which will be released next week, will more accurately capture the changing dynamics of immigration and net business creation and bring more clarity on the underlying pace of job growth. It is crucial that U.S. official data accurately capture structural changes in labor markets in real time, such as those in recent years, so we can more confidently rely on these data for monetary and economic policymaking. In the meantime, given conflicting economic signals, measurement challenges, and significant data revisions, I remain cautious about taking signal from only a limited set of real-time data releases.</p>
<p>Assuming the economy evolves as I expect, I think that inflation will slow further this year. Its progress may be bumpy and uneven, and the upcoming inflation data for the first quarter will be an important indication of how quickly this will happen. That said, I continue to see greater risks to price stability, especially while the labor market remains near full employment.</p>
<p>Despite the prospect for some reduction in geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Asia, global supply chains continue to be susceptible to disruptions, which could result in inflationary effects on food, energy, and other commodity markets. In addition, the release of pent-up demand following the election, especially with improving consumer and business sentiment, could lead to stronger economic activity, which could increase inflationary pressures.</p>
<p><strong>The Path Forward</strong><br />As we enter a new phase in the process of moving the federal funds rate toward a more neutral policy stance, I would prefer that future adjustments to the policy rate be gradual. We should take time to carefully assess the progress in achieving our inflation and employment goals and consider changes to the policy rate based on how the data evolves.</p>
<p>Given the current stance of policy, I continue to be concerned that easier financial conditions over the past year may have contributed to the lack of further progress on slowing inflation. In light of the ongoing strength in the economy and with equity prices substantially higher than a year ago, it seems unlikely that the overall level of interest rates and borrowing costs are exerting meaningful restraint.</p>
<p>I am also closely watching the increase in longer-term Treasury yields since we started the recalibration of our policy stance at the September meeting. Some have interpreted it as a reflection of investors' concerns about the possibility of tighter-than-expected policy that may be required to address inflationary pressures. In light of these considerations, I continue to prefer a cautious and gradual approach to adjusting policy.</p>
<p>There is still more work to be done to bring inflation closer to our 2 percent goal. I would like to see progress in lowering inflation resume before we make further adjustments to the target range. We need to keep inflation in focus while the labor market appears to be in balance and the unemployment rate continues to be at historically low levels. By the time of our March meeting, we will have received two inflation and two employment reports. I look forward to reviewing the first quarter inflation data, which, as I noted earlier, will be key to understanding the path of inflation going forward. I do expect that inflation will begin to decline again and that by year-end it will be lower than where it now stands.</p>
<p>Looking forward, it is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. At each FOMC meeting, my colleagues and I will make our decisions based on the incoming data and the implications for and risks to the outlook and guided by the Fed's dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. I will also continue to meet with a broad range of contacts as I assess the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance.</p>
<p>Bringing inflation in line with our price stability goal is essential for sustaining a healthy labor market and fostering an economy that works for everyone in the longer run.</p>
<p><strong>Perspective on Mutual and Community Banks</strong><br />Turning to banking, I will start with a brief discussion of the important role of mutual banks in the banking system before addressing other bank regulatory issues. One of the unique characteristics of the U.S. banking system is the broad scope of institutions it includes and the wide range of customers and communities it serves. Given this institutional diversity, regulators must strive to foster a financial system that enables each and every bank, no matter its size, to thrive, supporting a vibrant economy and financial system.</p>
<p><strong>Mutual Bank Issues</strong><br />In the Northeast, everyone is familiar with mutual banks given their significant presence in this region. Since the early 1800s, these banks have been dedicated to serving their local communities.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250131a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;Their ownership structure differs from traditional banks in that mutuals are owned by their depositors, rather than by shareholders. Like other community banks, they focus on local issues that are important to their communities and to their depositors.</p>
<p>Many of the challenges mutual banks face are similar to those faced by other financial institutions, including competition from other banks, credit unions, and non-banks. But mutual banks also face unique issues that can add cost and expense to their operations. Two issues I would like to discuss are the challenges mutual institutions face raising capital, and unique procedural hurdles mutuals face in managing the dividend process. While these issues are unique to mutuals, both highlight the challenges of a lack of transparency, and insufficient focus on efficiency.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250131a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>Just as with other community banks, a challenge for many mutuals is the difficulty of raising additional capital. This difficulty is exacerbated by their ownership structure, which typically requires mutuals to rely heavily on retained earnings. Although mutual institutions have historically been more highly capitalized relative to their stock-owned peers, if a mutual capital raise is needed, it would be helpful to provide some regulatory flexibility in the process. Recently, some mutuals have issued subordinated debt as a form of capital, but another form of regulatory capital may be preferable: mutual capital certificates.</p>
<p>To date, it has been unclear whether mutual capital certificates qualify as regulatory capital. These instruments could provide mutual banks an additional way to raise capital without disrupting their mutual structure. In my view, the banking agencies should be receptive to these kinds of instruments to ensure that mutual banks can both raise capital and maintain their depositor-owned structure. Mutuals need clarity and transparency about the regulatory treatment of these instruments and whether they qualify as regulatory capital.</p>
<p>Another concern for mutuals is the annual requirement to receive regulatory approval for a mutual holding company's waiver of a dividend issued by its subsidiary bank.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250131a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;The Board practice is to require a mutual holding company to submit an application each year to implement a waiver. This prior approval requirement is complex and imposes significant costs on these small institutions, reducing the investment they can make in their communities. Because of the time and expense of these waiver requirements, it is possible that the inefficiencies of the required application process erode the value of a mutual holding company structure, which would further constrain a mutual bank's ability to raise capital.</p>
<p>Since the Board has nearly 20 years of experience considering these waiver requests, it seems appropriate to consider whether the applications process for these waivers is efficient. What lessons have we learned? Is the prior approval requirement effective in its review of holding companies waiving receipt of their dividends, or can this be resolved in a more efficient and cost effective manner? In my view, the Board should consider whether this process is effective and efficient in addressing concerns related to dividend waivers.</p>
<p>Mutual banks, like all community banks, are vital to the economic success of their communities. It is critical that our applications process not act as a limit on a particular type of institution simply due to regulatory inaction or lack of clarity and transparency. Regulators must find efficient and effective ways to support a vibrant and diverse banking system that enables these and other small institutions to thrive while supporting and investing in their local economy.</p>
<p><strong>Tailoring</strong><br />Transparency and efficiency are just two of the necessary components of a regulatory approach that promotes a healthy and vibrant banking system. Another component that I speak about frequently is the use of "tailoring" in the regulatory framework. For those familiar with my philosophy on bank regulation and supervision, my interest and focus on tailoring will come as no surprise.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250131a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;In its most basic form, it is difficult to disagree with the virtue of regulatory and supervisory tailoring&mdash;calibrating the requirements and expectations imposed on a firm based on its size, business model, risk profile, and complexity&mdash;as a reasonable, appropriate and responsible approach for bank regulation and supervision. In fact, tailoring is embedded in the statutory fabric of the Federal Reserve's bank regulatory responsibilities.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250131a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a></p>
<p>The bank regulatory framework inherently includes significant costs&mdash;both the cost of operating the banking agencies, and the cost to the banking industry of complying with regulations, the examination process, and supplying information to regulators both through formal information collections and through one-off requests. In the aggregate, these costs can ultimately affect the price and availability of credit, geographic access to banking services, and the broader economy. The cost of this framework&mdash;both to regulators and to the industry&mdash;reflects layers of policy decisions over many years. But this framework could be more effective in balancing the mandate to promote safety and soundness with the need to have a banking system that promotes economic growth.</p>
<p>For example, let's consider costs. As regulatory and supervisory demands grow, there is often parallel growth in the staff and budgets of the banking agencies. We should not only be cognizant of these costs, but we should act in a way that requires efficiency while ensuring safety and soundness. Some degree of elasticity in regulator capacity is necessary to respond to evolving economic and banking conditions, as well as emerging risks, but there must be reasonable constraints on growth. Expansion of the regulatory framework is not a cost-free endeavor, and the costs are shouldered by taxpayers, banks, and, ultimately, bank customers.</p>
<p>The bank regulatory framework has great potential to provide significant benefits, including supporting an innovative banking system that enhances trust and confidence in our institutions, and promotes safety and soundness. When we consider the benefits and the costs, we can institute greater efficiencies in both banking regulation and in the banking industry itself. The bank regulatory framework is complex, and the various elements of this framework are intended to work in a complementary way. As banks evolve&mdash;by growing larger, or by engaging in new activities&mdash;tailoring can help us to quickly recalibrate requirements in light of the new risks posed by the firm.</p>
<p>But the regulatory framework, especially how supervisors prioritize its application to the banking industry, can pose a serious threat to a bank's viability. For example, imposing the same regulatory requirements on banks with assets of $2 billion to $2 trillion under the new rules implementing the Community Reinvestment Act demonstrated a missed opportunity to promote greater effectiveness and efficiency.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250131a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;I question the wisdom of applying the same evaluation standards to banks within such a broad range.</p>
<p>Likewise, supervisory guidance can provide fertile ground to differentiate supervisory expectations under a more tailored approach. While supervisory guidance is not binding on banks as a legal matter, it can signal how regulators think about particular risks and activities, and often drives community banks to reallocate resources in a way that may not be necessary or appropriate. The Fed's guidance on third-party risk management is an example of this. Originally, this guidance was published in a way that applied to all banks, including community banks. Yet, it was acknowledged even at the time of publication that it had known shortcomings, particularly in terms of its administration and lack of clarity for community banks.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250131a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a></p>
<p>Tailoring is important for all banks, but it is particularly important for community banks. There are real costs not only to banks, but to communities, when the framework is insufficiently tailored, as community banks faced with excessive regulatory burdens may be forced to raise prices or shut their doors completely. These banks often reach unbanked or underbanked corners of the U.S. economy, not only in terms of the customers they serve but also in terms of their geographic footprint. We are all familiar with banking deserts and the challenges many legitimate and law-abiding businesses and consumers have in accessing basic banking services and credit. It is difficult to imagine that a system with far fewer banks would as effectively serve U.S. banking and credit needs and sufficiently to support economic growth.</p>
<p>It is imperative that we keep the benefits of tailoring in focus as the bank regulatory framework evolves. A tailored regulatory and supervisory approach can help inform our policies on a wide range of industry issues that are likely to emerge in the coming years.</p>
<p><strong>Problem-Based Solutions</strong><br />One of the most difficult challenges on the regulatory front is prioritization, both for banks managing their businesses and for regulators deciding how to fulfill their responsibilities. At a basic level, the role of regulators is dictated by statute. Congress granted the Federal Reserve and other banking agencies broad statutory powers but has constrained how those powers may be directed through the use of statutory mandates, including to promote a safe and sound banking system, and broader U.S. financial stability. In the execution of these responsibilities, the Federal Reserve must also balance the need to act in a way that enables the banking system to serve the U.S. economy and promote economic growth. While these objectives are not incompatible, they do require us to consider tradeoffs when establishing policy.</p>
<p>How can regulators best meet these responsibilities? As many of you may already know, I strongly believe in a pragmatic approach to policymaking.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250131a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;This requires us to identify the problem we are trying to solve, determine whether we are the appropriate regulator to address the problem based on our statutory mandates and authorities, and explore options for addressing the identified issue.</p>
<p>As a first step, we must be attuned to the banking system and how regulatory actions affect that system. We oversee a wide range of banks of varying sizes, activities, affiliates, and complexity. These banks interact with a range of service providers, financial market utilities, payments providers, and non-bank partners, regularly competing with non-bank financial intermediaries. The banking system can be a key driver of business formation, economic expansion, and opportunity.</p>
<p>As we look at the banking system, including the regulatory framework, we must focus on those issues that are most important to advancing statutory priorities. There is always the risk of misidentification and mis-prioritization, and that we fail to take appropriately robust action on key issues or focus on issues that are less material to a bank's safety and soundness. Our goal should be to develop a better filter to promote appropriate and effective prioritization.</p>
<p><em>Fraud</em><br />We have seen several instances where this filter did not produce appropriate results, as we have recently seen with fraud. The incidence of fraud, particularly check fraud, has been rising substantially over the past few years, causing harm to banks, damaging the perceived safety of the banking system, and importantly hurting consumers who are the victims of fraudulent activity. Sometimes these efforts target vulnerable populations, like the elderly, who are particularly susceptible to certain forms of fraud.</p>
<p>Despite this known problem, efforts by regulators have been frustratingly slow to advance, and seem to have done little to address the underlying root causes of this increase in fraud. Why has this important issue failed to garner greater attention from all of the appropriate regulatory and law enforcement bodies? Different governmental agencies may share an important role in addressing this problem, but the need for a joint and coordinated solution does not excuse collective inaction.</p>
<p><em>Climate-Related Financial Risk</em><br />Of course, not every issue falls within the scope of the Federal Reserve's responsibilities. Even when policymakers identify an issue or priority that they would like to pursue, it is imperative to ask whether that priority falls within the scope of our mandate and authorities. Statutes and regulations, paired with the "soft" power of examination, can be deployed in ways that may not be primarily directed towards the priorities mandated for banking regulators. I've noted previously that the banking agencies' climate-related financial risk guidance arguably pushes the boundaries of appropriate regulatory responsibilities. Banks have long been required to manage all material risks, including weather- and climate-related risks. And while this additional guidance seemed to do little to advance the goals of promoting the safe and sound operation of banks it, in effect, posed significant risks of influencing credit allocation decisions. Ultimately, banking regulators should not dictate credit allocation decisions, either by rule or through supervision. Bank regulatory policy should be used to address the needs of the unbanked and expand the availability of banking services. It should not be used to limit or exclude access to banking services for legitimate customers and businesses in a way that is meant to further unrelated policy goals, sometimes referred to as "de-banking."</p>
<p>Once we have identified problems and determined that they are within the Fed's responsibility, we must consider alternative approaches to address them, focusing on identifying efficient solutions. New technologies and services often require novel regulatory and supervisory approaches, and we recognize that past approaches may not be effective. Often regulators take a "more is better" approach to regulation and guidance. Over the past several years, the banking industry has faced an onslaught of proposed and final regulations and guidance, materials that require a significant time commitment to review, to comment on, and to implement. Many times, these require changes to policies and procedures or risk management practices.</p>
<p>It is critical that in our urgency to address issues in the banking system&mdash;particularly for community banks&mdash;that we consider not just the direct and indirect effects of regulatory action but also this cumulative burden. Community banks are resilient and dedicated to serving their communities, but at some point, the cumulative burden of the bank regulatory framework can adversely affect the availability and pricing of banking services and threaten the ongoing viability of the community bank model. The community banks in this country are important economically and to their communities, and we should strive to support these institutions and their ongoing viability.</p>
<p><strong>Other Notable Issues and Concerns</strong><br />In preparation for today's event, conference attendees were asked to submit questions in advance. So before concluding my remarks I'd like to address a few of these, since we won't be able to do a live Q&amp;A session in this virtual format. Thank you for submitting your questions in advance.</p>
<p><strong>As community bankers, we are deeply invested in supporting the growth and resilience of our local economies. With ongoing regulatory pressures, what specific actions can the Federal Reserve take to ensure smaller institutions like ours remain competitive and capable of delivering the personalized service that our communities depend on?</strong><br />One of the things I think is critical in identifying how to support community banks is listening to the industry&mdash;which issues are top-of-mind for you? Being an effective regulator requires a degree of humility, and receptiveness to hearing about issues that affect the business of banking, particularly when there are alternative ways that regulators can better promote safety and soundness, or where regulatory actions have resulted in unintended consequences. At the same time, during my conversations with banks, a few themes have emerged that deserve attention. This will be a non-exclusive list, but hopefully will give you a sense of the types of issues and concerns that I hear about most frequently when talking to community banks.</p>
<p>First, I think there is room to improve the transparency of regulatory communication. Banks should not be left to guess what regulators think about the permissibility of particular activities, or what parameters and rules should apply to those activities. Uncertainty discourages investments in innovation and the expansion of banking activities, products, and services, and can call into question whether internal processes and procedures are consistent with supervisory expectations. Banks already must confront the challenges of dealing with evolving economic and credit conditions, regulators should not compound these challenges through opaque expectations and standards.</p>
<p>Second, I think we need to address shortcomings in the processing of banking applications, employing a more nimble and predictable approach specifically in the de novo formation and mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) contexts. Today, the process to obtain regulatory approval can be influenced by many factors under a bank's control&mdash;for example, the completeness of the application filed and responsiveness to addressing questions and providing necessary additional information. However, the timeline for application decisions is often uncertain and beyond the bank's control. This can be due to questions about the minimum amount of capital needed and early-stage supervisory expectations (for a de novo bank), or uncertainty about the competitive effects of a transaction, or the filing of a public comment raising concerns about an application in the M&amp;A context.</p>
<p>Finally, I think regulatory and supervisory "trickle-down" is real and it has significantly harmed community banks. I am referring to regulators conveying expectations to community banks (for example, during the examination process) that lack a foundation in applicable rules or guidance, or that were designed for larger institutions, or based on a horizontal review of unique banks.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to insulate community banks from the harmful consequences of "trickle-down," and broader structural changes may be needed to shield them from inapplicable and unreasonable expectations. At the same time, we must preserve strong supervisory standards as banks cross asset thresholds, so banks that grow larger and riskier are subject to appropriately tailored and calibrated requirements and expectations. I would also note that some degree of "trickle down" has occurred over time because the regulatory asset "line" defining community banks has remained constant at $10 billion in assets for over a decade. During that time, the economy has grown significantly, and inflation has rendered this asset definition obsolete. Many "community banks"&mdash;as defined by business model and activities rather than asset size&mdash;now exceed the threshold and must comply with broader regulatory requirements that may be excessive.</p>
<p><strong>What support or guidance can community banks expect from the Federal Reserve as we navigate technological innovation and increased cybersecurity threats?</strong><br />Both innovation and cybersecurity are issues that are top of mind for me. Innovation has always been a priority for banks of all sizes and business models. Banks in the U.S. have a long history of developing and implementing new technologies, and innovation has the potential to make the banking and payments systems faster and more efficient, to bring new products and services to customers, and even to enhance safety and soundness.</p>
<p>Regulators must be open to innovation in the banking system. Our goal should be to build and support a clear and sensible regulatory framework that anticipates ongoing and evolving innovation&mdash;one that allows the private sector to innovate while also maintaining appropriate safeguards. We must promote innovation through transparency and open communication, including demonstrating a willingness to engage during the development process. By providing clarity and consistency, we can encourage long-term business investment, while also continuing to support today's products and services. A clear regulatory framework would also empower supervisors to focus on safety and soundness, while ensuring a safe and efficient banking and payment system.</p>
<p>On cybersecurity, banks often note cybersecurity and third-party risk management as areas that raise significant concerns. Cyber-related events, including ransomware attacks and business email compromises, are costly in terms of expense and reputation, and are time-consuming events that pose unique challenges for community banks.</p>
<p>The maintenance of cyber assets and technology resources required to support a successful cybersecurity program are often difficult for smaller banks. Regulators can promote cybersecurity, and stronger cyber-incident "resilience" and response capabilities by identifying resources and opportunities, such as exercises, for banks to develop "muscle memory" in cyber incident response.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve plays an important role in supervising banks and supporting risk management practices. For example, the Federal Reserve hosts the Midwest Cyber Workshop, with the Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago, Kansas City, and St. Louis.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250131a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;Over the past couple of years, this workshop has provided a forum to discuss cyber risk among community bankers, regulators, law enforcement, and other industry stakeholders. Community banks can also turn to the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) website, which includes the FFIEC Cybersecurity Resource Guide and links to other external cybersecurity resources.</p>
<p>We know well that cyber threats pose real risks to the banking system, and we recognize that community banks may have unique needs in preventing, remediating, and responding to cyber threats. Regulators should, therefore, ensure that a range of resources are available to support banks and seek further opportunities to help build bank resilience against these threats.</p>
<p><strong>Community banks are integral to rural and underserved communities. How can the Federal Reserve support us in maintaining our presence in these areas, particularly amid ongoing consolidation trends?</strong><br />As I noted earlier, it is essential that the U.S. banking system is broad and diverse, including institutions of all sizes serving all the different markets across the country. Community banks play a particularly valuable role in rural and underserved communities, and we need to ensure that the community banking model remains viable into the future.</p>
<p>To do that, we need to have a regulatory system in which both de novo bank formations and M&amp;A transactions are possible. Viable formation and merger options for banks of all sizes are necessary to avoid creating a "barbell" of the very largest and very smallest banks in the banking system, with the number of community banks continuing to erode over time.</p>
<p>M&amp;A ensures that banks have a meaningful path to transitioning bank ownership. In the absence of a viable M&amp;A framework, there is potential for additional risks, including limited opportunities for succession planning, especially in smaller or rural communities. Uncertainty related to the M&amp;A process also may act as a deterrent to de novo bank formation, as potential bank founders may stay on the sidelines knowing that future exit strategies&mdash;like the strategic acquisition of a de novo bank by a larger peer&mdash;may face long odds of success.</p>
<p>Another challenge particularly in rural markets are the competitive "screens" that are used to evaluate the competitive effects of a proposed merger. Using these screens often results in a finding that M&amp;A transactions in rural markets can have an adverse effect on competition and should therefore be disallowed.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250131a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;Even when these transactions are eventually approved, the mechanical approach to analyzing competitive effects often requires additional review or analysis and can lead to extensive delays in the regulatory approval process. Reducing the efficiency of the bank M&amp;A process can be a deterrent to healthy bank transactions&mdash;it can reduce the effectiveness of M&amp;A and de novo activity that preserves the presence of community banks in underserved areas, prevent institutions from pursuing prudent growth strategies, and actually undermine competition by preventing firms from growing to a larger scale.</p>

<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has secured a confiscation order of &pound;5,963,376.15, against convicted fraudster Guy Flintham.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>Mr Flintham is serving a 6-year prison sentence having pleaded guilty to fraud by false representation. The fraudulent investment scheme operated by Mr Flintham took &pound;19m from over 240 investors.</p>
<p>He made several fraudulent claims to investors, including about how the scheme was operated and the profits they were making. He falsified documents to support his claims.</p>
<p>The court determined that Mr Flintham&rsquo;s criminal benefit was &pound;23,932,204.84, with the confiscation order amount being owed a &pound;5,963,376.15, based on the court&rsquo;s findings as to his available assets. The confiscated funds will be distributed to the victims of his crimes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The court has imposed a default prison sentence of 2 years on Mr Flintham, meaning that if he does not satisfy the terms of the confiscation order within 3 months, he will serve this further term of imprisonment in addition to the 6 years he is already serving.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steve Smart, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said: 'Mr Flintham deliberately lied and misled people, causing them serious harm. This order sends a signal to anyone who engages in fraud &ndash; your ill-gotten gains are not safe even when you&rsquo;re behind bars.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The FCA will now contact the identified victims of Mr Flintham&rsquo;s fraud to provide further information.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ol>
<li>Guy Flintham&rsquo;s date of birth is 7 July 1977.</li>
<li>Guy Flintham&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/guy-flintham-pleads-guilty-to-fraud" title="Guy Flintham pleads guilty to fraud">pleaded guilty to fraud</a>&nbsp;by false representation contrary to section 1 of the Fraud Act 2006.&nbsp;</li>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Sets Out Further Proposals To Support Growing Business And Investment Opportunities</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has set out proposals to make it easier for listed companies to issue corporate bonds that wealth managers and retail investors can buy.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p><span>The FCA is consulting on a single standard for corporate bond prospectuses, covering both large and small (less than &pound;100,000) bond sizes. This would reduce costs and barriers for companies raising capital and give investors the information they need to make an informed decision.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The aim is to encourage companies listed on stock exchanges to offer bonds in smaller sizes, improving investment opportunities for wealth managers and retail investors. More flexible and cheaper capital raising should help UK listed companies to grow.</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA is also proposing to simplify the requirements that apply to listed companies when they issue further securities. Among other changes, the FCA is proposing to streamline the process by cutting red tape.</span></p>
<p><span>The new public offer platforms will offer an alternative route for companies to raise capital, including from retail investors, and promote scale-up capital raising for smaller companies.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It will enable companies to make larger offers of shares or bonds to a broad investor base outside of public markets via an authorised firm, similar to crowdfunding platforms. Having clear and consistent requirements for firms, and setting out what firms need to become authorised, will build confidence in the new platforms and enable firms to access a wider pool of investors.</span></p>
<p><span>Simon Walls, interim executive director of markets at the FCA, said:</span></p>
<p><span>'We&rsquo;re opening the door for corporates to issue bonds in small sizes so that a wider range of investors can invest in them. That&rsquo;s more funding for companies, more easily, and more choice for investors too.</span></p>
<p><span>'We want to make sure investors have the information they need to make informed decisions about risk while removing unnecessary costs and widening access.'</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA recently set out proposals for a new private stock market, PISCES, on which shares in private companies will be bought and sold. This follows the FCA&rsquo;s wide-ranging reforms to the UK&rsquo;s world-leading markets to boost competitiveness, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>helping a wider range of companies to list on a UK exchange</span></li>
<li><span>making it cheaper and easier for companies to raise money in the UK</span></li>
<li><span>giving asset managers greater freedom in how they pay for investment research</span></li>
<li><span>opening the Digital Securities Sandbox so firms can test innovative new technologies</span></li>
<li><span>delivering a plan for regulating cryptoassets</span></li>
</ul>

<title>Cboe Clear Europe Celebrates 2024 Milestones And Unveils 2025 Strategic Plans</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Cboe Clear Europe, a leading pan-European clearing house, provides an overview of its 2024 key milestones and shares its plans for 2025.</p>
<ul>
<li><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2024 milestone achievements</span></b>:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Record market share</b>:  
<ul>
<li>In cash equities, Cboe Clear Europe (CCE) strengthened       its position as the largest pan-European clearing house, clearing 1.2bn       client trades - a 5% increase on 2023.&nbsp; </li>
<li>CCE ended the year with a record market share of 45.4%       on interoperable venues, up from 41.6% in 2023. </li>
<li>CCE achieved significant growth across the Nordic       region, with standout growth on Euronext Oslo, where its cleared volumes       grew 74% year-over-year.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>New venues</b>:  
<ul>
<li>CCE cleared in October 2024 its first trades on       Deutsche B&ouml;rse, marking the introduction of clearing choice in the German       market. Since this launch, the firm has cleared over 17,000 trades and       continues to welcome new users to its service. </li>
<li>CCE also initiated clearing for the Spotlight Stock       Market, a Swedish growth market, in early December - representing its       47th venue connection.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>CEDX growth</b>:  
<ul>
<li>CCE continued its support of Cboe Europe Derivatives       (CEDX), Cboe&rsquo;s pan-European equity derivatives marketplace. This includes       assisting with the significant expansion of its suite of single-stock       options during the year, which now comprises single-stock options on over       320 leading European companies from 14 countries. </li>
<li>Cboe Clear Europe cleared a record 210k lots over the       year, up from 94k in 2023, with Interactive Brokers joining as a new       direct trading and clearing member in July.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>New members</b>:  
<ul>
<li>CCE welcomed European financial group, Oddo BHF, and       French leader in Internet stock trading, Bourse Direct,&nbsp;as new       clearing members in 2024 &ndash; their 47<sup>th</sup> and 48<sup>th</sup> members, respectively.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2025 strategic plans</span></b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>SFT clearing</b>:  
<ul>
<li>CCE obtained regulatory approval in November 2024 to       clear Securities Financing Transactions (SFT). The firm is preparing to       clear the first trades and will be building out this new clearing       ecosystem in collaboration with market participants throughout the year. </li>
<li>The firm is in advanced discussions with various       firms, including banks, asset managers, broker-dealers, and agent       lenders, to ensure a smooth launch in the near future.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Commenting on the SFT clearing, <b>Vikesh Patel, President at Cboe Clear Europe</b>, said<i>:</i> <i>&ldquo;Our new SFT clearing solution will revolutionise the current bilateral process for SFTs into a centrally cleared model, thereby supporting the growth of this key market. Participants will be able to reduce their risk-weighted asset exposures associated with SFTs, as well as introduce various capital and operational advantages, such as greater settlement efficiencies, elimination of agent lender disclosures, and improved practices around corporate actions. This new service underscores our dedication to providing innovative clearing solutions across multiple asset classes.&rdquo;</i></p>
<ul>
<li><b>CEDX and Derivatives</b>:  
<ul>
<li>CCE will continue to support the growth of CEDX and       showcase the benefits this marketplace offers from a post-trade       perspective &ndash; contributing to the continued expansion of this emerging       European derivatives market.</li>
<li>By allowing pan-European index and single-stock       options to be cleared at a CCP, the combined service seeks to provide       significant capital efficiencies to participants and challenges the       status quo of how European derivatives have historically been cleared.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>OTC equities</b>:  
<ul>
<li>CCE will aim to activate our collaboration with DTCC       to improve the workflow around OTC equities trades during the first half       of the year. This initiative will enable CCE to introduce clearing for       trades traditionally settled OTC between executing and prime brokers on       DTCC CTM's tri-party trade matching workflow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Commenting on CCE&rsquo;s venue connectivity, <b>Vikesh Patel, President at Cboe Clear Europe</b>, said<i>:</i> <i>&ldquo;In equities, we remain proud of our status as the most-connected CCP in Europe and will continue to focus on strengthening our venue coverage. Looking ahead, we see opportunities in gaining access to Europe&rsquo;s listing exchanges for which we don&rsquo;t currently clear &ndash; promoting clearing choice in vertically integrated markets.&rdquo;</i></p>

<title>ACERâs Data Dashboard Provides Insights Into EU Household Energy Price Trends</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/acers-data-dashboard-provides-insights-into-eu-household-energy-price-trends/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/acers-data-dashboard-provides-insights-into-eu-household-energy-price-trends/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ACER has updated its data dashboard, which tracks monthly changes in household energy prices across EU Member States and Norway from January 2019 to December 2024.</p>
<p>The dashboard provides valuable insights for policymakers, consumer protection groups, and EU citizens by highlighting trends in end-user electricity and gas prices, supporting informed decisions on energy affordability and system costs.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the key findings?</span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Electricity prices:</strong>&nbsp;In 2024, household electricity prices decreased by 5% compared to 2023. This was mainly due to a 17% fall in the energy component of prices. However, this decline was partially offset by higher network costs and the phasing out of certain subsidies. In Q4, prices and their composition remained steady, showing no significant changes compared to the previous quarter.</li>
<li><strong>Gas prices:</strong>&nbsp;Similarly, household gas prices fell by an average of 7% in 2024, driven by the&nbsp;20% drop in the energy component. Removal of subsidies contributed to a rise in the tax component, partially offsetting the decrease. In the last quarter, the average end-user gas prices slightly increased.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What lies ahead?</span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></strong></p>
<p>The drop in energy costs reflects the impact of Europe's growing use of renewable energy. However, as renewable energy generation expands, there will be a need for substantial investment in energy infrastructure, which could lead to higher network costs in the future.</p>
<p>The European Commission&rsquo;s upcoming Action Plan on Energy Affordability will be key in addressing these challenges. The current trends highlight the importance of looking at the overall costs of the energy system (including network and infrastructure expenses), rather than focusing solely on commodity costs.</p>
<p>ACER will continue updating the dashboard quarterly to monitor the developments in energy affordability for European consumers.</p>

<title>U.S. Department Of The Treasury Withdraws From The Network Of Central Banks And Supervisors For Greening The Financial System (NGFS)</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury&rsquo;s (Treasury) Federal Insurance Office (FIO) today notified the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) that it is withdrawing its membership.</p>
<p>Withdrawal from NGFS is one part of implementing President Trump&rsquo;s Executive Orders Putting America First in International Environmental Agreements and Unleashing American Energy. &nbsp;NGFS was organized to help to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, from which the United States withdrew.&nbsp; NGFS&rsquo;s initiatives are inconsistent with this Administration&rsquo;s priorities to grow the U.S. economy and American jobs, and NGFS&rsquo;s role diverges from the traditional technical and coordinating roles of other international fora. Important parts of NGFS&rsquo;s scope, including on monetary policy frameworks, go beyond FIO&rsquo;s core duties.&nbsp; FIO will continue to engage with state insurance regulators and other stakeholders to promote U.S. interests in international insurance engagements.&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) Regional Consultative Group for the Middle East and North Africa (RCG MENA) met on 29 and 30 January 2025 in Sharm El Sheikh, hosted by the Central Bank of Egypt. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The meeting started with an overview of the&nbsp;<a class="status-publish" href="https://www.fsb.org/2025/01/fsb-work-programme-for-2025/">FSB&rsquo;s work programme for 2025</a>. Members exchanged views on how to best incorporate their regional perspective into the planned initiatives. Accelerating progress in cross-border payments, strengthening the resilience of non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI), and implementing the&nbsp;<a class="status-publish" href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/07/fsb-global-regulatory-framework-for-crypto-asset-activities/">FSB&rsquo;s regulatory framework for crypto-assets&nbsp;</a>were considered among the areas most relevant for the MENA region.</p>
<p>On the topic of cross-border payments, members discussed the FSB&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a class="status-publish" href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/10/g20-roadmap-for-enhancing-cross-border-payments-consolidated-progress-report-for-2024/">2024 progress report on the G20 Roadmap for cross-border payments</a>&nbsp;and the challenges to further improve the speed and cost of transactions. These challenges include frictions that arise from the laws, rules, and regulatory requirements for collecting, storing, and managing data that must accompany a cross-border payment. To address this, implementation of the<a class="status-publish" href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/12/recommendations-to-promote-alignment-and-interoperability-across-data-frameworks-related-to-cross-border-payments-final-report/">&nbsp;FSB&rsquo;s recommendations to promote interoperability in data frameworks</a>&nbsp;was seen as a priority.</p>
<p>Members reviewed recent NBFI developments, drawing on the findings of the FSB&rsquo;s latest&nbsp;<a class="status-publish" href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/12/global-monitoring-report-on-non-bank-financial-intermediation-2024/">Global Monitoring Report on Non-Bank Financial Intermediation</a>&nbsp;and were briefed by IOSCO on its recent publications on open-ended funds and liquidity risk management in collective investment schemes. They also discussed the FSB&rsquo;s proposed package of&nbsp;<a class="status-publish" href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/12/leverage-in-non-bank-financial-intermediation-consultation-report/">recommendations to address leverage in the NBFI sector</a>, and the approach to equip authorities with the flexibility needed to address specific risks within jurisdictions, while allowing for a consistency of outcomes across jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Members shared experiences of crypto usage in their jurisdictions and progress in the development of regulatory frameworks for crypto-assets and stablecoins, including challenges in implementing the FSB&rsquo;s recommendations.</p>
<p>Finally, members exchanged views on global and regional market developments, including perspectives on the outlook for financial stability and geopolitical risks; high levels of sovereign debt could become a source of vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h2>
<p>The FSB RCG for the Middle East and North Africa is co-chaired by Governor Ayman M. Al-Sayari, Saudi Central Bank, and Governor Hassan Abdalla, Central Bank of Egypt. Membership includes financial authorities from Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, T&uuml;rkiye and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>The FSB has six Regional Consultative Groups, established under the FSB Charter, to bring together financial authorities from FSB member and non-member countries to exchange views on vulnerabilities affecting financial systems and on initiatives to promote financial stability.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Typically, each Regional Consultative Group meets twice each year.</p>
<p>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. The FSB also conducts outreach with approximately 70 other jurisdictions through its six Regional Consultative Groups.</p>
<p>The FSB is chaired by Klaas Knot, President of De Nederlandsche Bank. The FSB Secretariat is located in Basel, Switzerland and hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>
<ol class="wp-block-footnotes">
<li id="061e2765-8b3a-482c-8f15-ecacef2bb0b1">The FSB Regional Consultative Groups cover the following regions: Americas, Asia, Commonwealth of Independent States, Europe, Middle East and North Africa, and sub-Saharan Africa.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2025/01/fsb-mena-group-discusses-cross-border-payments-non-bank-financial-intermediation-and-crypto-asset-recommendations/#061e2765-8b3a-482c-8f15-ecacef2bb0b1-link">â©ï¸</a></li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/page/small-business-capital-formation-advisory-committee">Small Business Capital Formation Advisory Committee</a>&nbsp;today released the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/meetings-events/sbcfac-agenda-022525">agenda</a>&nbsp;for its meeting on Tuesday, Feb. 25, 2025, which will include discussion of capital raising challenges facing emerging fund managers and hurdles facing small public companies not listed on a national securities exchange. Members of the public can watch the live meeting via webcast on www.sec.gov.</p>
<p>The committee, which provides advice and recommendations to the Commission on rules, regulations, and policy matters relating to small businesses, will start the morning session by hearing from SEC Office of the Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation staff, who will provide an overview of its 2024 Annual Report, which includes in-depth data on the state of capital raising activity from startup to small cap along with the office&rsquo;s policy recommendations. The committee will spend the rest of the morning exploring ways to support and facilitate capital formation for emerging fund managers, building upon ideas generated during a previous committee meeting. To facilitate discussion, committee members will hear from Ashok Kamal, Executive Director at NuFund Venture Group, and Sara Zulkosky, Co-Founder &amp; Managing Partner at Recast Capital.</p>
<p>In the afternoon session, the committee will explore the challenges of small public companies not listed on a national securities exchange. Understanding the decision-points and challenges those companies face is critical to fostering access to capital for, and investor participation in, those smaller public companies. As part of the discussion, members will hear from Dan Zinn, General Counsel and Chief of Staff at OTC Markets Group.</p>
<p>The full&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/meetings-events/sbcfac-agenda-022525">agenda</a>, meeting materials, and information on how to watch the meeting are available on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/page/small-business-capital-formation-advisory-committee">committee webpage</a>.</p>

<title>ACER Amends The Methodology For Harmonising Cross-Zonal Electricity Balancing Capacity Allocation</title>

<p>After&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsPAVcBWFVSB0xbUlJWHVYJDFcdU1sBABoABABVAQFRBgYFBlMdU1MHVwwHUgcdB1gBBx0GCwhfGgwGAAIZBFRRV1AOCVcAVVpXRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">consulting with stakeholders</a>&nbsp;in the autumn of 2024, ACER revised the TSOs&rsquo; proposal. Today, with its&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsPAwcCWFdSWkwBUgYGHVZdAVMdCgsDVhpUXVFRBgpQBQ8HAVUdU1MHVwwHUgcdB1gBBx0GCwhfGgwGAAIZBFRRV1AOCVcAVVpXRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Decision 01-2025</a>, ACER has adopted the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtSU1dXVlNSB0xbUlIHHVYNBQ8dCgwCVRoFUFFUV1FTVlAHAVIdU1MHVwwHUgcdB1gBBx0GCwhfGgwGAAIZBFRRV1AOCVcAVVpXRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">amended methodology</a>.</p>
<p>The methodology (approved by ACER in&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtVVQJTUQQBBkwBAgBbHVZcAVMdC1wDVBpUBwZSVlFTBlIFVAgdU1MHVwwHUgcdB1gBBx0GCwhfGgwGAAIZBFRRV1AOCVcAVVpXRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2023</a>) harmonises the processes (i.e., market-based and co-optimisation) that compare the market value of cross-zonal capacity between balancing capacity and day-ahead electricity markets. These processes rely on an algorithm that optimises the allocation of available cross-zonal capacity in a way that maximises overall market welfare.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why did ACER amend the methodology and what&rsquo;s new?</span></p>
<p>The updated methodology:</p>
<ul>
<li>clarifies the governance of the market-based process to ensure its efficient implementation and operation;</li>
<li>allows to establish rules for distributing congestion income resulting from cross-zonal capacity allocation among TSOs.</li>
</ul>
<p>ACER&rsquo;s Decision also grants TSOs more time to develop the harmonised market-based software and offers flexibility to those already operating regional market-based processes to adapt to the methodology&rsquo;s new requirements.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the next steps?</span></p>
<p>TSOs are required to develop the harmonised market-based software by June 2026.</p>
<p>Full implementation of the harmonised market-based allocation process is not expected before September 2027, pending approval from the relevant National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs).</p>
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtTBwUJVAMAVkwIUFFQHVYLDAAdClwGVxpWU1IDVQBUUVABAAkdU1MHVwwHUgcdB1gBBx0GCwhfGgwGAAIZBFRRV1AOCVcAVVpXRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Access the Decision</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>DFMGI achieved decade-high performance with 27.1% index growth at the end of December 2024. </li>
<li>Market capitalization surged by 32% to AED 907 billion.</li>
<li>DFM onboarded 138,262 new investors, 85% of whom were foreign nationals.</li>
<li>DFM raised AED 10.48 billion through three successful IPOs in 2024.</li>
<li>Board of Directors proposed cash dividend of AED 256 million, representing 97% of the total retained earnings available for distribution.</li>
</ul>
<p class="paragraph">Dubai Financial Market Company (PJSC) today announced its consolidated results for the fiscal year ending on 31st December 2024, highlighting a 24% increase in net profit (pre-tax) to AED 409.3 million, compared to AED 329.6 million in 2023. The growth was driven by robust trading volumes, strong capital inflows, a surge in both retail and institutional investor activity and sustained market performance in addition to investment returns performance.</p>
<p class="paragraph">DFM delivered a strong result for the period ending 31 December 2024, underscoring its position as the leading financial exchange in the region. The year witnessed three highly successful IPOs, including talabat's listing, which stood out as the largest global tech IPO of the year. The DFM General Index surged by 27.1%, closing at 5,158.67 on year end &mdash; its highest level since September 2014 &mdash; marking a remarkable decade-high milestone.

<p class="paragraph"><b>Trading and Market Performance</b></p>
<p class="paragraph">Performing at its highest level in a decade, DFM General Index recorded a 27.1% increase by the end of December 2024, reflecting the largest annual gain in three years. It further marks the fourth consecutive year of increase, reflecting strong investor confidence regionally as well as globally and the and steady market dynamics.</p>

Foreign investors contributed to 50% of the total trading value in 2024 compared to 47% in 2023 with market capitalization share at 21% at the close of the year. Additionally, the exchange witnessed a notable surge in interest from institutional investors, with their trading share rising sharply to 65% compared to 58% in 2023 reflecting the market&rsquo;s strong appeal for a broadening and increasingly diverse investor base.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><b>Dubai&rsquo;s Expanding IPO Market </b></p>
<p class="paragraph">DFM&rsquo;s IPO market had a robust year with three successful listings, across family business, private sector and government-related entity. Public offerings significantly boosted market activity, with listings from Parkin, Spinneys, and talabat raising AED 10.48 billion, a substantial increase from AED 1.97 billion raised through IPOs in 2023.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Talabat Holding plc, the region&rsquo;s premier on-demand delivery platform, raised AED 7.5 billion through its IPO. The listing drew significant demand from regional and international investors, standing out as the largest global technology IPO of the year. To address the exceptional demand, which included significant anchor orders from global long-term and technology-focused investors, the offering size was increased during the book-building phase from 15% to 20% of the company&rsquo;s total issued share capital.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Spinneys 1961 Holding plc, a premium grocery retailer, also made a notable debut on DFM. The IPO attracted AED 71 billion in orders and was oversubscribed by 64 times, making it one of the most sought-after non-government-related IPOs on DFM. The offering raised AED 1.38 billion and implied a market capitalization of AED 5.51 billion. Similarly, Parkin Company raised approximately AED 1.57 billion through its IPO.

The success of landmark IPOs in 2024, coupled with increased trading activity and foreign participation, reinforces Dubai&rsquo;s appeal as a preferred destination for companies and investors worldwide. Moving forward, we remain focused on creating a transparent and innovative marketplace to drive future growth</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="paragraph"><b>Driving Retail Investor Participation</b></p>
<p class="paragraph">Retail investor participation on the Dubai Financial Market (DFM) has grown substantially in 2024, Retail segment contributed 35% of total trading activity last year, highlighting the influence of retail investors, which was more evident in the recent IPOs, where retail tranches were expanded to meet strong demand: Spinneys increased its retail tranche from 5% to 7% while Parkin raised its tranche from 10% to 12%.</p>
<p class="paragraph">A major contributing factor has been DFM&rsquo;s accessibility enhancements for retail investors through digital platforms and streamlined subscription processes. The upgraded iVestor App launched in 2024, offers digital financial management for investors with seamless onboarding, direct IPO subscriptions, portfolio management, and dividend tracking, while the IPO Upgrade Program, enables investors to enhance their subscriptions by up to five times through leverage, thereby increasing their potential allocation in IPOs. These efforts have helped strengthen DFM&rsquo;s position as a leading hub for retail investor engagement, capturing approximately one-third of total retail IPO inflows.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><b>Strengthening Engagement Regionally and Globally</b></p>
<p class="paragraph">DFM successfully conducted its international investor roadshow in 2024, held in collaboration with HSBC in London. This roadshow featured 12 top-listed companies with a combined market capitalization of AED 326 billion and recorded a 20% increase in investor engagements compared to previous years.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Additionally, DFM&rsquo;s marquee event &mdash; the second edition of the Capital Market Summit &mdash; brought together over 1,000 delegates and 60 distinguished speakers, reinforcing its position as the region&rsquo;s premier gathering for capital markets. The event included discussions on key topics such as digital transformation of capital markets, MENA IPO pipeline and trajectory, venture capital growth, integration of AI and financial markets, as well as cross border stock exchange collaborations within GCC and globally across Swiss, Shenzhen and other markets. The summit also introduced ARENA by DFM, a new private platform that streamline access to capital by connecting investors with opportunities in diverse assets including private equity and private debt, with plans to introduce additional asset classes.</p>

<title>European Central Bank: Monetary Policy Decisions</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/european-central-bank-monetary-policy-decisions-17/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/european-central-bank-monetary-policy-decisions-17/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Governing Council today decided to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. In particular, the decision to lower the deposit facility rate &ndash; the rate through which the Governing Council steers the monetary policy stance &ndash; is based on its updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.</p>
<p>The disinflation process is well on track. Inflation has continued to develop broadly in line with the staff projections and is set to return to the Governing Council&rsquo;s 2% medium-term target in the course of this year. Most measures of underlying inflation suggest that inflation will settle at around the target on a sustained basis. Domestic inflation remains high, mostly because wages and prices in certain sectors are still adjusting to the past inflation surge with a substantial delay. But wage growth is moderating as expected, and profits are partially buffering the impact on inflation.</p>
<p>The Governing Council&rsquo;s recent interest rate cuts are gradually making new borrowing less expensive for firms and households. At the same time, financing conditions continue to be tight, also because monetary policy remains restrictive and past interest rate hikes are still transmitting to the stock of credit, with some maturing loans being rolled over at higher rates. The economy is still facing headwinds but rising real incomes and the gradually fading effects of restrictive monetary policy should support a pick-up in demand over time.</p>
<p>The Governing Council is determined to ensure that inflation stabilises sustainably at its 2% medium-term target. It will follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate monetary policy stance. In particular, the Governing Council&rsquo;s interest rate decisions will be based on its assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. The Governing Council is not pre-committing to a particular rate path.</p>
<h2>Key ECB interest rates</h2>
<p>The Governing Council today decided to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. Accordingly, the interest rates on the deposit facility, the main refinancing operations and the marginal lending facility will be decreased to 2.75%, 2.90% and 3.15% respectively, with effect from 5 February 2025.</p>
<h2><a id="_Hlk183423643"></a>Asset purchase programme (APP) and pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP)</h2>
<p><a class="link-inline" id="_Hlk183423579"></a>The APP and PEPP portfolios are declining at a measured and predictable pace, as the Eurosystem no longer reinvests the principal payments from maturing securities.</p>
<h2>Refinancing operations</h2>
<p><a class="link-inline" id="_Hlk183423554"></a>On 18 December 2024 banks repaid the remaining amounts borrowed under the targeted longer-term refinancing operations, thus concluding this part of the balance sheet normalisation process.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments within its mandate to ensure that inflation stabilises sustainably at its 2% target over the medium term and to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policy transmission. Moreover, the Transmission Protection Instrument is available to counter unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics that pose a serious threat to the transmission of monetary policy across all euro area countries, thus allowing the Governing Council to more effectively deliver on its price stability mandate.</p>
<p>The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:45 CET today.</p>

We have the expertise and resources to facilitate seamless access to capital, ensuring that Katsina State can effectively fund transformative projects,&rdquo; Chiemeka noted.</p>
<p>The visit culminated in a Closing Gong Ceremony, symbolizing the beginning of a strategic partnership focused on unlocking investment opportunities, fostering financial inclusion, and driving sustainable economic development in Katsina State through the capital market.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li><span>Fintech Boom: The fintech sector experienced a 44% surge in job vacancies, driven by venture capital investment and AI</span></li>
<li><span>Accountancy Resurgence: accountancy rebounded with a 29% increase in vacancies, fueled by a focus on green services and AI</span></li>
<li><span>Banking Challenges: Banking vacancies declined by 11%, reflecting restructuring and regulatory pressures</span></li>
<li><span>Regional Disparities Persist: London experienced a 7% increase in finance sector vacancies, while the rest of the UK faced a 4% decline</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>The combination of increased investment in AI, political shifts in the UK and falling interest rates has made 2024 a pivotal year for the finance sector according to the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Ffile%2Fd%2F1PiiQ80TnQOA2_EH3cRspN1zeGr61b2uR%2Fview%3Fusp=share_link/2/01020194b761a69b-e4b4e94d-72b7-4904-8ec9-93795516a27b-000000/MkEII5cO-1bgZ-ubJkfi89MDC_g=411" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2024 Year in Review UK finance market trends report</a>&nbsp;by leading professional recruiter Morgan McKinley and market data analysts Vacancysoft. AI and machine learning continue to reshape the industry, with a 98% year-on-year increase in AI investments. Nearly two-thirds (63%) of financial institutions now invest in AI, a substantial rise from 32% in 2023.</span></p>
<p><span>Fintech drives Vacancy boom with record growth in 2024</span></p>
<p><span>The fintech sector led the growth in professional vacancies in 2024, posting a 44% year-on-year increase across the UK. This surge was driven by a rise in venture capital funding,widespread adoption of AI and automation and the sector's ongoing fragmentation, which has fostered the emergence of new companies. Fintech has become a magnet for talent, particularly in commercial roles.</span></p>
<p><span>Leading the charge, Wise Payments recorded a staggering 225% increase in vacancies, reaching 335 roles. In comparison, Ebury Partners posted a 148% rise to 286 roles, highlighting their success in scaling operations and capitalising on international payments opportunities. Business development and sales roles dominated, accounting for 1,277 vacancies&mdash;a 54% year-on-year rise and 10% of all openings.</span></p>
<p><span>Growth in accountancy</span></p>
<p><span>The accountancy sector rebounded strongly in 2024, with a 29% rise in vacancies, reaching its highest demand in five years making up 54% of all openings. This resurgence was driven by increased investment in green services and deeper integration of AI, which created new opportunities for professionals, particularly in tax roles.</span></p>
<p><span>Tax professionals experienced a surge in demand, with vacancies reaching their highest levels in five years driven by evolving government policies and regulatory changes, which created opportunities for accountants and consultants with tax expertise. PwC reported a 30% year-on-year increase in vacancies, surpassing 1,000 roles, driven by its growth into sustainable practices and enhanced usage of smart technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp; Regional firms such as Francis Clark and Azets recorded the most significant growth, with vacancies rising 76% and 59%, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span>Banking sector faces significant reduction in vacancies</span></p>
<p><span>In 2024, banking vacancies contracted across most divisions and organisations by 11% in 2024, reflecting ongoing restructuring and regulatory challenges. Risk and compliance roles, which have traditionally dominated hiring, saw a sharp 20% drop, reflecting reduced regulatory activity. Major players like NatWest and Barclays posted steep declines in job openings, with reductions of 51% and 45%, reflecting ongoing industry-wide restructuring.&nbsp; Lloyds Banking Group reported a smaller decline of 19%, with 1,931 roles posted during the year. Economic pressures and shifting priorities heavily shaped hiring trends within the sector..</span></p>
<p><span>However, certain areas, such as banking operations and IT development, displayed resilience, growing by 6% and 2. These gains highlight a pivot toward streamlining operations and embracing technology to enhance efficiency. Despite the contraction, initiatives like proposed regulatory reforms allowing investment banks to access retail capital could stimulate activity and unlock new growth opportunities in the years ahead.</span></p>
<p><span>London leads growth in finance</span></p>
<p><span>While London saw a 7% increase in finance sector vacancies, the rest of the UK experienced a 4% decline, exposing persistent regional imbalances in job growth. This disparity underscores the need for strategic efforts to decentralise opportunities and foster development in regions outside the capital, ensuring a more balanced market across the UK.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Victoria Walmsley, Managing Director, Morgan McKinley UK commented:&nbsp;</strong><em>"</em>The UK jobs market in 2024 demonstrated remarkable resilience, despite global uncertainties and economic pressures. Key sectors such as technology, healthcare, and renewable energy provided stability and growth, driving digital transformation and innovation. As we look towards 2025, challenges such as skills shortages, regulatory changes, and evolving workforce expectations remain, yet they also present opportunities for growth and innovation. With continued investment in emerging technologies and green energy, alongside strategic government initiatives to attract talent, the UK is positioned for further transformation. It is essential that businesses remain adaptable and collaborative, ensuring that we can navigate the evolving job market and continue to foster economic resilience and growth in the years ahead."</span></p>

<title>Deutsche BÃ¶rse: Xetra ETF &amp; ETP Statistics 2024: Assets Under Management And Product Diversity Continue To Grow</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="row-with-description ">
<div class="text-highlight">
<ul class="rte--list">
<li>Assets under management in the segment reach a new all-time high of &euro;1.83 trillion</li>
<li>Trading turnover in ETFs and ETPs rises significantly by 28 per cent to &euro;230.8 billion</li>
<li>Deutsche B&ouml;rse records highest listing activity since the launch of the segment</li>
<li>Active ETFs establish themselves with high growth rates</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row-with-picture">
<div class="detailText">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Deutsche B&ouml;rse's Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) segment continued its growth trajectory last year, reaching a new all-time high with assets under management of &euro;1.83 trillion (+33.9 per cent; December 2023: &euro;1.36 trillion). At the same time, the trading volume in ETFs and ETPs on Xetra rose significantly by 28 per cent to &euro;230.8 billion (2023: &euro;180.4 billion). Trading in non-euro currencies achieved a particularly high growth rate of 82.9 per cent to 1.81 billion euros (2023: 989 million euros). In total, Deutsche B&ouml;rse now offers 180 ETFs and ETPs in other trading currencies such as the US dollar and British pound.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The positive development on the trading side is also reflected in the continuing high interest of European ETF issuers in launching new products: With 281 new ETF listings, Deutsche B&ouml;rse recorded the highest listing activity since the launch of the ETF segment in 2000. At the end of the year, the product range on Xetra stood at 2,328 ETFs (2023: 2,125 ETFs) and 446 ETPs (2023: 424 ETPs). Xetra was thus once again the largest exchange trading venue for ETFs and ETPs in Europe.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p class="p--heading-2">Actively managed ETFs are establishing themselves in the European market</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Among the particular growth drivers of the past year were once again active ETFs, which achieved new record highs across all key figures. In 2024, 78 new products were added, bringing the total number of active ETFs tradable on Xetra to 197 (2023: 119 active ETFs). Assets invested in active ETFs reached &euro;44.2 billion at the end of the year, almost twice as high as in the previous year (December 2023: &euro;22.4 billion). In terms of trading volume, the products generated an annual turnover of &euro;2.76 billion, an increase of 127 per cent compared to the previous year (2023: &euro;1.22 billion). The number of issuers has also increased: four new providers for actively managed ETFs have joined the segment in 2024. This means that 22 issuers now offer active ETFs on Xetra.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Active ETFs are an emerging category in the ETF product universe that enjoys great popularity on both the provider and investor side. Investors benefit not only from innovative investment concepts, but also from the low management fees of the products&rdquo;, says Stephan Kraus, Head of the ETF &amp; ETP segment at Deutsche B&ouml;rse. The average management fee of index ETFs on Xetra was 0.27 per cent at the end of the year, while that of active ETFs was 0.36 per cent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p class="p--heading-2">Thematic ETFs on artificial intelligence, semiconductor industry and defence sector in investor focus</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Spurred on by the growth potential of generative AI applications and the resulting demand for semiconductors, thematic ETFs in this sector recorded particularly high demand on Xetra. Accordingly, the invested assets of these ETFs increased by 95.1 per cent year-on-year to &euro;10.7 billion (2023: &euro;5.5 billion) and the trading volume by 177.2 per cent to &euro;4.55 billion (2023: &euro;1.64 billion). ETFs related to defence achieved even higher growth rates. After the first defence ETFs were listed on Xetra in 2023, their assets under management reached &euro;2.17 billion (+1,652 per cent; 2023: &euro;123.9 million) at the end of the year, with a trading turnover of &euro;1.04 billion (+1,263 per cent; 2023: &euro;76.1 million).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p class="p--heading-2">Overnight rate ETFs are becoming an alternative to call money accounts</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the bond ETF space, so-called overnight rate ETFs were able to continue their success story. Overnight rate ETFs aim for a return that is based on the key interest rates of a currency area. Therefore, they are increasingly being used by investors as an alternative to traditional call money accounts. This is also illustrated by the increase in fund assets and the trading turnover of the products on Xetra. Both key figures achieved triple-digit growth rates last year, with fund assets at &euro;19.2 billion (+188.8 per cent; 2023: &euro;6.64 billion) and trading turnover at &euro;6.57 billion (+149.1 per cent; 2023: &euro;2.64 billion) at the end of the year.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p class="p--heading-2">Crypto ETNs benefit from crypto market pick-up</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US market in early 2024 also led to a revival of the crypto exchange-traded note (ETN) market in Europe. With a Xetra full-year turnover of &euro;10.3 billion, the products recorded a particularly high year-on-year increase of 239.2 per cent (2023: &euro;3.05 billion). In the same period, assets under management increased significantly by 115.3 per cent to 11.4 billion euros (2023: 5.31 billion euros). At the end of the year, the range of crypto ETNs on Xetra comprised 93 products, which tracked the performance of 21 individual cryptocurrencies and 21 crypto indices. All crypto ETNs tradable on Xetra are physically backed by the underlying crypto assets. As the largest European trading venue for crypto ETNs, Xetra also offers central clearing of all traded products, which is unique in Europe given the breadth of cryptocurrencies offered.</p>

<title>European Capital Markets Forum</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/european-capital-markets-forum/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><b>The first edition of the European Capital Markets Forum took place on 29 January 2025. This unique event, held during the Polish Presidency of the Council of the European Union, brought together economists, industry leaders, and policy makers to discuss the key challenges and opportunities facing the European financial market. KDPW and KDPW_CCP were the co-organisers of the event alongside the Warsaw Stock Exchange (GPW) and the Federation of European Securities Exchanges (FESE).</b></p>
<p>The meeting was an opportunity to discuss how to make European capital markets more integrated and competitive and how to adopt innovative strategies to meet the challenges of the future.</p>
<p>The event was opened by the hosts of the Forum: KDPW and KDPW_CCP CEO Maciej Trybuchowski and Warsaw Stock Exchange CEO Tomasz BardziÅowski. The Forum began with an address by Minister of Finance Andrzej DomaÅski, followed by a keynote from Klaus L&ouml;ber, Chair of CCP Supervisory Committee speaking on behalf of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).</p>
<p><b>The panel &ldquo;Post-Trade Harmonisation in Europe: What has already been done? What is there left to do?&rdquo;, hosted by the KDPW Group, was dedicated to post-trade, i.e. the European clearing houses and central securities depositories. These institutions have key responsibility for the efficiency of the capital markets. They ensure safe and timely clearing of transactions and are responsible for the flow of securities and cash, including cross-border flows.</b></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The Polish capital market would not have developed as it has for small and medium-sized companies had it not been for local institutions which stimulate the interest of Polish investors and which at the same time invest in the development of the Polish capital market. Despite the existing fragmentation in Europe, the share of foreign investors in turnover on GPW&rsquo;s main market was high at 67 percent in H1 2024. From the point of view of post-trade institutions, it is important to remove barriers to cross-border settlement, including through changes in securities law, corporate law, tax law, and further harmonisation of corporate action market practice in the EU. All these areas are regulated by national jurisdictions and differ from each other, impacting settlement processes. Today&rsquo;s technological solutions support operational cooperation between CSDs and clearing institutions without the need to create a single entity. However, legal factors often stand in the way,</i>&rdquo; said KDPW and KDPW_CCP CEO&nbsp;<b>Maciej Trybuchowski</b>.</p>
<p>The speakers also discussed the change in the settlement schedule from T+2 to T+1, planned for October 2027. This will benefit market participants, including shorter time to receive assets (financial instruments, cash) from transactions. It will also help to harmonise post-trade processes for investors operating in different markets (e.g. USA, Canada, India, where T+1 cycles are already in place). However, this change also carries some risks (less time to prepare and send instructions through the chain of intermediaries in the market, less time for the settlement counterparties to obtain foreign currency, especially with less liquid currencies), which is why all market participants need to prepare well for the process.</p>
<p>Speakers in the discussion on post-trade included:&nbsp;<b>Klaus L&ouml;ber</b>, Chair of CCP Supervisory Committee, ESMA,&nbsp;<b>Godefroid Lamboray</b>, Executive Director, Clearstream,&nbsp;<b>Ilse Peeters</b>, Head of Government Relations &amp; Public Affairs, Euroclear, and&nbsp;<b>Maciej Trybuchowski</b>, KDPW and KDPW_CCP CEO. The discussion was moderated by&nbsp;<b>Anna Kulik</b>, Secretary General, European Central Securities Depositories Association (ECSDA).</p>
<p>Apart from the panel on post-trade and the challenges it is facing, others panels were dedicated to the Capital Markets Union, development of investments, and raising funds on the capital market.</p>
<p>The European Capital Markets Forum is a platform for exchange of experiences and views on the key challenges facing the European capital markets. The event participants had the opportunity to hear interventions focusing on strengthening market resilience, developing cross-border investment, and promoting regulatory harmonisation. Organised during the Polish Presidency of the Council of the EU, the event is an important step towards achieving Europe&rsquo;s strategic objectives in the area of finance and innovation.</p>
<p>The organisers of the European Capital Markets Forum were KDPW, the clearing house KDPW_CCP, the Warsaw Stock Exchange (GPW), and the Federation of European Securities Exchanges; the Polish Presidency of the Council of the European Union was the Honorary Patron of the event.</p>

<title>Nasdaq Dubai Welcomes The Middle Eastâs First USD 100 Million Blue Bond Listing By DP World</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/nasdaq-dubai-welcomes-the-middle-easts-first-usd-100-million-blue-bond-listing/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/nasdaq-dubai-welcomes-the-middle-easts-first-usd-100-million-blue-bond-listing/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li><i>With this landmark listing, Nasdaq Dubai's total debt market value currently stands at USD 137 billion, including USD 29 billion in ESG-linked instruments.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Nasdaq Dubai welcomed Middle East and North Africa&rsquo;s first corporate Blue Bond listing, of a USD 100 million by DP World, a leading provider of global end-to-end supply chain solutions. Issued under DP World&rsquo;s USD 10 billion Global Medium-Term Note Programme, the bond carries a 5.250% coupon rate and matures in 2029.</p>
<p>The issuance achieved a spread of 99.6 basis points (bps) above U.S. Treasuries &mdash; the tightest spread ever achieved by DP World in both the bond and Sukuk markets. This issuance highlights the region&rsquo;s growing commitment to sustainable finance, with proceeds funding critical projects such as marine transportation, port infrastructure, and water-positive initiatives.</p>
<p>This landmark issuance contributes directly to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) and SDG 14 (Life Below Water), addressing the significant funding gap for sustainable marine and water-related initiatives, and solidifying Nasdaq Dubai&rsquo;s position as a leading platform for innovative ESG-linked financial instruments. This listing also contributes to further enhancing the role of the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) as a hub for sustainable finance.</p>
<p>Nasdaq Dubai&rsquo;s ESG offerings include Green Bonds, Sustainability Bonds, Sustainability-Linked Bonds, and now the region&rsquo;s first Blue Bond. The total value of debt listings on Nasdaq Dubai currently stands at USD 137 billion, of which USD 29 billion consists of ESG-linked issuances.</p>
<p>To commemorate the listing, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, Group Chairman &amp; CEO, DP World rang the market-opening bell at Nasdaq Dubai, joined by Abdul Wahed Al Fahim, Chairman of Nasdaq Dubai and Hamed Ali, CEO of Nasdaq Dubai and Dubai Financial Market (DFM).</p>
<p><b>Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, Group Chairman &amp; CEO, DP World</b>: "The listing of our first Blue Bond represents a significant step forward in DP World's journey to drive sustainable growth and innovation in the global supply chain.

<title>Top 20 Global Biopharma Firms See 1.7% Market Cap Growth To $3.7 Billion In 2024 Amid Policy Challenges, Reveals GlobalData</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span><span>The biopharmaceutical industry in 2024 experienced a mixed performance, with the aggregate market capitalization of the top 20 biopharmaceutical firms&rsquo; year-on-year increasing by 1.7% from $3.6 trillion to $3.7 trillion as on 31 December 2024, despite challenges from shifting policies and regulatory concerns. Key players like Lilly, AbbVie, and Gilead Sciences saw significant growth, while companies like Novo Nordisk and CSL faced setbacks. The industry&rsquo;s outlook remains uncertain as it navigates complex economic and political dynamics, reveals</span><span>&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.gqh-2BaxUzlo7XKIuSly0rC502qyvSaH8suunkkct0v9mvfQCOd-2BH-2FL-2BYGtpYy-2FL-2FyLaZm1qwwVaPg8lPm6dvpuUGzmxcDRrpc-2BXaU-2BFHctKK2qwfJBe2dIC8cwTpUbkNKn4yN37FaiHVX8FXGb3WhnEUl1jttyxOEaeUbYCd7y-2BQvyAQhDUr-2BD-2BAMgyKdIHyIIedSCiJSAFX7cTX1LtbsqA-3D-3DtDMW_awSuR00uK8EZood8su7v4ItMFr0d7S5MNR1CcvAHRb7u8JiSB5Axp3o6-2Brp7TTn9jFAQeaiwuDUNp6ED3yPnAlc8P6BYb9FHuDe9ygxt5VZvNiU-2BtRuLsvHWqjkM9T7ClBx75wPFmdusb0PmVTgfISOJFuW02fwCepuTeERwvSJldpWEHpADN0N9It4ROqKIX6RbpcWw-2FwWy0mHeWvCifEGHqVktDz-2BPRAzSGT560zZ-2FI2oDU9iIATDqHn6aLBj02RA5RFgZ4LB2sVp-2F9qIbp1vNiLwftUTtNRu5o1qpL0rGMIYjFvcl-2FNSX8uNMW38zkrPyp-2FhHQMPPTpk8v6QbEjI5JIRkETIZE7Flcp1IddM-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GlobalData</span></span></a><span>, a leading data and analytics company.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Ophelia Chan, Business Fundamentals Senior Analyst at GlobalData, comments: &ldquo;The biopharmaceutical industry faced a dynamic landscape in 2024, shaped by the US Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, Medicare policy concerns under Donald Trump&rsquo;s second presidential term, and the uncertainty fueled by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&rsquo;s anti-vaccine stance.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><img alt="GlobalData_BioPharma_Dec24" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/GlobalData_BioPharma_Dec24.jpg" title="GlobalData_BioPharma_Dec24" /><br /></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>An analysis of GlobalData&rsquo;s Deals Database reveals that over two-thirds of the top 20 biopharmaceutical companies reported a decline in market capitalization. However, three companies achieved growth greater than 10%: Lilly (32.4%), AbbVie (14.8%) and Gilead Sciences (14.0%).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Lilly retained its top position with a 32.4% growth in market capitalization to $733 billion in 2024, driven by strong demand for its weight-loss drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound (tirzepatide). The recent results from the SURMOUNT-5 phase 3b trial revealed Zepbound (tirzepatide) provided a 47% greater relative weight loss compared to rival Novo Nordisk&rsquo;s Wegovy (semaglutide).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>AbbVie reported market capitalization growth of 14.8% in 2024, fueled by acquisitions of ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics worth $19 billion in total, which further strengthened AbbVie's oncology and neuroscience portfolios.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Gilead Sciences achieved a 14% increase in market capitalization, driven by the advancement of late-stage drug candidates to new drug application submissions, including lenacapavir, an injectable HIV-1 capsid inhibitor for HIV prevention. The company also benefited from the accelerated approval of Livdelzi (seladelphar) for primary biliary cholangitis.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>UCB was a new entrant among the top 20 biopharmaceutical companies, doubling its market capitalization from $16.9 billion in 2023 to $38.7 billion in 2024. This growth was driven by the success of its blockbuster drug, Bimzelx (bimekizumab). Following its initial FDA approval for plaque psoriasis in October 2023, UCB secured approvals for three additional indications: psoriatic arthritis, non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, further expanding the drug&rsquo;s potential across multiple inflammatory diseases.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>However, Novo Nordisk saw a 16.8% decline in market capitalization in 2024, following the Phase III REDEFINE 1 trial results for its next-generation weight-loss drug, CagriSema (cagrilintide + semaglutide), which fell short of expectations. The outcome raised concerns about the company&rsquo;s competitive position in the growing obesity and diabetes drug market.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>CSL also witnessed a 10.5% decline in market capitalization in 2024, following its acquisition of Vifor Pharma in August 2022, aimed at diversifying its portfolio of vaccines and blood plasma products. However, CSL has since reported that Vifor&rsquo;s portfolio is facing commercial and regulatory challenges, including reimbursement bundle issues for its pruritus drug, Korsuva (difelikefalin).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Chan concludes: &ldquo;The biopharmaceutical industry&rsquo;s mixed performance in 2024 underscores rising uncertainty driven by shifting policies and regulatory challenges. With Trump&rsquo;s second term raising concerns around drug pricing, inflation trends, and FDA approvals, the industry faces an unclear outlook heading into 2025.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The UK&rsquo;s venture capital (VC) market experienced a decline in the number of deals announced in 2024, with 1,209 deals compared to 1,289 in 2023.

<p><span><span>Aurojyoti Bose, Lead Analyst at GlobalData, comments: &ldquo;The growth in funding value despite a decline in deal volume showcases a trend wherein VC firms seem to be weighing quality over quantity and have put in big money in few promising startups.

<p><span><span>Bose adds: &ldquo;The UK, apart from being the top European market for VC funding activity, is also among the top five markets globally in terms of both deal volume and value.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The UK accounted for 7.3% of the total number of VC deals announced globally during 2024 while its share in terms of the total funding value stood at 6.1%.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Some of the notable VC funding deals announced in the UK during 2024 included $1.05 billion worth of funding raised by Wayve Technologies, $1 billion raised by Abound, $500 million by Core Power, $431 million raised by Monzo, $370 million by Lighthouse, and $267 million worth of funding raised by Zepz.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Bose concludes: &ldquo;The increase in big-ticket deals underscores strong confidence in the UK&rsquo;s innovation ecosystem, reinforcing its position as a global VC hotspot. As funding strategies evolve, the market&rsquo;s resilience and ability to attract large-scale investments will be key in shaping the future of venture capital in the region.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: Historic data may change in case some deals get added to previous months because of a delay in disclosure of information in the public domain.</span></span></p>

<title>ASIC Calls Out Superannuation Trustees For Weak Scam And Fraud Practices</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-calls-out-superannuation-trustees-for-weak-scam-and-fraud-practices/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-calls-out-superannuation-trustees-for-weak-scam-and-fraud-practices/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC has written to superannuation trustees urging them to strengthen anti-scam practices, or risk exposing members to harm.</p>
<p>The open letter, signed by ASIC Commissioner Simone Constant, outlines our guidance for superannuation trustees in preventing, detecting and responding to scams and fraud activity.</p>
<p>Superannuation trustees have a key role to play in minimising the risk of scam and fraud risks to members, given they are the custodians of the second largest asset for many Australians.</p>
<p>With scammers employing increasingly sophisticated tactics to manipulate superannuation members, taking prompt and proactive steps to monitor and address scam activity is vital.</p>
<p>Superannuation trustees are the gatekeepers of their members&rsquo; money and cannot outsource their obligations to third parties when it comes to protecting their members from scams.</p>
<p>The Commissioner&rsquo;s letter follows an ASIC review of 15 superannuation trustees which found none had an organisation-wide scams strategy in place.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s review of the anti-scam practices of superannuation trustees forms part of our ongoing focus on disrupting investment scams in the broader financial services landscape.</p>
<p>In 2023, we published&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-761-scam-prevention-detection-and-response-by-the-four-major-banks/" title="REP 761 Scam prevention, detection and response by the four major banks">Report 761</a><em>&nbsp;Scam prevention, detection and response by the four major banks</em>&nbsp;(REP 761) and in 2024, we published&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-790-anti-scam-practices-of-banks-outside-the-four-major-banks/" title="REP 790 Anti-scam practices of banks outside the four major banks">Report 790</a><em>&nbsp;Anti-scam practices of banks outside the four major banks&nbsp;</em>(REP 790).</p>

<title>ASIC Acts To Protect Small Business - Q2 FY25 Update</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-acts-to-protect-small-business-q2-fy25-update/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-acts-to-protect-small-business-q2-fy25-update/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Small businesses employ approximately half of the private sector workforce and&nbsp;<a href="https://budget.gov.au/content/factsheets/download/factsheet-sml-bus.pdf">contribute more than $500 billion</a>&nbsp;to the Australian economy each year. They are essential for Australia&rsquo;s prosperity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ASIC assists small businesses by providing the information they need to operate lawfully, and by taking enforcement action against directors or companies when the law has been contravened.</p>
<p>In the period 1 October to 31 December 2024 enforcement action was taken by ASIC against:</p>
<ul>
<li>four company directors through disqualification &ndash; two for the maximum five years</li>
<li>one director charged for making misleading statements to ASIC</li>
<li>one director sentenced for making false statements to ASIC, and</li>
<li>58 individuals for 107 offences in failing to assist registered liquidators following the collapse of their companies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Criminal prosecutions and administrative actions were also taken against directors for:</p>
<ul>
<li>failing to maintain proper books and records</li>
<li>failing to lodge tax returns</li>
<li>failing to ensure the companies paid their statutory debts including tax bills, workers compensation and land taxes</li>
<li>insolvent trading</li>
<li>failing to assist liquidators, and</li>
<li>lodging false and misleading documents with ASIC.</li>
</ul>
<p>The failure of these directors to meet their statutory obligations adversely impacted many small business creditors across a range of industries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Small business owners can take practical steps to protect their interests such as maintaining financial records to track the health of the business, keeping up to date about their company&rsquo;s financial position and performance and ensuring their company can pay its debts on time.</p>
<p>Company directors should seek&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/for-business/small-business/starting-a-small-business-company/legal-requirements-for-companies/#advice" title="Legal requirements for companies">professional advice</a>&nbsp;if they are uncertain about their legal obligations or have concerns about their company&rsquo;s finances. It&rsquo;s critical to be proactive and seek help early by engaging a professional adviser such as an accountant, registered liquidator or lawyer.</p>
<h2>Director disqualifications</h2>
<p>In addition to the recent five-year disqualification periods handed down to Constandinos Ganatzos (refer&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-242mr-asic-disqualifies-nsw-director-for-five-years/" title="24-242MR ASIC disqualifies NSW director for five years">24-242MR</a>), Mary Makeny (refer&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-259mr-asic-disqualifies-security-industry-director-for-five-years/" title="24-259MR ASIC disqualifies security industry director for five years">24-259MR</a>) and a four-year disqualification period for Allan Caratti (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-291mr-perth-property-developer-disqualified-from-managing-corporations-for-four-years/" title="24-291MR Perth property developer disqualified from managing corporations for four years">24-291MR</a>), ASIC also disqualified Ian Thomas Griggs from managing corporations for two years on 20 November 2024.â¯Mr Griggs was involved in the failure of four companies in the hospitality industry. The four failed companies owed in excess of $4 million to creditors.</p>
<p>In disqualifying these directors, ASIC relied on supplementary reports lodged by certain liquidators after ASIC approved funding from theâ¯<a href="https://asic.gov.au/for-finance-professionals/registered-liquidators/your-ongoing-obligations-as-a-registered-liquidator/assetless-administration-fund/" title="Assetless Administration Fund">Assetless Administration Fund</a>. The liquidators of Mr Griggs&rsquo; companies were Jarvis Archer of Revive Financial and Barry Taylor and Todd Gammel of HLB Mann Judd.</p>
<p>Directors may be disqualified from managing a corporation for a maximum of five years. They are listed on ASIC&rsquo;s publicâ¯<a href="https://asic.gov.au/online-services/search-asic-registers/banned-and-disqualified/" title="Banned and disqualified">banned and disqualified persons register</a> and can face criminal charges if they don&rsquo;t comply with the disqualification order. Directors can seek a review of ASIC&rsquo;s decision by the Administrative Review Tribunal.</p>
<h2>Criminal prosecutions</h2>
<p>On 27 November Jye Dilin Menzies-Clifton appeared in Mount Druitt Local Court, Sydney. He is charged with two counts of making misleading statements in a document lodged with ASIC. ASIC alleges that while director of a company which operated a Sydney gym, Mr Menzies-Clifton submitted a form to close the company which contained declarations that the company had no outstanding liabilities, and that all the members of the company agreed to the deregistration, while knowing those statements to be false (refer to&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-260mr-director-of-sydney-gym-charged-with-authorising-the-making-of-false-statements-to-asic/" title="24-260MR Director of Sydney gym charged with authorising the making of false statements to ASIC">24-260MR</a>).</p>
<p>On 13 December, Benjamin Molloy was sentenced to a recognisance release order under section 20(1)(b) of the&nbsp;<em>Crimes Act 1914</em>&nbsp;(Cth), with a fully suspended sentence of 12 months&rsquo; imprisonment on the condition he be of good behaviour for two years.â¯Mr Molloy pleaded guilty to two counts of making false statements to ASIC pursuant to sections 1308(1) and 1308(2) of the Corporations Act. Her Honour Magistrate Hartnett described the offending as &lsquo;objectively serious&rsquo; where the offending was &lsquo;squarely in the context of family violence&rsquo;, which was used by Mr Molloy to &lsquo;facilitate a structure of some complexity that promoted [his] lifestyle and the operation of [his] business interests&rsquo; (refer to&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-282mr-former-victorian-director-sentenced-for-making-false-statements-to-asic/?altTemplate=betanewsroom" title="24-282MR Former Victorian director sentenced for making false statements to ASIC">24-282MR</a>).</p>
<h2>Assistance for external administration</h2>
<p>Registered liquidators can request assistance from ASIC in circumstances when directors, officers and individuals related to an entity in external administration fail to comply with legislative requirements, including the failure to provide books and records to the liquidator and the failure to complete a report on company activities and property (ROCAP).&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />For the period of 1 October 2024 &ndash; 31 December 2024, ASIC prosecuted a total of 58 individuals for 107 offences in failing to assist registered liquidators, with a total of $342,400 in fines and $6,692 in costs. Proving the ROCAP as well as all company books and records, allows the liquidator to obtain better information about events leading up to their appointment and assist the liquidator in their investigations, asset recoveries, and complying with their obligations to report to creditors and to ASIC.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Section 206F of the&nbsp;<em>Corporations Act 2001</em>&nbsp;allows ASIC to disqualify a person from managing corporations for a maximum period of five years if, within a seven-year period, the person was an officer of two or more companies, and those companies were wound up and a liquidator provided a report to ASIC about each of the company&rsquo;s inability to pay its debts.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, together with the Securities and Exchange Commission, extended the compliance date for the amendments to Form PF that were adopted Feb. 8, 2024. The compliance date for these amendments, which was originally March 12, 2025, has been extended to June 12, 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Form PF is the confidential reporting form for certain SEC-registered investment advisers to private funds, including those that also are registered with the CFTC as commodity pool operators or commodity trading advisers. This extension will mitigate certain administrative and technological burdens and costs associated with the prior compliance date. This extension will also provide more time for filers to program and test for compliance with these amendments.</p>

<div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item">
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced the U.S. District Court for Northern District of Illinois issued an order of default judgment against five offshore entities and three individuals, finding them liable for fraud and other violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations in connection with a global retail binary options fraud that victimized U.S. residents. The defendants executed their unlawful scheme through internet websites using fictitious trade names such as BigOption, BinaryBook, and BinaryOnline.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The following foreign entities and Israeli citizens were found liable for, and enjoined from, fraud and other violations:</p>
<ul>
<li class="BulletedHyperlink">Yukom Communications Ltd., incorporated in Israel</li>
<li class="BulletedHyperlink">Linkopia Mauritius Ltd., incorporated in Mauritius</li>
<li class="BulletedHyperlink">Wirestech Limited d/b/a BigOption, incorporated in the Marshall Islands</li>
<li class="BulletedHyperlink">WSB Investments Ltd. d/b/a BinaryBook, incorporated in Anguilla, the United Kingdom, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Gibraltar</li>
<li class="BulletedHyperlink">Zolarex Ltd. d/b/a BinaryOnline, incorporated in the Marshall Islands</li>
<li class="BulletedHyperlink">Yossi Herzog&nbsp;</li>
<li class="BulletedHyperlink">Lee Elbaz&nbsp;</li>
<li class="BulletedHyperlink">Shalom Peretz</li>
</ul>
<p>The order finds the defendants engaged in fraud and other violations and orders them to pay, jointly and severally, $112.9 million in restitution and a $338.7 million civil monetary penalty. The order also permanently enjoins them from engaging in conduct that violates the CEA, as charged, and permanently bans them from registering with the CFTC and from trading in any CFTC-regulated markets.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The order stems from the CFTC&rsquo;s complaint, filed Aug. 12, 2019, charging defendants with fraud and other violations. [See CFTC Press Release No.<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/7995-19">7995-19</a>]</p>
<p><strong>Case Background</strong></p>
<p>The order finds that from March 26, 2014, until the filing of the complaint on Aug. 12, 2019, the defendants made numerous fraudulent misrepresentations to customers on websites and through email and telephone solicitations, telling customers that binary option transactions were profitable, when in fact the substantial majority of their customers lost money, and individual brokers misrepresented their names, financial expertise, and physical location. The order finds the defendants misappropriated customer funds and made additional misrepresentations to thwart customers&rsquo; attempts to withdraw their funds, including failing to disclose material information about so-called &ldquo;bonuses&rdquo; and &ldquo;risk-free trades.&rdquo; The defendants also manipulated their trading platform&rsquo;s risk settings to limit or prevent customers from being &ldquo;in the money&rdquo; with winning trades.</p>
<p><strong>Previous Settlement</strong></p>
<p>The court previously entered a consent order against another defendant involved in the fraud, Yakov Cohen, which resolved similar allegations against Cohen and required that he disgorge $7 million in ill-gotten gains received from his participation in the fraudulent binary options scheme.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>[See CFTC Press Release&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8962-24">8962-24</a>]</p>
<p><strong>Parallel Criminal Actions</strong></p>
<p>On Aug. 7, 2019, Elbaz was convicted by a federal jury of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud in violation of criminal statutes based upon substantially the same underlying facts as alleged in the CFTC complaint, she was sentenced to 20 years in prison, and ordered to pay restitution of $28 million in<em>&nbsp;United States v. Elbaz</em>, No. 18-cr-00157 (D. Md.)</p>
<p>Cohen pled guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit wire fraud predicated on the same conduct charged in CFTC&rsquo;s complaint. He was sentenced to 5.5 years in prison on Aug.15, 2024 and ordered to pay $7 million in restitution on January 22, 2025, in&nbsp;<em>United States v. Yakov Cohen</em>, No.&nbsp;19 cr 77-1 PX (D. Md.).</p>
<p>The CFTC thanks the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the District of Maryland for their assistance in this matter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this case are Heather Dasso, Elizabeth N. Pendleton, Elizabeth Streit, Scott R. Williamson, and Robert T. Howell.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>* * * * * * *</p>
<p><strong>Fraud Advisory</strong></p>
<p>The&nbsp;CFTC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/About/CFTCOrganization/OCEO">Office of Customer Education and Outreach</a>&nbsp;and the SEC&rsquo;s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy have issued a joint&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/fraudadv_binaryoptions.html">investor alert</a>&nbsp;to warn about fraudulent schemes involving binary options and their trading platforms. The alert warns customers the perpetrators of these unlawful schemes may refuse to credit customer accounts, deny fund reimbursement, commit identity theft, and manipulate software to generate losing trades.</p>
<p><span lang="EN">The CFTC also urges the public to verify a company&rsquo;s registration at&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.nfa.futures.org/basicnet/"><span lang="EN">NFA BASIC</span></a><span lang="EN">&nbsp;before committing funds. Customers should be wary of providing funds to any unregistered entity.</span></p>
<p>Suspicious activities or information, such as possible violations of commodity trading laws, can be reported to the Division of Enforcement via a toll-free hotline 866-FON-CFTC (866-366-2382) or&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cftc.gov/ConsumerProtection/FileaTiporComplaint/index.htm">file a tip or complaint</a>&nbsp;online or contact the CFTC&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whistleblower.gov/">Whistleblower Office</a>.&nbsp;Whistleblowers may be eligible to receive between 10 and 30 percent of the monetary sanctions collected, paid from the CFTC Customer Protection Fund financed through monetary sanctions paid to the CFTC by violators of the CEA.</p>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/federal-reserve-issues-fomc-statement-49/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. The unemployment rate has stabilized at a low level in recent months, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated.</p>
<p>The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.</p>
<p>In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgageâbacked securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.</p>
<p>In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.</p>
<p>Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Michael S. Barr; Michelle W. Bowman; Susan M. Collins; Lisa D. Cook; Austan D. Goolsbee; Philip N. Jefferson; Adriana D. Kugler; Alberto G. Musalem; Jeffrey R. Schmid; and Christopher J. Waller.</p>

<title>ISDA &amp; The Centre For Financial Technology: Challenges And Opportunities Of Digital Transformation, January 29, 2025, Opening Remarks, Scott Oâ Malia, ISDA Chief Executive</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-and-the-centre-for-financial-technology-challenges-and-opportunities-of-digi/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-and-the-centre-for-financial-technology-challenges-and-opportunities-of-digi/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good morning and thank you for joining us today for our event on the challenges and opportunities of digital transformation. A big thank you to our sponsors, Clifford Chance and RBC Capital Markets, and a special thank you to our co-host, Imperial College Business School&rsquo;s Centre for Financial Technology.</p>
<p>In many respects, technology has transformed the financial sector. From payments to quantitative trading, financial institutions have made use of cutting-edge technology to make things easier, faster, safer and more accurate. That&rsquo;s had an impact on all of us. The chances are you used your phone or contactless card to tap in and out of the train station this morning or to buy a coffee. In fact, cash now makes up less than 20% of all payments in the UK. Technology isn&rsquo;t just reshaping finance &ndash; it&rsquo;s woven into the fabric of our everyday lives.</p>
<p>But if we look beyond these customer-facing solutions, the story isn&rsquo;t quite so transformative. Progress behind the scenes has been far less marked, and that&rsquo;s where the real challenge lies.</p>
<p>In my remarks this morning, I&rsquo;ll briefly highlight the areas that we think are ripe for digitization and the advantages this can bring &ndash; as well as the challenges involved. I&rsquo;ll then describe the steps ISDA has taken to bring greater standardization, optimization and automation to parts of the derivatives market, with the aim of cutting costs, enhancing revenues and reducing risk.</p>
<p><span>Manual processes</span></p>
<p>According to a 2024 report on the future of finance by Boston Consulting Group (BCG), banks are spending more on IT as a share of revenue than most other industries. But much of that is directed at maintaining complex, legacy systems and complying with regulatory requirements. Only a small portion is actually targeted at innovation and modernization, with the banking sector lagging other industries in investing in new capabilities at scale.</p>
<p>The result is a lack of interoperation across legacy platforms and continued reliance on manual processes in back-end systems that leads to inefficiencies, higher costs, mistakes and greater risk. The derivatives market is no exception. For example, the legal and regulatory provisions of a derivatives contract are typically negotiated with multiple drafts of paper documents or PDFs.&nbsp;This process sucks up substantial resources and delays the start of business with a new customer. Key information must be manually copied from these documents into internal systems, which can lead to errors. And in times of market stress, firms need to search hundreds of pages of documents to determine their rights and obligations. In volatile, fast-moving markets, delays cost money and increase risk.</p>
<p>We have to do better. BCG recommends that banks design a drastically simplified business strategy that is supported by a modern platform operating model, a bold deployment of front-to-back digitization and a comprehensive re-imagination of functions leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI. Without this, banks will struggle to reduce costs and deliver value to investors.</p>
<p>Of course, that&rsquo;s easier said than done. Overhauling legacy systems is hard, it&rsquo;s expensive and it takes time. There aren&rsquo;t any shortcuts to doing this right. But we think the cost and efficiency benefits more than make it worthwhile.</p>
<p>At ISDA, we&rsquo;ve taken a very targeted approach, focusing on areas in which derivatives market participants share common problems and can get the biggest bang for their buck. And our starting point is always the same &ndash; to develop industry-wide standards as the foundation of any solution.</p>
<p>For the remaining part of my remarks, I&rsquo;d like to highlight some of the areas we&rsquo;re focused on and the benefits digitization can bring.</p>
<p><span>Digital solutions</span></p>
<p>Over time, each firm has established its own unique set of descriptions for events and processes that occur during the life of a trade. There&rsquo;s simply no commercial advantage to organizations maintaining their own terminologies and data standards, as it results in firms having to continually reconcile their trades to make sure they have the same information &ndash; a big drain on resources.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we developed the Common Domain Model, or CDM &ndash; an open-source data standard for financial products, trades and lifecycle events.</p>
<p>This has formed the basis of our Digital Regulatory Reporting (DRR) initiative, which significantly reduces the time, resources and cost needed to implement reporting regulations in multiple jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Over the past 12 months alone, five jurisdictions have amended their regulatory reporting rules, with more to follow this year, including Canada and Hong Kong. Each set of rules needs to be interpreted and then implemented &ndash; a huge amount of work for each individual firm to do on its own.</p>
<p>The ISDA DRR addresses this by taking a common interpretation of each set of requirements that has been reviewed and agreed by an industry working group. The CDM is then used to convert that industry interpretation into unambiguous, machine-executable code. That code can be used as the basis for implementing the rules or to validate that a firm&rsquo;s interpretation is aligned with the industry reading.</p>
<p>This not only helps firms reduce implementation and maintenance costs &ndash; using a common interpretation of the rules brings greater accuracy and consistency to the reporting process, reducing the risk of non-compliance and the potential for regulatory penalties caused by incomplete or misreported data.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to say that ISDA has committed to support 11 reporting rule sets in nine major jurisdictions through the DRR. As importantly, the DRR will evolve as rules are further modified in the future, avoiding the need for firms to reassemble teams to overhaul their systems every time changes occur. It&rsquo;s about building a smarter, more resilient system that works for the long term.</p>
<p>Let me turn to another area where ISDA has used technology to bring efficiencies to derivatives market processes. I mentioned earlier the example of resource-intensive, paper-based negotiations of derivatives contracts.</p>
<p>In response, ISDA has been working to digitize the documentation process. For example, the ISDA MyLibrary platform now hosts over 160 derivatives documents and document versions in digital form, giving users the ability to access and navigate commonly used agreements in one place. A sophisticated search function also allows users to easily find key provisions in their contracts, improving efficiency and reducing risk at times when key contractual terms need to be identified swiftly.</p>
<p>Combined with ISDA Create &ndash; a digital platform for the negotiation and execution of derivatives contracts that captures and stores the resulting legal data &ndash; firms can access the specific details of their negotiated trades within a few clicks of a mouse, giving them a complete picture of their exposures. Available through S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence&rsquo;s Counterparty Manager platform, ISDA Create brings huge improvements to the speed and efficiency of negotiations, enabling firms to start trading with new counterparties at a quicker pace.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re now preparing to launch our latest offering &ndash; the ISDA Notices Hub. This responds to challenges that exist with the physical delivery of critical termination-related notices &ndash; an essential part of the risk management process when a counterparty fails to pay or enters into default.</p>
<p>Under the ISDA Master Agreement, these notices must be delivered by certain prescribed methods using the counterparty&rsquo;s address as listed in the agreement. This has long been problematic if firms have moved offices without updating the address details in their documentation. But more recent issues emerged during the pandemic lockdowns, making it extremely difficult to deliver or receive notices. This is a big problem &ndash; uncertainty over the delivery of notices can have serious economic consequences, with losses running to millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>The ISDA Notices Hub is an online platform that will enable the instantaneous delivery and receipt of termination notices, eliminating risk exposures and potential losses that can result from delays in terminating derivatives contracts. It will also maintain a golden source of updated address details for those counterparty relationships where physical delivery of notices will continue.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve obtained strong industry support for the Notices Hub and plan to launch in the middle of this year on S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence&rsquo;s Counterparty Manager platform, so watch this space.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The EDHEC Infrastructure &amp; Private Assets Research Institute (EIPA) has announced the appointment of Tim Whittaker, PhD, to succeed Frederic Blanc-Brude, PhD, as director of the institute from January 1st, 2025.</span><br /><br /><span>Frederic Blanc-Brude, Founding Director of EIPA in 2016, stepped down to focus on his role as CEO of EIPA's sister organisation, Scientific Infra &amp; Private Assets (SIPA), an ESMA-registered provider of infrastructure and private equities market indices and benchmarks.

We are extremely proud of our academic DNA and our EDHEC Business School and EDHEC-Risk Institute heritage. Going forward, EIPA will focus on the measurement and reporting of the fair market value of private assets. This is an essential question that has deep prudential and fiduciary implications for anyone involved in private markets.

<title>Enterprise And ONEOK Extend Terminal Transfer Fee Waiver For ICE Midland WTI (HOU) Crude Deliveries To The End Of 2028</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/enterprise-and-oneok-extend-terminal-transfer-fee-waiver-for-ice-midland-wti-ho-1/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/enterprise-and-oneok-extend-terminal-transfer-fee-waiver-for-ice-midland-wti-ho-1/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced that Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE: EPD) and ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) have extended their fee waiver arrangement between the Enterprise Crude Houston (ECHO) and ONEOK East Houston (MEH) terminals to transfer crude oil delivered through ICE&rsquo;s Midland WTI futures contract (ICE: HOU) until December 31, 2028.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 2024, crude producers, refiners and exporters moved more of their pricing and hedging away from a WTI Cushing Basis to ICE Midland WTI (HOU), while price reporting agencies have launched new assessments which price all North American crude grades as differentials to HOU,&rdquo; said Jeff Barbuto, Global Head of Oil Markets at ICE. "Physical deliveries of ICE Midland WTI were twice that of the Cushing WTI contract in 2024. Extending the fee waiver through 2028 provides the industry with added incentive to migrate crude pricing to the U.S. Gulf Coast via ICE HOU."</p>
<p>If customers take an HOU futures position to delivery, buyers can submit a preferred delivery terminal to the seller who governs the delivery terminal selection of MEH or ECHO. If the buyer&rsquo;s preferred terminal was not selected, it can transfer the crude oil delivered against HOU between the two terminals at no cost. The waiver also applies to customers who take delivery of HOU via ICE&rsquo;s Exchange for Physical (EFP) and Alternative Delivery Procedure (ADP) mechanisms. If the buyer executes an EFP or ADP with a seller at a non-preferred terminal, the buyer may transfer the barrels to the other terminal at no cost so long as they provide proof of the EFP or ADP to ONEOK or Enterprise. Currently, a 10-cent per barrel charge is applied for all other transfers of HOU-quality WTI between the ECHO and MEH terminals.</p>
<p>Over 82 million barrels were delivered through the exchange delivery mechanism for HOU in 2024. EFPs are also heavily traded as they provide customers with the flexibility to deliver barrels to different locations and have accommodating delivery dates. A total of 5.5 million HOU futures traded in 2024 with average daily volume of 21,000 contracts.</p>
<p>ICE has seen a significant endorsement of HOU as the price of Midland crude, with Continental Resources switching a portion of its Permian production to price off of HOU, replacing a differential to WTI Cushing. Similarly, in recognition of HOU's establishment within Midland WTI pricing, Platts, part of S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, launched a daily price assessment of Midland WTI crude as a differential to HOU, effective January 22, 2025. This follows General Index&rsquo;s launch of a full suite of all North American Crude grades priced as differentials to HOU, also replacing WTI Cushing as a benchmark.</p>
<p>ICE offers HOU time spreads, as well as inter-commodity spreads with Brent and WTI Cushing (Domestic Sweet) to help customers mitigate price risk between locations and grades. Meanwhile, customers can benefit from margin offsets as high as 98% when clearing HOU alongside other oil positions cleared at ICE. Offsets are available across a range of over 800 oil contracts including ICE Brent, ICE Gasoil, ICE WTI (Cushing), ICE Dubai (Platts) and ICE Murban, as well as NY Harbor RBOB Gasoline and Heating Oil.</p>
<p>ICE is home to the most liquid energy markets in the world to manage risk exposure. A record 1 billion energy derivatives contracts traded on ICE in 2024, including a record 655 million oil futures and options contracts.</p>

Adena Friedman, Chair and CEO&nbsp;</span>said, &ldquo;2024 was a transformative year for Nasdaq. With the integration of AxiomSL and Calypso largely complete, we&rsquo;ve made substantial progress as a scalable platform company. We are executing well across our strategic priorities, including driving cross-sell opportunities, innovating across our solutions, and expanding client relationships with our One Nasdaq strategy.</p>
<p>Looking to 2025, we are well positioned to provide more value to our clients while driving profitable and durable growth as the trusted fabric of the world&rsquo;s financial system."</p>
<p><span>
Sarah Youngwood, Executive Vice President and CFO&nbsp;</span>said, &ldquo;After setting ambitious targets, Nasdaq delivered strong revenue growth and profitability across 2024 and is tracking ahead of schedule against our deleveraging and cost synergy targets.</p>
<p>Our achievements this year reflect our team&rsquo;s relentless focus on our clients and our ability to deliver outsized, long-term growth within our large and expanding market opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>FINANCIAL REVIEW</span></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>2024 net revenue was&nbsp;$4,649 million, reflecting 19% growth versus the prior year period while non-GAAP net revenue was&nbsp;$4,683 million. Adjusted net revenue growth was 9%.</li>
<li>Fourth quarter 2024 net revenue was&nbsp;$1,227 million, reflecting 10% growth versus the prior year period. Adjusted net revenue growth was also 10%.</li>
<li>Solutions revenue was&nbsp;$949 million&nbsp;in the fourth quarter of 2024, up 10% versus the prior year period, or up 9% on an adjusted basis, reflecting strong growth from Index and Financial Technology.</li>
<li>ARR grew 7% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2024 with 11% ARR growth for Financial Technology, or 12% on an organic basis, and 3% ARR growth for Capital Access Platforms.</li>
<li>Market Services net revenue was&nbsp;$268 million&nbsp;in the fourth quarter of 2024, up 8% versus the prior year period, or 12% growth on an adjusted basis. The increase was primarily driven by a&nbsp;$15 million&nbsp;increase in&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;equity derivatives and a&nbsp;$14 million&nbsp;increase in&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;cash equities, partly offset by a&nbsp;$4 million&nbsp;decrease in&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;tape plan revenue.</li>
<li>2024 GAAP operating expenses were&nbsp;$2,851 million, an increase of 23% versus the prior year period. The increase for the year was due to expenses related to the acquisition of Adenza, which resulted in an incremental&nbsp;$288 million&nbsp;in amortization expense of acquired intangible assets,&nbsp;$220 million&nbsp;of other AxiomSL and Calypso operating expenses, as well as organic growth driven by increased investments in technology and people to drive innovation and long-term growth, partially offset by lower merger and strategic initiative costs.</li>
<li>Fourth quarter 2024 GAAP operating expenses were&nbsp;$710 million, a decrease of 7% versus the prior year period. The decrease in the fourth quarter was primarily due to lower merger and strategic initiative costs and lower general and administrative expense, partially offset by expenses related to the acquisition of Adenza, which resulted in an incremental&nbsp;$29 million&nbsp;in amortization expense of acquired intangible assets,&nbsp;$24 million&nbsp;of other AxiomSL and Calypso operating expenses, as well as organic growth driven by increased investments in technology and people to drive innovation and long-term growth.</li>
<li>2024 non-GAAP operating expenses were&nbsp;$2,162 million, an increase of 18% over 2023, or 6% growth on an adjusted basis. Fourth quarter 2024 non-GAAP operating expenses were&nbsp;$556 million, reflecting 10% growth versus the prior year period, or 6% growth on an adjusted basis. The increase for the full year and fourth quarter included&nbsp;$220 million&nbsp;and&nbsp;$24 million, respectively, of AxiomSL and Calypso operating expenses. The increases for the year and quarter on an adjusted basis reflected growth driven by increased investments in technology and people to drive innovation and long-term growth, as well as increased regulatory costs, partially offset by the benefit of synergies.</li>
<li>Cash flow from operations was&nbsp;$705 million&nbsp;for the fourth quarter and&nbsp;$1,939 million&nbsp;for 2024, enabling the company to make additional progress on its deleveraging plan. In the fourth quarter, the company returned&nbsp;$138 million&nbsp;to shareholders through dividends. The company also repurchased&nbsp;$181 million&nbsp;of senior unsecured notes in the fourth quarter of 2024. As of&nbsp;December&nbsp;31, 2024, there was&nbsp;$1.7 billion&nbsp;remaining under the board authorized share repurchase program.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>2025 EXPENSE AND TAX GUIDANCE UPDATE</span><span><span>7</span></span></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>The company is initiating its 2025 non-GAAP operating expense guidance at a range of&nbsp;$2,245 million&nbsp;to&nbsp;$2,325 million, and its 2025 non-GAAP tax rate guidance to be in the range of 22.5% to 24.5%.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>STRATEGIC AND BUSINESS UPDATES</span></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><span>Strong execution across Financial Technology led to double-digit ARR growth in the fourth quarter.</span>&nbsp;Financial Technology ARR growth was up 12% on an organic basis, in the fourth quarter with 120 new clients, 127 upsells, and 4 cross-sells. Division revenue increased 7% on an adjusted basis. Financial Technology had an exceptional year for new bookings, including a number of sizeable and strategic enterprise deals, underscoring its leadership position and expanding Nasdaq&rsquo;s right to win across its products. Fourth quarter highlights included:<br /> 
<ul type="circle">
<li><span>Financial Technology continued its international expansion with several strategic enterprise deals.&nbsp;</span>In the fourth quarter, Nasdaq signed a long-term agreement to provide a future-proof, regulatory management solution through AxiomSL to AuRep, a collaborative joint venture of banks and financial service providers in&nbsp;Austria. The companies will provide additional details on this important partnership in the coming weeks. AxiomSL also secured an upsell with Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale to manage its domestic regulatory reporting needs. During the quarter, Calypso also expanded its reach with international customers through upsells with a large European bank and a Middle Eastern bank.</li>
<li><span>Financial Crime Management Technology generated 23% ARR growth with 114% net revenue retention.&nbsp;</span>In the fourth quarter, Nasdaq Verafin added 102 new SMB clients, completed a new cross-sell with a Tier 1 bank, and launched in&nbsp;Europe. Nasdaq Verafin&rsquo;s data consortium continues to benefit from strong growth in its client base, which now represents nearly&nbsp;$10 trillion&nbsp;in assets.</li>
<li><span>AxiomSL and Calypso accelerated cloud bookings.&nbsp;</span>Cloud bookings as a percent of AxiomSL and Calypso&rsquo;s combined new annual contract value was 52% for 2024 and 60% in the fourth quarter, increasing the combined business&rsquo; cloud mix of ARR to 27% at year end.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>Index delivered another quarter of outstanding performance benefiting from its growth strategy across innovation, globalization, and institutional client expansion.&nbsp;</span>In 2024, Nasdaq&rsquo;s Index business launched a record 116 new products with its clients, more than half of which were international, 27 were within the institutional insurance annuity space, and 30 were launched in partnership with new Index clients. For the year, the business had&nbsp;$80 billion&nbsp;of net inflows, including&nbsp;$28 billion&nbsp;in the fourth quarter, and reported its fifth consecutive record quarter in ETP AUM, reaching&nbsp;$647 billion&nbsp;at quarter end.</li>
<li><span>Nasdaq extended listing leadership in 2024 with its sixth consecutive year as the top&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;exchange by number of IPOs and proceeds raised.</span>&nbsp;For the year, Nasdaq welcomed 180 IPOs, representing&nbsp;$23 billion&nbsp;in total proceeds raised. New listings included 130 operating companies, headlined by Lineage, the largest IPO of the year. In 2024, Nasdaq had an 80% win rate among eligible operating company IPOs in the&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;In the third quarter, Nasdaq celebrated its 500th listing transfer, bringing the cumulative market capitalization at transfer to nearly&nbsp;$3 trillion. The company had 14 new transfers in the fourth quarter, including Palantir, the largest transfer on a&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;exchange in 2024, bringing the total to 30 new switches with over&nbsp;$180 billion&nbsp;in market value for the year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li><span>Market Services achieved record fourth quarter and full year net revenue.&nbsp;</span>Fourth quarter net revenue benefited from momentum in&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;cash equities, including the Closing Cross reaching a new record in fourth quarter share volume, and record&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;equity derivatives volumes. 2024 Market Services net revenue growth reflected healthy growth in&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;cash equities, with the Closing Cross setting full year records in both share volume and notional value traded, and index options revenue more than doubling.</li>
<li><span>Nasdaq successfully delivered on its 2024 strategic priorities&nbsp;</span>&ndash; Integrate, Innovate, Accelerate &ndash; positioning the company to capitalize on opportunities for sustainable, scalable, and resilient growth.<br /> 
<ul type="circle">
<li><span>Integrate</span>&nbsp;&ndash; Nasdaq finished the year ahead of its net expense synergy and deleveraging goals. The company has fully actioned the&nbsp;$80 million&nbsp;net expense synergies goal that was announced with the acquisition of AxiomSL and Calypso, a year ahead of the initial target. Nasdaq is broadening its efficiency program beyond the Financial Technology division and now expects to action annual cost savings of&nbsp;$140 million&nbsp;by the end of 2025, inclusive of the net expense synergies related to the AxiomSL and Calypso acquisition.</li>
<li><span>Innovate&nbsp;</span>&ndash; In 2024, Nasdaq demonstrated its innovation leadership with the launch of AI-powered solutions and product enhancements across its divisions. Nasdaq has a robust pipeline of new AI capabilities to deliver through our software and analytics solutions, with several feature launches planned for 2025. The company has advanced its focus from &ldquo;exploration and experimentation&rdquo; to driving &ldquo;impact&rdquo; as it targets AI-driven productivity enhancements across the organization.</li>
<li><span>Accelerate</span>&nbsp;&ndash; The company continues to make progress on its One Nasdaq strategy, with 17 cross-sell deals since the Adenza acquisition across solutions such as Nasdaq Surveillance, AxiomSL, and&nbsp;Verafin. Nasdaq remains on track to exceed&nbsp;$100 million&nbsp;in run-rate revenue from cross-sells by the end of 2027.</li>

Adjusted change also excludes the impacts of foreign currency except for AxiomSL and Calypso, which will be calculated on an organic basis beginning in 2025, and the previously announced one-time revenue benefits in Market Services in 4Q23 and Index in 1Q24. These results are not calculated, and do not intend to be calculated, in a manner consistent with the pro forma requirements in Article 11 of Regulation S-X. Preparation of this information in accordance with Article 11 would differ from results presented in this earnings release.<br /><span>4</span>&nbsp;Constitutes revenue from our Capital Access Platforms and Financial Technology segments.<br /><span>5</span>&nbsp;Annualized&nbsp;Recurring&nbsp;Revenue&nbsp;(ARR) for a given period is the current annualized value derived from subscription contracts with a defined contract value. This excludes contracts that are not recurring, are one-time in nature or where the contract value fluctuates based on defined metrics. ARR is currently one of our key performance metrics to assess the health and trajectory of our recurring business. ARR does not have any standardized definition and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those items. For AxiomSL and Calypso recurring revenue contracts, the amount included in ARR is consistent with the amount that we invoice the customer during the current period. Additionally, for AxiomSL and Calypso recurring revenue contracts that include annual values that increase over time, we include in ARR only the annualized value of components of the contract that are considered active as of the date of the ARR calculation. We do not include the future committed increases in the contract value as of the date of the ARR calculation. ARR is not a forecast and the active contracts at the end of a reporting period used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers.<br /><span>6&nbsp;</span>Organic changes reflect adjustments for: (i) the impact of period-over-period changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and (ii) the revenue, expenses and operating income associated with acquisitions and divestitures for the twelve month period following the date of the acquisition or divestiture.<br /><span>7&nbsp;</span>U.S.&nbsp;GAAP operating expense and tax rate guidance are not provided due to the inherent difficulty in quantifying certain amounts due to a variety of factors including the unpredictability in the movement in foreign currency rates, as well as future charges or reversals outside of the normal course of business.</p>

<p><span>NON-GAAP INFORMATION</span></p>
<p>In addition to disclosing results determined in accordance with&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP, Nasdaq also discloses certain non-GAAP results of operations, including, but not limited to, non-GAAP Solutions revenue, non-GAAP net revenue, non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP operating expenses, that include certain adjustments or exclude certain charges and gains that are described in the reconciliation table of&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP to non-GAAP information provided at the end of this release. Management uses this non-GAAP information internally, along with&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP information, in evaluating our performance and in making financial and operational decisions. We believe our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and supplemental data relating to our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of results as the items described below in the reconciliation tables do not reflect ongoing operating performance.</p>
<p>These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to,&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate such measures differently, which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. This information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant as a substitute for our operating results in accordance with&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP. We recommend investors review the&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP financial measures included in this earnings release. When viewed in conjunction with our&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide greater transparency and a more complete understanding of factors affecting our business than&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP measures alone.</p>
<p>We understand that analysts and investors regularly rely on non-GAAP financial measures, such as those noted above, to assess operating performance. We use these measures because they highlight trends more clearly in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our ongoing operating performance.</p>
<p><span>Organic revenue and expense growth, organic change and organic impact</span>&nbsp;are non-GAAP measures that reflect adjustments for: (i) the impact of period-over-period changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and (ii) the revenue, expenses and operating income associated with acquisitions and divestitures for the twelve month period following the date of the acquisition or divestiture. Reconciliations of these measures are described within the body of this release or in the reconciliation tables at the end of this release.</p>
<p><span>Foreign exchange impact:</span>&nbsp;In countries with currencies other than the&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;dollar, revenue and expenses are translated using monthly average exchange rates. Certain discussions in this release isolate the impact of year-over-year foreign currency fluctuations to better measure the comparability of operating results between periods. Operating results excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations are calculated by translating the current period&rsquo;s results by the prior period&rsquo;s exchange rates.</p>
<p align="justify"><span>Restructuring programs</span>: In the fourth quarter of 2023, following the closing of the Adenza acquisition, our management approved, committed to and initiated a restructuring program to optimize our efficiencies as a combined organization. We further expanded this program in the fourth quarter of 2024 to accelerate our momentum and further optimize our efficiencies (efficiency program). We have incurred costs principally related to employee-related costs, contract terminations, real estate impairments and other related costs and expect to incur additional costs in these areas in an effort to accelerate efficiencies through location strategy and enhanced AI capabilities. Actions taken as part of this program will be complete by the end of 2025, while certain costs may be recognized in the first half of 2026. We expect to achieve benefits primarily in the form of expense synergies. In&nbsp;October 2022, following our September announcement to realign our segments and leadership, we initiated a divisional alignment program with a focus on realizing the full potential of this structure. In connection with the program, we expect to incur pre-tax charges principally related to employee-related costs, consulting, asset impairments and contract terminations over a two-year period. We expect to achieve benefits in the form of both increased customer engagement and operating efficiencies. Costs related to the Adenza restructuring and the divisional alignment programs are recorded as &ldquo;restructuring charges&rdquo; in our consolidated statements of income. We exclude charges associated with these programs for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures as they are not reflective of ongoing operating performance or comparisons in Nasdaq's performance between periods.</p>

<td colspan="18">(1) During the third quarter of 2024, as part of finalizing the purchase accounting of the Adenza acquisition, we implemented a change to the accounting treatment of the revenues associated with AxiomSL on-premises subscription contracts, which are included in the Regulatory Technology business within the Financial Technology segment. Starting in the third quarter of 2024, we began recognizing AxiomSL&rsquo;s subscription-based revenues on a ratable basis over the contract term. As a result of this change, we recognized a one-time revenue reduction of&nbsp;$32 million&nbsp;in the third quarter of 2024, reflecting the net impact of the accounting change since the date of the Adenza acquisition. The adjustment of&nbsp;$34 million&nbsp;reflects the prior year impact of this change.</td>

We expect to achieve benefits primarily in the form of expense and revenue synergies. In&nbsp;October 2022, following our&nbsp;September 2022&nbsp;announcement to realign our segments and leadership, we initiated a divisional alignment program with a focus on realizing the full potential of this structure. In&nbsp;September 2024, we completed our divisional alignment program and recognized total pre-tax charges of&nbsp;$139 million&nbsp;over a two-year period.</td>

We expect to achieve benefits primarily in the form of expense and revenue synergies. In&nbsp;October 2022, following our&nbsp;September 2022&nbsp;announcement to realign our segments and leadership, we initiated a divisional alignment program with a focus on realizing the full potential of this structure. In&nbsp;September 2024, we completed our divisional alignment program and recognized total pre-tax charges of&nbsp;$139 million&nbsp;over a two-year period.</td>

This excludes contracts that are not recurring, are one-time in nature, or where the contract value fluctuates based on defined metrics. ARR is currently one of our key performance metrics to assess the health and trajectory of our recurring business. ARR does not have any standardized definition and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those items. For AxiomSL and Calypso recurring revenue contracts, the amount included in ARR is consistent with the amount that we invoice the customer during the current period. Additionally, for AxiomSL and Calypso recurring revenue contracts that include annual values that increase over time, we include in ARR only the annualized value of components of the contract that are considered active as of the date of the ARR calculation. We do not include the future committed increases in the contract value as of the date of the ARR calculation. ARR is not a forecast and the active contracts at the end of a reporting period used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers.</td>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Issues First Fine For Transaction Reporting Failures Under MiFIR</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-issues-first-fine-for-transaction-reporting-failu/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-issues-first-fine-for-transaction-reporting-failu/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>Infinox Capital Limited (Infinox) has been fined &pound;99,200 by the FCA for failing to submit 46,053 transaction reports which risked market abuse going undetected.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>To monitor, detect and disrupt market abuse effectively, the FCA needs to receive complete, accurate and timely transaction reports.</p>
<p>Between 1 October 2022 and 31 March 2023, Infinox failed to submit transaction reports for single-stock contracts for difference (CFD) trades executed through one of its corporate brokerage accounts. Trades executed through this corporate brokerage account accounted for the majority of this business line. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Although Infinox identified its failure to submit these transaction reports following a third-party review, it did not proactively report the breach to the FCA. The FCA independently identified this discrepancy in transaction data submitted by Infinox. The breach highlighted weaknesses in Infinox&rsquo;s transaction reporting systems and controls for a high-risk investment product. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA has fined a number of firms for transaction reporting failures. However, this is the first enforcement action against a firm for a breach of transaction reporting requirements since they became law under the UK Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (MiFIR). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Steve Smart, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight, commented: &lsquo;As a data-led regulator it is vital that firms submit accurate and timely transaction reports, and promptly bring any failures to our attention. Infinox failed to do this, which meant market abuse could have flown under the radar and risked the integrity of the market.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Our specialist teams constantly monitor market data in real time to track any signs of misconduct.&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/final-notices/infinox-2025.pdf" title="Final Notice 2025: Infinox Capital Limited">Final Notice: Infinox Capital Limited</a>.</li>
<li>Infinox agreed to resolve the case at an early stage and qualified for a 30% discount on the penalty imposed. Without this discount, the fine would have been &pound;141,800.</li>
<li>Infinox breached Article 26(1) of the UK Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 600/2014) (MiFIR).</li>
<li>Article 26(1) MiFIR provides that: &lsquo;Investment firms which execute transactions in financial instruments shall report complete and accurate details of such transactions to the competent authority as quickly as possible, and no later than the close of the following working day.&rsquo;</li>
<li>CFDs are derivative instruments that investors use to speculate on the rise and fall in price of a wide range of assets without owning the asset itself. They are most commonly offered in the UK on an over-the-counter basis by firms acting as counterparty (i.e., as principal) to the client&rsquo;s trade. They allow investors to gain indirect exposure to the price movements in an underlying index, single stock equity, commodity, FX pair or cryptocurrencies. Single-stock CFDs therefore allow investors to speculate on the rise and fall in price of a single stock rather than an index or basket of stocks.</li>
<li>Transaction reports are submitted to the FCA when a transaction is executed in a financial instrument. Transaction reports include, but are not limited to, information on the financial instrument traded, the price and the participants involved. Read more information about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/markets/transaction-reporting" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">transaction reporting</a>.</li>
<li>The FCA uses the information from transaction reports for: 
<ul>
<li>monitoring market abuse</li>
<li>firm supervision</li>
<li>market supervision&nbsp;</li>
<li>sharing with certain external parties, such as the Bank of England</li>
</ul>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>NGX Regulation Limited (NGX RegCo), the independent regulation subsidiary of Nigerian Exchange Group, and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) have called for enhanced partnership to enhance market surveillance and combat financial crimes in Nigeria's increasingly digitalized capital market.</p>
<p>This strategic initiative was discussed during a high-level meeting between NGX RegCo's Chief Executive Officer, Olufemi Shobanjo, and EFCC's Executive Chairman, Ola Olukoyede, at the Commission's Abuja headquarters on Tuesday, January 28, 2025.</p>
<p>During the meeting, Shobanjo highlighted the critical need to adapt regulatory frameworks to address sophisticated digital financial crimes emerging in today's evolving market landscape. "The digitalization of our markets has brought new challenges, necessitating a more robust collaborative approach," he stated. "While our 2013 MoU established initial cooperation parameters, the substantial market growth in 2024 demands an enhanced partnership framework. As a frontline regulator, we recognize the EFCC's crucial role in providing enforcement support and specialized expertise to combat market abuse and protect investor interests."</p>
<p>Shobanjo emphasized NGX RegCo's dedication to maintaining market integrity and expressed confidence that reinforced collaboration with the EFCC would strengthen investor protection mechanisms.</p>
<p>Responding, Olukoyede commended the desire to strengthen the existing relationship between the two agencies and assured that the Commission was ready and willing to collaborate.</p>
<p>"I know you are also concerned with regulatory compliance because the issue of compliance is a key issue. It is part of our mandate to enforce compliance. Under my administration, we have strengthened our bond with different regulatory bodies. Let's see how we can have a desk where we can work better and attend to you. I have a special interest in the capital market in respect of the abuse of assets and trades. We will try to review the MoU, make our observations in line with the relevant laws and regulations, and communicate our views to you. We pledge our commitment to this", he said.</p>
<p>The strategic dialogue highlighted both organizations' shared commitment to fostering a secure, transparent, and globally competitive Nigerian capital market that instils investor confidence and promotes sustainable economic growth.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Executive Board members Javier Hernani, Head Business Unit Securities Services, and Jochen D&uuml;rr, Chief Risk Officer, will leave SIX with effect from 1 February 2025. Both have contributed significantly to the further development and international growth of SIX.</span></p>
<p>Javier Hernani was CEO of BME for many years until November 2024 and since the takeover of BME by SIX, has also headed the Business Unit Securities Services (Post Trading). In this role, he has successfully expanded the international post trading business and developed the business unit into one of the most important commercial pillars of SIX. Jos&eacute; Manuel Ortiz, Head Clearing and Repo Operations, will take over the business unit on an interim basis from 1 February 2025 on until Javier Hernani&rsquo;s successor has been appointed.</p>
<p>Jochen D&uuml;rr has headed the risk and security organization of SIX as Chief Risk Officer for ten years. Jochen D&uuml;rr also led the transformation program as part of the company's strategic realignment in 2017. By establishing and continuously developing a professional security organization, he has made a significant and lasting contribution to the stability and security of SIX. Markus Gumpfer, Head Risk Management, will take over the area from 1 February 2025 on as a Member of the SIX Executive Board (ExB).</p>
<p><span>Bj&oslash;rn Sibbern, CEO SIX</span>: &ldquo;I would like to thank Javier and Jochen for their strong commitment to SIX. Not only have they both successfully built up and developed their respective units, they have also made a significant contribution to the successful international growth of SIX. In doing so, they have made a major contribution to the attractiveness of the Swiss and Spanish financial centers. At the same time, I would like to congratulate Markus for his new role as CRO and welcome him to the ExB. I would also like to thank Jos&eacute; Manuel for his willingness to lead the Business Unit Securities Services on an interim basis. I look forward to working with both of them.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Japan Financial Services Agency: Administrative Action Against AEON Bank, Ltd.</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/japan-financial-services-agency-administrative-action-against-aeon-bank-ltd/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/japan-financial-services-agency-administrative-action-against-aeon-bank-ltd/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="indent">The Financial Services Agency (hereinafter, "FSA") issued a business improvement order as follows to AEON Bank, Ltd. (corporate number: 1010601032497; hereinafter, the "Bank"), pursuant to the provisions of Article 26 (1) of the Banking Act, today.</p>
<p class="indent">Note.</p>
<h2>â . Content of the business improvement order</h2>
<ol>
<li>Implement the following in order to develop a sound risk control culture focusing anti-money laundering and combating financing of terrorism (hereinafter, "AML/CFT"), and build an effectively control money laundering and the financing of terrorism (ML/FT) risks, as well as ensure appropriate business operations concerning Suspicious transaction reporting (STR): 
<ul class="no_icon in-2hang">
<li class="mt20">
<p>(1)ãPromptly establish a control framework for STR in a timely and appropriate manner;</p>
</li>
<li class="mt10">
<p>(2)ãRegarding transactions that had been detected by the transaction monitoring system but were left unaddressed without making judgments as to whether they fall under suspicious transactions, make judgments concerning the necessity to submission STR and promptly make reports if judged necessary;</p>
</li>
<li class="mt10">
<p>(3)ãTake measures as required for the matters left unaddressed, out of those for which actions are required in the Guidelines for Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (published by FSA in February 2018; hereinafter, the "Guidelines"); and</p>
</li>
<li class="mt10">
<p>(4)ãClarify where the responsibility rests based on the imposed disposition, and fundamentally strengthen governance regarding the control environment for managing ML/FT risks, in a manner where the board of directors and the management team make positive efforts to ascertain reality and play a leading role by giving necessary instructions or otherwise positively getting involved in the process, on the premise of utilizing internal audits, in order to implement the above without fail and entrench such attitude as the corporate culture.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="mt20">Submit a plan for improving business operations regarding 1. above by Friday, January 31, 2025,<br />and carry it out immediately.</li>
<li class="mt20">Regarding the improvement plan mentioned in 2. above, make a report on the progress and the achieved improvements once every three months by the 15th of the following month (the first base date for submission shall be February 28, 2025).</li>
</ol>
<h2>â¡. Reasons for the administrative action</h2>
<p class="indent">As a result of FSA's on-site inspection and the reviews of the report which the Bank was requested to submit under the provisions of Article 24 (1) of the Banking Act, points to be improved were found regarding the Bank's inappropriate business operations and problems in its business attitude and governance regarding AML/CFT as below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Inappropriate business operations regarding countermeasures against ML/TF 
<ul class="no_icon in-3hang">
<li class="mt20">
<p>(1)ãInappropriate handling of STR</p>
<ul>
<li class="mt10">
<p>(i)ãIgnored transactions detected by the transaction monitoring system</p>
<p>From June to November 2023 and from July to September 2024, the Bank is suspected to have left at least 14,639 transactions, out of all transactions detected by the transaction monitoring system, without making judgements as to whether they fall under suspicious transactions, and have failed to make reports on transactions that should have been reported. It was found that the Bank's handling of the reporting in this manner may constitute a violation of the Act on Prevention of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds.</p>
</li>
<li class="mt10">
<p>(ii)ãAccumulation and prolongation of STR</p>
<p>It was found that the Bank has continued to require a long period of time to make reports after detecting suspicious transactions since May 2023 (the average number of days was the largest, at 152 days, in February 2024).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="mt10">
<p>(2)ãNon-completion of the Guidelines by the deadline</p>
<p>The Bank has failed to take measures for its systems necessary for developing the relevant control environment as requested by the Guidelines, and has not also completed the development of rules, etc.<br /> With regard to the matters for improvements pointed out by FSA in the previous on-site inspection, the Bank made no improvements as of the time of the latest inspection despite having had sufficient time. It was found that the Bank has not taken measures for the matters for which actions are required by the Guidelines and has not completed the development of its control environment by the deadline as requested by FSA (end of March 2024).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Problems in the business attitude and governance
<p>In consideration of the increasing global request and the recent expansion of damage caused by bank transfer fraud, AML/CFT should be positioned as one of the priorities in management policies in the financial sector. FSA has also requested financial institutions to surely develop their governance for managing ML/FT risks based on the Guidelines by the deadline and has repeatedly disseminated related information.<br /> Under such circumstances, the Bank is found to continue inappropriate business operations as mentioned in 1. above and have problems in its business attitude as described in (1) and (2) below, which are direct causes of such inappropriateness. Its board of directors and management team have had multiple opportunities for ascertaining those facts based on the situation where business operations regarding STR were delayed and prolonged, or through reports on the status of responses to the matters pointed out in the previous inspection and the points indicated in internal audits, but they have failed to exercise initiative by positively ascertaining reality or giving instructions for the development of the control environment.<br /> Such attitude of the board of directors and the management team must have fostered the Bank's risk control culture disregarding the establishment of the control environment for managing ML/TF risks, and have hindered its autonomous improvements.</p>
<ul class="no_icon in-3hang">
<li class="mt20">
<p>(1)ãProblems in the control environment related STR</p>
<p>The Bank has not allocated personnel necessary for the business operations regarding the reporting of suspicious transactions, and as a result, it has left detected transactions without making judgments as to whether they fall under suspicious transactions as mentioned in 1.(1) (i) above, and has failed to ascertain such situation appropriately on a timely basis.<br /> In addition, even after business operations regarding STR was actually delayed and prolonged, the Bank did not investigate the causes nor has it developed a control environment necessary for performing the relevant business operations appropriately on a timely basis.</p>
</li>
<li class="mt10">
<p>(2)ãProblems in the control environment wherein the Bank could not complete actions as required by the Guidelines by the deadline</p>
<p>With regard to improvements to the matters pointed out in the previous inspection, the Bank misconstrued that it would be all right if only the Bank makes a plan for measures for its systems necessary for developing the control environment by the deadline even though it does not actually introduce the relevant systems, and has yet to introduce them even at present without considering adverse effects that may be caused by the delay in the introduction of systems, such as increases in work load.<br /> Furthermore, the Bank overlooked the situation where the departments in charge have failed to fulfil their function to check the progress in improvement measures and the sufficiency and validity of the details thereof, and did not make corrections to such situation. The Bank has not conducted confirmation as to the effectiveness of the measures for strengthening its control environment that it took after the previous inspection, including confirmation using external consulting companies.<br /> The Bank left responses to the matters for improvements pointed out in internal audits completely to the departments in charge, and did not follow up on the progress by the deadline.</p>

<p>the process by which NRSROs determine whether their methodologies are appropriately designed to reflect their view of relevant credit risks as conditions evolve;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>surveillance practices of NRSROs to assess compliance with statutory and rule requirements, such as the requirement to have an effective internal control structure;</p>

The staff also discusses credit rating activity and industry developments with NRSROs and market participants. OCR provides its examination findings to Congress and the public in its annual staff report.</p>

<title>Alberta Securities Commission: Top Concepts From ScamShield: Investor Protection Challenge Selected To Move Forward</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/alberta-securities-commission-top-concepts-from-scamshield-investor-protection/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/alberta-securities-commission-top-concepts-from-scamshield-investor-protection/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Alberta Securities Commission (ASC), in partnership with the Edmonton Police Foundation (EPF) and Edmonton Police Service (EPS), is pleased to provide an update on the ScamShield: Investor Protection Challenge.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.asc.ca/en/News-and-Publications/News-Releases/2024/09/sept-04-New-challenge-seeks-to-tackle-online-crypto-investment-fraud-with-innovation">Launched in September 2024</a>, the challenge called for innovative solutions to address the growing threat of online crypto investment fraud. More than 30 submissions were received, and a diverse panel of judges selected two concepts that demonstrated the best approaches to tackling this pressing issue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We look forward to the further development of these two ideas and their potential to make a meaningful impact in combatting online crypto investment fraud,&rdquo; said Stan Magidson, Chair and CEO of the ASC. &ldquo;We congratulate the winners and thank everyone who participated in this challenge for their dedication to investor protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The solutions presented through ScamShield highlight the power of collaboration and innovation in addressing this complex and pervasive issue,&rdquo; said Ashif Mawji, Past Chair of the Edmonton Police Foundation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While police continue to investigate the increasing amount of crypto investment frauds, it&rsquo;s encouraging to see so many people in the community united through the ScamShield challenge to address this particular type of fraud,&rdquo; said Deputy Chief Devin Laforce with the EPS Investigations and Support Services Bureau.&nbsp; &ldquo;Law enforcement can&rsquo;t tackle this problem alone, but with collective efforts like this, we can reduce these incidents and provide essential education and awareness to help Edmontonians identify this type of fraud. Thank you to everyone who participated in the challenge, and congratulations to the winners!&rdquo;</p>
<p>More information about the winning solutions will be shared in the coming months. After they have undergone further stress testing, these tools will serve as an important addition to the ASC&rsquo;s investor protection resources available on&nbsp;<a href="http://checkfirst.ca/">CheckFirst.ca</a>.</p>
<p>Online crypto investment fraud continues to evolve, and Alberta investors remain a target of sophisticated scams. The ASC estimates that in 2023, more than 60 per cent of the $309 million in investment fraud reported to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre was tied to crypto schemes. As part of the EPF&rsquo;s Community Solutions Accelerator, ScamShield put forth a challenge to innovators to develop a solution to online crypto investment fraud that would complement the work already being done by the ASC and law enforcement.</p>
<p>EPS and the EPF were the first to bring the Community Solutions Accelerator approach to policing in North America in 2020. The Community Solutions Accelerator leverages expertise, data, technology, and support from multiple sources to work collectively on challenges that have been identified by the community, social agencies, healthcare, and law enforcement.<br /><br />The ASC is the regulatory agency responsible for administering the province's securities laws. It is entrusted with fostering a fair and efficient capital market in Alberta and with protecting investors. As a member of the Canadian Securities Administrators, the ASC works to improve, coordinate and harmonize the regulation of Canada's capital markets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This report is a valuable tool that we provide to member firms in support of our self-regulatory mission to protect investors and ensure market integrity. The topics reflect areas where FINRA has observed gaps in firm compliance programs as well as areas of emerging or increased risk. The report contains new topics, including a section addressing the third-party risk landscape, and many that will be familiar&mdash;such as cybersecurity and cyber-enabled fraud, communications with the public, and Regulation Best Interest and Form CRS&mdash;which have been updated to reflect evolving risks, industry trends and exam findings,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/about/governance/executives#member">Greg Ruppert, Executive Vice President and Head of Member Supervision at FINRA</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monitoring the markets, anticipating and addressing risks, identifying and investigating trading violations, and leveraging data are all part of the important work that FINRA does to safeguard the integrity of our vibrant capital markets to ensure that everyone can invest with confidence. Part of this work is reflected in our observations about manipulative trading, customer order handling and extended hours trading, among others, in this year&rsquo;s Regulatory Oversight Report,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/about/governance/executives#mrts">Stephanie Dumont, Executive Vice President and Head of Market Regulation and Transparency Services at FINRA</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Transparency is essential to a healthy regulatory program, and that is what we aim to provide with the Regulatory Oversight Report. This report contains information and insights that were gathered during the course of our regulatory operations activities, as well as some of the effective practices we have observed, to help member firms enhance their compliance programs,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/about/bill-st-louis">Bill St. Louis, Executive Vice President and Head of Enforcement at FINRA</a>.</p>
<p>The report covers 24 topics, including new content. For each area, the report identifies the relevant rule(s); summarizes noteworthy findings or observations, as well as effective practices observed, from recent oversight activities; and provides additional resources that may be helpful to member firms in reviewing their supervisory procedures and controls, and fulfilling their compliance obligations.</p>
<p><strong>New content covered in the report:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Third-party risk landscape.</strong>&nbsp;In recent years, FINRA has observed an increase in cyberattacks and outages at third-party vendors used by member firms. Given the financial industry&rsquo;s reliance on third-party vendors to support key systems and covered activities, an attempted cyberattack or an outage at a third-party vendor could potentially impact a large number of firms.</li>
<li><strong>Sales practice and Reg BI compliance regarding complex products (</strong><em><strong>e.g.</strong></em><strong>, RILAs).</strong>&nbsp;The Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s Regulation Best Interest establishes a &ldquo;best interest&rdquo; standard of conduct for broker-dealers and associated persons when they make recommendations to retail customers of any securities transaction or investment strategy involving securities, including recommendations of variable annuities and registered index-linked annuities.</li>
<li><strong>Extended hours trading.</strong>&nbsp;Over the last few years, trading in National Market System stocks and other securities has increasingly stretched beyond regular trading hours. As a result, FINRA has observed a growing number of firms offering varying degrees of extended hours trading services, in some instances including the overnight period of 8:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m. ET.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Artificial intelligence (AI).</strong>&nbsp;FINRA has noted that AI-based tools have been widely used in the financial services for a number of years, and recognizes their potential value for investors, member firms and markets, etc.&mdash;and also the need for all those involved to manage potential risks. FINRA has observed that firms are proceeding cautiously with their use of Generative AI (Gen AI) technology, generally exploring or implementing vendor-supported Gen AI tools to increase efficiency of internal functions.</li>
<li><strong>Investment fraud by bad actors that directly targets investors.</strong>&nbsp;FINRA has observed an increase and evolution in investment fraud committed by bad actors who engage directly with investors. This typically includes enticing victims to withdraw funds from their securities accounts and send the funds to the bad actors as part of a fraudulent scheme.</li>
<li><strong>FINRA rules concerning the Remote Inspections Pilot Program and Residential Supervisory Location designation.</strong>&nbsp;Advances in technology and communications in the financial industry have significantly changed the way in which firms and their associated persons conduct business. In recognition of these changes, FINRA adopted FINRA Rules&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/key-topics/remote-inspections-pilot-program">3110.18</a>&nbsp;(Remote Inspections Pilot Program) and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/key-topics/remote-inspections-pilot-program">3110.19</a>&nbsp;(Residential Supervisory Locations), which reflect a measured, modernized approach to supervision while preserving investor protection objectives.</li>
<li><strong>Trade reporting enhancements for fractional share transactions.</strong>&nbsp;FINRA is planning to implement enhancements to the FINRA facilities to support the reporting of fractional share quantities.</li>
</ul>
<p>A FINRA Unscripted&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/media-center/finra-unscripted/unpacking-the-2025-regulatory-oversight-report">podcast episode</a>&nbsp;about the report&mdash;featuring Ruppert, Dumont and St. Louis and guest hosted by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/about/executives/kayte-toczylowski">Kayte Toczylowski, Vice President, Member Relations and Education at FINRA</a>&mdash;is available on FINRA&rsquo;s website (a transcript is available).

<title>Bank Of England Opens New Contingent Non-Bank Lending Facility For Applications</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Bank of England today opened the Contingent Non-Bank Financial Institution Repo Facility (CNRF) for applications.</p>
<p>The new facility, which will only be activated during episodes of severe gilt market dysfunction, will lend to participating insurance companies, pension schemes and liability driven investment funds to help maintain financial stability. This follows the Bank setting out the CNRF&rsquo;s initial design in July 2024.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2025/january/boe-open-new-contingent-non-bank-lending-facility-for-applications#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Vicky Saporta, Bank of England, Executive Director for Markets said:</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Opening for CNRF applications marks a significant step forward in our efforts to deal with future episodes of gilt market dysfunction. Having the ability to lend to eligible non-bank financial institutions in times of severe market stress means we are better equipped to protect financial stability for the benefit of households and businesses throughout the UK.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To ensure its effective design and implementation, the Bank had welcomed views from firms and industry bodies on the first-of-its-kind facility for the UK.</p>
<p><strong>Zoe Alexander, Pensions Lifetime Savings Association, Director of Policy and Advocacy, said:</strong></p>
<p>"The PLSA strongly welcomes this facility and has been consulted by the Bank during its development. It will provide greater reassurance to defined benefit pension schemes, and their members, that they will be able to obtain liquidity during periods of market dysfunction&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>David Otudeko, Association of British Insurers, Interim Director of Regulation, said:</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;The ABI welcomes the Bank of England&rsquo;s new CNRF. It is a helpful emergency liquidity tool to be used during periods of severe market dysfunction only, that could temporarily increase demand for liquidity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As outlined in previous Bank publications and speeches,<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2025/january/boe-open-new-contingent-non-bank-lending-facility-for-applications#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[2]</a></sup>&nbsp;non-bank financial institutions have continued to grow in significance and importance in terms of the impact on UK financial stability. This new tool will support financial stability in times of severe market stress, by providing backstop liquidity to participating insurance companies, pension funds and liability driven investment funds, reducing their need to sell assets.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ol>
<li>The CNRF is now open to applications but will only be activated at the Bank&rsquo;s sole discretion during times of severe gilt market stress that threaten UK financial stability.</li>
<li>CNRF eligibility is targeted at insurance companies, defined benefit pension schemes and liability driven investment funds as these are major holders of gilts and may be exposed to material risk of gilt sales during shocks. The CNRF is a collateralised lending facility which will give cash in return for gilts, and pricing will be determined at the point of activation.</li>
<li>To maximise effectiveness, firms need to hold more than &pound;2 billion gilts alongside meeting other eligibility criteria.</li>
<li>There is an annual fee set at &pound;8,000, which recovers our ongoing costs of running the facility.</li>
<li>Firms must be onboarded according to the Bank&rsquo;s requirements before they can participate in the facility upon its activation. A firm can either access the tool directly or via an appointed representative.</li>

<title>Bank Of England: Contingent NBFI Repo Facility (CNRF) â Market Notice 28 January 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bank-of-england-contingent-nbfi-repo-facility-cnrf-market-notice-28-january/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bank-of-england-contingent-nbfi-repo-facility-cnrf-market-notice-28-january/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>This Market Notice describes the details of the Contingent NBFI Repo Facility and how firms can start the process of applying to the facility.</span></p>
<h2>Market Notice</h2>
<p>In previous communications<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/market-notices/2025/january/contingent-nbfi-repo-facility-market-notice-28-january-2025#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup>, the Bank committed to providing an updated Market Notice and accompanying legal documentation when the Contingent NBFI Repo Facility (CNRF) is open for applications. This Market Notice has been published to provide details about the CNRF and outline how firms can start the process of applying and as such it is not an activation of the CNRF. It should be read alongside the accompanying&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/bank-of-england-market-operations-guide/cnrf">CNRF contractual documentation</a>.</p>
<p>The CNRF is a contingent facility, which aims to address episodes of severe dysfunction in the UK sovereign debt (gilt) market. In particular, the CNRF will address gilt market dysfunction arising from system-wide shocks that temporarily increase non-bank financial institutions&rsquo; (NBFIs) demand for liquidity, when that demand is outside the reach of the Bank&rsquo;s existing Sterling Monetary Framework (SMF) liquidity facilities. The CNRF is not intended to provide liquidity support to NBFIs facing idiosyncratic liquidity or balance sheet pressures, or liquidity demands arising from other market events which do not result in gilt market dysfunction. The CNRF will not be activated outside of periods of severe gilt market dysfunction. For more information about the purpose of the facility, please see the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/market-notices/2024/july/contingent-nbfi-repo-facility-explanatory-note">Explanatory Note</a>.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk170984630"></a>When activated, the CNRF will lend cash, against gilt collateral, to participating insurance companies, pension funds and liability-driven investment funds for a short lending term.</p>
<p>For queries regarding this facility, please email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:CNRFapplications@bankofengland.co.uk">CNRFapplications@bankofengland.co.uk</a>.</p>
<p>The Bank reserves the right to amend or supplement the information contained in this Market Notice, and to adjust the operational parameters of the CNRF or any other aspects of the facility at its sole discretion.</p>
<p>This Market Notice supplements the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/market-notices/2024/july/contingent-nbfi-repo-facility-provisional-market-notice">Market Notice</a>&nbsp;published on 24 July 2024 in connection with the CNRF. In the event of conflict between this Market Notice and the Market Notice published on 24 July 2024, this Market Notice prevails.</p>
<h3>Eligible counterparties</h3>
<p>Participation in the CNRF is open to the following types of institutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Insurance companies;</li>
<li>Defined benefit occupational pension schemes (&lsquo;pension funds&rsquo;); and</li>
<li>Investment Funds or sub-funds thereof whose investment strategy seeks to match the sensitivity of its assets to United Kingdom interest rates or inflation to that of its investors&rsquo; pre-defined liabilities (&lsquo;LDI funds&rsquo;).</li>
</ul>
<p>This Market Notice refers collectively to these institutions as &ldquo;ICPFs&rdquo;.<a id="_Hlk172239112"></a>&nbsp;Eligible ICPFs must meet the eligibility criteria set out in the CNRF Terms and Conditions and any Market Notice published by the Bank from time to time to be admitted to the CNRF as 'Participants'. In particular, all ICPFs must be appropriately regulated or authorised, as applicable, by a relevant regulatory or supervisory authority as determined by the Bank from time to time for assessing eligibility for the CNRF and as more specifically set out in the CNRF Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>This Market Notice specifies the following supplementary information relating to certain eligibility criteria specified in the CNRF Terms and Conditions:</p>
<h4>Minimum level of gilt holdings</h4>
<p>To maximise the targeted effectiveness of the CNRF in addressing severe gilt market dysfunction, while recognising the limits to the number of firms that the Bank can onboard to the CNRF, eligible ICPFs will need to make a material contribution to gilt market functioning. ICPFs that own a market value of &pound;2 billion gilts will normally be regarded by the Bank as meeting this requirement.&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk188434199"></a>This minimum level of gilt holdings will be reviewed annually, and ICPFs will be informed of any changes via an updated Market Notice.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/market-notices/2025/january/contingent-nbfi-repo-facility-market-notice-28-january-2025#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[2]</a></sup></p>
<h4>Current and prospective financial health</h4>
<p>To participate in the CNRF, eligible ICPFs must meet at all times, in the Bank&rsquo;s opinion, an appropriate standard of current and prospective financial health.</p>
<p>Insurance companies regulated in the UK can demonstrate this by meeting the Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA)&rsquo;s and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)&rsquo;s regulatory threshold conditions.</p>
<p>For LDI funds that are subject to the macroprudential measures introduced by the European Securities and Markets Authority in 2024<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/market-notices/2025/january/contingent-nbfi-repo-facility-market-notice-28-january-2025#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[3]</a></sup>&nbsp;(or the macroprudential guidance introduced by The Pensions Regulator and FCA in April 2023<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/market-notices/2025/january/contingent-nbfi-repo-facility-market-notice-28-january-2025#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[4]</a></sup>, if applicable), adhering to these measures (or guidance) satisfies this requirement.</p>
<p>Pension schemes, LDI funds that are not subject to the aforementioned macroprudential measures, and insurance companies that are regulated outside the UK, can satisfy this requirement by providing evidence of financial health equivalent to an investment-grade credit rating. Where no public agency rating is available, the Bank will consider relevant credit information from other qualified sources, including private ratings from commercial lenders or other relevant third-party sources.</p>
<p>Where an applicant is unable to provide any of this information, please contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:CNRFapplications@bankofengland.co.uk">CNRFapplications@bankofengland.co.uk</a>&nbsp;to discuss whether evidence of current and prospective financial health can be demonstrated in another way.</p>
<h3>Fees</h3>
<p>To participate in the CNRF, Participants will be required to pay an Access Fee of &pound;8,000, payable annually. The Access Fee for the initial annual period in which the Participant is admitted to the CNRF is payable in advance and will be pro-rated to reflect the Participant's date of admission.</p>
<h3>Activation</h3>
<p>The CNRF will be activated when the Bank, in its sole discretion, judges there to be significant gilt market dysfunction presenting risks to UK financial stability; where lending is likely to be effective in tackling gilt market dysfunction and when the demand for liquidity is outside the reach of the SMF liquidity facilities; and until such time as the Bank judges such risks to have subsided. Activation of the CNRF will be announced by a further Market Notice published by the Bank.</p>
<p>To inform decisions about activating the CNRF, the Bank will draw on a range of information to monitor market conditions, including financial market data and market intelligence.</p>
<h3>Design and operating parameters</h3>
<p>The CNRF is structured as a collateralised loan facility between the Bank and Participants, similar to how lending facilities in the Sterling Monetary Framework operate.</p>
<p>The Bank&rsquo;s expectations for the design and operating parameters of the facility are set out below. However, the precise parameters will be calibrated by the Bank based on prevailing market conditions when the CNRF is activated during a period of severe market dysfunction and would be confirmed and published in a Market Notice at the relevant time.</p>
<h4>Pricing</h4>
<ul>
<li>The pricing of borrowing from the CNRF will be specified in a Market Notice at the point of activation. Pricing will be set as a spread to Bank Rate and will be calibrated such that the facility is unattractive when compared to market pricing in normal conditions, but attractive during times of stress when the facility is active. Further explanation of the approach to pricing can be found in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/market-notices/2024/july/contingent-nbfi-repo-facility-explanatory-note">Explanatory Note</a>.</li>

<li>In the event it is activated, the CNRF will provide liquidity at the frequency required to restore market functioning. This could include daily operations if needed.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Eligible collateral</h4>
<ul>
<li><a id="_Hlk172303093"></a>The Bank will accept gilts (both conventional and index-linked, including unconventional gilts such as strips)<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/market-notices/2025/january/contingent-nbfi-repo-facility-market-notice-28-january-2025#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[5]</a></sup>&nbsp;as collateral. The Bank forms its own independent view of the risks in the collateral it takes in its operations and reserves the right to reject any gilts offered as collateral, for any reason, at any time.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Haircuts and concentration limits</h4>
<ul>
<li>Haircuts for the CNRF are to be set in line with the SMF<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/market-notices/2025/january/contingent-nbfi-repo-facility-market-notice-28-january-2025#footnote-7" id="footnote-ref-7"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[6]</a></sup>. The Bank will keep its approach to CNRF haircuts under review and reserves the right to apply additional haircuts to any individual counterparty to account for large exposures or other risks. Applicable haircuts will be confirmed in a Market Notice at the point of activation.</li>
<li>Concentration limits will be applied to cap the amount of any individual gilt with the same International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) that may be transferred to the Bank as collateral by a Participant. The Bank expects the ISIN concentration limit to be set at &pound;500 million of the Adjusted Value (the value after applying the appropriate haircuts) of the gilts with the same ISIN but will confirm this limit at the point of activation.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Borrowing limits</h4>
<ul>
<li>Participants will be subject to borrowing limits equal to 50% of their total gilt holdings, rounded up to the nearest &pound;1 billion.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/market-notices/2025/january/contingent-nbfi-repo-facility-market-notice-28-january-2025#footnote-8" id="footnote-ref-8"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[7]</a></sup></li>
<li>The Bank will notify Participants of their borrowing limits on admission to the CNRF, and then approximately annually thereafter.</li>
<li>The Bank reserves the right to amend an individual Participant&rsquo;s borrowing limit, including where multiple Participants from that Participant&rsquo;s group have been admitted to the CNRF.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Allocation process</h4>
<ul>
<li>CNRF operations will be fixed price, full allotment, subject to borrowing limits as described above.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Term of the facility</h4>
<ul>
<li>The maturity of the lending is expected to be short-term, with a lending term of around 1 to 2 weeks. However, the Bank expects that Participants will be able to roll their borrowing in operations while the CNRF is active. The exact term of the facility will be specified via a Market Notice at the point of activation.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Bidding process</h4>
<ul>
<li>Operations will be conducted using the Bank&rsquo;s electronic tendering system, Btender<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/market-notices/2025/january/contingent-nbfi-repo-facility-market-notice-28-january-2025#footnote-9" id="footnote-ref-9"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[8]</a></sup>, which runs over SWIFT. Installation and completion of testing on Btender will be required prior to admission.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Settlement and collateral management</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Bank expects settlement will be on a T+0 basis.</li>
<li>All payment of funds to the Participant or the Bank will be paid or received via CHAPS.</li>
<li><a id="_Hlk170984857"></a>Gilt securities can only be delivered to the Bank&rsquo;s CREST account<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/market-notices/2025/january/contingent-nbfi-repo-facility-market-notice-28-january-2025#footnote-10" id="footnote-ref-10"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[9]</a></sup>.</li>
<li>CNRF cash advances will be paid to Participant&rsquo;s nominated bank according to Standard Settlement Instructions (SSIs) provided to the Bank as part of the application and test trade process in advance. Participants will be required to provide ongoing updates as appropriate.&nbsp;The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/markets/cnrf/collateral-management-and-custody-client-data-collection-cnrf-repo-facility.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SSI data collection form<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;is provided on the Bank&rsquo;s website.</li>
<li>ICPFs will not be eligible to join the SMF or to hold a reserves account.</li>
<li>The Bank will operate a collateral pooling model to support this facility.&nbsp;Participants will be provided with a collateral pool account at the Bank through the on-boarding process. Collateral held in the pool will not be earmarked against individual transactions. Instead, the value of the collateral held in the pool will be used to collateralise the value of the Bank&rsquo;s total exposure to the Participant under the CNRF. More detail on the methods of instructing collateral movements to a Participant&rsquo;s pool account are provided in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/markets/cnrf/cnrf-operating-procedures.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CNRF Operating Procedures<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external">&nbsp;</span></a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Results publication arrangements</h4>
<ul>
<li>If the CNRF is activated, the Bank will publish aggregate usage of the facility shortly after the close of each operation. Historical aggregate usage will also be uploaded to the Bank&rsquo;s website. By participating in the CNRF, Participants agree to the Bank publishing this information.</li>
<li>The Bank does not expect Participants to publish their own usage of the facility, unless required to by law, regulation or any governmental or competent regulatory or resolution authority. Successful applicants are permitted to publish their own access to the facility once admitted. More detail on Participants&rsquo; confidentiality requirements can be found in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/markets/cnrf/terms-and-conditions-for-participation-in-boe-cnrf.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CNRF Terms and Conditions<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external">&nbsp;</span></a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Onboarding process and requirements for eligible Participants</h3>
<ul>
<li>ICPFs wishing to sign up for the CNRF must submit an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/markets/cnrf/cnrf-application-form.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Application Form<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external"></span></a>&nbsp;along with supporting documentation. Applications should be submitted by individual ICPFs, with valid Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs). The Bank reserves the right to reject applications at its sole discretion at any time.</li>
<li>Participation in test trades will also be required as part of the onboarding process, to demonstrate operational readiness.</li>
<li>The Bank recognises that certain ICPFs may wish to appoint a Representative (such as an asset manager) to act on their behalf for the purposes of participating in the CNRF. Representatives are required to satisfy separate eligibility criteria set out in the CNRF Terms and Conditions, and to have signed a Representative Appointment Letter published by the Bank on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/bank-of-england-market-operations-guide/cnrf">CNRF webpage</a>&nbsp;to give effect to their appointment. Representatives will be able to act for one or more ICPFs.</li>

<title>Middle East Families To Experience USD 1trn Transfer Of Generational Wealth By 2030</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/middle-east-families-to-experience-usd-1trn-transfer-of-generational-wealth-by-2/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/middle-east-families-to-experience-usd-1trn-transfer-of-generational-wealth-by-2/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>DIFC Innovation Hub, the region&rsquo;s largest innovation ecosystem; Julius Baer, the global Swiss wealth management firm; and Euroclear, the world&rsquo;s leading financial markets infrastructure provider, today launched a whitepaper that outlines how technologies are changing the transfer of wealth and highlights opportunities to streamline the process, particularly in the Middle East.</p>
<p><a href="https://edge.sitecorecloud.io/dubaiintern0078-difcexperie96c5-production-3253/media/project/difcexperiences/difc/difcwebsite/documents/media-section/publications/partnered-publications-and-reports/future-of-inheritance-report-2025.pdf">The Navigating the Future of Inheritance report</a>&nbsp;addresses the complexities of inheritance at a time when the region stands on the verge of a historic transition of USD 1trn (AED 3.67trn) in wealth to heirs and extended family members. This includes High Net Worth individuals in the United Arab Emirates who have seen their assets grow by 20 per cent to reach USD 700bn in value since 2022.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digital technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Smart Contracts, Distributed Ledger Technology, and Tokenisation offer promising avenues to reduce friction, improve transparency, and ensure secure, efficient asset transfers.</p>
<p>Despite these new technologies the report identifies that only 24 per cent of High-Net-Worth Individuals currently have a full estate plan in place, highlighting the urgent need for improved inheritance processes. Over half of families (53 per cent) believe that it is just too complicated and too time-intensive to gather, record and plan how to allocate assets across potentially large families.</p>
<p>The report reinforces the importance of close collaboration between wealth managers, family offices, regulators, and service providers in creating a robust platform for wealth transfer and driving adoption.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Mohammad Alblooshi, CEO of DIFC Innovation Hub,&nbsp;</span>said: &ldquo;We stand on the crossover of a monumental generational wealth transfer in the Middle East in an era when wealth portfolio compositions are increasingly complex, driven by ever-widening asset categories and an appetite towards investments in digital assets. This report is the fruit of our partnership with Julius Baer and Euroclear, aiming to leverage this inflection point and drive meaningful change along the inheritance journey. Our goal is to harness emerging digital technologies to tap into the opportunities ahead and position the Middle East as a beacon of best practices in the wealth transfer space.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Alireza Valizadeh, CEO, Julius Baer (Middle East) Ltd,&nbsp;</span>said: &ldquo;Generational wealth transfer is gaining momentum in the UAE and the wider Middle East, and we, as Julius Baer, are in a unique position to advise our clients having had our origins as a family business. As we work closely with current and future generations, it becomes more important than ever to take into account the evolving landscape with the onset of digital assets. We increasingly see the potential of technology particularly blockchain and tokenisation in enabling a secure and transparent process for wealth transfer. I am particularly pleased that we were able to collaborate with DIFC and Euroclear on the eve of our 20th anniversary celebrations on this innovation paper showcasing how we can work towards building the future of finance together.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Isabelle Delorme, Global Head of Product Strategy and Innovation, Euroclear,&nbsp;</span>said: &ldquo;We are extremely pleased to take this next step with the DIFC Innovation Hub and Julius Baer in the launch of this report with the objective to explain the evolving inheritance landscape and its transformative potential. Together we have crafted a comprehensive guide to address the unique regional challenges and vast opportunities within this sector. Our ambition is to empower financial stakeholders and policymakers to embrace innovation, promote efficiencies and build a future-ready inheritance framework that benefits generations to come."</p>
<p>Beyond the future of inheritance, the issues and needs of a family business that has been operating for one or two generations may be very different from those of an established multigenerational family business. To cater to these varied needs, DIFC offers a flexible range of family business structures and solutions, which have been covered in a series of new guides.&nbsp; The first three guides in this DIFC series were prepared in collaboration with DIFC Family Wealth Centre partners including M/HQ, Equiom, Clyde &amp; Co, and KENDRIS. &lsquo;<a href="https://edge.sitecorecloud.io/dubaiintern0078-difcexperie96c5-production-3253/media/project/difcexperiences/difc/difcwebsite/documents/business-section-documents/difc-family-wealth-centre-docs/v2xx-difc-family-wealth-centre--understanding-difc-foundations.pdf">Understanding DIFC Foundations: A Key Tool for Wealth Structuring and Legacy Planning</a>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<a href="https://edge.sitecorecloud.io/dubaiintern0078-difcexperie96c5-production-3253/media/project/difcexperiences/difc/difcwebsite/documents/business-section-documents/difc-family-wealth-centre-docs/difc-family-wealth-centre---understanding-difc-trusts.pdf">Understanding DIFC Trusts: A Comprehensive Guide</a>&rsquo; are available for download for advisors and families.</p>
<p>The series follows the DIFC Family Wealth Centre&rsquo;s first publication titled &lsquo;<a href="https://edge.sitecorecloud.io/dubaiintern0078-difcexperie96c5-production-3253/media/project/difcexperiences/difc/difcwebsite/documents/media-section/publications/difc-business-sector-publications/family-wealth-guide_prosperity-across-generations.pdf">Prosperity Across Generations: Unlocking the power of DIFC for families</a>&rsquo;, to empower families with access to knowledge and expertise on structures, governance, wealth management, succession, and estate planning in Dubai and DIFC. Reflecting the increasing interest from families across the globe to manage their business growth through DIFC, this guide is now available in Arabic, English, Mandarin, and Spanish.</p>

<title>Dubai Financial Services Authority Co-Leads Report On Consumer-Facing AIâs Transformative Impact In Financial Services, Offering Key Insights For Global Regulators</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/dubai-financial-services-authority-co-leads-report-on-consumer-facing-ais-trans/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/dubai-financial-services-authority-co-leads-report-on-consumer-facing-ais-trans/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) announced today the publication of a new GFIN artificial intelligence (AI) report<i>&nbsp;</i>which they have co-led with the UK&rsquo;s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) on behalf of the Global Financial Innovation Network (GFIN). The GFIN AI report, titled&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thegfin.com/publications/key-insights-on-the-use-of-consumer-facing-ai-in-global-financial-services"><span><i>Key insights on the use of consumer-facing AI in global financial services</i></span></a>, outlines key topics such as the transformative role of AI and machine learning (ML), with a focus on their application within risk management, customer service, fraud detection, and investment strategies.</p>
<p>As a founding member of the GFIN, a global network of more than 90 regulators and organisations committed to supporting financial innovation, the DFSA has played a leading role in the GFIN AI project.</p>
<p>Working alongside the FCA to facilitate international roundtables and to host discussions on AI&rsquo;s adoption in consumer-facing financial services, the regulators brought together more than 40 other regulators, industry stakeholders, and financial innovators across multiple jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The GFIN AI report reflects a collective effort by members of the GFIN to better understand the opportunities and challenges AI presents to consumer-facing financial services.</p>
<p>AI is poised to significantly impact how individuals, households, and organisations interact with their daily finances, including how they earn, spend, save, invest, and plan for the future.</p>
<p><span>Key insights illustrate that:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Consumers are increasingly seeking clarity on how robo-advisors make decisions, with a growing demand for transparent decision-making processes in automated financial advice.</li>
<li>&nbsp;AI&rsquo;s role in expanding financial inclusion is clear, assisting the unbanked and underbanked to access the financial tools needed to build better, more resilient futures.</li>
<li>Although AI-powered open finance models drive innovation, they also present governance, accountability, and cybersecurity challenges, therefore highlighting the importance of balancing risk and opportunity.</li>
<li>&nbsp;Global collaboration is essential for harnessing AI&rsquo;s full potential whilst protecting consumers, firms, and markets across borders.</li>
</ul>
<p>The GFIN AI report is designed to facilitate knowledge sharing and insights rather than serve as regulatory guidance.</p>
<p><span>Ian Johnston, Chief Executive of the DFSA, said:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;AI is unlocking new possibilities in financial services, from enhancing accessibility to creating personalised solutions for consumers. As a regulator within the GFIN, the DFSA is committed to fostering innovation in financial services while ensuring that integrity, transparency, and agility remain at the forefront. This report captures a global perspective on how AI can transform financial systems for the better, but also highlights the importance of a robust regulatory framework to address emerging risks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The GFIN AI Project paves the way for continued global collaboration, including exploring the feasibility of a global AI sandbox and enhanced information-sharing frameworks among regulators. The DFSA remains committed to advancing global collaboration and fostering responsible innovation to ensure financial services continue to evolve in a way that benefits consumers and economies alike.</p>

<title>Interactive Brokers Chooses Pirumâs CoacsConnect To Automate Corporate Actions</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/interactive-brokers-chooses-pirums-coacsconnect-to-automate-corporate-actions/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/interactive-brokers-chooses-pirums-coacsconnect-to-automate-corporate-actions/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Pirum, a trusted technology partner for securities finance automation and collateral management, today announced&nbsp;that Interactive Brokers, an automated global electronic broker, has adopted CoacsConnect to automate corporate actions for its clients worldwide.</p>
<p>Pirum&rsquo;s CoacsConnect offers a centralized solution for managing corporate actions, including income claims and voluntary corporate actions functionality. The solution caters to each client&rsquo;s individual requirements and tech stack and currently processes on average US$3.8bn of corporate actions daily.</p>
<p>In selecting the CoacsConnect solution, Interactive Brokers set out to unlock efficiencies through strategic collaborations and mitigate risk in how the global firm processes corporate actions.</p>
<p>Interactive Brokers chose CoacsConnect, as a result of Pirum&rsquo;s proven track record of best-in-class automation services, covering the entire securities lending trade life cycle, as well as the firm&rsquo;s industry-leading connectivity across the securities finance ecosystem.</p>
<p>With CoacsConnect, Interactive Brokers intends to streamline its operations: clean up receivables, reduce email traffic, and accelerate response times with counterparts. Automated payments also mean quicker payment times and reduced open claim balances. In addition, the centralized solution was identified as offering a valuable risk mitigant, with full audit trails, updates, and alerts to identify and notify of time-critical actions to be taken.</p>
<p>Jacob Koopmans, Chief Revenue Officer at Pirum, said: &ldquo;We are delighted that Interactive Brokers chose Pirum for automating corporate actions flows. Even within leading organizations, processing of corporate actions has traditionally relied heavily on manual processes. Thanks to forward-looking firms like Interactive Brokers, which insist on offering best-in-class services to their customers, this past practice is fast becoming outdated. We look forward to collaborating closely with the Interactive Brokers team, to support its roll out of automated and digitalized corporate actions, and to continue developing CoacsConnect, for the benefit of all our clients.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Hamilton ETFs Introduces U.S. &amp; Canadian Dividend ETFs Tracking The Solactive Dividend Elite Index Series</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/hamilton-etfs-introduces-us-and-canadian-dividend-etfs-tracking-the-solactive-di/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/hamilton-etfs-introduces-us-and-canadian-dividend-etfs-tracking-the-solactive-di/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Solactive is proud to expand its collaboration with Hamilton ETFs with the launch of four new ETFs. The HAMILTON CHAMPIONS&trade; Canadian Dividend Index ETF (ticker: CMVP, trading on the TSX), and the HAMILTON CHAMPIONS&trade; Enhanced Canadian Dividend ETF (ticker: CWIN) track a multiple of the Solactive Canada Dividend Elite Champions Index. The HAMILTON CHAMPIONS&trade; U.S. Dividend Index ETF (ticker: SMVP) and the HAMILTON CHAMPIONS&trade; U.S. Dividend Index ETF (ticker: SMVP) track a multiple of the Solactive United States Dividend Elite Champions Index. These ETFs are designed to provide investors with exposure to companies that have a proven history of stable and growing dividend payments in their respective countries.</strong></p>
<p>Dividend-focused investment strategies continue to be an essential component for income-seeking investors. Companies with a long history of stable and increasing dividend payments, often classified as blue-chip companies, are highly valued for their financial stability. Such investment strategies offer exposure to companies that are often financially resilient with strong cash flow generation and shareholder-friendly policies, making them appealing to investors as they are often better positioned to navigate diverse market environments. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Both indices, the<strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.solactive.com/indices/?index=DE000SL0NSW3" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Solactive Canada Dividend Elite Champions Index</a></strong>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.solactive.com/indices/?index=DE000SL0LJE4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Solactive United States Dividend Elite Champions Index</a>,</strong>&nbsp;are part of the broader Solactive Dividend Elite Index Series, which aims to provide exposure to an equity portfolio with a proven track record of stable dividend growth while ensuring sector diversification. Eligible equities must meet minimum thresholds for free-float market capitalization and average daily trading value to ensure adequate tradability. &nbsp;Companies must have a consistent dividend growth history for a sufficient number of years, although stable dividends for securities already in the index are sufficient. Index constituents are selected using a rules-based methodology that prioritizes securities with the highest free-float market capitalization while maintaining diversification by limiting the number of securities from any single sector. Index components are equally weighted to ensure balanced exposure across the portfolio.</p>
<p><strong>The first two ETFs &ndash; CMVP and SMVP &ndash; listed on January 27 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Enhanced versions of these ETFs, CWIN and SWIN, which utilize modest 25% leverage, will list today, January 28, 2025.</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Timo Pfeiffer, Chief Markets Officer at Solactive, commented</span>:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;The launch of these ETFs is an example of the robustness and versatility of Solactive&rsquo;s Dividend Elite Index Series. By focusing on stable income and growth through a well-diversified approach, these indices represent a robust dividend investment approach that reflects the qualities of stability and resilience that investors increasingly value in today&rsquo;s market. We are proud to continue our collaboration with Hamilton ETFs in providing innovative investment solutions.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Babak Assadi, Partner, Head of Product Strategy &amp; Trading, commented:</span>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;We are pleased to continue our relationship with Solactive AG with the launch of our new suite of Hamilton CHAMPIONS&trade; ETFs, which offer investors a disciplined approach to dividend growth investing, focusing on high-quality companies with long-term track records of increasing dividends.&rdquo;</em></p>

<title>ICE Announces Plans To Launch Environmental Registry Technology Services To Bring State-Of-The-Art Infrastructure To Support The Growth Of Carbon Markets - Launch Partners ACR And ART Will Transition To The Next-Generation Registry Platform In 2025</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ice-announces-plans-to-launch-environmental-registry-technology-services-to-brin/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, and the world&rsquo;s largest operator of environmental derivatives markets, today announced plans to launch an environmental registry technology service to bring best in class infrastructure to registries and registry users and support the adoption of carbon credits as an asset class. ICE&rsquo;s service, called ICE GreenTrace&trade;, is expected to launch in late 2025 and is designed to support registries and registry users across the life cycle of a carbon credit.</p>
<p>Launch partner, Winrock International&rsquo;s Environmental Resources Trust (ERT), will use ICE&rsquo;s registry technology service for its world-leading crediting programs: ACR, the Architecture for REDD+ Transactions (ART) and the new sectoral crediting standard in development for the Energy Transition Accelerator (ETA).</p>
<p>ERT launched ACR, formerly the American Carbon Registry, in 1996 as the world&rsquo;s first private greenhouse gas registry. ART was established in 2018 as the first market-based initiative to incentivize the protection and restoration of tropical forests at scale, also known as jurisdictional REDD+. ERT was selected in 2023 by the ETA Founding Partners to develop and pilot the carbon crediting standard for the ETA to accelerate a clean power transition in emerging and developing economies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ICE registry platform is a leap forward for the technology infrastructure underpinning global carbon markets, providing powerful next-generation digital functionality to all registry users to enhance efficiency and market integration,&rdquo; said Mary Grady, CEO of Environmental Resources Trust. &ldquo;Bringing nearly 30 years of carbon market experience to our role as ICE&rsquo;s launch partner, we are excited to join forces with an industry leader to deliver a transformational platform that supports the market growth required to achieve global climate goals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Building on more than two decades of expertise in analogue to digital transformations across multiple asset classes, ICE now plans to deliver mission-critical infrastructure to the carbon credit market. We selected ERT as our launch partner based on their reputation for excellence, longstanding support of carbon markets, and commitment to a market infrastructure transformation,&rdquo; said Gordon Bennett, Global Head of Environmental Markets at ICE. "ICE&rsquo;s technology will bring unparalleled financial market infrastructure to allow customers to more confidently invest in and manage carbon assets at a time when transparency and trust are vital for scaling carbon credit markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since its inception, ICE has built a global digital network connecting energy and environmental market participants to the tools needed to mitigate risk, achieve compliance, and invest, all within a secure, highly regulated, and transparent operational framework. Today, ICE is home to the most liquid venues in the world to trade energy and environmental derivatives. In 2024, a record 20.4 million environmental contracts traded on ICE, equivalent to over $1 trillion in notional value for the fourth consecutive year with more than $50 billion physically delivered to multiple registries.</p>

<title>Euronext To Acquire Nasdaqâs Nordic Power Futures Business</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/euronext-to-acquire-nasdaqs-nordic-power-futures-business/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/euronext-to-acquire-nasdaqs-nordic-power-futures-business/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p align="justify"><span>Euronext (Euronext: ENX), the leading European capital market infrastructure, and Nasdaq (Nasdaq: NDAQ), a leading transatlantic market operator and global technology company, today announced the signing of a binding agreement under which Euronext will acquire Nasdaq&rsquo;s Nordic power futures business, subject to receipt of applicable regulatory approvals.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>The agreement entails the transfer of existing open positions in Nasdaq&rsquo;s Nordic power derivatives, currently held in Nasdaq Clearing, to Euronext Clearing, with approval of the members. Trading of power futures will be operated from Euronext Amsterdam and will be cleared through Euronext Clearing. Nasdaq Clearing AB, Nasdaq Oslo ASA, and their respective infrastructure are not included in the sale. Nasdaq will continue to operate its European Markets Services business and multi-asset clearinghouse.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>The anticipated combination of Euronext Nord Pool&rsquo;s market initiative with Nasdaq&rsquo;s Nordic power futures business is fully aligned with Euronext&rsquo;s &ldquo;Innovate for Growth 2027&rdquo; strategic priority to expand in power and accelerates the delivery of Euronext&rsquo;s power futures ambitions. The transaction complies with Euronext&rsquo;s capital allocation policy and will be fully financed with existing cash.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Camille Beudin, Euronext Head of Diversified Services, said</span><span>:&nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span>Euronext, with its strong presence in the Nordics and efficient integrated trading and clearing setup, is in an excellent position to deliver a long-standing and liquid power futures market for the Nordic and Baltic region. The acquisition of Nasdaq&rsquo;s Nordic power futures is a major accelerator for our power futures ambition and positions Euronext as a leading player for trading and hedging of power in Europ</span><span>e.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Roland Chai, President of European Markets at Nasdaq, said</span><span>:&nbsp;</span><span>&ldquo;Nasdaq&rsquo;s European multi-asset class market infrastructure is an integral part of our business as an operator of transatlantic markets. This transaction will further sharpen our focus on strategic growth areas as we lead the European capital markets with strong client commitment, state of the art infrastructure for multi-asset class trading and clearing, and expertise in sustainability solutions. We are pleased that Euronext can offer a compatible power product structure and are confident that it will provide our members with the scale and expertise needed to further their power businesses.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>In August 2024, Euronext and Nord Pool announced their plan to launch a Nordic and Baltic power futures market that addresses the need expressed by the market to have a long-standing, sustainable market infrastructure committed to developing secure power futures trading in the Nordic and Baltic regions. Client testing for the Euronext Nord Pool power futures offering will open in March 2025. The infrastructure created as part of this project is expected to go live in June 2025 and will be able to support the existing Nasdaq Nordic power futures business.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Euronext and Nasdaq intend to work closely together to ensure a smooth migration of Nasdaq&rsquo;s Nordic power futures in the first half of 2026. Until the migration is completed, Nasdaq will continue to operate its Nordic power futures business as usual. On receipt of the required approvals, Nasdaq will inform the market about the timing for the transfer of existing open positions to Euronext and Nasdaq will exit its commodities business post migration. No financial details of the transaction are disclosed.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced the Southern District of Florida entered orders of default final judgement against&nbsp;<strong>Roberto Pulido aka Berto Delvanicci&nbsp;</strong>and his company,&nbsp;<strong>Lions of Forex LLC</strong>, both of Miami, Florida.</p>
<p>The orders stem from the CFTC&rsquo;s complaint filed Sept. 28, 2023, charging Pulido with fraudulently soliciting at least four clients to trade leveraged or margined retail off-exchange foreign currency (forex) and charging LOF with aiding and abetting Pulido&rsquo;s fraudulent scheme [See CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8795-23">8795-23</a>].</p>
<p>Under the terms of the orders, the defendants are required to pay, jointly and severally, approximately $172,000 in restitution to defrauded clients and over $516,000 in civil monetary penalties. The court&rsquo;s decision also permanently enjoins the defendants from engaging in conduct that violates the Commodity Exchange Act, as charged, and permanently bans them from registering with the CFTC and from trading in any CFTC-regulated markets. The orders resolve the CFTC&rsquo;s lawsuit against both defendants.</p>
<p><strong>Case Background</strong></p>
<p>The orders filed Nov. 13, 2024, find from approximately January 2019 to March 2021, Pulido, aided by LOF, fraudulently solicited clients to trade leveraged or margined retail off-exchange forex on their behalf. Several clients subscribed to a retail forex signals trading service LOF offered that would send signals to buy or sell retail forex for a monthly fee, and, for a higher monthly fee, offered live one-on-one training with Pulido. LOF offered this signals trading service through its website which touted Pulido as a &ldquo;seven-figure trader.&rdquo; Pulido, in various social media platforms claimed significant profits trading retail forex. After prospective clients were identified through LOF&rsquo;s signals subscriptions, Pulido made various material misrepresentations and omissions to the clients, including falsely representing they would earn guaranteed monthly profits by having Pulido use his discretion to trade retail forex on their behalf, and clients could withdraw their funds at any time. However, Pulido failed to pay the promised monthly returns and when clients requested their funds, he did not return a significant portion of the clients&rsquo; funds.</p>
<p>The orders also find LOF aided Pulido&rsquo;s fraud by, among other things, receiving client funds into its own bank accounts; allowing Pulido to use the accounts in connection with his fraudulent scheme; touting Pulido&rsquo;s supposed trading expertise on the LOF website; and using the LOF email address to communicate with clients whom Pulido defrauded.<span>&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of Financial Regulation, the Eastern Caribbean Securities Regulatory Commission, and the Financial Services Authority of St. Vincent &amp; the Grenadines.<strong></strong></p>
<p>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this action include Elizabeth C. Brennan, David MacGregor, Lenel Hickson, Manal S. Sultan and former staff member Steven I. Ringer.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CFTC&rsquo;s Commodity Fraud Advisory</strong></p>
<p>The CFTC has issued several customer protection&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cftc.gov/ConsumerProtection/FraudAwarenessPrevention/CFTCFraudAdvisories/index.htm" target="_top">fraud advisories</a>&nbsp;that provide the warning signs of fraud, including the Foreign Currency (Forex) Trading Fraud Advisory, to help customers identify this sort of scam.</p>
<p>The CFTC strongly urges the public to verify a company&rsquo;s registration with the Commission at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nfa.futures.org/basicnet">NFA BASIC</a><span>&nbsp;</span>before committing funds. If unregistered, a customer should be wary of providing funds to that entity</p>
<p>Suspicious activities or information, such as possible violations of commodity trading laws, should be reported to the Division of Enforcement via a Toll-Free Hotline 866-FON-CFTC (866-366-2382) or&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cftc.gov/ConsumerProtection/FileaTiporComplaint/index.htm" target="_top">file a tip or complaint</a>&nbsp;online or contact the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whistleblower.gov/">CFTC Whistleblower Office</a>.&nbsp; Whistleblowers are eligible to receive between 10 and 30 percent of the monetary sanctions collected paid from the CFTC Customer Protection Fund financed through monetary sanctions and paid to the CFTC by violators of the CEA.</p>

<title>Sheep In The Steep: Remarks Before The Northwestern Securities Regulation Institute - SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, Washington D.C., Jan. 27, 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Dixie [Johnson], for that introduction and thank you to the Northwestern Pritzker School of Law for hosting this conference. It is a particular honor to give the Alan B. Levenson Keynote Address. Thank you to everyone in the audience for being here this morning in southern California. Our hearts go out to people who have lost loved ones, homes, or livelihoods not too far away in the Los Angeles wildfires. I must begin with my disclaimer: my views are my own as a Commissioner and not necessarily those of the SEC or my fellow Commissioners.</p>
<p>California&rsquo;s natural beauty has imprinted itself in my memory as it has in the minds and hearts of so many other visitors: breathtaking views from a hike in Yosemite, the saturated majesty of the California redwoods during a December downpour, the mountains ringing Palm Springs&rsquo;s desert loveliness, and stunning Pacific panoramas. One of the state&rsquo;s natural treasures that I would love to see on a future visit is the Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep, a very rare and impressive species of wild sheep. Living in the high altitudes of the Sierra Nevada mountains, these bighorn sheep encounter precarity every day as they navigate the treacherous alpine terrains of their habitat.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-northwestern-securities-regulation-institute-012725?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[i]</a>&nbsp;John Muir described them as &ldquo;highest among the animal mountaineers of the Sierra.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-northwestern-securities-regulation-institute-012725?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[ii]</a>&nbsp;Muir goes on to rhapsodize that the sheep &ldquo;dwells secure amid the loftiest summits, leaping unscathed from crag to crag, up and down the fronts of giddy precipices, crossing foaming torrents and slopes of frozen snow, exposed to the wildest storms, yet maintaining a brave, warm life, and developing from generation to generation in perfect strength and beauty.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-northwestern-securities-regulation-institute-012725?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[iii]</a></p>
<p>Were I to have the privilege of seeing the bighorn sheep in their alpine athletics, I am sure my mind would turn to issues similar to those on the agenda for this conference. Specifically, I would see in the bighorn&mdash;making their way in a terrain that is steep, varied, and fraught with danger, including predators, avalanches, and disease&mdash;an animal analog to public companies navigating the hazardous regulatory, political, and societal landscape of today. Public companies, however, are less nimble and gracious than their creature counterparts in dealing with the rough topography, because it is not their native habitat. Public companies are confronting a symptom of a larger societal malady&mdash;importing politics and contentious social issues into everything we do. The SEC, so-called stakeholders, and the burgeoning industry of advisers, consultants, accountants, and attorneys peddling their costly wares to public companies, sometimes with the agreement of corporate executives, drag companies into social and political melees. Their efforts, an insidious form of rent-seeking, are often quite convincingly disguised in a cloak of ethics and morality. In my remarks today, I hope to offer a path toward more level, predictable terrain (for public companies, not for Sierra Nevada bighorns).</p>
<p>The first step on this path is reminding ourselves that both public companies and the SEC have limited missions. Public companies build products and services that they think other people need or want. If they succeed, they grow and thrive. If they fail, they go out of business. An incentive to serve other people well comes from the desire to maximize the company&rsquo;s long-term financial value for the benefit of its owners&mdash;its shareholders.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-northwestern-securities-regulation-institute-012725?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[iv]</a>&nbsp;A singular focus on building corporate value for shareholders precludes companies from spending time and resources on matters that do not contribute to the company&rsquo;s long-term value: no pet projects for executives, no non-financial targets to afford managers the freedom to claim success when the company is failing financially, no spending simply to silence the loud hawkers of the controversial issue du jour, no commandeering of the company&rsquo;s resources to further one shareholder&rsquo;s favorite cause. Public companies should be at the beck and call of shareholders qua shareholders, not the ever-growing, never-satisfied set of stakeholders that brazenly grasp at company resources to do something other than maximize the value of the company. Directors and executive officers serve shareholders and society best by keeping the companies they guide focused on maximizing long-term financial value.</p>
<p>The SEC also has a limited mission. One of the pillars of that mission is serving the investors who entrust their money to other people by facilitating the provision of disclosure necessary for investment decisions. As lecture namesake Alan Levenson explained more than a half century ago, the corporation has a &ldquo;role as the trustee of other people&rsquo;s money&rdquo;; &ldquo;the other people&rdquo; are &ldquo;the investors&mdash;who are the consumers of the securities industry&rdquo;; and&mdash;&ldquo;[i]f the Securities and Exchange Commission is to be viewed as a &lsquo;consumer protection agency&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;investors are the consumers the SEC is charged with protecting.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-northwestern-securities-regulation-institute-012725?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[v]</a>&nbsp;Levenson goes on to explain that the protection comes in the form of getting &ldquo;readily available and in the most understandable form, relevant, material corporate information at the least expense and burden to the issuer-registrant&rdquo; into the hands of investors, while leaving decision-making to the investor.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-northwestern-securities-regulation-institute-012725?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn6" name="_ednref6">[vi]</a>&nbsp;The SEC&rsquo;s role is to ensure that investors have the information they need to channel funds to the companies that can put that money to the best use by delivering the products and services people demand.</p>
<p>If the first step in drawing companies away from societally contentious rocks and crags is simply to remind ourselves of the limited missions of public companies and the SEC, the second step is fending off efforts to commandeer the SEC&rsquo;s disclosure regime. An effective disclosure regime for public companies is a tempting target for people who want information from companies for reasons other than deciding whether to invest. Attempts to co-opt the SEC&rsquo;s disclosure program to serve non-investor constituencies is not new but has gained steam in recent years. Conflict minerals disclosure and CEO pay ratios are examples from Dodd-Frank. More recently, efforts to expand public company climate disclosure serve not only constituencies that seek to lower greenhouse gas emissions but also sellers of climate consulting services to increasingly over-encumbered public companies. Labor interests seek expanded human capital disclosures.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-northwestern-securities-regulation-institute-012725?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn7" name="_ednref7">[vii]</a>&nbsp;Proponents of higher corporate taxes seek more granular disclosures of how much tax companies pay in each jurisdiction.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-northwestern-securities-regulation-institute-012725?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn8" name="_ednref8">[viii]</a>&nbsp;If this trend continues, companies&rsquo; securities disclosures will bury information material to investors in an unwieldy catalog of responses to special interest groups&rsquo; demands. We all have special interests but endeavoring to stuff them all into securities filings undermines the reason we have such documents in the first place.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-northwestern-securities-regulation-institute-012725?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn9" name="_ednref9">[ix]</a>&nbsp;The best course is for all of us to retreat to a place where materiality from the perspective of the reasonable investor is the sine qua non for disclosures. In this retreat, there is no shame. Materiality-based disclosure is one of the foundational strengths of the American securities regulatory regime. Although in some instances such disclosure may incidentally address the concerns of some special interest groups, important societal concerns are better addressed by political institutions and civil society.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-northwestern-securities-regulation-institute-012725?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn10" name="_ednref10">[x]</a>&nbsp;Europe, where sustainability disclosure requirements are unmoored from materiality and companies are losing focus on corporate value maximization, offers us a cautionary tale.</p>
<p>In addition to guarding public company disclosures, as a third step, we need to stop pressuring asset managers to push public companies into contentious social and political issues. In 2003, the Commission required investment companies to disclose to the public a record of how they voted proxies relating to portfolio securities.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-northwestern-securities-regulation-institute-012725?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn11" name="_ednref11">[xi]</a>&nbsp;The Commission doubled down on this requirement in 2022. Now funds have to disclose votes by category, such as &ldquo;environment or climate,&rdquo; &ldquo;human rights or human capital/workforce,&rdquo; and &ldquo;diversity, equity, and inclusion.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-northwestern-securities-regulation-institute-012725?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn12" name="_ednref12">[xii]</a>&nbsp;Funds also have to disclose the number of shares voted and the number of shares loaned but not recalled and, therefore, not voted by a fund.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-northwestern-securities-regulation-institute-012725?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn13" name="_ednref13">[xiii]</a>&nbsp;These disclosure requirements, while enabling fund shareholders to monitor fund voting, also make asset managers sitting ducks for pressure campaigns from social and political activists<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-northwestern-securities-regulation-institute-012725?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn14" name="_ednref14">[xiv]</a>&nbsp;and scrutiny by ESG rating providers.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-northwestern-securities-regulation-institute-012725?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn15" name="_ednref15">[xv]</a>&nbsp;Fiduciary duty to the fund should be the only guiding principle for asset managers in deciding whether and how to exercise a vote, but this public disclosure requirement elevates voting and exposes it to scrutiny by third parties in a way that could interfere with the proper exercise of fiduciary duty. Relatedly, the Commission has failed to ensure that asset managers think through whether active engagement with companies comports with fiduciary duty to funds that do not have an active investment objective.</p>
<p>A fourth step in bringing companies back onto neutral territory is doing a better job protecting investors from having their resources diverted to deal with shareholder proposals that are not aimed at maximizing corporate value. Historically, shareholder proposals were focused on governance topics that had a direct relationship to the financial prospects of a company. These included measures such as the removal of classified boards, the adoption of poison pills, and the subsequent removal of those poison pills.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-northwestern-securities-regulation-institute-012725?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn16" name="_ednref16">[xvi]</a>&nbsp;In the past decade, the number of shareholder proposals related to environmental and social issues has risen steadily.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-northwestern-securities-regulation-institute-012725?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn17" name="_ednref17">[xvii]</a>&nbsp;The increased volume of pro- and anti-environmental and social proposals should not be mistaken for popularity among voting shareholders.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-northwestern-securities-regulation-institute-012725?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn18" name="_ednref18">[xviii]</a>&nbsp;Sorting through the bluster is no small cost for companies, a point that my colleague Acting Chairman Uyeda has addressed well.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-northwestern-securities-regulation-institute-012725?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn19" name="_ednref19">[xix]</a>&nbsp;Not only does each shareholder proposal impose a significant monetary cost, but it also imposes a much larger opportunity cost as management and the board of directors divert their attention away from the day to day business of maximizing corporate value to deal with the often picayune issues at the heart of shareholder proposals. When one shareholder makes a proposal, all shareholders incur the costs borne by the company.</p>
<p>To protect investors from these expensive corporate diversions, we should re-examine the ownership thresholds in Rule 14a-8 and other available tools to ensure that a proponent has some meaningful economic stake or investment interest in a company. A proponent with such a commitment is more likely to submit a proposal that is actually in the interest of the company. We also should take a fresh look at how Rule 14a-8&rsquo;s consideration of social significance under two bases of exclusion has affected the number, type, and excludability of shareholder proposals. As a practical matter, questions outside of securities issues are necessarily outside of the staff&rsquo;s expertise. As a logistical matter, arbitrating between companies and proponents is a tremendous drain on staff resources. As a constitutional matter, making decisions on highly contentious social and political matters outside of our securities laws usurps Congress.</p>
<p>A fifth way to shepherd public companies back to their more suitable flatland habitat would be for the SEC to refrain from using enforcement actions to override managerial decision-making. These actions may seem benign and unassailable at first glance&mdash;tighter corporate controls are good, right? But, if replicated, they will become a subtle mechanism for the Commission to insinuate itself into corporate management. Some might well argue that this has already occurred. For example, the Commission has taken an aggressively broad interpretation of Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(B)&rsquo;s internal accounting controls provision.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-northwestern-securities-regulation-institute-012725?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn20" name="_ednref20">[xx]</a>&nbsp;As Acting Chairman Uyeda and I noted in a dissent to one case, &ldquo;The Commission&rsquo;s attempts to convert an internal accounting controls provision into an ever-unfolding utility tool that magically converts every corporate activity into something the Commission regulates are inappropriate extensions of the agency&rsquo;s authority.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-northwestern-securities-regulation-institute-012725?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn21" name="_ednref21">[xxi]</a>&nbsp;In another recent example of management through enforcement, the Commission used Rule 13a-15(a), which requires companies to have &ldquo;disclosure controls and procedures,&rdquo; to punish a company for &ldquo;lacking controls and procedures . . . to collect or analyze employee complaints of workplace misconduct&rdquo; given that it disclosed a risk factor &ldquo;related to its workforce and how its ability to attract, retain, and motivate skilled personnel might materially impact its business.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-northwestern-securities-regulation-institute-012725?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn22" name="_ednref22">[xxii]</a>&nbsp;The Commission did not charge the company with making misleading disclosures. By requiring companies to establish disclosure controls for information that is not important for disclosure purposes, the Commission &ldquo;seeks to nudge companies to manage themselves according to the metrics the SEC finds interesting at the moment.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-northwestern-securities-regulation-institute-012725?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn23" name="_ednref23">[xxiii]</a>&nbsp;As one law firm explained, this enforcement action &ldquo;may signal continued and increased SEC effort to use internal controls requirements to address workplace activity not commonly associated with the business and financial performance at the heart of SEC disclosure rules.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-northwestern-securities-regulation-institute-012725?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn24" name="_ednref24">[xxiv]</a>&nbsp;Restoring the internal accounting controls and disclosure controls and procedures requirements to their important, but limited intended purposes is a change in the right direction to rein in the scope of enforcement actions.</p>
<p>A sixth step in bringing companies back to normal is for the Commission staff in our Division of Corporation Finance and Office of the Chief Accountant to re-double efforts to provide guidance to companies about the many disclosure issues that arise in the normal course of business. In the registration statement review process, staff should communicate early and often so new and seasoned issuers alike can have increased confidence in offering timelines. Of course, engagement on timing alone is not enough. The Commission also should encourage the expert staff to engage with public companies and their lawyers and accountants on difficult questions about the application of new and existing rules. This engagement should be dynamic and interactive, not formulaic. Commission staff time is well spent on these fundamental functions of a disclosure regulator, which in recent years have languished due to other Commission priorities.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Commodity Futures Trading Commission<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Acting Chairman Caroline D. Pham is launching a series of public roundtables on evolving trends and innovation in market structure, including issues such as affiliated entities and conflicts of interest, prediction markets, and digital assets. Pham renewed calls for open public engagement and increased transparency by the CFTC on its policy approach to changes in derivatives markets&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement082924b">last year</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I have long said, the CFTC must take a forward-looking approach to shifts in market structure to ensure our markets remain vibrant and resilient while protecting all participants,&rdquo; Pham said. &ldquo;Innovation and new technology has created a renaissance in markets that presents new opportunities that are accessible to more people, as well as risks. The CFTC will get back to basics by hosting staff roundtables that will develop a robust administrative record with studies, data, expert reports, and public input. A holistic approach to evolving market trends will help to establish clear rules of the road and safeguards that will promote U.S. economic growth and American competitiveness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over the next several months, the CFTC will engage with industry leaders, market participants, other market structure experts, and public interest groups through open and transparent public roundtables to provide the CFTC with the best information and latest data.&nbsp;Details about the series will be provided as they become available.</p>

<title>BC Securities Commissionâs New Campaign Targets Investment Scamsâ Use Of Artificial Intelligence</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As fraudsters increasingly adopt artificial intelligence (AI) to deceive investors, an edgy new campaign from the BC Securities Commission (BCSC) seeks to help British Columbians understand how to avoid becoming a victim to AI investment scams.</p>
<p>From chatbots to deepfakes to fake reviews, AI is has become a common tool to lure and deceive investors by making it more difficult for investors to distinguish fact from fiction. According to new research from the BCSC, 71 per cent of British Columbians are worried about AI technology being used in investment fraud, and over half are unsure of where to look for information about AI investment scams.</p>
<p>The BCSC&rsquo;s latest fraud prevention campaign, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re Not All F**ked,&rdquo; acknowledges the anxiety many individuals are feeling about AI while encouraging British Columbians to pause, scrutinize and think critically before investing. An anthemic music&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/25YYb_Ymr9Y" target="_blank">video</a>&nbsp;details the insidious ways in which AI is being used in investment scams, and our new microsite,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.avoidaiscams.ca/" target="_blank">avoidAIscams.ca</a>, offers unbiased tips and information for investors to identify and protect themselves from AI investment scams.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/25YYb_Ymr9Y" target="_blank"><img alt="Group of people with and AI dog" src="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/-/media/Images/News-Releases/BCSC_AI-Fraud_We-Are-All-Fucked_With-Text-January2025.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Canadians lost a staggering $530 million to fraud and cybercrime in 2022, a 40 per cent increase from 2021, according to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre. The real cost is likely much higher, because only 5 to 10 per cent of victims report fraud, the centre says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;AI is a new tool for fraudsters to use to deceive investors, but the warning signs are much the same as other types of investment fraud,&rdquo; said Pamela McDonald, the BCSC&rsquo;s Director of Communications and Education. &ldquo;You are the first line of defense. So it&rsquo;s more important than ever that you pause, think critically, and do your own research before investing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>British Columbians can protect themselves from AI investment scams in various ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look for warnings from securities regulators (for example, see the BCSC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/enforcement/early-intervention/investment-caution-list">Investment Caution List</a>) and negative reviews. Remember &ndash; positive reviews can be faked.</li>
<li>Use the&nbsp;<a href="https://info.securities-administrators.ca/nrsmobile/nrssearch.aspx" target="_blank">National Registration Search</a>&nbsp;to make sure the company or person you&rsquo;re dealing with is legitimate and registered to buy and sell investments.</li>
<li>Check that a company&rsquo;s phone number matches the one listed on the National Registration Database. Call the number to make sure.</li>
<li>Confirm someone is who they say they are. Meeting them in person is one way to do this, but be safe.</li>
<li>AI isn&rsquo;t the only tool scammers use to defraud investors.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/report-to-us" target="_blank">Report suspicious activity</a>&nbsp;to the BC Securities Commission.</li>
</ul>
<p>British Columbians should watch out for red flags of any investment scam, including claims of guaranteed high returns with no risk, pressure to commit quickly, unanswered questions, or exploitation of family, friendship or social connections to create a sense of trust.</p>

<p>The Prudential Regulation Committee (PRC) is responsible for the exercise of the Bank of England&rsquo;s functions as the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA). The PRA is the UK&rsquo;s microprudential regulator for around 1,500 banks, building societies, credit unions, insurers and major investment firms.</p>
<p>The Bank of England Act 1998 requires the Treasury, at least once in each Parliament, to make recommendations to the PRC about aspects of the government&rsquo;s economic policy to which the PRC should have regard when advancing the objectives and discharging the duties of the PRA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This letter provides such recommendations and outlines the important role the PRA plays in facilitating growth and international competitiveness.</p>
<p>The PRC is required to respond to the recommendations from the Treasury within a year of receiving the recommendations, and each subsequent year after that. These responses set out action that the PRC has taken, or intends to take, in accordance with the recommendations, or why it has not acted.</p>

<title>ISDA derivatiViews - On ISDAâs 40th, Weâre Just Getting Started</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-derivativiews-on-isdas-40th-were-just-getting-started/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-derivativiews-on-isdas-40th-were-just-getting-started/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This year marks the 40<span>th</span>&nbsp;anniversary of ISDA &ndash; in May 1985, a group of 10 dealers established the association in New York and published the very first standard document for the nascent over-the-counter derivatives market. Forty years on, the market is bigger, more global and more diverse, and so too is ISDA, having evolved in lockstep with the industry. The commitment to safe, efficient markets has never wavered. That&rsquo;s where you can expect ISDA to double down in 2025, as we begin to chart the next 40 years of the association&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>In the early years, the development of standard documentation helped to alleviate a back-office logjam that had constrained ambitions and limited the growth of the market. Forty years on, ISDA&rsquo;s suite of industry documentation has grown in line with the market, with more than 160 documents and document versions now available in digital form on ISDA MyLibrary. ISDA&rsquo;s pioneers would never have imagined the huge benefits digitization would bring to the documentation of trades and compliance with regulation. In its 40<span>th</span>&nbsp;anniversary year, helping market participants to reap those benefits is a priority for ISDA.</p>
<p>ISDA now boasts a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/isda-solutions-infohub/">wide-ranging set of mutualized industry solutions</a>&nbsp;to automate derivatives market processes and we&rsquo;ll be pushing particularly hard on two of these in 2025. First, ISDA&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/isda-solutions-infohub/isda-digital-regulatory-reporting/">Digital Regulatory Reporting (DRR) initiative</a>&nbsp;has established itself as a valuable tool to improve the accuracy of reported data, reducing costs and cutting the risk of regulatory penalties. Following a rush of reporting rule updates last year, several other jurisdictions will follow in 2025, including Canada and Hong Kong. The DRR will be expanded to support market participants in implementing those new rule sets, as well as reflecting future updates to any of the rules supported by the DRR.</p>
<p>Second, we&rsquo;ll be moving at pace to bring the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/isda-solutions-infohub/isda-notices-hub/">ISDA Notices Hub</a>&nbsp;to market. This will be a powerful industry facility that will enable the instantaneous delivery and receipt of critical termination notices, eliminating the risk exposures and potential losses that can result from delays in terminating derivatives contracts. It will also maintain a golden source of updated office addresses for those counterparty relationships where physical delivery of notices will continue. We have found strong industry support for the Notices Hub and are looking forward to making it available via S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence&rsquo;s Counterparty Manager platform.</p>
<p>The policy agenda for 2025 will also be keeping ISDA busy. It is not yet clear what path the Basel III &lsquo;endgame&rsquo; package will take under the new administration in the US, but ISDA will continue to advocate relentlessly for risk-appropriate rules that support deep and liquid markets. A year ago,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/01/16/isda-and-sifma-response-to-us-basel-iii-npr/">we highlighted the negative impact the proposed rules would have on liquidity and the ability of banks to offer client clearing services</a>. We proposed a series of calibration changes to improve the risk sensitivity of the framework, and it is critical that these are incorporated into the rules. We simply have to get this right.</p>
<p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s Treasury clearing rules, which are due to be implemented on a phased basis from the end of this year, are also high on ISDA&rsquo;s agenda. Given the extensive workload and the complex nature of introducing clearing in this market, spanning document negotiation, cross-netting capital issues and operational integration, ISDA will request that policymakers&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2025/01/22/deadline-pressure-on-treasury-clearing/">adopt a more appropriate implementation timetable</a>.</p>
<p>This wide-ranging book of work includes very different issues and priorities to those contemplated by ISDA&rsquo;s founders in 1985. As we look back on those early days and celebrate all that it has achieved in its first 40 years, I am confident ISDA will continue to deliver value for market participants through standards and mutualized solutions. Forty years might feel like a long time, but we&rsquo;re just getting started.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Managements of the 35 companies included in TASE&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;100 Club&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;in 2024 opened trading on TASE this morning.</p>
<p>On 2023 TASE launched the &ldquo;100 Club&rdquo;, which includes companies with a market cap exceeding NIS 200 million, that have achieved a share-yield of more than 100%. TASE publishes the list of Club constituents in 2024, which includes 35 companies, compared to only 13 companies in 2023.</p>
<p>The highest share-yield in 2024 was achieved by&nbsp;<strong>Prime Energy</strong>, a renewable energy company, with an increase of 574%.&nbsp;<strong>Multi Retail</strong>, which operates retail chains such as Ace, AutoDepot and Beitili, achieved a yield of 417% in 2024. In addition, six companies achieved a share-yield in excess of 200%.</p>
<p>Five companies were awarded 5 stars top rating, which have &nbsp;achieved a positive yield in each of the past three years:&nbsp;<strong>El Al, Bet Shemesh, Teva, Navitas Petroleum&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>TASE</strong>, as compared to only one company awarded the 5-star top rating in 2023.</p>
<p><strong>Arie Zilberberg, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Prime Energy,&nbsp;</strong>said: &ldquo;Prime Energy is proud to be the top-yielder in 2024, which reflects a vote of confidence in its capabilities. Solar energy companies are by nature more solid and stable than rental property companies. We build rental property with set rates for decades ahead, and with Triple A customer.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Ram Drori, CEO of Bet Shemesh Engines,</strong>&nbsp;said: &ldquo;We, are thrilled to be selected as the highest yielder of the &ldquo;TASE 100 Club&rdquo; in the last 3 years. . Bet Shemesh Engines was founded 57 years ago, and we are proud of our successful representation and advancement of Israeli industry and our contribution to national securtity. A significant point of pride for our company is our ability to maintain undisrupted activity, despite the challenges of the past year, and meet the strictest quality requirements of our local and global customers. We are proud of our dedicated employees, who are integral to the continued success and development of the company in the next 57 years and beyond. Bet Shemesh Engines thanks all investors for showing confidence in our company and contributing to our success&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>Dina Ben Tal Ganancia, CEO of El Al,&nbsp;</strong>said: &ldquo;In this challenging year, El Al maintained Israel&rsquo;s air connectivity under extraordinary operational and security constraints. We are proud to have flown more than 6.5 million passengers and tens of thousands of tons of essential cargo to and from Israel. We have demonstrated the crucial contribution of Israeli aviation to national infrastructure and economic strength. We are proud of our achievements this year - last May we entered the TA-125 index for the first time, and now we are excited to be awarded the 5-star top rating and included in TASE &ldquo;100 Club&rdquo;, thanks to the yield that El Al has generated for the investors. The investors&rsquo; confidence in the company was also reflected in the financing of the Dreamliner purchase by Israeli banks and the international institutional investments infused into the company. The streamlining measures that we have implemented in the company, alongside significant agreements with the employees&rsquo; committees, were instrumental to the growth of the company and to its share activity. I would like to thank the El Al staff in Israel and worldwide for their essential role in maintaining continuous air connectivity and taking the company to new heights. Since the beginning of the war, El Al has been providing essential services to our soldiers, the security forces and the families of the hostages. We pray for the return of all hostages, the safety of our soldiers on all fronts, and the quick recovery of the wounded.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Tamar Rosenberg, CFO of&nbsp;</strong><strong>Navitas Petroleum,</strong>&nbsp;said: &ldquo;Navitas Petroleum is proof that vision and tenacity are essential to creating value over time. Our consistent strategy was to take advantage of high-potential opportunities with a lower risk than that customarily taken in our sector, and we have selected worthy partners, operated transparently and gained the full trust of the capital market investors. The Shenandoah Project, which is nearing production, is expected to comprehensively change Navitas Petroleum. The significant Sea Lion Project, which we are currently advancing, is also expected to enhance the business growth of Navitas Petroleum. We our proud to join the &ldquo;TASE 100 Club&rdquo; and thank the investors that have accompanied us on our journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Hani Shitrit-Bach, EVP, Head of Listings at TASE,&nbsp;</strong>said: &ldquo;We are proud to present, for the second year, the list of companies that entered the &ldquo;TASE 100 Club&rdquo;. At the end of one of the most difficult and complex years experienced by Israeli society, we are particularly proud to present the 35 companies that achieved a share-yield of more than 100% in 2024. Despite the many challenges of the past year, the companies exhibited business resilience and were quick to recover, thereby enhancing teh strength of the State of Israel and the Israeli capital market.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Central Bank Independence In An Era Of Volatility - Lamfalussy Lecture By Christine Lagarde, President Of The ECB, At The Lamfalussy Lectures Conference Organised By The Magyar Nemzeti Bank, Pre-Recorded In Frankfurt Am Main On 15 January 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In his later years, Alexandre Lamfalussy was once asked what his fundamental motivation in life was. He recalled the experience of his turbulent youth, surrounded by the destruction caused by the Second World War.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250127~16c35af0c0.en.html#footnote.1" id="fn1">1</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;&ldquo;In the aftermath of the war,&rdquo; Lamfalussy said, &ldquo;I decided to serve the community in the rebuilding of Europe.&rdquo;<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250127~16c35af0c0.en.html#footnote.2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>He went on to do just that. A member of the Delors Committee and the first President of the European Monetary Institute, Lamfalussy helped pave the way for Europe&rsquo;s monetary union and the establishment of the ECB.</p>
<p>His generation had also been scarred by the difficulties of the &ldquo;Great Inflation&rdquo; in the 1970s.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250127~16c35af0c0.en.html#footnote.3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;And so Lamfalussy &ndash; alongside other architects of the euro<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250127~16c35af0c0.en.html#footnote.4" id="fn4">4</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;&ndash; ensured that the ECB would have sufficient powers to prevent a scenario where inflationary expectations once again became embedded in the economy.</p>
<p>We can see proof of this today, as advanced economies emerge from the largest inflation shock in a generation.</p>
<p>As in the 1970s, a series of shocks contributed to high and persistent inflation. But unlike the 1970s, inflation has since fallen relatively fast across advanced economies &ndash; and expectations have remained firmly anchored throughout.</p>
<p>This hard-won progress has been in large part due to the independence of central banks, which has given them the ability to take difficult but necessary monetary policy decisions in pursuit of stable prices.</p>
<h2>The rise of central bank independence</h2>
<p>In the late twentieth century, central bank independence spread rapidly around the world.</p>
<p>A strong social consensus about its benefits &ndash; emerging from the negative experience of the 1970s &ndash; sparked what Lamfalussy would later call a &ldquo;sea change&rdquo; in monetary policymaking.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250127~16c35af0c0.en.html#footnote.5" id="fn5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>By one account, over 80% of the world&rsquo;s central banks became operationally independent by the turn of the millennium.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250127~16c35af0c0.en.html#footnote.6" id="fn6">6</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;And price stability had been adopted as the primary objective of monetary policy frameworks across almost all advanced economies and many emerging market economies.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250127~16c35af0c0.en.html#footnote.7" id="fn7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>Moreover, independent central banks both contributed to &ndash; and benefited from &ndash; a period of low macroeconomic volatility.</p>
<p>In their famous paper, Alesina and Summers found a positive relationship between the degree of independence of central banks and lower and less volatile inflation outcomes.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250127~16c35af0c0.en.html#footnote.8" id="fn8">8</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;At the same time, substantial structural changes were afoot in the global economy, which also helped to reduce macroeconomic volatility &ndash; an era that soon came to be known as the Great Moderation.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250127~16c35af0c0.en.html#footnote.9" id="fn9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>Globalisation led to an enormous increase in both global labour supply and production capacity, which meant that prices and wages were often little affected even in the face of strong demand. And the oil crises of the 1970s had sparked a wave of change in global energy markets, resulting in a more elastic energy supply.</p>
<p>The upshot of the Great Moderation<span>&nbsp;</span>was a<span>&nbsp;</span>virtuous circle.</p>
<p>An environment of low macroeconomic volatility made it easier for independent central banks to deliver on their price stability mandates. That, in turn, solidified the social consensus in support of central bank independence and helped ensure its growing adoption around the world &ndash; further contributing to lowering levels of volatility.</p>
<h2>The era of volatility</h2>
<p>The end of the Great Moderation came suddenly and unexpectedly in 2008 with the arrival of the global financial crisis. And over the last years in particular, our world has changed dramatically.</p>
<p>Indeed, the two forces that fostered the spread of central bank independence &ndash; a strong social consensus and growing pools of global supply &ndash; are now coming under increasing pressure.</p>
<p>While recent research suggests that&nbsp;<em>de jure</em>&nbsp;central bank independence has never been more prevalent than it is today<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250127~16c35af0c0.en.html#footnote.10" id="fn10">10</a>]</sup></span>, there is no doubt that the&nbsp;<em>de facto</em>&nbsp;independence of central banks is being called into question in several parts of the world.</p>
<p>One study examining 118 central banks in the 2010s shows that around 10% of them faced political pressure in an average year &ndash; even those central banks with a high degree of&nbsp;<em>de jure</em>&nbsp;independence.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250127~16c35af0c0.en.html#footnote.11" id="fn11">11</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;Another paper finds that between 2018 and 2020 alone,&nbsp;<em>de facto</em>&nbsp;central bank independence deteriorated for almost half of those central banks in jurisdictions accounting for 75% of global GDP.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250127~16c35af0c0.en.html#footnote.12" id="fn12">12</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>There is evidence to suggest that political influence on central bank decisions can also contribute substantially to macroeconomic volatility. For instance, persistent political pressure on a central bank has been found to affect the level and the volatility of exchange rates, bond yields and the risk premium.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250127~16c35af0c0.en.html#footnote.13" id="fn13">13</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>At the same time, geopolitical tensions threaten to amplify volatility by increasing the frequency of shocks hitting the global economy.</p>
<p>We have already seen the impact of geopolitical tensions play out in Europe. Following Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, average output growth volatility in the euro area surged by 60% compared with before the global financial crisis, while average inflation volatility shot up by 280%.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250127~16c35af0c0.en.html#footnote.14" id="fn14">14</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>An environment of heightened volatility could make the task of maintaining price stability more difficult to achieve.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250127~16c35af0c0.en.html#footnote.15" id="fn15">15</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;This could raise concerns that independent central banks are failing to deliver on their mandates, which could undermine the social consensus and further amplify volatility in the economy.</p>
<p>So, the question that comes to the fore is: will the current era of volatility turn the virtuous circle that facilitated the rise of central bank independence into a vicious circle that leads to it being undermined?</p>
<h2>The benefits of central bank independence in today&rsquo;s world</h2>
<p>All things considered, I would argue that this is unlikely to happen.</p>
<p>A volatile macroeconomic environment actually makes the benefits of central bank independence all the greater. We saw this during the recent inflation shock.</p>
<p>In OECD countries, average annual inflation surged to 9.6% in 2022 as they faced a variety of shocks that compounded each other.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250127~16c35af0c0.en.html#footnote.16" id="fn16">16</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;In response, independent central banks sharply increased policy rates.</p>
<p>These actions led to a rapid decline and convergence in the respective inflation paths of major economies &ndash; despite all these economies facing different shocks. Moreover, inflation expectations have remained firmly anchored, suggesting that the public continues to have faith in independent central banks&rsquo; commitment to price stability over the long run.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250127~16c35af0c0.en.html#footnote.17" id="fn17">17</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s world, central bank independence offers two key advantages.</p>
<p>First, it acts as a headwind to volatility in these unpredictable times.</p>
<p>As we emerge from a period of very high inflation, the issue of time inconsistency is more relevant than ever.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250127~16c35af0c0.en.html#footnote.18" id="fn18">18</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;Compared with the pre-pandemic era of low inflation, central banks may need to contend with lower levels of rational inattention.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250127~16c35af0c0.en.html#footnote.19" id="fn19">19</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>In this environment, credible policy regimes become even more important for maintaining trust in central banks. Research finds that higher trust in the ECB lowers inflation expectations on average and significantly reduces uncertainty about future inflation.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250127~16c35af0c0.en.html#footnote.20" id="fn20">20</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>Second, central bank independence also contributes to regional strength in a world increasingly defined by geopolitical rivalries.</p>
<p>Price stability provides the foundation upon which other strategic goals can be achieved. Regions with stable prices tend to have more efficient resource allocation and higher levels of competitiveness, and they attract greater levels of investment. At heart, strong economic institutions are the fundamental cause of long-run economic growth and development differences between regions.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250127~16c35af0c0.en.html#footnote.21" id="fn21">21</a>]</sup></span></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Lamfalussy once described the task of launching the euro as &ldquo;navigating in uncharted waters&rdquo;.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250127~16c35af0c0.en.html#footnote.22" id="fn22">22</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;In an era of volatility, independent central banks now also find themselves in unfamiliar waters.</p>
<p>While inflation has fallen sharply, central banks are still likely to face a more volatile macroeconomic environment compared with the Great Moderation.</p>
<p>It therefore remains imperative that central banks have the independence to fully deliver on their price stability mandates.</p>

<p><a class="link-inline" id="_Hlk175652581"></a>Average output growth volatility relates to year-on-year euro area real GDP growth. The figure for average inflation volatility is derived from year-on-year HICP inflation for the euro area. The two reference periods are the 28 months following Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine and the 28 months leading up to the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.</p>

<p>This speaks to Lamfalussy&rsquo;s own prescient observation in the lead-up to the creation of the ECB. He argued that the new central bank &ldquo;will have no track record of its own &hellip; This implies that financial markets and the general public will assess the performance of the ECB on the basis of the effectiveness of the monetary policy framework adopted and the ability to act in accordance with its primary objective.&rdquo; See Lamfalussy, A.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Bursa Malaysia Berhad (&ldquo;Bursa Malaysia&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Exchange&rdquo;) announced a Profit After Tax, Zakat and Minority Interest (&ldquo;PATAMI&rdquo;) totalling RM310.1 million for the financial year ended 31 December 2024 (&ldquo;FY2024&rdquo;), marking a 22.9% surge from the RM252.4 million recorded in the previous financial year ended 31 December 2023 (&ldquo;FY2023&rdquo;). The increase in PATAMI was mainly attributed by the robust performance in the Securities and Derivatives Markets, as well as Data Business, which contributed to the 27.8% growth in operating revenue to RM757.7 million in FY2024, compared to RM592.8 million in FY2023. Meanwhile, total operating expenses in FY2024 increased by 26.8% to RM373.4 million against RM294.5 million in FY2023. This increase was largely due to higher staff costs, IT maintenance and service fees, along with the reversal of provision in FY2023.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Bursa Malaysia Berhad (&ldquo;Bursa Malaysia&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Exchange&rdquo;) today announced the appointment of Dato&rsquo; Fad&rsquo;l Mohamed as the new Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Bursa Malaysia, effective 1 March 2025.<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The decision was made by its Board of Directors, in line with the Exchange&rsquo;s leadership succession plan and with the upcoming retirement of Datuk Muhamad Umar who has been the CEO of Bursa Malaysia since February 2019. The Securities Commission Malaysia has also given its concurrence for the appointment of the new CEO in accordance with Section 10 of the Capital Markets and Services Act 2007.</p>
<p>Tan Sri Abdul Wahid Omar, Chairman, Bursa Malaysia said, &ldquo;On behalf of the Board, we are pleased to welcome Dato&rsquo; Fad&rsquo;l Mohamed as the next CEO to take Bursa Malaysia forward, building on the strong progress laid by Datuk Muhamad Umar. Dato&rsquo; Fad&rsquo;l&rsquo;s understanding of capital markets and investment banking sets him in solid stead to lead the Exchange into the future. We are confident that his expertise will drive continued growth and success for the Exchange and the marketplace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dato&rsquo; Fad&rsquo;l, 57, brings with him over 30 years&rsquo; experience in areas of legal, capital markets, and investment banking. He is currently the Managing Director, Group Wholesale Banking of RHB Bank Berhad, and was previously CEO of Maybank Investment Bank. Dato&rsquo; Fad&rsquo;l began his career as a lawyer at Messrs Rashid &amp; Lee in 1991 before joining the Securities Commission Malaysia in 1993. Thereafter, he moved to Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, an investment banking firm. In 2004, he founded Maestro Capital Sdn. Bhd., a licensed corporate finance adviser advising on mergers and acquisitions, capital raising and IPOs, until 2015 when he joined Maybank Investment Bank.</p>
<p>Dato&rsquo; Fad&rsquo;l holds a Masters in Business Administration from Imperial College London, UK and a Bachelor of Laws (Honours) degree from the University of London, UK. In addition, he holds a Certified Diploma in Accounting &amp; Finance from The Chartered Association of Certified Accountants and is a Fellow Chartered Banker with the Asian Institute of Chartered Bankers. Dato&rsquo; Fad&rsquo;l is also a Certified Expert in Sustainable Finance awarded by the Frankfurt School of Finance &amp; Management.</p>
<p>Tan Sri Abdul Wahid acknowledged Datuk Muhamad Umar&rsquo;s pivotal role to the capital market, adding, &ldquo;On behalf of the Board, we extend our utmost gratitude to Datuk Muhamad Umar for his outstanding contributions and leadership marked by innovation, integrity, as well as a deep commitment and collaborative approach to serving the diverse needs of our stakeholders, and the nation. Datuk Umar will be remembered for many significant contributions and achievements during his tenure, including among others, setting the vision and roadmap for Bursa Malaysia to be a multi-asset exchange, keeping the markets open with fully operational trading throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, and steering the Exchange into a new era of sustainability, customer-centricity, and digitalisation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under Datuk Muhamad Umar, Bursa Malaysia achieved several market records, including surpassing RM2 trillion in equities market capitalisation. Under his leadership, Bursa Malaysia ventured into new asset classes, with the launch and operationalisation of the Bursa Carbon Exchange, Bursa Gold Dinar, and BR Capital. During his service, the Exchange had also developed the Centralised Sustainability Intelligence (CSI) Solution, welcomed the world&rsquo;s first Waqf-featured ETF, and its first currency futures product. These are just some of the expanded suite of products and services rolled out to enhance the competitiveness of listed issuers, and to provide wider investment and hedging opportunities. 2024 was a particularly strong year for the Exchange, where Bursa Malaysia ranked as ASEAN&rsquo;s leading IPO market, and the derivatives market hit a new high in annual trading volume for all products.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) today announced SARANA, an alternative financing scheme offered by nine SC-registered peer-to-peer financing (P2P) platform operators under the Government e-procurement system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Effective immediately, this alternative financing option aims to address the working capital needs of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), and small contractors, participating in Government contracts under the scope of supplies, services or works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SARANA offers two primary financing options, namely:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Invoice financing, which supports cash flow post-contract delivery; and </li>
<li>Financing for contract implementation (pre-financing), to bridge contractors&rsquo; initial working capital needs before a project is executed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The participating P2P platform operators are as follows:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Ba<a href="https://capbay.com/">y Smart Capital Ventures Sdn</a><a href="https://capbay.com/"> </a><a href="https://capbay.com/">Bhd</a><a href="https://capbay.com/">*</a> </li>

</ol>
<p>*Note: Offers Shariah financing.</p>
<p>With the Government&rsquo;s support for P2P financing as announced at the Budget 2025 tabling, SARANA provides a viable alternative to bridge critical funding gaps, particularly for companies facing challenges in assessing traditional financing.</p>
<p>This initiative of enabling access to the capital market through P2P platform operators is also in line with the SC&rsquo;s Catalysing MSME And MTC Access to the Capital Market: 5-Year Roadmap (2024-2028).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the introduction of the P2P regulatory framework by the SC in 2016, registered P2P platform operators have played a pivotal role in addressing the financing needs of locally incorporated companies. As of 30 September 2024, P2P financing has raised a total of RM7.9 billion.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Fixed Income And Thematic Investing Drives AUM For ETFs Benchmarked To ICE Indices To Record Level In Asia-Pacific In 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE: ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced record 2024 growth in assets under management (AUM) for Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) benchmarked to ICE&rsquo;s indices listed on Asian exchanges. This growth was driven by strong retail interest in fixed income and thematic investing in the region, and occurred as ICE has continued to expand its global index offering to include more fixed income, thematic, equity and international indices that match the strategies of the global investment community.</p>
<p>In 2024, passive AUM benchmarked to ICE&rsquo;s indices surged in Asia to an all-time-high of approximately $45.15 billion, on December 31, 2024, an increase of over 70% from the end of 2023, and 10x since ICE acquired the BofA Indices in October 2017. Although rising markets and strong global interest in ETFs have provided strong tailwinds, this growth also came as index issuers launched a record number of ETFs benchmarked to ICE&rsquo;s indices across the region. In 2024, 30 new ETFs were launched in Asia that were benchmarked to ICE&rsquo;s Indices, compared to the previous record of 13 in 2023. In Taiwan alone, there are now 53 ETFs from 15 issuers tracking ICE&rsquo;s indices, with combined AUM up 67% at the end of December 2024 compared to the end of 2023. Japan, Australia and South Korea also had record AUM growth over the same period of over 400%, 69% and 65%, respectively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The growth we&rsquo;ve seen in our Asian index business has mirrored the evolution we&rsquo;ve witnessed the last five years as Asia has continued to grow into a major asset management center,&rdquo; said Magnus Cattan, ICE&rsquo;s Vice President and Head of Client Development in Asia. &ldquo;We look forward to working with ETF issuers as we launch new indices that match the investment needs of investors across the region.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ICE is a leading provider of indices, offering over 7,000 global equity, fixed income, commodity and foreign exchange indices to support benchmarking and performance measurement by investors. As of December 31, 2024, ICE accounted for approximately $2 trillion in AUM across active and passive strategies combined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Building on the strength of our portfolio, fixed income continued to play a strong role in the growth in AUM of ETFs benchmarked to our indices throughout 2024 as investors took advantage of higher interest rates and a broad selection of fixed income ETFs in the market,&rdquo; said Preston Peacock, Head of ICE Data Indices. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re pleased to see that investors in our core markets throughout Asia and the rest of the world are continuing to adopt ETFs as a preferred way to invest, and that our broad offering across equities, fixed income and commodities supports their investment strategies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ICE&rsquo;s indices leverage the ICE Data Services Pricing &amp; Reference Data LLC&rsquo;s extensive suite of pricing and reference data, which includes evaluated pricing on approximately 3 million securities and reference data on approximately 79 million active and inactive financial instruments.</p>

<title>CFTC Commissioner Kristin Johnsonâs Keynote Address At The University Of Chicago Law School: Charting The Future Of Financial Regulation</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-commissioner-kristin-johnsons-keynote-address-at-the-university-of-chicago/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-commissioner-kristin-johnsons-keynote-address-at-the-university-of-chicago/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Good afternoon. Thank you to Dean Miles, Professor Birdthistle and the broader University of Chicago Law School for the kind invitation to join you for today&rsquo;s event. We can often learn a great deal about the future by looking at the past. About 4,000 years ago (c. 2000 B.C.E.), Phoenician sailors developed charts and observations of the Sun and stars. Early mariners&rsquo; compasses were inaccurate or inconsistent because they lacked an understanding of magnetic variation. Later, the astrolabe, sextant, chip log, gyroscopic compass, radar, and GPS replaced earlier, primitive tools.</span></p>
<p><span>In remarks earlier this week at a blockchain event at the World Economic Forum in Davos, I explored rapidly advancing technologies&mdash;an area that has long been a central focus of my contributions as a lawyer in private practice, in-house counsel, an academic, and most recently, a financial market regulator at the CFTC.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson15#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>[1]</span></a><span>&nbsp;Today, on the eve of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission&rsquo;s (CFTC) 50<span>th</span>&nbsp;Anniversary, we stand, once again on the frontier&mdash;a frontier of technological development in markets&mdash;including increasingly advanced computing, predictive analytical models, and algorithmic trading, and digital trading, clearing and settlement.</span></p>
<p><span>During the most recent past administration, the Securities Exchange Commission Divisions of Trading and Markets and of Investment Management announced rule amendments to shorten the standard settlement cycle for most broker-dealer transactions from two business days after the trade date (&ldquo;T+2&rdquo;) to one business day after the trade date (&ldquo;T+1&rdquo;)</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson15#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span>[2]</span></a><span>&nbsp;marking faster, more efficient, less costly trading ushered in, in part, by digitization of trading market infrastructure. Many of our largest market participants have partnered with technology firms to migrate exceptional volumes of data including orders, quotes, trades, cancellations and settlement data to cloud-based storage.</span></p>
<p><span>Executive Orders this week on AI and digital assets or cryptocurrency indicate the new administration&rsquo;s intent to focus on these new technologies. As we prepare to hear from the new administration regarding solutions to address the intricacies of balancing responsible innovation with the critical goals of ensuring market integrity, market stability, and protection of vulnerable market participants, let&rsquo;s keep top-of-mind the lessons of the past and the benefits of well-honed regulatory tools which aid us in navigating the sea of technological innovation set forth before us.</span></p>
<p><span>Today, we will consider the two specific technologies at the center of the new administration&rsquo;s Executive Orders issued yesterday&mdash;AI and crypto.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Artificial Intelligence in Financial Markets</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Financial markets regulation is often defined by two salient questions&mdash;what should we regulate and, if we regulate, what should be the scope of regulation. Knowing that crypto technologies are a focus of my remarks, some of you might demand that we tailor these questions and simply focus on the legal standard for distinguishing among regulated products, namely securities and commodities, citing the debate surrounding the legal standard articulated by the Supreme Court of the United States in SCOTUS&rsquo;s now (in)famous 1946 decision S.E.C. vs Howey,</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson15#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><span>[3]</span></a><span>&nbsp;explaining that investment contracts that involve an investment of money in a common enterprise with an expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others.</span></p>
<p><span>Leaving this question aside for a moment and focusing on the macro issue, I would note an underlying premise of these two fundamental questions. It is presumed that regulators understand both the products and the markets that are the subject of regulation&mdash;that we are clear on the benefits as well as the risks and limitations posed by products, processes, and market structures introduced in our markets. In other words, we are well-informed and deeply engaged in discussions regarding the attributes of what we regulate. I would also share that, for me, this understanding informs &ldquo;how&rdquo; I think about regulation.</span></p>
<p><em><span>The Ever-Expanding Universe of AI Use Cases</span></em></p>
<p><span>AI has long served financial services firms. For decades, firms have integrated standard algorithms and earlier forms of machine learning in both external client-facing applications as well as internal operations.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson15#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><span>[4]</span></a><span>&nbsp;Developers tout the potential for more nascent uses of AI to enhance critical risk management tools, &ldquo;inform[ing] trading strategies by identifying patterns, optimizing execution, managing portfolio workflows, and assessing risk-return tradeoffs.&rdquo;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson15#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><span>[5]</span></a><span>&nbsp;According to proponents, deep learning through neural networks holds promise to simulate the multi-layered, complex decision-making capabilities of the human brain.</span></p>
<p><span>Several years ago, the CFTC identified a number of AI use cases in our regulated markets:</span></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><span>Trading (including market intelligence, robo-advisory, sentiment analysis, algorithmic trading, smart routing, and transactions)</span></li>
<li><span>Risk Management (including margin and capital requirements, trade monitoring, fraud detection)</span></li>
<li><span>Risk Assessments and Hedging</span></li>
<li><span>Resource Optimization (including energy and computer power)</span></li>
<li><span>RegTech &ndash; Applications that enhance or improve compliance and oversight activities (including surveillance, reporting)</span></li>
<li><span>Compliance (including identity and customer validation, anti-money laundering, regulatory reporting)</span></li>
<li><span>Books and Records (including automated trade histories from voice or text)</span></li>

</ul>
<p><span>The ever-expanding universe of AI use cases impacts investment, trading, surveillance and compliance, fraud detection, cyber security and supervision and enforcement across the derivatives and broader financial markets. In discussing AI&rsquo;s application across financial markets, a Treasury report released last month stated &ldquo;some financial firms have been experimenting with Generative AI tools&mdash;to explore the capabilities of AI in enhancing existing processes.&rdquo;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson15#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><span>[7]</span></a><span></span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Robo-advisors offer personalized investment advisory services, while AI-driven insights improve forecasting and trading process automation.&rdquo;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson15#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><span>[8]</span></a><span>&nbsp;The Treasury Department&rsquo;s recent report on Artificial Intelligence in Financial Services also notes that &ldquo;financial firms are increasingly using AI&mdash;and particularly experimenting with Generative AI&mdash;internal business operations, including but not limited to risk management, regulatory compliance, treasury management, fraud detection, and back-office functions.&rdquo;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson15#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"><span>[9]</span></a><span></span></p>
<p><em><span>Risks and Challenges Remain</span></em></p>
<p><span>Attendant risks associated with the increase in use of AI, however, deserves equal attention, particularly for regulators tasked with safeguarding the integrity and stability of financial markets and the global economy. In testimony before Congress and academic work prior to my service at the Commission, I have encouraged regulators and market participants to also consider the following risks fraud and market manipulation, bias and discrimination, and privacy and data protection risks.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson15#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><span>[10]</span></a><span></span></p>
<p><span>As the Financial Stability Board recently explained, &ldquo;many of the potential risks of AI may seem new, but when you look beneath the surface, they are strikingly similar to traditional financial risks. Risks that we are familiar with. We already have frameworks to assess concentration risk, third party dependence and interconnectedness. This is good news. But potential new forms of interconnectedness in the financial system may emerge.&rdquo;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson15#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"><span>[11]</span></a><span></span></p>
<p><span>To that end, it will be imperative for regulators to understand, track, and be poised to address emerging cybersecurity, third-party, concentration, and human capital risks.</span></p>
<ol>
<li value="1"><em>Cybersecurity</em></li>
</ol>
<p><span>Few would disagree that cybersecurity attacks and related disruptions pose one of the most pernicious and persistent threats to global financial markets.&nbsp; In a timely and critical report on cybersecurity and AI, Treasury notes that &ldquo;complex and persistent cyber threats continue to grow, and some experts from financial institutions believe the availability of advanced AI tools such as Generative AI will, at least initially, give threat actors an upper hand.&rdquo;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson15#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"><span>[12]</span></a><span>&nbsp;Following a recent attack that disrupted clearing and settlement in derivatives markets in January of 2023, the Commission adopted a proposed rule enhancing operational resilience for swap dealers. In parallel to this rule, the Market Risk Advisory Committee that I sponsor, encouraged the Commission to consider comprehensive reform and consider the need for parallel reforms for our derivatives clearing organizations. While our principles-based approach to regulation enables dynamic application of existing rules, we must be ever vigilant to ensure that regulation is keeping pace and fit-for-purpose. I am looking forward to advancing these initiatives.</span></p>
<ol>
<li value="2"><em>Third-Party Risk Management</em></li>
</ol>
<p><span>Financial market regulators have, for several years, noted the challenges of relying on third parties for critical services. While regulated entities may have robust tools to monitor their own activities, our market participants increasingly partner with and rely upon third parties for critical services. Third party critical service providers may not have the comprehensive compliance processes and procedures the regulated entities have. The cascading impact of disruption may impact the many financial institutions that rely on the same critical third-party service providers, potentially engendering systemic risk concerns.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson15#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"><span>[13]</span></a><span></span></p>
<ol>
<li value="3"><em>Concentration Risk</em></li>
</ol>
<p><span>The increasing reliance on third party service providers and the limited number of critical third-party service providers creates concentration risk. While the largest financial services firms in the world may have less exposure to these threats, smaller and medium sized firms without the technical expertise to develop high-cost technologies may need to rely on third parties and may also adapt these technologies in ways not anticipated by original developers, creating additional frictions.</span></p>
<p><span>At the CFTC, we have been engaged in a longstanding dialogue with our market participants and our colleagues at other federal regulatory agencies to analyze and work to address these concerns&mdash;and we plan to continue the conversation.</span></p>
<p><span>Last year, our staff released a request for comment, soliciting data regarding our market participants&rsquo; increasing use of AI.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson15#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14"><span>[14]</span></a><span>&nbsp;We have not been alone in this work. The U.S. Department of Treasury similarly issued a request for information.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson15#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15"><span>[15]</span></a><span>&nbsp;I worked with staff at the CFTC and staff at Treasury prior to and following these RFIs. The important results of these forms of engagement have only scratched the surface, given that &ldquo;[o]ne of the most significant learnings from the comment responses is the reported ubiquity of AI usage&mdash;in particular traditional AI such as algorithms or machine learning&mdash;in virtually every function of financial firms, ranging from compliance management, internal operations, underwriting, customer service, treasury management, and product development and marketing.&rdquo;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson15#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16"><span>[16]</span></a><span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>A Roadmap for the Future</strong></span></p>
<p><span>I have advanced, and will continue to advance, several policy initiatives over the course of my time at the Commission.</span></p>
<p><em><span>Collaboration is Key</span></em></p>
<ol>
<li value="1"><em>Continued Dialogue</em></li>
</ol>
<p><span>There is still much work to be done. Continuing conversations with interested stakeholders across the board is the only way to ensure that we are learning in real time and incorporating that knowledge into sensible actions, both within the regulatory sphere and in the private sector.</span></p>
<p><span>This dialogue &ldquo;create[s] a framework that simultaneously serves two goals. The first is protecting the integrity of the trading markets so that they fairly serve the interests of participants and the larger public. The second is welcoming and encouraging the development and application of the newest technologies with responsible guardrails. In this way, we can ensure that these technologies help assure that the United States financial markets remain leaders in financial innovation in the years ahead.&rdquo;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson15#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17"><span>[17]</span></a><span></span></p>
<ol>
<li value="2"><em>Interagency coordination</em></li>
</ol>
<p><span>In the December Treasury report, a brief discussion of the existing and proposed frameworks related to the use of AI in financial services is more than two pages long.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson15#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18"><span>[18]</span></a><span>&nbsp;And that is just the first layer before adding state laws on AI, which can differ from each other and from federal frameworks, and finally, international standards.</span></p>
<p><span>Of course, each regulator has its own specific mission and mandate. However, regulators must work together to harmonize regulation.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson15#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19"><span>[19]</span></a><span></span></p>
<p><span>The Financial Stability Oversight Council echoes this recommendation in its annual report: &ldquo;The Council supports interagency development of expertise to analyze and monitor potential systemic risks associated with the use of AI in the financial services sector, as well as further inter-agency discussions on developments in AI and associated financial stability risks.&rdquo;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson15#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20"><span>[20]</span></a><span></span></p>
<p><span>FSOC also recognizes the need for collaboration on a global scale. &ldquo;The U.S. financial system is part of a global network and could potentially be vulnerable to shocks that originate abroad. The Council supports continued engagement with international counterparts on the risks and benefits of AI in financial services.&rdquo;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson15#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21"><span>[21]</span></a><span></span></p>
<p><em><span>Enhanced Resources for An Enhanced Mission</span></em></p>
<ol>
<li value="1"><em>Resources Must Keep Pace with Demand</em></li>
</ol>
<p><span>The CFTC is small but mighty, and continues to punch above its weight on all matters that come before it. In 2015 amidst the Dodd-Frank regulatory mandates, the CFTC had completed a greater percentage of its Dodd-Frank rules than other domestic financial regulatory agencies despite its smaller staff.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson15#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22"><span>[22]</span></a><span>&nbsp;The same has been true in the past few years, as the Commission has taken on an increased role in addressing digital assets, while continuing its existing work, without any increase in budget.</span></p>
<p><span>As the CFTC oversees increasingly complex markets, and must identify threats from increasingly sophisticated bad actors, it must have the resources to continue to do so effectively. I feel it important to reiterate that &ldquo;the Commission would benefit from increased resources dedicated to enabling several of the Divisions within the Commission to prepare for and meet the challenges of regulating innovative trading, clearing, and settlement technologies, among other changes to operational infrastructure that merits consideration.&rdquo;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson15#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23"><span>[23]</span></a><span></span></p>
<ol>
<li value="2"><em>An AI Fraud Task Force to Tackle Fraud Full Force</em></li>
</ol>
<p><span>I have expressly called for the CFTC Division of Enforcement to create an AI Fraud Task Force. While there may be divergent opinions on the benefits and risks engendered by AI, preventing bad actors from using AI to commit fraud against consumers and potentially market participants should be common ground. &ldquo;Policing derivatives markets is one of the cornerstones of the CFTC&rsquo;s mission. We must adapt our surveillance technologies and enforcement penalties to keep pace with the rapidly evolving innovation that characterizes global financial markets.&rdquo;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson15#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24"><span>[24]</span></a><span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>A Future Framework for Digital Asset Markets&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>A second Executive Order released yesterday established a Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets within the National Economic Council and appointed a Special Advisor for AI and Crypto to serve as Chairman of the PWG.</span></p>
<p><span>Meaningful regulation in any market begins with identifying and developing standards to address certain risk management concerns. Many of the risks in the digital asset markets are well known.Learning from the lessons of the past few years, I am hopeful that any action to establish digital asset regulation include needed clarity regarding the application of rules and protections that safeguard the integrity of our markets. These regulations often also serve the organizations that implement them well.</span></p>
<p><span>Digital asset market regulation should incorporate the same governance principles that have long governed our markets. Evidence of recent crises in digital asset markets underscore the benefits of strong corporate governance, rules governing conflicts of interest, and separation of customer property to preserve customer assets as part of a broader default management, recovery, and resilience strategy.</span></p>
<ol>
<li value="1"><em>Segregation of Customer Assets</em></li>
</ol>
<p><span>Our markets are built on trust. Any market that we supervise should have measures in place to protect the trust and confidence of customers and counterparties. Such recovery, resilience, and default risk management approaches should be applicable across markets that engender similar risks.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At the core these default-focused efforts create protections that preserve customer assets in the event of a liquidity or solvency crisis. The measures also guard against the commingling of customer funds witnessed in the 2022 crypto crises.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson15#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25"><span>[25]</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) expressly requires separation of customer funds in certain contexts. Section 4d(a)(2) of the CEA requires each FCM to segregate from its own assets all money, securities, and other property deposited by futures customers to margin, secure, or guarantee futures contracts and options on futures contracts traded on designated contract markets.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson15#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26"><span>[26]</span></a><span>&nbsp;As the PGW takes up the mantle, preservation of customer capital must be a central and key issue.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li value="2"><em>Governance</em></li>
</ol>
<p><span>Basic corporate governance and internal controls should form part of the health and welfare of any market participant subject to the Commission&rsquo;s supervision. Among other obligations, our regulations uniformly call for registered entities to have boards of directors, including independent directors, risk management committees, and executive officers that include chief compliance and risk officers who possess the requisite skills and expertise.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson15#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27"><span>[27]</span></a><span></span></p>
<p><span>We continuously refine and update our governance standards as our markets evolve. In 2023, the Commission unanimously (please confirm) approved a final rule requiring derivatives clearing organizations (DCOs) to establish and consult with one or more risk management committees (RMCs) comprised of clearing members and customers of clearing members on matters that could materially affect the risk profile of the DCO. Section 5b(c)(2) of the CEA establishes core principles with which a DCO must comply in order to be registered and to maintain registration as a DCO (DCO Core Principles),1 and part 39 of the Commission&rsquo;s regulations implement the DCO Core Principles. DCO Core Principle O requires a DCO to establish governance arrangements that are transparent, fulfill public interest requirements, and permit the consideration of the views of owners and participants.2 Regulation &sect; 39.24 implements this aspect of Core Principle O by providing minimum requirements regarding the substance and form of a DCO&rsquo;s governance arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span>In the earlier referenced 2023 final risk governance rule, the Commission adopted minimum requirements for RMC composition and rotation, and required DCOs to establish and enforce fitness standards for RMC members. The Commission adopted requirements for DCOs to maintain written policies and procedures governing the RMC consultation process and the role of RMC members. Finally, the Commission adopted requirements for DCOs to establish one or more market participant risk advisory working groups (RWGs) that must convene at least twice per year, and adopt written policies and procedures related to the formation and role of the RWG.</span></p>
<ol>
<li value="3"><em>Compliance with AML/KYC laws and regulations</em></li>
</ol>
<p><span>Our experience regulating financial markets has demonstrated that strong AML/KYC regulations protects not only market integrity and stability, but also national security interests. These regulations are foundational and define the scope of who is permitted to actively engage our markets and, in many instances, the broader financial services and banking sector of our economy.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Concluding with A Word Collaboration</strong></span></p>
<p><span>One of the greatest strengths of our government and, more specifically, the federal agencies that supervise many of the largest global financial market participants in the world is the intellectual leadership that our market regulators demonstrate. Our financial market regulations enhance efficiency, reduce the costs of raising capital, attract global investments, and serve as a model for regulation around the world. Our successful regulation is due, in large part, to our engagement with markets and the global regulatory community.</span></p>
<p><span>As I noted in keynote remarks last year at NYU&rsquo;s AI Convening, it is imperative for government and regulators to demonstrate a deep and abiding commitment to developing well-informed, research-based, data-driven regulatory solutions that are well-tailored, fit-for-purpose interventions. This requires a multi-stakeholder, public-private partnership that may include for advancing technologies developers, market participants, academics, government and industry researchers, diverse regulators across the financial markets, and public interest organizations.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson15#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28"><span>[28]</span></a><span></span></p>
<p><span>Last year, in response to a staff advisory on the use of AI in CFTC-regulated markets,</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson15#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29"><span>[29]</span></a><span>&nbsp;I noted that &ldquo;[w]orking in partnership with market participants, we are able to enhance our ability to accomplish our mission of ensuring market stability and market integrity. .&rdquo;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson15#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30"><span>[30]</span></a><span></span></p>
<p><span>I started this week in Davos, Switzerland, where I shared remarks at a conference about blockchain and AI, and about how the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting theme of &ldquo;Collaboration for the Intelligent Age&rdquo; is relevant to my work at the CFTC on these topics. World leaders in government, business, and civil society are still there, discussing the most pressing issues facing our global markets and broader societies, and trying to solve problems on a global scale. Nowhere is that more salient than in the United States, as we are close out the first week of a new executive administration.</span></p>
<p><span>When we reflect on the future of finance, we must think back to the lessons learned as markets navigated sustained periods of extreme distress. Collaboration has served as one of the most important tools in our toolkit.</span></p>
<p><span>The creation of the Financial Stability Oversight Council has proved a valuable source for convening the heads of financial market regulators across our government can carefully identifying and addressing anticipated systemic risk concerns. In addition to collaboration across market and prudential regulators, efforts by the SEC and CFTC to navigate implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act rules offers a second example of successful collaboration among market regulators. The discussions regarding regulation of AI, crypto, and other novel and emerging technologies should benefit from similar collaboration across regulators authority and across the aisle.</span></p>
<p><span>Navigating difficult conditions requires focus, discipline, leadership and a steady hand at the helm. In recent years, our markets have navigated the onset of a global pandemic, geopolitical conflicts, sustained inflation.</span></p>
<p><span>I am committed to working together to achieve this goal. As we enter this new year and new administration, collaboration will be as important as ever to achieve the benefits of scale and take advantage of all that innovation has to offer financial markets.</span></p>
<p><span>Simply stated, and echoing this year&rsquo;s World Economic Forum theme at Davos, we must find a path to collaboration in an intelligent age.</span></p>

<title>Dubai Financial Services Authority Decision To Fine Al Ramz Capital LLC For Failure To Report Suspicious Transactions Referred To The Financial Markets Tribunal</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/dubai-financial-services-authority-decision-to-fine-al-ramz-capital-llc-for-fail/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/dubai-financial-services-authority-decision-to-fine-al-ramz-capital-llc-for-fail/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) today published a Decision Notice against Al Ramz Capital LLC (Al Ramz), a DFSA Recognised Member, recording a DFSA finding that Al Ramz failed to report suspicious transactions and imposing a financial penalty of USD 25,000 (AED 91,813) on Al Ramz.</p>
<p>Al Ramz disputes the DFSA&rsquo;s findings and has referred the Decision Notice to the Financial Markets Tribunal (FMT). The DFSA&rsquo;s decision is therefore provisional and reflects the DFSA&rsquo;s current understanding of Al Ramz&rsquo;s conduct.</p>
<p>The FMT will determine what, if any, is the appropriate action for the DFSA to take. The DFSA&rsquo;s decision may be confirmed, varied, or overturned as a result of the FMT&rsquo;s review.</p>
<p>Trades were executed through Al Ramz&rsquo;s online trading platform where there was no change in the ultimate beneficial ownership, known as a &ldquo;wash trade&rdquo;. A wash trade is a form of potential Market Abuse because it can create a misleading impression of the supply, demand, or price of an investment. In this case, the wash trades caused a temporary spike of 27% in the share price on the last day of the trades.</p>
<p>The trades were executed on the exchange of Nasdaq Dubai, who flagged it to Al Ramz as a suspected wash trade. Despite this, Al Ramz failed to report the suspicious transactions to the DFSA as required under Recognition Rule 3.4.5(1).</p>
<p>The DFSA emphasises the importance of recognised members having robust surveillance systems and promptly reporting any suspicious trading activity to the DFSA when required. This action underscores the regulator's commitment to maintaining the integrity of financial markets and protecting investors from potentially abusive practices.</p>
<p>A copy of the DFSA's Decision Notices can be found in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dfsa.ae/what-we-do/enforcement/regulatory-actions" target="_blank">Regulatory Actions section</a>&nbsp;of the DFSA website.</p>
<p>The DFSA does not intend to make any further public comment until the FMT&rsquo;s review is complete, except as necessary to correct any inaccuracies. Information about pending FMT matters, including details of any public hearings, can be found on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dfsa.ae/about-dfsa/our-structure/financial-markets-tribunal" target="_blank">FMT section</a>&nbsp;of the DFSA website.</p>

<title>ICE Announces Record Environmental Market Trading In 2024 - Equivalent To Over $1 Trillion In Notional Value For The Fourth Consecutive Year</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ice-announces-record-environmental-market-trading-in-2024-equivalent-to-over/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ice-announces-record-environmental-market-trading-in-2024-equivalent-to-over/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced that a record number of environmental contracts traded on ICE in 2024, equivalent to over $1 trillion in notional value for the fourth consecutive year.</p>
<p>A record 20.4 million environmental futures and options contracts traded on ICE in 2024, up approximately 40% year-over-year (y/y) along with record average daily volume and participation.</p>
<p>ICE&rsquo;s EU Carbon Allowance (EUA) futures and options, which represents the world&rsquo;s most liquid carbon derivatives market, and U.K. Carbon Allowance (UKA) futures and options each reached record participation in 2024 and physically delivered carbon allowances worth $40 billion.</p>
<p>Across ICE&rsquo;s North American environmental markets, a record 5.6 million futures and options traded in 2024, with a record $12.3 billion physically delivered. ICE&rsquo;s California Carbon Allowance (CCA) market hit record traded volume in 2024 of 3.9 million contracts, up 68% y/y.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the last twenty years, ICE has worked to create a truly interconnected global network of energy and environmental markets to allow customers to meet their emissions obligations and environmental price risk on a single platform,&rdquo; said Gordon Bennett, Managing Director, Utility Markets at ICE. &ldquo;At ICE we are working hard to develop scalable carbon credit markets, including CORSIA, the first global market-based carbon credit program targeted at reducing emissions from international aviation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reflecting how many carbon markets are expanding their scope and coverage, the European Union has created a new emissions trading scheme named ETS 2 to cover carbon dioxide emissions from fuel combustion in buildings and road transport. To help the market manage carbon price risk in these new sectors, ICE plans to launch EUA 2 futures on May 6, 2025, subject to regulatory approval.</p>
<p>Since launch, 166 billion carbon allowances, 6 billion carbon credits, 588 million renewable energy certificates, and the equivalent of 21.2 billion Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) have traded across ICE&rsquo;s global environmental portfolio.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Dechert advised Fasanara Capital Ltd (Fasanara), a London-based institutional investment manager with over US$4 billion in assets, on launching its first tokenised money market fund.</p>
<p>This innovative product combines the stability of traditional money market investments with the operational eï¬ciency of blockchain technology.</p>
<p>Dechert's team worked closely with Fasanara and key service providers on all aspects of the fund structure, product solution development, and legal documentation.</p>
<p>Fasanara's first tokenised money market fund offers investors daily liquidity, with ownership of shares maintained on the Polygon blockchain, with the ability to integrate other blockchains in the future.</p>
<p>Investors can subscribe for shares using digital assets and earn stable yields without leaving the blockchain ecosystem.</p>
<p>As one of the first of its kind, Fasanara's tokenised money market fund seeks to significantly reduce settlement times, increase operational efficiency, and provide greater transparency to investors by offering real-time tracking through a bespoke-built platform maintained by the fund administrator.</p>
<p>The Dechert team was led by financial services partner Craig Borthwick and associate Dona Treska, with support from financial services partners Brenden Carroll and Neel Maitra; financial services counsel Laurel Neale; corporate associate Nicolas Kokkinos; tax partners Joseph Riley and Mansi Seth and associate Zhujing Wu.</p>
<p>Dona Treska said:<b>&nbsp;"</b>The future of finance is digital, and this significant launch, one of the first of its kind in the market, brings us a step closer to it."</p>
<p>Satjeet Sahota, General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Head of Special Projects at Fasanara said: "We are excited to launch our first tokenised money market. This marks a significant step in combining the stability of TradFi with the efficiencies and transparency of blockchain technology. We are delighted to partner with Dechert as our counsel on the evolving legal and compliance framework in this dynamic space."</p>

<title>ASIC: Key Issues Outlook 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-key-issues-outlook-2025/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-key-issues-outlook-2025/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC actively scopes and monitors the shifting regulatory environment in which it operates. This informs ASIC&rsquo;s ability to identify and assess the issues facing Australia&rsquo;s financial system.</p>
<p>Drawing from these observations, ASIC has identified the most significant current, ongoing and emerging issues within its regulatory remit in 2025. ASIC has a broad remit and the issues outlined here cannot convey the full scope of work and surveillance underway at the agency, however identifying the key issues for 2025 is intended to provide insights for Australian businesses and consumers.</p>
<p>These issues impact a broad range of sectors ASIC regulates, but most importantly they have the potential to impact the safety, integrity and trust of Australia&rsquo;s financial system.</p>
<p>ASIC will continue to adapt and be a proactive regulator that promotes a safe environment for Australian businesses and markets and that protects consumers.</p>
<p>Increased market volatility, geopolitical changes, the global accumulation of debt to drive growth, perceived and real inequality of wealth, shifts in the way capital is invested, and advances in artificial intelligence, data and cyber risk, are all key factors influencing the way ASIC views the issues facing Australia&rsquo;s financial system.</p>
<p><em>The issues outlined are not ranked.</em></p>
<h2>Changing dynamics between public and private markets</h2>
<p>ASIC will be leading discussion on issues key to the ongoing and future success of Australia&rsquo;s capital markets and seeking feedback on whether our regulatory settings and supervision approach needs to adapt in light of changing market dynamics.</p>
<p>Domestic and international regulators and policy makers are taking steps to review and respond to issues arising from these changes and to consider potential vulnerabilities and harms that may emerge with growth in private markets.</p>
<p>Both public and private markets are important to our economy and play a role in generating wealth. Through superannuation investments, many Australians have indirect exposure to private assets. Private markets operate differently than public markets and are inherently less transparent.</p>
<p>We are also increasing our focus on private markets through our surveillance work: as part of this work ASIC will review the governance processes and practices of a sample of responsible entities of retail private credit funds, including their asset valuation and liquidity management practices.</p>
<h2>Superannuation members being let down by their fund and trustee</h2>
<p>Around three million Australians will become eligible to draw from their superannuation in the next 10 years with at least $750 billion of funds shifting from the accumulation phase to the retirement phase.</p>
<p>As more members enter the retirement phase, they will have more frequent, and more complex, interactions with their superannuation funds so trustees will need to ensure they can meet members&rsquo; changing needs. Between 2021 and 2023, complaints to the Australian Financial Complaints Authority about superannuation funds&rsquo; service provision (complaints in the &lsquo;service&rsquo; issue category) doubled.</p>
<p>ASIC will publish findings from a review of member services and will not hesitate to take enforcement action where appropriate.</p>
<h2>Consumer losses through fraud and scams, driven by increasing sophistication and the use of technology</h2>
<p>Evolving types of financial frauds and scam continue to threaten consumers, investors, and small businesses, as people are deceived out of their money and/or into divulging sensitive personal information.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency and celebrity endorsement impersonations are amongst the prevalent scam activities.</p>
<p>ASIC has taken down over 7,300 phishing and investment scam websites since the service was launched in July 2023. ASIC also maintains an Investor Alert List currently adding on average 20 companies, businesses or websites per week to warn Australians.</p>
<p>ASIC will continue to support the ACCC&rsquo;s National Anti-Scam Centre including by sharing scam intelligence through the automated data sharing capability.</p>
<h2>Unsuitable superannuation advice resulting in adverse consumer outcomes</h2>
<p>As more Australians approach retirement, there is higher demand for good quality retirement-related financial advice, including around managing longevity risk and ensuring a sustainable income stream.</p>
<p>In recent work, ASIC has observed considerable volumes of superannuation fund inflows into high-risk investments, including property investments, via superannuation platforms and significant payments of superannuation monies to lead generation businesses. High pressure sales tactics and the use of social media algorithms to target receptive audiences, has enabled rapid growth in these types of business models.</p>
<p>ASIC will continue to warn Australians about this conduct and will take enforcement action where we see misconduct exploiting superannuation savings. ASIC also has a current surveillance underway assessing the quality of financial advice to establish SMSFs.</p>
<h2>Cyber-attacks, data breaches, and internal system failures undermining market confidence and causing financial loss</h2>
<p>The continuing risk in this area is driven by the ongoing digitalisation of the financial sector, reliance on controls of third-party service providers, and legacy systems, which are vulnerable to cyber attacks and data breaches.</p>
<p>ASIC expects directors to ensure their organisation&rsquo;s risk management framework adequately addresses cyber security threats and that controls are in place to protect assets and information and enhance cyber resilience.</p>
<p>ASIC will be reviewing cyber and operational resilience in various sectors and sharing its findings with companies and entities based on its findings.</p>
<p>ASIC has active investigations underway in the cyber security space and will provide more information through 2025 on how we are bringing the full force of the law against those found to have failed in their duties.</p>
<h2>Poor household outcomes following natural disasters due to deficient claims handling by general insurers</h2>
<p>Recent reviews have found persistent issues in the delivery of claims handling services following natural disasters (including multiple disasters at the same time), which are expected to increase in frequency and severity as the effects of climate change are felt.</p>
<p>Unreasonable delays in assessments, decision-making and repairs, poor communications throughout the life of a claim, and settlement arrangements that do not meet customer and community needs are particular areas ASIC will be monitoring in 2025.</p>
<h2>Impact of ASX&rsquo;s CHESS replacement on Australian markets</h2>
<p>The sound and seamless implementation of the replacement of the Clearing House Electronic Subregister System (CHESS) is fundamental to maintaining investor confidence and the orderly and efficient operation of Australia&rsquo;s financial markets.</p>
<p>ASIC, in partnership with the RBA, will continue to focus on ASX maintaining resilience, reliability and integrity of its clearing and settlement operations as the replacement project progresses, and that it appropriately manages associated risks.</p>
<h2>Poor quality climate-related financial disclosures leading to misinformed investment decisions</h2>
<p>High quality, consistent and comparable information about reporting entities&rsquo; climate-related risks and opportunities facilitates confident and informed decision making by investors.</p>
<p>As new climate related financial reporting obligations are rolled out, reporting entities will need to ensure they have appropriate governance and reporting processes in place to provide greater transparency to Australians and investors about their climate-related risks and opportunities. ASIC will provide support through guidance.</p>
<p>ASIC will also continue to scrutinise disclosures where entities mispresent financial products or investment strategies as environmentally friendly, sustainable or ethical when they are not.</p>
<h2>Poor audit quality resulting in declining market confidence and misinformed investment decisions</h2>
<p>There are around 29,000 entities that require audits in Australia, including approximately 2,000 listed entities. The reliability and quality of audit reports is vital to market integrity and confidence.</p>
<p>In 2025, ASIC has particular concern about auditor independence and conflicts of interest and will be scrutinising firms&rsquo; compliance with the relevant legislative requirements.</p>
<h2>Banks and lenders exacerbating consumer financial hardship</h2>
<p>Banks and lenders&rsquo; financial hardship practices have been clearly shown to be wanting, with many Australians finding it hard to get help, even amidst current cost of living pressures.</p>
<p>ASIC is monitoring to ensure that banks and lenders, particularly those who have agreed improvement plans with us, improve the way they support customers experiencing financial hardship.</p>

<title>Monetary Authority Of Singapore Monetary Policy Statement - January 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/monetary-authority-of-singapore-monetary-policy-statement-january-2025/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/monetary-authority-of-singapore-monetary-policy-statement-january-2025/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>In the October 2024 Monetary Policy Statement (MPS), MAS maintained the rate of appreciation of the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER) policy band, with no change to the width of the band or the level at which it was centred. Since then, the S$ has eased against the US$, amid broad-based US$ strength, but continued to appreciate against several other currencies in the S$NEER basket. The S$NEER remains within the gradually rising policy band.</span></p>
<p><span>Chart 1<br /><span>S$ Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (S$NEER)</span><br /><img alt="S$NEER chart for Monetary Policy Statement January 2025" height="363px" src="https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/mas-media-library/news/monetary-policy-statements/2025/mps_chart_2025_01.jpg?h=363px&amp;w=562px&amp;hash=C4B793B1DE008C9B6D77F39ACFEC8777" width="562px" /></span></p>
<h4>GROWTH BACKDROP</h4>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Economic activity in Singapore&rsquo;s major trading partners held steady in the last quarter of 2024. Private consumption in the advanced economies was generally resilient, while growth in Asia continued to benefit from the upturn in the global tech cycle. More broadly, growth was likely also supported by</span><span>&nbsp;some frontloading of production and shipments in anticipation that trade frictions could intensify.</span></p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>In line with the resilient global economic backdrop, MTI&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Advance Estimat</em><em>es</em>&nbsp;show that the Singapore economy grew by 0.1% on a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis in Q4 2024, following the 3.2% expansion a quarter ago. Overall, GDP growth in H2 last year was stronger than expected, largely due to the robust performance of the trade-related and financial services sectors.</span></p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Global economic policy uncertainty has risen since the October monetary policy review, mainly reflecting expectations of increasing trade policy frictions. Concomitantly, the prospect of persistently elevated inflation has contributed to a tightening of global financial conditions. While consumer spending in the advanced economies should continue apace given still-strong wage growth amid supportive labour market conditions, manufacturing and trade activity is anticipated to normalise following a period of frontloading. All in, global growth could slow over 2025.</span></p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Singapore&rsquo;s GDP growth is projected to moderate over 2025. The impact of shifts in global trade policies could weigh on the domestic manufacturing and trade-related services sectors. For now, the Singapore economy is forecast to expand at a slower pace of&nbsp;</span><span>1.0&ndash;3.0% this year, from 4.0% in 2024, with the level of output keeping close to potential for 2025 as a whole.</span></p>
<h2>INFLATION OUTLOOK</h2>
<p>6.&nbsp; &nbsp;<span>MAS Core Inflation<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/monetary-policy-statements/2025/mas-monetary-policy-statement-24jan25#1">[1]</a></span>&nbsp;stepped down by more than expected to 1.9% y-o-y in Q4 2024, from 2.7% in Q3. The seasonally adjusted three-month/three-month rate<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/monetary-policy-statements/2025/mas-monetary-policy-statement-24jan25#2">[2]</a></span>&nbsp;of core inflation came in close to an annualised 1.0% for most of H2 2024, while core inflation excluding the impact from the GST hikes is estimated to have fallen below 1.5% y-o-y in Q4. Overall, the pace of consumer price increases has moderated across a broad range of goods and services, and core inflation is presently low and stable.</span></p>
<p>7.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span>MAS Core Inflation is now forecast&nbsp;</span><span>to&nbsp;</span><span>average 1.0</span><span>&ndash;</span><span>2.0% in 2025, lower than the 1.5</span><span>&ndash;</span><span>2.5% projected in the October 2024 MPS</span><span>. Business cost- and demand-driven inflationary pressures are expected to remain contained. Singapore&rsquo;s imported costs should stay moderate reflecting forecasts of global oil price declines and favourable supply conditions in key food commodity markets. While an escalation of trade frictions could be inflationary for some economies, their impact on Singapore&rsquo;s import prices is likely to be offset by the disinflationary drags exerted by weaker global demand. On the d</span><span>omestic front,&nbsp;</span><span>unit labour cost increases are projected to be lower this year as nominal wage growth gradually eases alongside steady productivity gains.&nbsp;At the same time, consumer price inflation for essential services such as public healthcare, pre-school education and public transport will be dampened by additional government subsidies.</span></p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>CPI-All Items inflation is&nbsp;</span><span>forecast to average 1.5&ndash;2.5% in 2025, compared to 2.4% in 2024. Accommodation inflation is forecast to slow, partly offsetting an anticipated pickup in private transport inflation.</span></p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Overall,&nbsp;</span><span>the outlook for Singapore&rsquo;s growth and thus inflation remains subject to uncertainties in the external environment.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4>MONETARY POLICY</h4>
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Singapore&rsquo;s growth momentum is expected to slow over this year, after outperforming in H2 2024.&nbsp;</span><span>The level of output is projected to come in close to the economy&rsquo;s potential for 2025 as a whole.&nbsp;</span><span>Meanwhile, MAS Core Inflation has moderated more quickly than expected and will remain below 2% this year, reflecting the return to low and stable underlying price pressures in the economy.</span></p>
<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>MAS will therefore reduce slightly the slope of the S$NEER policy band. There will be no change to the width of the policy band or the level at which it is centred.</span><span>&nbsp;This measured adjustment is consistent with a modest and gradual appreciation path of the S$NEER policy band that will ensure</span><em>&nbsp;</em><span>medium-term price stability.&nbsp;</span><span>MAS will closely monitor global and domestic economic developments, and remain vigilant to risks to inflation and growth.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<title>ASIC Proposes To Remake Relief For Offers Of CHESS Depository Interests</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-proposes-to-remake-relief-for-offers-of-chess-depository-interests/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-proposes-to-remake-relief-for-offers-of-chess-depository-interests/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC is seeking feedback on our proposal to remake Class Order&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2014L01345/latest/text">[CO 14/827]</a>&nbsp;<em>Offers of CHESS Depository Interests,</em>&nbsp;which is due to expire on 1 April 2025.</p>
<p>ASIC has assessed that the current class order continues to form a necessary and useful part of the legislative framework. Therefore, ASIC is proposing to remake the class order on largely the same terms, for a period of five years. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Changes include minor revisions to the definition of 'depository interests' and the wording of the Australian financial services (AFS) licence exemption. These changes are intended to improve clarity, not change the operation of the relief.</p>
<p>The purpose of the remade relief is to continue to:</p>
<ul>
<li>remove any uncertainty about how offers of CHESS Depository Interests (CDIs) over foreign shares and options are regulated under the&nbsp;<em>Corporations Act 2001</em>;</li>
<li>facilitate offers of CDIs over foreign shares and options, and to assist foreign companies to make such offers in an efficient market, and</li>
<li>promote better understanding for retail investors about CDIs, to assist them to make confident and informed investment decisions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: ASIC has received an application for relief from Cboe Australia Pty Ltd (Cboe) to include Cboe in the definition of &lsquo;approved financial market&rsquo;.&nbsp; If ASIC approves that application, it may update that definition to include Cboe.</p>
<h2>Consultation</h2>
<p>ASIC invites feedback from stakeholders on its proposal to remake [CO 14/827], which is due to sunset on 1 April 2025: see&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/consultations/cs-15-proposed-remake-of-relief-for-offers-of-chess-depository-interests/" title="CS 15 Proposed remake of relief for offers of CHESS Depository Interests">CS 15&nbsp;<em>Proposed remake of relief for offers of CHESS Depository Interests</em></a>.&nbsp; Submissions should be sent&nbsp;<strong>by 5pm AEDT on Friday 28 February 2025&nbsp;</strong>to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:rri.consultation@asic.gov.au">rri.consultation@asic.gov.au</a><strong>.</strong></p>

<title>Alberta Securities Commission Signs Onto Multi-Jurisdiction Settlement With GSB Gold Standard, GS Partners Allowing Albertans To File A Claim For A Refund</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/alberta-securities-commission-signs-onto-multi-jurisdiction-settlement-with-gsb/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/alberta-securities-commission-signs-onto-multi-jurisdiction-settlement-with-gsb/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Alberta Securities Commission (ASC), along with other provincial and U.S. state securities regulators, has participated in a multi-jurisdiction settlement with GSB Gold Standard Corporation AG, GSB Gold Standard Bank LTD and other affiliated companies and entities, referred to as &ldquo;GS Partners,&rdquo;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp; as well as the group&rsquo;s principal Josip Heit.&nbsp;<br /><br />The investigation and settlement were led by other provincial and U.S. state securities regulators that had larger numbers of known investors in their jurisdictions. The ASC signed onto this settlement to protect the interests of Alberta investors who made an investment with GS Partners, as it allows Alberta investors to make a claim for a refund of all investments made with them. GS Partners has undertaken to the ASC to refrain from trading in Alberta in the future unless they comply with securities laws.<br />&nbsp;<br />GS Partners claim to have over 800,000 investors from more than 170 countries and to be close to completing $1 billion in transactions. Many of the products offered to investors were tied to tangible and intangible investments, including digital assets and the metaverse, such as the &ldquo;G999 token,&rdquo; a digital asset deployed on a proprietary blockchain; &ldquo;XLT Vouchers,&rdquo; a digital asset representing ownership interests in a skyscraper; and investments in a &ldquo;staking pool&rdquo; in a metaverse known as &ldquo;Lydian.World.&rdquo;</p>
<h4><strong>How to file a claim</strong></h4>
<p>Per the settlement terms, GS Partners will provide compensation to eligible investors by paying the difference between the value of their investments or deposits and the value of any withdrawals. The claims process will be managed by AlixPartners LP.</p>
<ul>
<li>In order to receive a refund, investors need to file a claim&nbsp;<strong>within 90 days</strong>&nbsp;of the claims process, which is expected to start on February 21, 2025.</li>
<li>Information on how to file a claim can be found on the website managed by AlixPartners at&nbsp;<a href="https://gsbsettlement.com/">gsbsettlement.com</a>.</li>
<li>Depending on how the investment was made, investors will be paid in either money or cryptocurrency.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ASC gratefully acknowledges the working group of members of the North American Securities Administrators Association led by U.S. state securities regulators Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia and Texas, as well as the British Columbia Securities Commission who investigated and negotiated the terms of the multi-jurisdiction settlement with GS Partners.</p>
<p>The ASC is the regulatory agency responsible for administering the province&rsquo;s securities laws. It is entrusted with fostering a fair and efficient capital market in Alberta and with protecting investors. As a member of the Canadian Securities Administrators, the ASC works to improve, coordinate and harmonize the regulation of Canada&rsquo;s capital markets.</p>
<p><span><sup>1</sup>The entities, brands and platforms included in the agreement are: GSB Gold Standard Corporation AG; GSB Gold Standard Banking Corporation AG; GSB Gold Standard Corporation USA; GSB Gold Standard Pay LTD (brand name GSDeFi operating g999main.net); GSB Gold Standard Bank LTD dba GS Smart Finance, Gold Standard Partners, GSPartners, GS Partners, and GSP (marketing arm of the metaverse Lydian.World); GSB Gold Standard Banking Corporation PLC; GSB Gold Standard Pay Kommanditbolag aka GSB Gold Standard Pay KB; GS Trade; GSB Gold Standard Trade (virtual digital-asset platform for storing, transferring, obtaining, and exchanging digital assets); GS Digital Partners LLC; GSB Gold Standard B Corporation; GSB Premier Exchange Corporation LTD; GSB Gold Standard PLC; and GSB Money LTD.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canadian Securities Administrators (<strong>CSA</strong>) today published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asc.ca/-/media/ASC-Documents-part-1/Regulatory-Instruments/2025/01/6202253-CSA-Notice-Proposed-Amendments-NI-23-101.ashx">Notice and Request for Comment</a>&nbsp;on proposed amendments to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asc.ca/securities-law-and-policy/regulatory-instruments/23-101">National Instrument 23-101&nbsp;<em>Trading Rules</em></a>&nbsp;(<strong>Proposed Amendments</strong>) and proposed changes to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asc.ca/securities-law-and-policy/regulatory-instruments/23-101">Companion Policy 23-101&nbsp;<em>Trading Rules</em></a>&nbsp;(<strong>Proposed CP Changes</strong>) related to the recent rule changes announced by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (<strong>SEC</strong>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Proposed Amendments and Proposed CP Changes ensure trading in Canadian securities that are inter-listed on U.S.-registered national securities exchanges (<strong>U.S. Inter-listed Securities</strong>) remains competitive. If adopted, alignment of the Canadian trading fee cap with the fee cap in the United States would continue for U.S. Inter-listed Securities priced at CAD 1.00 or more. The comment period to solicit feedback on the Proposed Amendments and Proposed CP Changes will run for 60 days and close on March 24, 2025.</p>
<p>The Proposed Amendments and Proposed CP Changes follow the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-137" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SEC announcement of its final rules</a>&nbsp;on September 18, 2024, specifically (i) reduced trading fee caps for National Market System (<strong>NMS</strong>) stocks and (ii) reduced minimum pricing increments for certain NMS stocks priced at USD 1.00 or more per share (together,&nbsp;<strong>SEC Final Rules</strong>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>On December 12, 2024, the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ciro.ca/news-room/publications/proposed-amendments-respecting-trading-increments" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">proposed amendments</a>&nbsp;to the Universal Market Integrity Rules (<strong>Proposed UMIR Amendments</strong>) that, if adopted, would conform the minimum pricing increments with the SEC Final Rules for U.S. Inter-listed Securities priced at CAD 1.00&nbsp; or more&nbsp; per share. The comment period to solicit feedback on the Proposed UMIR Amendments will close on January 27, 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The planned implementation date for the SEC Final Rules was November 3, 2025, however, on December 12, 2024, the SEC issued an order staying the implementation of the SEC Final Rules pending completion of judicial review of those rules. The Proposed Amendments, Proposed CP Changes and Proposed UMIR Amendments would not be implemented in Canada before the SEC Final Rules are implemented in the U.S.</p>
<p>The CSA, the council of the securities regulators of Canada&rsquo;s provinces and territories, co-ordinates and harmonizes regulation for the Canadian capital markets.</p>

<title>New York State Department Of Financial Services Superintendent Adrienne A. Harris Secures $2 Million Cybersecurity Settlement With PayPal, Inc. - PayPalâs Cybersecurity Failures Led To The Exposure Of Customersâ Social Security Numbers</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-york-state-department-of-financial-services-superintendent-adrienne-a-harri-11/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-york-state-department-of-financial-services-superintendent-adrienne-a-harri-11/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div>
<p>New York State Department of Financial Services Superintendent Adrienne A. Harris today announced that PayPal, Inc. (PayPal) will pay a $2 million penalty to New York State for violations of DFS&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dfs.ny.gov/industry_guidance/regulatory_activity/financial_services#final-adoptions" target="_blank">Cybersecurity Regulation</a>. An investigation determined PayPal failed to use qualified personnel to manage key cybersecurity functions and failed to provide adequate training to address cybersecurity risks. These failures led to sensitive customer information, including social security numbers (SSNs), being left unredacted and easily accessible to cybercriminals.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>&ldquo;New York&rsquo;s nation-leading cybersecurity regulation sets a critical standard for safeguarding consumer data and strengthening the resilience of financial institutions,&rdquo; said Superintendent Harris. &ldquo;Qualified cybersecurity personnel are the first line of defense against potential data breaches, and providing proper training and effectively implementing cybersecurity policies and procedures are vital steps to protecting sensitive data and mitigating risks.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>PayPal, one of the world&rsquo;s largest financial technology companies, offers online financial services to customers around the globe. Customer data was exposed after PayPal implemented changes to existing data flows to make IRS Form 1099-Ks available to more of its customers. However, the teams tasked with implementing these changes were not trained on PayPal&rsquo;s systems and application development processes. As a result, they failed to follow proper procedures before the changes went live. This allowed cybercriminals to leverage compromised credentials to access Form 1099-Ks, which included sensitive customer data, including SSNs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The Department&rsquo;s investigation also revealed that PayPal failed to implement and maintain written policies that address access controls, identity management, and customer data, and failed to use effective controls to protect against unauthorized access to Nonpublic Information or Information Systems. Notably, the company did not require customers to use multifactor authentication or use controls such as CAPTCHA or rate limiting to help prevent unauthorized access. PayPal has since remediated these issues and improved its cybersecurity practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The Department&rsquo;s Cybersecurity Regulation has been in effect since March 2017, with the second amendment becoming effective in November 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Euronext, the leading European market infrastructure, today announces the launch of the 2025 edition of its pre-IPO programme IPOready. This is the tenth consecutive year Euronext has hosted IPOready, which has become Europe&rsquo;s largest pre-IPO programme.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mathieu Caron, Head of Primary Markets at Euronext N.V., said:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;We are delighted to welcome over 160 companies to the 2025 edition of IPOready. IPOready equips company leaders with the critical tools and insights needed for IPO success, while fostering&nbsp;a strong network of entrepreneurs across Europe to support them throughout their growth journey.&nbsp;In 2015, Euronext embarked on a mission to clarify the IPO process and the programme has proven to be a tremendous success with more than 1,000 participants since the beginning. Celebrating ten years of the programme is testament to our dedication to supporting Europe&rsquo;s most innovative and dynamic companies on their journey to the capital markets.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>For the 2025 edition, IPOready has attracted an outstanding cohort of over 160 companies from Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom.This highlights the dynamism of the fast-growing and ambitious companies considering a listing in Europe and underscores Euronext&rsquo;s position as the leading listing venue in the region.</p>
<p>As in previous years, technology companies dominate the landscape of the 2025 cohort, making up 67% of the total participants. This includes 41% from Tech Media and Telecom, 13% from Cleantech, and 13% from Healthtech. Traditional industries represent the remaining 33% of the cohort.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On average, participating companies generate &euro;89 million in annual revenues and employ 448 people. Since their inception, they have raised an average of &euro;49 million in equity financing. Over the past nine editions of Euronext&rsquo;s pre-IPO programmes, more than 1,000 alumni have participated, resulting in 33 successful listings on Euronext markets. These companies have collectively raised over &euro;1.6 billion at IPO, achieving a combined market capitalisation of nearly &euro;5.7 billion. In 2024, Euronext welcomed the listing of four new IPOready alumni: Exosens and Imeon Energy in Paris, and Oncoinvent and Moreld in Oslo. Already this year, Euronext has welcomed the listing of Younited Financial on Euronext Paris, a dual listing with the company's existing listing on Euronext Amsterdam. &nbsp;</p>
<p><span>A tailored training programme</span></p>
<p>Entrepreneurs will embark on their journey to understand the roadmap to an IPO through a comprehensive six-month training programme. This programme is structured around several key modules, featuring workshop sessions in each country alongside expert partners who will delve into the IPO process, legal considerations, IPO valuation, crafting an equity story, financial communication, corporate governance, and post-listing obligations.&nbsp;More than 80 expert partners from across Europe&rsquo;s financial ecosystem will contribute their insights and expertise to the training sessions.</p>
<p>Euronext is also pleased to renew its academic collaboration with INSEAD, a global leader in executive education. Through webinars and in-person workshops, INSEAD brings its global business education expertise&nbsp;to equip executives with the managerial tools needed to lead their companies effectively through the IPO process.</p>
<p><span>The leading equity listing venue in Europe&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>In 2024, Euronext confirmed its position as the leading European primary markets venue with over 1,800 issuers representing &euro;6 trillion in aggregated market capitalisation on its single stock market covering seven countries. Euronext is the venue of choice for ambitious global champions on its markets, having welcomed 50% of international equity listings across Europe in 2024.&nbsp;Euronext is also the leading exchange for Tech in Europe, with over 700 technology companies listed and technology companies accounting for nearly 40% of new listings in 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority And UK Payment Systems Regulator Set Out Next Steps For Open Banking</title>

<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>Next steps for open banking will include a new independent company to drive forward variable recurring payments.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>Open banking is a UK success story with over 11.7 million active users and over 22.1 million open banking payments made monthly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was significant progress in developing open banking in 2024, thanks to voluntary funding from 20 leading firms. This included:</p>
<ul>
<li>fraud analysis capabilities</li>
<li>consumer protections</li>
<li>new open banking services such as variable recurring payments (which will give consumers greater sight and control over their regular payments)</li>
</ul>
<p>It is clear from the&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-payments-vision" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="National Payments Vision | GOV.UK">National Payments Vision<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>, and the government&rsquo;s growth agenda, that continued success in this area is critical for the UK. The FCA and the Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) are fully supportive and are ready to meet this challenge &ndash; as set out in Nikhil Rathi&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/correspondence/fca-letter-new-approach-support-growth.pdf" title="FCA letter on a new approach to ensure regulators and regulations support growth">letter to the Prime Minister</a>&nbsp;and the PSR&rsquo;s recent&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.psr.org.uk/media/saoofhsk/psr-strategy-review-jan-2025.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="PSR Strategy update January 2025">strategy update<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>.</p>
<h2>Benefits of variable recurring payments&nbsp;</h2>
<p>An important initiative underpinning growth is the development of new services that will give consumers and businesses more choice in how they make and receive payments safely, securely and efficiently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a step towards using open banking payments for e-commerce, variable recurring payments will help consumers to take greater control of their regular payments. It will do this by allowing customers to control how much can be paid at one time or over the course of a month, reducing the risk of unexpected expenditure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For businesses, variable recurring payments offer greater competition to current payment methods and could help reduce processing fees. They could also increase the proportion of customers who complete a payment, through better user experiences.</p>
<h2>New independent operator for variable recurring payments</h2>
<p>Open Banking Limited has been central to delivering progress.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the next steps to deliver variable recurring payments, Open Banking Limited will play a key role in establishing an independent central operator to coordinate how variable recurring payments are made.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We support it in doing that, working with industry and trade associations, and look forward to significant progress being made in 2025. This will see live services available for consumers to make recurring payments to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>utility companies</li>
<li>government</li>
<li>financial services firms</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, we are working with industry and trade associations to progress development of the commercial arrangements underpinning both variable recurring payments and use of open banking for e-commerce.</p>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>It is critical that the collaboration seen in 2024 across the industry continues this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We thank industry for their continued support and engagement in the success of open banking so far and we will continue to work together constructively as we implement the next steps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA and PSR will continue to work closely together, overseen by a joint steering committee.</p>

<p>The company, which is the ninth to join BME's growth markets from the Pre-Market Environment and the first to debut this year, took a reference price of 7 euros per share, implying a total company valuation of 17 million euros.</p>
<p>"Redegal well symbolizes the role of capital markets in accelerating the growth of companies, coming from the Pre-Market Environment and now making the leap to BME Scaleup, a market oriented towards companies like it. After 23 incorporations last year, BME's growth markets are ready to continue welcoming new companies seeking access to investors, reputation, visibility, and financing that only the markets offer," explains Juan Flames, CEO of BME.</p>
<p>The company, which has&nbsp;<span>DCM Asesores, Direcci&oacute;n y Consultor&iacute;a de Mercados</span>&nbsp;as a registered advisor, has started trading under the code "<span>SCRDG</span>".</p>
<p>Photos of Redegal's Bell Ringing are available&nbsp;<a href="https://flic.kr/s/aHBqjBZ6TR">on Flickr.</a></p>
<p>The Initial Public Offering Document of&nbsp;<span>Redegal</span>&nbsp;is available on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bolsasymercados.es/MTF_Equity/bme-scaleup/esp/Home.aspx">BME Scaleup website</a>, where all the information related to the company and its business can be found.</p>
<p>The growth markets of BME (BME Growth and BME Scaleup) are aimed at small and medium-sized enterprises. In 2024, these markets welcomed 23 new companies and now have more than 150 companies listed for trading.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bmegrowth.es/ing/Home.aspx">BME Growth</a>&nbsp;allows small-cap companies from all sectors, with a significant presence of technology companies, to finance their growth, with recurring access to capital increases and a broad base of national and international investors. For its part,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bolsasymercados.es/MTF_Equity/bme-scaleup/ing/Home.aspx">BME Scaleup</a>&nbsp;is especially oriented towards scaleups, although it is also open to other types of companies such as SMEs, REITs, or family businesses. This market adapts to the needs of these companies by relaxing the incorporation requirements while offering the necessary transparency to investors. Among the advantages of accessing capital markets for small and medium-sized enterprises are financing, reputation, visibility, a boost to inorganic growth, and greater ease in attracting and retaining talent.</p>
<p>With these growth markets, BME completes its service offering. BME has a market for every type of company, from the first approaches to capital markets with the formation of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.entornopremercado.es/ing/Home">Pre-Market Environment</a>, to large companies listed on the Stock Exchange.</p>

<title>The World Federation Of Exchanges Announces The Industryâs Priorities For 2025</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-world-federation-of-exchanges-announces-the-industrys-priorities-for-2025/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The World Federation of Exchanges (WFE), the global industry group for exchanges and CCPs, today announces the 2025 priorities for the exchange and clearing industry.&nbsp;<br /><br />The WFE Board &ndash; 18 leaders of market infrastructures from around the world, met last week to discuss and agree the priorities. The WFE, which represents over 250 market infrastructures, will focus on the areas below:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Role, Purpose &amp; Work of Market Infrastructure in the next decade:&nbsp;</strong>As public, lit markets continue to champion the rights of investors, issuers and market participants, while more lightly regulated alternatives continue to be a source of concern and undermine social welfare, the WFE will advocate for regulation for all forms of financial trading that ensures markets remain trustworthy, inclusive, transparent, and serves the needs of the industry&rsquo;s diverse stakeholders. &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>ESG Leadership for Market Infrastructures:</strong>&nbsp;Regulated marketplaces remain the bastion of ESG, and the WFE will work on practical guides on disclosures and transition, in support of securities issuers and derivatives markets. &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Innovation in Technology:</strong>&nbsp;As IT evolves continuously and plays a central role in modern market infrastructure, the WFE will assess the changes and how best to manage the use of technology, such as Artificial Intelligence. This will include the key issues of security and resilience &ndash; which are the hallmarks of Market Infrastructure. We will be working with regulators to ensure that emerging standards in these areas neither deter innovation nor fail to protect investors.</li>
<li><strong>Private and Public Markets - improving the health of capital markets:&nbsp;</strong>Private markets now occupy a grey area relative to public ones, especially with growth in secondary trading and retail access. With our stakeholders, the WFE will examine how private and public markets interact and how to optimise this interaction, to ensure that the incentives to list and to trade transparently are aligned with the known benefits of lit, public markets. &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Clearing, CCPs and the changes arising from new regulation:</strong>&nbsp;The WFE, which is the largest global organisation representing CCPs, will work on the issues arising from the wave of new policy making, especially around margin practices, to ensure the CCP voice, and consensus, is heard clearly.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Education:</strong>&nbsp;With the WFE&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://world-exchanges.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=48ddcbc11eb58f141a51219ea&amp;id=6296b32d43&amp;e=979576350c" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Market Infrastructure Certificate</a>&nbsp;entering its third year, the WFE will work to ensure the learning and educational needs of future leaders are being served.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p><br />As the voice of the exchange industry, the WFE will continue to foster and promote efficient market structures that are resilient, robust, fair, transparent and stable during this time of change and innovation.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Nandini Sukumar, CEO at the WFE, said:&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;We will continue to champion the sustainable growth of public markets and collaborate with stakeholders to ensure their ongoing health and robustness, given their important economic and social role to the global economy.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Dun &amp; Bradstreet Global Business Optimism Insights Report Reveals Cautious Economic Outlook For Q1 2025 - Slow Economic Growth, Rising Geopolitical Tensions, And Increasing Trade Uncertainties Drive Down Overall Optimism Levels</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/dun-and-bradstreet-global-business-optimism-insights-report-reveals-cautious-econo/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/dun-and-bradstreet-global-business-optimism-insights-report-reveals-cautious-econo/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Dun &amp; Bradstreet (NYSE:DNB), a leading global provider of business decisioning data and analytics, today released its Q1 2025 Global Business Optimism Insights report. The survey, conducted during November 2024, revealed a 12.9% quarter-over-quarter decline in the Global Business Optimism Index for Q1 2025, reflective of growing concerns over weak economic growth, rising geopolitical risks, and trade policy uncertainties.</p>
<div class="PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference" id="DivAssetPlaceHolder1">
<p><img src="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2604005/5129602/Dun_Bradstreet__Logo.jpg" title="Dun &amp; Bradstreet Logo (PRNewsfoto/Dun &amp; Bradstreet)" /></p>
</div>
<p>This shift suggests a redirection from previously elevated optimism levels seen in the latter half of 2024 and indicates a more cautious approach by businesses, particularly in terms of supply chain stability and investment strategies. The anticipation of policy changes from the new U.S. administration may have also contributed to lower optimism. Despite this quarterly decline, 30 of 32 economies show optimism levels above those seen in Q1 2024, signaling a correction from previously elevated optimism levels rather than a bleak outlook.</p>
<p>"Survey respondents have a guarded outlook for the quarter ahead due to the evolving economic and political landscape that may impact how the world does business," said Neeraj Sahai, President of Dun &amp; Bradstreet International. "Optimism levels for supply chain risks vary across business size with large businesses indicating increased optimism and resilience by leveraging their economies of scale and reliance on alternative sourcing. Medium-sized businesses experienced the sharpest deterioration with a 36% decline, indicating that these businesses have not been able to counter the challenges posed by cross-country trade, while simultaneously facing insufficient local supplies, further showing heightened concern on the supply chain continuity front. Small businesses had a moderate decline of 3.5%."</p>
<p><b>Key findings from the Q1 2025 report:</b></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>The&nbsp;<b>Global Business Optimism Index</b>&nbsp;dropped by 12.9%, its first decline since the series began, with all 32 surveyed economies seeing a downturn, reflecting heightened economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, and sluggish growth. However, for over 90% of the economies, the optimism levels remain above Q1 2024, signaling a correction from previously elevated optimism levels.</li>
</ul>
<p>o&nbsp; Over 80% of the economies reported a decline in optimism for new export orders, with almost half of them having more than 10% trade exposure to either the U.S. or the Chinese Mainland.</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><b>The Global Supply Chain Continuity Index</b>&nbsp;deteriorated by 10.4% after three quarters of improvement. Persistent challenges such as freight costs, container shortages, and geopolitical disruptions, as well as payment delays, contributed to this decline.</li>
</ul>
<p>o&nbsp; Optimism among large businesses improved 10.7% due to their economies of scale and reliance on alternative sourcing. Medium-sized businesses lagged with 66% reporting lower optimism. Small businesses, despite a 3.5% decline, are optimistic about delivery times, delivery costs, and supplier concentration due to their ability to source locally and relocate production bases.</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><b>The Global Business Financial Confidence Index</b>&nbsp;declined 8.9%, for both advanced and emerging economies, with over 90% of the economies reporting a decline in their financial confidence index.</li>
</ul>
<p>o&nbsp; This decline can be attributed to the uncertain macroeconomic environment, weak demand outlook, increased balance sheet risk, and declining financial risk appetite, especially among small and medium-sized businesses. Optimism among large businesses, in contrast, improved 12.7%.</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><b>The Global Business Investment Confidence Index</b>&nbsp;decreased by 4.7%, though it is still 12% higher than the 5-quarter average, reflecting commitments by many central banks to lower their policy rates.</li>
</ul>
<p>o&nbsp; Globally, 66% of businesses reported a need to raise long-term funds, a significant decline from 71% in the previous quarter. M&amp;A activity remains a bright spot, with 78% of businesses anticipating a conducive environment.</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><b>The Global Business&nbsp;ESG Index</b>&nbsp;rose 2.4%, highlighting businesses' focus on sustainability despite challenging economic conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p>o&nbsp; Notably, responses highlighted the differing strategies between the U.S. and the European Union to increase budgets for sustainability initiatives in Q1, particularly in automotive manufacturing spending, likely due to varying expectations of policy changes that may impact budget allocations.</p>
<p>"Businesses have entered the new year with subdued expectations for Q1 2025 and are grappling with supplier risk as&nbsp;only 51% of businesses expressed confidence in managing supplier concentration risk, compared with 59% in Q4," said Arun Singh, Global Chief Economist at Dun &amp; Bradstreet. "Further, central banks globally are implementing interest rate cuts, yet the cost of capital is perceived to remain elevated, indicating heightened credit risk. This is also accentuated by lower optimism for sales and profitability."</p>
<p>Descriptions and information about the indices can be found on page 31 of the report.</p>
<p><b>About the Global Business Optimism Insights Report</b></p>
<p>The Global Business Optimism Insights report is a synthesis of data from a comprehensive survey encompassing 32 economies, covering approximately 10,000 businesses and 17 sectors, alongside insights from Dun &amp; Bradstreet, leveraging the firm's proprietary data and economic expertise. The report is an amalgamation of five indices which reflect overall business optimism and expectations about supply chain continuity, financial and investment conditions and ESG initiatives. An index reading above 100 indicates an improvement in optimism relative to the base year, while an index reading below 100 signifies a deterioration in optimism.</p>

While over 76% of fraud decision-makers recognise the growing threat of AI in fraud, only 22% of organisations have started implementing AI-driven fraud prevention measures. This delay in action leaves companies vulnerable to increasingly sophisticated fraud techniques as they enter 2025.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The research surveyed over 1,200 fraud decision-makers across banks, fintechs, payment providers, and insurance companies in Europe. Despite a high awareness of the threat, the findings reveal a significant gap between understanding the issue and taking action.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Awareness-Action Disconnect</span></p>
<p><span>The report highlights that organisations are aware of the problem but struggle to implement the necessary defences due to:</span></p>
<ul class="ql-agpr-list">
<li class="ql-indent-0 ql-agpr-list-item"><span><strong>Lack of expertise</strong>: 76% of fraud decision-makers cite inadequate skills as a major barrier.</span></li>
<li class="ql-indent-0 ql-agpr-list-item"><span><strong>Lack of time</strong>: 74% admit that they do not have the time to address the problem with the urgency it requires.</span></li>
<li class="ql-indent-0 ql-agpr-list-item"><span><strong>Budget Shortfalls</strong>: 76% report insufficient funding to deploy robust fraud prevention technologies.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>&lsquo;<i>Despite the alarming rise in AI-driven identity fraud techniques like deepfakes, most organisations are stuck in the planning phase,&rsquo;</i>&nbsp;states Pinar Alpay, Chief Product &amp; Marketing Officer at Signicat. &lsquo;<i>The gap between awareness and action is widening, creating a ticking time bomb, especially for the financial sector and other regulated industries&rsquo;</i>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2025: the year of AI Fraud evolution</span></p>
<p><span>As organisations face the challenges of 2025, the report warns that fraudsters are set to leverage AI to unprecedented levels, combining scale with sophistication. Deepfake attacks, which have grown by 2137% over the past three years according to Signicat&rsquo;s data, are just one example of how rapidly AI-driven fraud techniques are advancing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To stay ahead of fraudsters, companies must act swiftly by:</span></p>
<ul class="ql-agpr-list">
<li class="ql-indent-0 ql-agpr-list-item"><span><strong>Prioritise multi-layered defence approach:&nbsp;</strong>From early risk assessment to robust identity verification and authentication tools combined with data enrichment to ongoing monitoring for a comprehensive approach covering the primary vulnerable fronts.</span></li>

<p><span><i>&lsquo;Just as our industry is constantly updating and preparing for new challenges, companies must do the same. Relying on obsolete solutions is the opposite of what&rsquo;s needed.

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Review Finds Gaps Remain In Brokersâ Money Laundering Defences</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has found wholesale brokers need to enhance their systems, controls, risk awareness and training to guard against money laundering.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA focused on wholesale brokers in its review because of the important role they play in capital markets in facilitating deals.</p>
<p>The regulator also engaged with other market participants to understand wider risks, issues and good practice, recognising that collaboration with and across industry is essential to delivering real improvements. This report will assist any firms involved in the capital markets to improve their controls and prevent financial crime.</p>
<p>Good progress has been made since the FCA&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/thematic-reviews/tr19-004.pdf" title="TR19/4: Understanding the Money Laundering Risks in the Capital Markets">Thematic Review</a>&nbsp;in 2019, including with customer risk assessments, onboarding processes, governance and oversight, and collaboration between trade surveillance and transaction monitoring teams.</p>
<p>However, the FCA identified areas where firms needed to improve to better protect against money laundering, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>an underestimation of the risks of money laundering firms are exposed to</li>
<li>over-reliance on others in the transaction chain completing appropriate due diligence checks on customers</li>
<li>limited information sharing between firms</li>
<li>insufficient awareness of the money laundering through the markets suspicious activity reports glossary code</li>
</ul>
<p>Steve Smart, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight, said: &lsquo;The flow of capital is an essential part of a thriving and competitive market, but tainted cash must not be allowed to pollute the rest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;For the UK financial services industry to grow, investors and institutions need to have trust in it. Integrity is vital for that, and firms play a key role in helping to detect criminal activity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Firms need to keep their controls under review and ensure they are effective against financial crime. This report will help them do that.&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA will continue to work closely with firms, industry and law enforcement to improve understanding and sharing of information about emerging risks and to encourage greater innovation by firms with transaction monitoring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, the FCA also published a review of how firms are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/multi-firm-reviews/firms-use-national-fraud-database-money-mule-account-detection-tools" title="Firms&rsquo; use of the National Fraud Database (NFD) and money mule account detection tools">preventing and detecting money mules</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/corporate-documents/money-laundering-through-markets" title="Money Laundering through the Markets">Report: Money laundering through the markets</a></li>
<li>Capital markets bring together buyers and sellers to trade stocks, bonds, currencies and other financial assets. Capital markets include stock markets and bond markets amongst several others. They play a pivotal role in enabling economic growth and innovation through connecting entities seeking capital and investment.</li>
<li>Money laundering through markets, or MLTM, relates to the use of these markets to launder funds obtained through criminal activity, so that they appear legitimately generated. &nbsp;</li>
<li>The UK&rsquo;s National Risk Assessment 2020 highlights that &lsquo;capital markets continue to offer a route for criminals to move and disguise the audit trail of money through the use of complex financial transactions&rsquo;.</li>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-from-the-securities-commission-malaysia/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As the country&rsquo;s capital market regulator, the Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) is entrusted with ensuring all transactions within our jurisdiction comply with relevant rules and regulations, including the Malaysian Code on Take-overs and Mergers (Code) and the Rules on Take-overs, Mergers and Compulsory Acquisitions (Rules).</p>
<p>In any take-over offer, the SC focuses on ensuring compliance with the Code&rsquo;s and the Rules&rsquo; requirements, particularly with regards to the timely and adequate disclosure of information to the shareholders. This is to ensure that shareholders have sufficient information to make informed decisions on take-over offers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given the recent interest in this matter, the SC would like to reassure stakeholders that we are monitoring the situation closely to ensure adherence to the Code and the Rules, and to safeguard the integrity of the capital market.&nbsp;</p>

<li>Eurex Clearing has received non-objection from its regulator BaFin for DLT-supported collateral mobilization for its clients.</li>
<li>The objective is to ensure that securities collateral can be accessed and utilized instantly to fulfil central counterparties' (CCP) margin requirements, regardless of its physical location.</li>
<li>The initiative is a collaboration with HQLA<sup>X</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;and Clearstream, with J.P. Morgan planning to participate as the pilot clearing member.</li>

<p>Eurex Clearing extends its technical capabilities and announces the planned launch of collateral mobilization supported by Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) in Q2 2025. This will set an example for enabling digital mobilization of collateral with the benefits of a secure CCP framework. The flexibility, speed and efficiency of collateral transfers will be enhanced by mobilizing collateral with the support of the HQLA<sup>X</sup>&nbsp;digital ledger. The goal is to ensure that securities collateral becomes easily accessible, independent of its physical location, and can be moved quickly and without incurring substantial costs. This will improve the immediate availability to meet the margin requirements set by CCPs. By achieving this, the process of fulfilling CCP margin requirements becomes even more efficient.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory green light for seamless integration</strong><br /><br />Eurex Clearing has received regulatory non-objection from its regulator BaFin. The proposed DLT-supported functionality will enable Eurex&rsquo;s clients to mobilize margin collateral via custodians and central securities depositories (CSDs) on the HQLA<sup>X</sup>&nbsp;digital ledger. Such collateral is being posted to Eurex Clearing as margin collateral at Clearstream Banking S.A.. The ambition is to enhance the flexibility, speed and efficiency of collateral mobilization capabilities for Eurex Clearing clients. Valuable insights from a client perspective were implemented throughout the process from J.P. Morgan, which plans to participate as the pilot clearing member.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Enhanced flexibility offers client benefits</strong><br /><br />This initiative is a cornerstone of Eurex Clearing's collateral offering and digital services ambitions. Eurex Clearing continues to invest in and integrate innovative services, reflecting its commitment to provide cutting-edge solutions to its clients.</p>
<p>Helen Gordon, Global Head of Derivatives Clearing, J.P. Morgan, commented: &ldquo;J.P. Morgan early on identified the benefits of using traditional assets in digital form to move cleared derivatives collateral and is pleased to see this regulatory milestone achieved. We look forward to the next phase of implementation and realizing the risk and optimization benefits associated with improved collateral mobility for us and our clients.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guido Stroemer, Co-founder and CEO of HQLA<sup>X</sup>, commented: &ldquo;We are pleased to support Eurex Clearing in this pioneering initiative, which leverages our DLT platform to enhance collateral mobility and security for cleared margin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marton Szigeti, Head of Collateral, Lending &amp; Liquidity Solutions, Clearstream, adds: &ldquo;We are thrilled that our colleagues from Eurex Clearing add the central clearing element to HQLA<sup>X</sup>&rsquo;s collateral offering, further strengthening Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group&rsquo;s engagement. This collaboration underscores Clearstream&rsquo;s commitment to providing efficient collateral solutions, shaping a secure digital financial landscape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matthias Graulich, Member of the Executive Board at Eurex Clearing, concludes: "With this offering Eurex Clearing once again pioneers and upholds its status as the innovator in the CCP space. Eurex Clearing continues to invest in such advanced services, reflecting its commitment to providing cutting-edge solutions and services to its clients."</p>

<title>ASX Releases CHESS Settlement Incident Review</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asx-releases-chess-settlement-incident-review/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asx-releases-chess-settlement-incident-review/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASX has today released an incident review to assist customers and stakeholders with a more detailed understanding of the CHESS Batch Settlement incident that occurred on Friday 20 December 2024. This includes an overview of how the incident unfolded, root cause analysis, steps taken to prevent reoccurrence, and a preliminary action plan that ensures the ongoing stability of CHESS and identifying opportunities for improvement in our incident management protocols.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The incident resulted in Batch Settlement for Friday 20 December 2024 having to be rescheduled to the following business day, Monday 23 December 2024.</p>
<p>The root cause of the incident arose from a combination of events but is isolated to an area of CHESS that calculates memory allocation for the settlement processes. Trading and Clearing services were unaffected on Friday and the market opened without issue on the following Monday.</p>
<p>There were specific circumstances in December 2024 that triggered the incident but the root cause can be traced back to an error that was introduced in 2014 to the memory allocation logic which resulted in the Batch Settlement process not being able to complete. The nature of this issue and how it arose was highly irregular and there is no record of previous incidents caused by this part of the system, or of CHESS not completing Batch Settlement on a designated settlement day.</p>
<p>ASX Managing Director and CEO Helen Lofthouse sent a personal letter to customers today apologising once again for the incident and committed a $1 million credit to settlement participants in acknowledgement of the disruption. Details of this customer rebate can be found in the final section of the Incident Review.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.asx.com.au/content/dam/asx/markets/clearing-and-settlement-services/chess-batch-settlement-incident-review.pdf">Incident Review</a><a href="https://www.asx.com.au/content/dam/asx/markets/clearing-and-settlement-services/chess-batch-settlement-incident-review.pdf"> </a>and the <a href="https://www.asx.com.au/markets/clearing-and-settlement-services/chess-replacement/chess-batch-settlement-incident-review">CEO</a><a href="https://www.asx.com.au/markets/clearing-and-settlement-services/chess-replacement/chess-batch-settlement-incident-review"> </a><a href="https://www.asx.com.au/markets/clearing-and-settlement-services/chess-replacement/chess-batch-settlement-incident-review">letter to customers</a><a href="https://www.asx.com.au/markets/clearing-and-settlement-services/chess-replacement/chess-batch-settlement-incident-review"> </a>can be accessed on ASX&rsquo;s website.</p>
<p>Echoing the sentiment in her letter to customers, Ms Lofthouse said: &ldquo;Not being able to complete Batch Settlement is unprecedented and we fully appreciate the seriousness of this matter. While the incident was successfully resolved such that the market could open normally on the next business day, this does not meet the high operating standards expected of ASX and which we expect of ourselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to write to customers directly to once again apologise for the incident and to assure them that we&rsquo;ve taken steps to fix the issue and prevent reoccurrence. We&rsquo;ve also outlined the current action plan that considers any further technical reviews and potential incident management protocols including how we engage stakeholders.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The release of today&rsquo;s Incident Review underscores ASX&rsquo;s continued commitment to transparency. We continue to update our regulatory agencies on this matter and further engagement with participants is planned as part of our post incident review actions.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Happy New Year. I don&rsquo;t know how many of you are football fans, but many games are played over the Christmas and New Year period. Every morning when I tried to check the scores, I was struck by how every single headline was about the referee, whether a penalty should have been awarded, or whether a red card should have been given. I was annoyed. I wanted to read about the game, not the referee. This got me thinking about how this applied to market regulation. People want to read about how the market is performing and what companies are doing. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s called the Business Times and not the Regulatory Times. What can we do to keep the focus on the play and not the refereeing?</p>
<p>The first question we need to ask is whether the referee or the regulator is intervening excessively. I have spoken on previous occasions about the feedback on our trading queries and how they can have a chilling effect on our market. We have finetuned our trading queries, which has helped reduce the number of queries. and this year, we will conduct a review of the entire trading query regime.</p>
<p>We have heard feedback, including from some of you today, that we should look not just at our trading queries, but also our public queries in general, because they too can also have a chilling effect on the market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me caveat that under our disclosure-based regime, our guiding principle is to require the timely disclosure of material information, and we make no apologies for querying companies on material matters that in our judgment require stronger disclosure. But in light of the feedback, we will conduct a review of our query regime as a whole to see if we have been applying that materiality principle consistently.</p>
<p>The second is market participants must know what is and what is not allowed, and the regulator must communicate this clearly and quickly. Nothing irritates fans more than a lengthy stoppage of play. In the same way, the market also wants to see regular news flow on corporate actions which in turn will inform trading activity.</p>
<p>So we have published tonnes of guidance, and I personally have written a record number of regulators&rsquo; columns to set out our expectations. There will of course be complex cases where interaction with the regulator is required. We appreciate that time to market is important, and we will see whether we need to change the way we interact with the market in order to speed things up.</p>
<p>In football, when there is a foul, the referee can play advantage and let play continue if it benefits the team that has been fouled. You can be assured that we have our own version of the advantage rule, for example by granting waivers of our listing rules when the cost of compliance is disproportionate to the benefit.</p>
<p>Finally, we all need to recognize that public action is warranted once bad behavior crosses the line to challenge the fairness and transparency of our market. A few weeks ago, there was a game between the top two teams in the English Premier League. By all accounts it was a fantastic game until the referee issued a red card and sent a player off for a foul. There was a huge debate over whether the referee was at fault for spoiling the game.</p>
<p>This is where I think we must not conflate two issues. The first is unnecessary regulatory intervention which I agree we must avoid. The second is necessary regulatory intervention which needs to be conducted regardless of whether it spoils the game or not. You cannot refrain from issuing a justified red card just because it is an exciting game.</p>
<p>Public action is a deterrent to future bad behavior that crosses the line. Plus, let us face it, allowing such bad behavior to continue is not sustainable.&nbsp; This will have to remain as one of our guiding principles even as we review the way that we regulate.</p>
<p>In conclusion, let me leave you with a quote from Sir Robert Peel, who is considered the founder of modern policing. He said: the test of police efficiency is the absence of crime and disorder, not the visible evidence of police action in dealing with it so on that note, thank you very much for your attention.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The High Court yesterday allowed the Public Prosecutor&rsquo;s application against Havana Bayview Sdn Bhd and Wong Shee Kai (Ricky Wong) to forfeit a luxury condominium unit at Four Seasons Place in Kuala Lumpur as well as a sum of RM445,039.28 held in Ricky Wong's personal fixed deposit account (Forfeiture Application).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) conducted the Forfeiture Application on behalf of the Public Prosecutor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The property at No. 145 Jalan Ampang, Kuala Lumpur is owned by Havana Bayview, of which Ricky Wong is a director and substantial shareholder.</p>
<p>The Forfeiture Application pertains to proceeds raised by Bright Packaging Industry Berhad (BPI) through its corporate exercises conducted between October 2013 to July 2014. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The SC&rsquo;s investigation revealed that proceeds amounting to a total of RM56,074,500 were siphoned out of BPI and a portion thereof was used as part payment for the purchase of the condominium.</p>
<p>The RM445,039.28 sum was interest generated from a portion of the proceeds that were placed into Ricky Wong&rsquo;s fixed deposit account.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the SC had in May 2021 commenced the Forfeiture Application, pursuant to Section 56 of the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001 (AMLATFPUAA), upon obtaining the Public Prosecutor&rsquo;s consent. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The matter was heard before YA Dato&rsquo; Azhar bin Abdul Hamid on 2 September 2024. &nbsp;</p>
<p>At the decision yesterday, the Judge allowed the Forfeiture Application and granted an order for both the condominium and the cash. He further granted the Respondents a stay of execution on the decision pending a formal stay application.</p>
<p>In the past, the SC has initiated other enforcement actions against Ricky Wong. This includes a civil suit in May 2020 against Ricky Wong, Teh Sew Wan, and Wong SK&nbsp;Holdings Sdn Bhd for securities fraud offences under section of the 179 of the Capital Markets and Services Act 2007.</p>
<p>The SC is also seeking<a href="https://www.sc.com.my/resources/media/media-release/sc-seeks-publics-assistance-to-locate-ricky-wong-shee-kai.%E2%80%99"> </a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/resources/media/media-release/sc-seeks-publics-assistance-to-locate-ricky-wong-shee-kai.%E2%80%99">public assistance</a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/resources/media/media-release/sc-seeks-publics-assistance-to-locate-ricky-wong-shee-kai.%E2%80%99"> </a>to locate Ricky Wong, who is currently wanted in relation to offences under the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001.</p>

<title>Which Markets And Investors?: Statement On The Notice Of Proposed Plan Of Distribution And Opportunity For Comment With Respect To Barclays PLC And Barclays Bank PLC, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, Jan. 22, 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/which-markets-and-investors-statement-on-the-notice-of-proposed-plan-of-distri/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/which-markets-and-investors-statement-on-the-notice-of-proposed-plan-of-distri/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In accordance with a vote taken before January 20, the Commission today published a Notice of Proposed Plan of Distribution and Opportunity for Comment for a Fair Fund created from the $200 million civil penalty imposed in a settled administrative proceeding against Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-barclays-012225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Under the Proposed Plan, the Commission would &ldquo;use a single claims process to compensate investors who purchased or acquired ADRs on a U.S. exchange and ordinary shares/common stock on a foreign exchange, and were harmed by a violation of the federal securities laws.&rdquo; Specifically, the Fair Fund proposes to compensate investors for the &ldquo;Recognized Loss[es]&rdquo; incurred from trading during the &ldquo;Relevant Period&rdquo; in Barclays ADRs on the NYSE and in &ldquo;Barclays ordinary shares traded on the [London Stock Exchange] (&ldquo;LSE&rdquo;).&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-barclays-012225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;This proposed plan&mdash;to use a Fair Fund to compensate investors who purchased securities of a foreign issuer on a foreign exchange&mdash;is somewhat novel. I have both legal and policy concerns regarding the novel proposal.</p>
<p>First, the Notice&rsquo;s discussion of extraterritoriality misapplies the presumption against extraterritoriality. In discussing the Commission&rsquo;s statutory authority under Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Notice argues that because &ldquo;SOX 308(a) does not regulate conduct but rather confers a benefit,&rdquo; it therefore does not &ldquo;implicat[e] the sovereignty of foreign nations&mdash;one of the core animating principles&rdquo; underpinning the presumption against extraterritorial, and on that basis concludes that the presumption against extraterritoriality does not apply to SOX 308(a). The Supreme Court, in explaining the various reasons for the presumption, has noted that it &ldquo;serves to avoid the international discord that can result when U.S. law is applied to conduct in foreign countries.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-barclays-012225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;However, the Court likewise instructed that &ldquo;the presumption applies regardless of whether there is a risk of conflict between the American statute and a foreign law.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-barclays-012225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;The Court further has explained that its precedents</p>
<blockquote>
<p>reflect a two-step framework for analyzing extraterritoriality issues. At the first step, we ask whether the presumption against extraterritoriality has been rebutted&mdash;that is, whether the statute gives a clear, affirmative indication that it applies extraterritorially. We must ask this question regardless of whether the statute in question regulates the conduct,&nbsp;<i>affords relief</i>, or merely confers jurisdiction.&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;</i>If the statute is not extraterritorial, then at the second step we determine whether the case involves domestic application of the statute, and we do this by looking to the statute&rsquo;s &ldquo;focus.&rdquo; If the conduct relevant to the statute&rsquo;s focus occurred in the United States, then the case involves a permissible domestic application even if other conduct occurred abroad; but&nbsp;<i>if the conduct relevant to the focus occurred in a foreign country, then the case involves an impermissible extraterritorial application regardless of any other conduct that occurred in U.S. territory</i>. (emphasis added)<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-barclays-012225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Notice did not reach the best conclusion under the Court&rsquo;s two-step framework. At the first step, it is clear that SOX 308(a) lacks any language that &ldquo;gives a clear, affirmative indication&rdquo; that Congress meant for the statute to have extraterritorial application, and the Notice does not contend otherwise. Moving to the second step, the relevant conduct that is the focus of the Fair Fund&mdash;compensation for losses incurred during the relevant period&mdash;involves conduct occurring both domestically (ADR transactions on NYSE) and in a foreign country (common stock transactions on the LSE). The former &ldquo;involves a permissible domestic application.&rdquo; By contrast, the latter, applies the statute to conduct occurring in a foreign country and thus appears to &ldquo;involve[] an impermissible extraterritorial application&rdquo; of SOX 308(a). The presence or absence of implications for the sovereignty of foreign nations does not change the result of this two-step analysis.</p>
<p>Second, from a policy perspective, does it make sense for the Commission to provide compensation to investors who chose to transact in Barclays&rsquo; common stock on the LSE rather than purchasing the economically equivalent ADRs on NYSE?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-barclays-012225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;The Commission understandably is concerned with the fair and efficient operation of the United States capital markets. Compensating investors who traded on domestic exchanges and incurred losses that have a causal connection to the violation of the United States&rsquo; securities laws and regulations furthers the Commission&rsquo;s mission to protect investors and maintain fair and efficient markets. The Commission does not have a similar interest in the fair and efficient operation of the LSE and in protecting investors trading thereon. When people choose to go&nbsp;<i>outside</i>&nbsp;the United States to trade, they do not get the protection of the Securities and Exchange Commission. They are opting out of U.S. securities laws and into another set of laws and regulations.</p>
<p>Moreover, given that penalty money not paid out to investors through a Fair Fund is deposited into the United States Treasury, compensating the foreign investors who traded on foreign exchanges comes at a cost to American taxpayers. The Commission should reallocate funds from American taxpayers to foreign investors only when there is clear authorization or instruction from Congress to do so, something that appears lacking on the face of SOX 308(a).</p>
<p>For those reasons, I question whether the Commission&rsquo;s Proposed Plan of Distribution is consistent with the text of SOX 308(a) or an appropriate exercise of discretion even if it is allowable under the statute. I look forward to hearing from commentors. To aid the Commission in its consideration of the Proposed Plan of Distribution, I welcome comment on the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is the Commission&rsquo;s conclusion that the presumption against extraterritoriality does not apply to SOX 308(a) because the statute confers a benefit and does not conflict with foreign law correct?</li>
<li>Does the Notice correctly construe and apply the Supreme Court&rsquo;s precedents regarding the presumption against extraterritoriality?</li>
<li>Is the Commission&rsquo;s proposal to compensate foreign investors for losses incurred trading on foreign exchanges consistent with its mission to further fair and efficient markets and to protect investors?</li>

<title>Remarks Of CFTC Commissioner Kristin Johnson At The Global Blockchain Business Councilâs 8th Annual Blockchain Central Davos: Collaboration For The Intelligent Age</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/remarks-of-cftc-commissioner-kristin-johnson-at-the-global-blockchain-business-c/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/remarks-of-cftc-commissioner-kristin-johnson-at-the-global-blockchain-business-c/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>In January, we mark the launch of a number of initiatives and resolutions. A significant transition in leadership in U.S. government is taking place as I am delivering these remarks. Moments of transition offer an exceptional time for reflection on our shared goals and recommitment to the values that drive government, business, and our society.</span></p>
<p><span>I am glad to join for the start of the 2025 World Economic Forum in Davos and the Global Blockchain Business Council&rsquo;s kick off to its Eighth Annual meeting here. Over the last three years, I have used my time at the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission to foster a parallel dialogue among government agencies and market participants exploring the benefits and challenges engendered by innovation. This dialogue emphasizes issues that inspire the WEF Annual Meeting theme&mdash;Collaboration for the Intelligent Age.</span></p>
<p><em><span><strong>Rapidly Advancing Technologies&nbsp;</strong></span></em></p>
<p><span>Rapid technological innovation has ushered in lightning speed advances in science and medicine, enabling unprecedented precision in disease mapping and diagnosis.</span></p>
<p><span>We have reached a watershed moment in the evolution of our markets. While predictive analytics and models have long been adopted in financial markets, cloud-based technologies, quantum computing, automation, and robotics are poised to alter market structure and the provision of services.</span></p>
<p><em><span><strong>Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain Technologies&nbsp;</strong></span></em></p>
<p><span>Artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies have captured the popular imagination and offer some of the most diverse and accessible applications among the many nascent technologies being discussed in Davos this week. An increasingly robust conversation regarding the integration of cryptocurrencies in our markets underscores the critical need to advance this dialogue.</span></p>
<p><span>U.S. financial market regulators have recognized the need to enhance the channels of communication. Last year, I contributed to a request for information launched by the CFTC on the use of artificial intelligence in CFTC-regulated markets,</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson14?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>[1]</span></a><span>&nbsp;and the U.S. Department of the Treasury issued a similar request on artificial intelligence in the financial services sector.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson14?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span>[2]</span></a><span>&nbsp;The RFIs, alongside efforts of the Federal Reserve Bank, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and Securities and Exchange Commission, seek to better understand use cases, priorities, and limitations of artificial intelligence in financial markets and to appreciate the risks that may be easily identified as well as those that are difficult to identify.</span></p>
<p><span>While these initiatives are a great start, where should we go from here? I strongly support advancing two core goals, each involving multi-stakeholder dialogues.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><span><strong>Next Steps&nbsp;</strong></span></em></p>
<ol>
<li value="1"><strong>Deeper Learning and Enhanced Dialogue</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span>First, I continue to encourage our domestic regulators and the international coalitions of regulators to advance a dialogue of learning and deeper understanding regarding each of these technologies.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This information gathering stage fosters an open dialogue among regulators and market participants, along with other voices including other regulators, both domestic and international, academics, public interest advocates, and others.</span></p>
<p><span>Last year the CFTC Staff issued an advisory on market participants&rsquo; use of AI.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson14?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><span>[3]</span></a><span>&nbsp;The Advisory emphasized principles common across our regulatory framework that govern all the markets that we supervise. As I explained at that time, &ldquo;I believe it is important that regulators across financial markets within the United States and globally work in collaboration to establish effective regulatory approaches. . . . A collaborative approach would promote efficiency and consistency in AI regulation and ensure that regulation keeps pace with technological advancements and emerging challenges.&rdquo;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson14?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><span>[4]</span></a><span></span></p>
<p><span>I have advocated for creating an interagency task force and explained &ldquo;[a]ddressing the perils of AI, while harnessing its promise, is a challenge that will require a whole-of-government approach, with regulators working together across diverse agencies.&rdquo;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson14?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><span>[5]</span></a><span>&nbsp;As we enter into a new year, I would also emphasize that this approach promises efficiencies and a needed clarity for market participants trying to navigate diverse and sometimes divergent regulatory and compliance frameworks. These benefits extend to collaboration beyond our borders as well.</span></p>
<ol>
<li value="2"><strong>Enhanced Supervisory Resources&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span>Second, and equally impacted by collaboration, is the important role of individual firms, trade associations, and regulators in effective supervision. Self-regulation is a central value in our regulatory framework. Ensuring the stability and integrity of our markets is a team effort&mdash;a genuine public-private collaboration. We rely on our market participants to be the first line of defense in many contexts.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Within the agency, we have faced increased demand on reduced resources. Let there be no doubt, the CFTC punches above its weight. Yet, if more is asked of our Commission, more resources must follow to ensure that we successfully achieve our mission.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have strongly advocated for the allocation of additional resources to train supervisory staff and better enable surveillance to combat issues such as fraud schemes that use AI to identify potential victims or carry out heists. More specifically, the CFTC Division of Enforcement should stand up an AI Task Force, led by staff with expertise in all traditionally relevant areas as well as a depth of experience and expertise in AI-based fraud.</span></p>
<p><em><span><strong>Intellectual Leadership&nbsp;</strong></span></em></p>
<p><span>I am extremely thankful for the opportunity to serve my country at the CFTC. During my time as a lawyer in financial markets, a regulator, and an academic committed to the stability and integrity of our markets, the Commission has demonstrated significant intellectual leadership.</span></p>
<p><span>From the vantage of the mountain top (an unparalleled majestic view here in Davos), I will hope for the continued commitment of the Commission to intellectual leadership and Collaboration for the Intelligent Age.</span></p>

<title>ISDA derivatiViews: Deadline Pressure On Treasury Clearing</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-derivativiews-deadline-pressure-on-treasury-clearing/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-derivativiews-deadline-pressure-on-treasury-clearing/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>By the end of this year, the first phase of the US Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s (SEC) Treasury clearing mandate is scheduled to come into force, affecting users of US Treasury securities all over the world. It&rsquo;s difficult to overstate how big a deal this is, and a huge amount of work is underway to implement the new requirements. However, several legal, operational and capital issues crucial to implementation must be resolved before the new requirements take effect &ndash; and time is running out. With the start of a new administration in the US, we hope the deadlines will be quickly revisited to provide sufficient time to tackle the various implementation challenges.</p>
<p>Under the rules,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023-247">finalized by the SEC in December 2023</a>, clearing agencies will need to adjust their policies and procedures to require their members to clear certain cash US Treasury securities by December 31 this year, with repos following in a second phase six months later. This will include trades conducted by those member firms or their branches with any counterparty, including those based outside the US, meaning the number of in-scope entities around the world will likely run into the thousands.</p>
<p>The industry is working hard to meet the deadlines, but a lot remains unknown. While the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICCC) &ndash; historically the only clearing house for US Treasury transactions &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/08/06/isda-letter-on-ficcs-proposed-rulebook-changes/">released proposed changes to its rule book</a>&nbsp;last year, proposals for CME Group&rsquo;s new clearing offering have only recently been published, and market participants are in the early stages of digesting them. ICE has also announced it will launch a US Treasury clearing service. To assist the market, ISDA has published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/02/23/isda-clearing-model-comparison/">comparison of various clearing models</a>&nbsp;for US Treasury transactions and derivatives, which we will update as new models emerge.</p>
<p>Alongside this work, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) is leading a group (which also includes ISDA) that is making good headway in developing appropriate documentation. However, this documentation has to reflect the clearing models and rule books that are still under development, as well as client segregation solutions, some of which have yet to be finalized or tested. Dealers will then need to execute the new documents with thousands of counterparties, as well as obtain netting opinions to ensure efficient capital treatment. We know from the implementation of the margin rules for non-cleared derivatives that this is a considerable amount of work that takes time.</p>
<p>Impediments also exist in the regulatory and capital framework that need to be ironed out. For example, FICC and CME Group offer cross-margining at the clearing-member level to enable initial margin efficiencies from offsetting trades in a portfolio of cash, repo and futures transactions, but recognition of cross-margining at the client level is still pending. Moreover, there is no recognition in the revised US capital framework for corresponding cross-netting across derivatives and repo trades. Unless this is resolved, it will constrain bank balance sheets and limit their ability to offer client clearing.</p>
<p>Likewise, the US supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) in its current form may restrict the ability of banks to participate in the US Treasury market.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/03/05/isda-submits-letter-to-us-agencies-on-slr-reform/">As we pointed out to US prudential regulators last year</a>, we believe targeted reforms to the SLR framework are necessary to facilitate participation by banks in US Treasury markets, including clearing US Treasury transactions for clients.</p>
<p>This is on top of continued uncertainty about the final shape of the US Basel III endgame rules and the surcharge for US global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). Based on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/01/16/isda-and-sifma-response-to-us-basel-iii-npr/">analysis conducted by ISDA and SIFMA last year</a>, those two sets of proposals would increase capital for client clearing businesses at US G-SIBs by an eye-popping 80% &ndash; an unnecessary tax on clearing that is out of whack with risk and would bring the economic viability of that business into question.</p>
<p>We think now is the time to revisit all these issues, with the aim of maintaining deep, liquid markets and ensuring the continued smooth functioning and resilience of the US Treasury market. Having legal and operational certainty on pending implementation issues, as well as clarity on the related capital treatment, is a fundamental prerequisite for any successful US Treasury clearing mandate. Given all the issues that need to be resolved, it&rsquo;s difficult to see how Treasury clearing can be achieved safely and efficiently within the current time frame. We need to rethink the deadlines.</p>

<title>UK Chancellor Calls On Watchdog Bosses To Tear Down Regulatory Barriers That Hold Back Growth</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="call-to-action">
<ul>
<li>Chancellor pledges to work with regulators to develop ambitious reforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Today&rsquo;s (16 January) summit marks the first in a series of meetings with the regulators ahead of publishing action plan.</li>
<li>Reeves welcomes initial ideas from regulators to boost innovation and investment, but pushes for more ambition.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>In a meeting hosted by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and Secretary of State for Business and Trade, chief executives at watchdogs covering sectors including railways, water, energy and aviation were told that economic growth is the absolute top priority for the government, as part of the Plan for Change, putting more money in people&rsquo;s pockets.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The meeting was the first in a series following a joint letter from the Prime Minister, Chancellor and Secretary of State for Business and Trade in December, in which the government asked the regulators to each propose five reforms to support growth in the coming year.&nbsp;Over the coming weeks, 17 regulators will be called in to have their proposals scrutinised as the government leaves no stone unturned to deliver growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the meeting today, the Chancellor told the regulators that they would have a key role to play in delivering growth by helping to create a regulatory environment that unlocks innovation and investment, supports businesses to thrive and allows much needed infrastructure to be built. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The regulators agreed with the Chancellor that they have a role to play in driving growth but highlighted that there are some barriers, including the need to balance growth with their other legal responsibilities. The Chancellor noted that the regulators&rsquo; responsibilities had accumulated over time and said she was open to hearing about where this was preventing them from taking clear, consistent and balanced actions to drive growth.</p>
<p>She emphasised the importance of leadership to deliver a mindset shift on regulation, calling on each of the CEOs in the room to institute cultural change based on helping to deliver growth instead of excessively focusing on risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chancellor also promised&nbsp;that the government would work with them to develop and deliver important reforms by playing its part, including by making time for legislation where it is needed or using the upcoming Spending Review, and noted the Prime Minister&rsquo;s promise to rip up regulation that blocks investment to make the regulatory regime fit for the modern age.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chancellor was clear that while some of the proposals already put forward were promising, she wanted to see greater ambition and urgency to drive economic growth. She emphasised that fresh ideas were needed and noted that the Government will also ask industry to come forward with their own ideas to deliver a more growth supportive regulatory environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>She highlighted some specific and promising ideas she had heard from the regulators today. These included: driving greater responsiveness to business demands, particularly on planning and license applications; grant funding administered by Ofwat to drive innovation in the water sector supply chain; energy tariff reform; increasing access to rail operator efficiency data and innovative drone solutions which would unlock growth in the public sector. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The regulators agreed to continue working with the government on their proposals reform ahead of publishing an action plan in Spring, and welcomed today&rsquo;s strategic discussion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chancellor finished the meeting by reiterating that leadership matters, noting that every regulator would have to play their part to improve living standards across the country.</p>
<p><strong>Following the meeting, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s no substitute for growth. It&rsquo;s the only way to create more jobs and put more money in people&rsquo;s pockets, which is why it&rsquo;s at the heart of our Plan for Change.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="last-child">Every regulator, no matter what sector, has a part to play by tearing down the regulatory barriers that hold back growth. I want to see this mission woven into the very fabric of our regulators through a cultural shift from excessively focusing on risk to helping drive growth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=tT3lbsNSLROKr8szcdIjXb0kcZBublPasRFuPVOupxDVSXPnkVLmgYtVgGILLqxpw6Ue0ZuhfaKCkI_1QB_-kkicbbKMmw5KtOpy4XIBTyFJyggGLsyhRt5uQBMYbz-U" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span>CUSIP Global Services</span></a>&nbsp;(CGS) today announced the launch of a new CUSIP service for the private credit market.&nbsp;Developed in conjunction with CGS operator FactSet Research Systems Inc. (FactSet), the new service improves transparency and efficiency in the rapidly growing direct lending space, which includes direct loans, syndicated loans, and collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), the new service is being made available both as a standalone file and in the core CGS database product.</p>
<p>The CUSIP is a nine-character alphanumeric security identifier that captures the unique attributes of issuers and their financial instruments throughout the U.S. and&nbsp;Canada. Widely recognized as a trusted standard in the financial markets, CUSIPs are a foundational building block that allow for efficient trading, clearing and settlement across dozens of asset classes.</p>
<p>By adding CUSIP coverage for the U.S. private credit markets, which are now estimated to top $2 trillion in assets, CGS is making it possible for market participants to quickly and accurately determine critical entity- and asset-level information that is central to trading, clearing, settlement and portfolio management activities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As investor interest in U.S. private credit markets continues to grow, the ability to accurately identify and reconcile issuer and security details will be a key driver of liquidity and improved efficiency,&rdquo; said Scott Preiss, Senior Vice President and Global Head, CGS, &ldquo;CGS has decades of experience developing unique identifiers for the syndicated corporate loan market based on our close work with the LSTA, and we look forward to bringing that expertise to bear for the private credit markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>CGS developed the workflows for private credit CUSIP assignment in collaboration with FactSet to efficiently ramp up coverage of private credit facilities.&nbsp;FactSet is leveraging Business Development Company (BDC) SEC filings to identify, concord, and maintain unique instruments for CUSIP assignment eligibility during the initial phase. Currently over 3,000 private credit CUSIPs have already been assigned via this approach.&nbsp;Over the next year, CGS will expand its private credit CUSIP service to include other alternative credit instruments, working with FactSet, the LSTA, and other interested parties to address the needs of the marketplace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Private credit has become the fastest growing alternative asset class in North America, and as the market grows, so does the importance of establishing and maintaining accurate and reliable reference and security master records,&rdquo; said John Costigan, Executive Vice President and Chief Data Officer, FactSet. &ldquo;FactSet&rsquo;s comprehensive data solutions address the critical challenges in data transparency and quality by delivering accurate, reliable, and actionable insights. By collaborating with our CGS colleagues, we are taking key steps towards reaching a single source of truth&mdash;empowering the private credit investment community to streamline portfolio operations workflows and drive informed decision-making for this rapidly evolving asset class.&rdquo;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The B.C. Securities Commission (BCSC) has reached an agreement with an overseas group of companies, GS Partners and its affiliates, which will enable British Columbians to make a claim for a refund of all investments they made with them.</p>
<p>The agreement, reached as part of a coordinated effort by U.S. state and Canadian provincial securities regulators, includes GSB Gold Standard Corporation AG, which purportedly operated in the financial technology (&ldquo;fintech&rdquo;) and banking industry, GSB Gold Standard Bank LTD (commonly known as &ldquo;GS Partners&rdquo;), GSB Gold Standard Corporation AG, affiliated entities together known as the &ldquo;GSB Group&rdquo;, and Josip Heit, the group&rsquo;s principal.</p>

<p>British Columbians who invested with the companies must submit a claim to receive a refund of the value of their deposits minus any withdrawals.</p>
<p>The investments included in the claims process are:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Certificates (also known as &ldquo;Metacertificates&rdquo;), including Olympus, Elemental and Success series, through which purchasers were allegedly incentivized to add value to their certificates to unlock returns,</li>
<li>G999 token, a digital asset purportedly deployed on a proprietary blockchain tied to physical gold,</li>
<li>XLT Vouchers, a digital asset purportedly representing ownership interests in a skyscraper, and</li>
<li>the so-called staking pool in a metaverse known as Lydian World.</li>
</ul>
<p>Eligible investors can submit a claim with the claims administrator, AlixPartners LP, on the Claims Portal starting on February 21, 2025. Eligible investors will have until May 22, 2025 to submit a claim.</p>
<p>AlixPartners previously managed a claims process for clients of Bernie Madoff and was recently hired by the bankruptcy managers for FTX to perform complex cryptocurrency and blockchain analyses.</p>
<p>Detailed instructions about how to file a claim are available on the Claims Portal website,&nbsp;<a href="https://gsbsettlement.com/" target="_blank">gsbsettlement.com</a>. Please send any questions about submitting a claim by email to &nbsp;AlixPartners at gsbsettlement@alixpartners.com.</p>
<p>In November 2023, the BCSC issued a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/about/media-room/news-releases/2023/92-bcsc-issues-temporary-orders-against-three-bc-residents-and-offshore-companies-they-are-promoting">temporary order</a>&nbsp;against GS Partners, certain affiliates and three B.C. promoters as part of a coordinated enforcement effort with U.S. state securities regulators. The temporary order was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/-/media/PWS/New-Resources/Decision-and-Orders/Decisions/2024/2024-BCSECCOM-127.pdf?dt=20240404205931" target="_blank">subsequently extended</a>&nbsp;to November 29, 2024.

<title>ESMA: New Governance Structure For Transition To T+1 Settlement Cycle Kicks Off</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/esma-new-governance-structure-for-transition-to-t1-settlement-cycle-kicks-off/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, the European Commission (EC) and the European Central bank (ECB) launched today a new governance structure to support the transition to the T+1 settlement cycle in the European Union.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify">Following&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-11/ESMA74-2119945925-1969_Report_on_shortening_settlement_cycle.pdf">ESMA&rsquo;s report</a>&nbsp;<a>with recommendations&nbsp;</a>on the shortening of the settlement cycle, the new governance structure has been designed to oversee and manage the operational, regulatory and technological aspects of this transition. Given the high level of interconnectedness within the EU capital market, a coordinated approach across the EU, involving authorities, market participants, financial market infrastructures and investors, is desirable. The key elements of the new governance model include:</p>
<ul>
<li>An&nbsp;<span>Industry Committee</span>, composed of senior leaders and representatives from market players. The Committee will be chaired by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/european-securities-and-markets-authority-esma_industry-representatives-active-in-the-activity-7274465953424236547-YMBD?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">Giovanni Sabatini</a>.&nbsp;Giovanni has a long-standing experience working in securities markets both in the private and public sector. He has served as a member of the European Economic and Social Committee and held roles within IOSCO, EBF and ECSDA.</li>
<li>Several&nbsp;<span>technical workstreams</span>, operating under the Industry Committee, focusing on the technological operational adaptations needed in the areas concerned by the transition to T+1 (i.e. trading, matching, clearing, settlement, securities financing, funding and FX, asset management, corporate events, settlement efficiency). In addition, two more general workstreams will review the scope and the legal and regulatory aspects of these adaptations.</li>
<li>A&nbsp;<span>Coordination Committee</span>, chaired by ESMA and with representation from the EC, the ECB, ESMA and the chair of the Industry Committee. This committee will ensure coordination between the authorities and the industry, advising on challenges that may arise during the transition.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text-align-justify">Shortening the trade settlement cycle from the current T+2 framework to one business day should enable faster execution, clearing, and settlement of securities transactions, as well as international alignment, benefiting the entire EU financial ecosystem.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">The Commission is currently considering the merits of a legislative change mandating a potential transition to a shorter settlement cycle.</p>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Next Steps</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify">ESMA has recommended 11 October of 2027 as the optimal date for the transition to T+1 in the EU. In its Report ESMA concluded that the transition to T+1 should be implemented in phases, with key milestones including technology upgrades, stakeholder engagement and regulatory alignment. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">Further details regarding the governance set-up and participating organisations will be published in the coming days.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">Industry representatives interested in contributing to the upcoming work are advised to contact the T+1 Industry Secretariat&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/esmas-activities/markets-and-infrastructure/shortening-settlement-cycle-t1-eu#IndustryCommittee">here</a>.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">The first meeting of the Coordination Committee will take place on 6 February.</p>

<title>UAE Securities And Commodities Authority  Invites Feedback On Draft Regulations For Security Tokens And Commodity Tokens</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uae-securities-and-commodities-authority-invites-feedback-on-draft-regulations/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uae-securities-and-commodities-authority-invites-feedback-on-draft-regulations/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p dir="ltr">As part of its leading role in regulating and advancing the UAE&rsquo;s capital markets&mdash;and in keeping with its established practice of seeking input from financial industry partners before finalizing new regulations&mdash;the Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA) has published a draft regulation on security tokens and commodity tokens on its website,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sca.gov.ae/en/home.aspx">www.sca.gov.ae</a>. It invites stakeholders, experts, and relevant parties to provide their input and insights, which will be carefully considered when shaping the final version of the regulation. To access the draft regulation,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sca.gov.ae/assets/f7fc7dcd/regulations-drafts-en-2025.aspx">click here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">This draft regulation is the first of its kind in the UAE&rsquo;s capital markets, marking a significant milestone in the issuance and trading of security tokens and commodity tokens. By integrating traditional elements of securities and commodities and modern financial technologies, these tokens provide investors with more efficient and resilient investment tools.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The regulation comprises 18 articles that outline the scope of application, define security tokens and commodity tokens, and discuss the implications of issuing such tokens.

<title>FSB Finds That The G20 Financial Regulatory Reforms Have Enhanced The Resilience Of Securitisation Market</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em><span>Minimum risk retention and higher prudential requirements have contributed to the resilience of the residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) and collateralised loan obligation (CLO) securitisation markets, without strong evidence of material negative side-effects on financing to the economy.</span></em></li>
<li><span>Report notes recent growth in CLOs and warns that the post-GFC securitisation market has not yet been tested through a full credit cycle.</span></li>
<li><span>The evaluation identifies issues for consideration by national authorities and international bodies, such as the need to monitor risks from recent market developments and the role of risk retention and third-party financing for CLOs.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) today published the final report of its&nbsp;<a class="status-publish" href="https://www.fsb.org/2025/01/evaluation-of-the-effects-of-the-g20-financial-regulatory-reforms-on-securitisation-final-report/">Evaluation of the Effects of the G20 Financial Regulatory Reforms on Securitisation</a>.&nbsp;<a>The&nbsp;</a>report focuses on the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) minimum retention recommendations and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) revisions to prudential requirements for bank securitisation-related exposures in RMBS and CLO markets.</p>
<p>The evaluation finds that these reforms, introduced in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis (GFC), have contributed to the resilience of the securitisation market without strong evidence of material negative side-effects on financing to the economy. Complex structures that contributed to the GFC &ndash; including securitisations of subprime assets, collateralised debt obligations and re-securitisations &ndash; have declined significantly, while the securitisation market is more transparent. However, the market has not yet been tested through a full credit cycle to fully confirm the evidence on enhanced resilience. This is particularly relevant for CLOs that have grown significantly in recent years but have not yet experienced a prolonged downturn.</p>
<p>The reforms appear to have contributed to a redistribution of risk from banks to the non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) sector, with banks shifting towards higher-rated tranches. This redistribution of risk has been driven both by an increase in non-bank financing of the economy and by the growth of non-bank investors in securitisations. Risk transfer for investors is more evident in the CLO than the RMBS market. The financial stability impact of this trend is difficult to assess since it is not always clear if the non-bank entities taking on the risks are well-placed to assume them given their funding structure and ability to withstand losses in stress events.</p>
<p>The report highlights key issues for national authorities and international bodies to consider:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>the need to monitor risks in securitisation markets in light of developments such as the growth of synthetic risk transfers and private credit in securitisation structures;</li>
<li>the effectiveness of risk retention requirements for risk alignment in CLOs, given the fact that a large part of the global CLO market does not currently operate under such requirements and given the use of third-party risk financing for CLO structures; and</li>
<li>differences in reform implementation across FSB member jurisdictions, whose impact needs to be considered as authorities explore opportunities for framework adjustments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Benjamin Weigert, Director General for Financial Stability at the Deutsche Bundesbank and Chair of the FSB group that carried out the evaluation, said &ldquo;The evaluation highlights the importance of the G20 reforms in enhancing securitisation market resilience. Nonetheless, recent market developments reinforce the need for authorities to monitor risks and to ensure the alignment of incentives between securitisation originators, sponsors and investors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ryozo Himino, Deputy Governor at the Bank of Japan and Chair of the Standing Committee on Standards Implementation that oversaw the preparation of the report, said &ldquo;Evaluations are a core part of the FSB&rsquo;s mandate, as they help us to assess whether agreed reforms are achieving their intended outcomes and identify any material unintended consequences that may have to be addressed. This was the FSB&rsquo;s first streamlined evaluation, focusing on the most relevant securitisation reforms and market segments from a financial stability perspective.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h2>
<p>The evaluation assesses the extent to which the BCBS and IOSCO securitisation reforms have achieved their financial stability goals by reducing misaligned incentives and moral hazard. It also examines the broader effects of the reforms on the functioning and structure of securitisation markets and the financing of the real economy. It draws on a broad range of information sources and analytical approaches, including responses to a questionnaire by FSB member jurisdictions; input from stakeholders; a literature review; dialogue with academics; and various quantitative indicators and analyses on the effects of reforms using different datasets. These sources, taken together, form the basis for the conclusions in the report.</p>
<p>This final report reflects feedback received on a&nbsp;<a class="status-publish" href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/07/evaluation-of-the-effects-of-the-g20-financial-regulatory-reforms-on-securitisation-consultation-report/">consultative version of the report</a>, which the FSB published in July 2024. An&nbsp;<a class="status-publish" href="https://www.fsb.org/2025/01/evaluation-of-the-effects-of-securitisation-reforms-overview-of-the-responses-to-the-consultation/">overview of responses to the FSB&rsquo;s public consultation</a>&nbsp;was also published today.</p>
<p>The evaluation was undertaken using the FSB&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a class="status-publish" href="https://www.fsb.org/2017/07/framework-for-post-implementation-evaluation-of-the-effects-of-the-g20-financial-regulatory-reforms/">framework for the post-implementation evaluation of the effects of the G20 financial regulatory reforms</a>. This is the fifth evaluation under the FSB framework. All completed evaluations are published on the&nbsp;<a class="status-publish" href="https://www.fsb.org/work-of-the-fsb/">FSB website</a>.</p>
<p>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. The FSB also conducts outreach with approximately 70 other jurisdictions through its six Regional Consultative Groups.</p>
<p>The FSB is chaired by Klaas Knot, President of De Nederlandsche Bank. The FSB Secretariat is located in Basel, Switzerland and hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>

<p><strong>Recently, income-generating strategies like dividend investing has risen to popularity again for its stability and lower volatility. This strategy typically includes investing in companies with consistent dividend payouts which help to safeguard investors&rsquo; purchasing power over time, and they tend to weather economic downturns more effectively due to their robust financial foundations. Moreover, a regular income stream can be important to various kinds of investors, for example when planning for liquidity requirements during retirement. These factors highlight the potential of dividend stocks, positioning them as attractive opportunities for long-term investments.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.solactive.com/indices/?index=DE000SL0NS72">Solactive U.S. Dividend 30 Index</a>&nbsp;comprises the top 30 U.S. listed stocks with a consistent track record of dividend growth, payouts, and superior quality characteristics &ndash; such as strong profitability and low leverage. The selection process includes the application of minimum tradability filters, exclusion of REITs, and requirement of at least 10 consecutive years of dividend payments. Several quality factors, including cash flow to debt, return on equity (ROE), indicated dividend yield, and dividend payment growth, are employed to construct a final composite score to rank securities. The 30 securities with the highest final scores are selected and weighted by Free Float Market Capitalization, with sector weights capped at 35% and individual security weights limited to 5%.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The ETF is listed on 21<span>st</span>&nbsp;Jan on the Korean Stock Exchange with the ticker code &ldquo;0004G0.KS&rdquo;.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Timo Pfeiffer, Chief Markets Officer at Solactive, commented</span>:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;</em><em>We are very pleased to announce the first collaboration with Hana on the back of the Solactive U.S. Dividend 30 Index.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>DIFC Academy, the education platform of Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), the leading global financial hub in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia (MEASA) region, has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Lloyd&rsquo;s, the world&rsquo;s leading insurance market providing specialist insurance services to businesses in over 200 countries and territories.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paving the way to develop future talent within the insurance and reinsurance market, the agreement builds on a longstanding partnership. It will expand the Lloyd&rsquo;s Academy&rsquo;s reach, an education platform for risk professionals developed from London, to help support the development of a talent pipeline into the fast-growing Middle East region.</p>
<p>As part of the agreement, the DIFC Academy and Lloyd&rsquo;s Academy will work together to organise a series of events, educational bootcamps and on-demand learning that support the drive for talent across the insurance industry.</p>
<p>From a global perspective, the insurance sector has a significant opportunity with respect to talent development. The DIFC remains an ecosystem that fosters talent in the (re)insurance industry by providing learning and mentorship opportunities through the DIFC Academy, and developing a robust insurance community through non-profit organisations such as the DIFC Insurance Association.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Alya AlZarouni, Chief Operating Officer, DIFC Authority</span>&nbsp;commented: &ldquo;DIFC offers a world-class learning environment and guidance from renowned organisations to accelerate development of talent within the sector. We continue this legacy by expanding our existing relationship with Lloyd&rsquo;s. This initiative enables us to further develop a burgeoning sector in DIFC, representing more than 125 companies. Together, we foster industry growth while shaping the future of finance.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Dawn Miller, Lloyd&rsquo;s Chief Commercial Officer and CEO of Lloyd&rsquo;s Americas</span>, said: &ldquo;Collaboration and partnerships lay at the heart of Lloyd&rsquo;s value proposition, and our market has stood the test of time because of the talented individuals and firms that continue to participate. The MOU between the Lloyd&rsquo;s Academy and DIFC, to drive forward talent development and industry wide education is another step forward on this journey.&nbsp; I look forward to our continued work in the Middle East, and helping the development of a talent pipeline into the fast-growing region.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 2019, DIFC signed an MoU with Lloyd&rsquo;s to fuel the region&rsquo;s insurance sector by upskilling talent, as well as promoting sectoral efficiency and improvement.</p>
<p>DIFC Academy has catered to the learning needs of the financial services industry by providing an accessible platform for top-ranked educational institutes. To date, DIFC Academy has delivered professional development certifications and higher education courses for 32,000 graduates since inception.</p>

<title>Nasdaq Report Identifies Between $25 Billion And $50 Billion In Potential Efficiency Gains In Banks' Risk And Compliance Functions - The Savings, Which Would Come At Greater Or Equal Effectiveness, Could Generate Up To $1 Trillion In Additional Lending Capacity</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Between&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$25 billion</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$50 billion</span>&nbsp;in potential efficiency gains can be realized through targeted enhancements in banks' Risk and Compliance functions alone without compromising effectiveness, according to a report released by&nbsp;<span class="xn-org">Nasdaq</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span class="xn-org">Boston Consulting Group (BCG)</span>. The report, titled&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ty8-uDPbyIiQZnqRTKlrAykpTiBt8HWFF3ajnbcT5fL_qOk5vIa59t7FYe7-repZKOKcFVCrY-hPrSI094XycBuYOXjkluSErudhrLh2TCKThVQgwVLPiLbvBCKnxj5LEo3_1l0AFSpUaylxX3TS0ZtcjmkmUkUSaEh3qJuLuARgXnwb0CgMNAhBgmGfLhS32NxfWVnNSlq3kRYYtKY0Gg==" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">&ldquo;The New Growth Imperative: Cutting through Complexity in the Financial System&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;reviews the interconnected challenge of complexity and complicatedness and finds that while external complexity continues to increase, excess layers of internal complicatedness have accumulated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Financial institutions are particularly exposed to the exponential growth in complexity across the global economy, from the evolution of technology paradigms to the expectation of real-time finance and the explosion of data. What&rsquo;s more, regulators have put banks on the front line in the fight against financial crime and cyber-attacks,&rdquo; said Nasdaq Chair and CEO&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Adena Friedman</span>. &ldquo;The good news is that as both external complexity and internal complicatedness have grown, so have the solutions to help manage them. By leveraging modern technology and embracing a systems-based approach, we can unlock significant efficiencies and foster a more resilient and innovative ecosystem towards the dual goal of resilience&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;growth. At a time where the demand for long-term capital is exploding and political mandates are geared toward change, this report provides novel perspectives on how we can better tackle complexity without adding to the mounting body of complicatedness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are at an inflection point. The dramatic increase in complexity in business operating environments, furthered by advances in technology over the past decade, is adding cost and friction to our financial system,&rdquo; said BCG CEO&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Christoph Schweizer</span>. &ldquo;Our research highlights significant opportunities for efficiency gains with equal or greater effectiveness and improved performance outcomes that could unlock up to&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$1 trillion</span>&nbsp;of lending capacity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereas complexity can be viewed as external factors beyond the control of individual organizations, complicatedness arises from how organizations respond, and the mechanisms created to adapt to that complexity. Nasdaq&rsquo;s analysis suggests that by reducing complicatedness in processes across bank Risk &amp; Compliance functions, significant resources can be released and deployed towards critical investment areas such as the digitization of the global economy, the modernization of our energy systems, and the need for next-generation power solutions to enable the artificial intelligence revolution.</p>
<p>In addition, the report finds that financial institutions are turning toward strategic technology partners that offer holistic best-in-class solutions to their biggest risk and compliance challenges as a means of addressing the exponential increase in complexity. Only 22% of industry professionals have a preference to build software solutions in house, indicating that industry recognizes the value of systems-based solutions from trusted partners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most effective solutions will require a comprehensive recalibration of people, processes, and systems,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Tal Cohen</span>, President of Nasdaq. &ldquo;By shifting from lengthy manual processes to systems-based and people-led processes, human capital can be unlocked to focus on decision-making, risk management, oversight, analysis, and innovation. Getting this right can unlock significant value through efficiency gains. But that only tells part of the story. The transformative potential of AI will redefine every industry - including the financial industry - in the years ahead. The very same solutions that sit at the core of the complicatedness challenge, will serve as the foundation for success in tomorrow&rsquo;s AI-enabled world. As such, effectively addressing these issues today could protect and reinforce competitiveness well into the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The report also provides a call to action to bank leaders to amplify the talent of their teams by shifting from a people-based to a people-led approach, where systems serve as the base of unleashing human potential, reducing rote processes and procedures and leveraging the scale of software platforms to achieve the same level of effectiveness with significantly enhanced efficiency. This call also includes encouraging all stakeholders in the ecosystem, including regulators, to embrace new ways of working and to better embrace the capabilities of modern technology.</p>
<p><span>Additional Insights from the Report:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Increasing Complexity in Financial Institutions:</span> 
<ul type="circle">
<li>Research revealed that throughout just over a half-century, while external complexity had increased more than 6-fold, organizational complicatedness in response had increased more than 35-fold.</li>
<li>The complexity of the operating environment within the global financial system has increased 2x-3x over the past decade, driven by external factors such as increased regulations and an interconnected global financial system.</li>
<li>The number of new regulations per year are now more than 6x what they were during the Global Financial Crisis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>Cost of Complexity:</span> 
<ul type="circle">
<li>Despite significant investments in the digitization of the financial system &ndash; i.e.&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$800 billion</span>&nbsp;in annual tech investments, 30% decrease in bank branches in the&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">U.S.</span>&nbsp;alone &ndash; overall operating costs for banks have not meaningfully declined or improved.</li>
<li>In addition, significant costs continue to be associated with non-compliance for banks with nearly&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$250 billion</span>&nbsp;spent on regulatory fines &ndash; this number excludes the financial impact of financial crime and related costs to the financial system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>The Time is Now, and the Opportunity is Significant:</span> 
<ul type="circle">
<li>Bank executives see significant opportunities for efficiency gains and improved outcomes from modernization solutions. This could result in annual savings of&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$25 billion</span>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$50 billion</span>&nbsp;in Risk &amp; Compliance operating expenditures, unlocking up to&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$1 trillion</span>&nbsp;in lending capacity.</li>
<li>This is particularly powerful given the&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$80 trillion</span>&nbsp;required over the next few decades to support major transformation themes across the global economy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>Transformation Through Technology:</span> 
<ul type="circle">
<li>The financial system is now at a point where this transformation is technologically and culturally possible, with increased comfort in leveraging cloud-based solutions.</li>
<li>For example, the level of comfort to leverage and deploy cloud-based solutions across the industry has increased from 11% in 2014 to 93% in 2024.</li>
<li>Today, bank leaders cite comfort in AI similar to that of cloud five years ago &ndash; paving a runway for similar comfort in AI to build over the next five years.</li>
<li>Additionally, only 22% of respondents have a preference to build software solutions in house, indicating that industry is looking for systems-base solutions from trusted partners.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<title>Tokyo Stock Exchange: Results Of The English Disclosure Implementation Status Survey As Of The End Of December 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div>
<p class="component-text">Tokyo Stock Exchange, Inc. (TSE) has promoted English disclosure by listed companies in order to enhance convenience for overseas investors and enable them to make appropriate investment decisions based on the disclosed information. As part of this effort, since 2019, TSE has been conducting surveys on the English disclosure implementation status of listed companies and providing a list of the results on its website to a wide range of people including overseas investors.<br /><br />TSE has now published the results for the survey as of the end of December 2024.<br /><br />The English disclosure rate of Prime-listed companies was 99.0% (up 0.8% year-on-year). By type of document, the English disclosure rates of Prime-listed companies rose to 93.8% (up 2.1% year-on-year) for earnings reports, 76.4% (up 5.0% year-on-year) for IR presentations, and 59.2% (up 7.1% year-on-year) for timely disclosure documents.<br /><br />In April 2025, it will become mandatory for companies listed on the Prime Market to disclose financial results and timely disclosure information simultaneously in Japanese and English. Although some companies have made efforts in this regard, there are still a considerable number of them that need to take further action, such as ensuring that the timing of English-language disclosure is the same as that of Japanese-language disclosure.<br /><br />The Prime Market is positioned as a market for companies that place a high value on constructive dialogue with global investors. Given that English-language disclosure is the basis for dialogue with global investors and investment decisions, it is expected that companies will take proactive measures to improve the scope and content of English-language disclosure and the timing of disclosure, rather than simply complying with the new disclosure requirements.</p>

<p>The Nigerian Exchange&rsquo;s (NGX) e-offering platform, NGX Invest, continues to revolutionize capital-raising in Nigeria with the addition of Stanbic IBTC Holdings Plc&rsquo;s N148.7 billion rights issue. Presented at the Facts Behind the Rights Issue event, the Rights Issue, which has been open since January 15 and will close on February 21, 2025, highlights the growing adoption of NGX Invest, a platform designed to streamline capital raising and enhance investor participation.</p>
<p>The rights issue allows existing shareholders to subscribe to 2,944,772,083 ordinary shares of 50 kobo each at N50.50 per share, structured as five (5) new shares for every twenty-two (22) ordinary shares held as of October 29, 2024.

<title>Circle Announces Acquisition Of Hashnote And USYC Tokenized Money Market Fund Alongside Strategic Partnership With Global Trading Firm DRW</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li><i>Strategic acquisition accelerates Circle&rsquo;s product offerings and competitive position in digital asset capital markets; as the largest Tokenized Money Market Fund (TMMF) in the world, US Yield Coin (USYC) will play a critical role as collateral in digital asset markets; DRW partnership via Cumberland brings one of the largest liquidity providers in the world to support USDC and USYC adoption.</i></li>
<li><i>Circle also announces planned native USDC support on Canton Network, enabling private transactions and the use of USDC and USYC in TradFi markets.</i></li>
</ul>
<p class="bwalignl"><span>Today,<span>&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcircle.com&amp;esheet=54184391&amp;newsitemid=20250121703032&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Circle+Internet+Group%2C+Inc.&amp;index=1&amp;md5=6778efbbfff6ffdd642b924ed09ff0ce" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>Circle Internet Group, Inc.</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span>a global financial technology company and stablecoin market leader, announced its acquisition of Hashnote &ndash; the issuer of USYC incubated by Cumberland Labs &ndash; which according to 3rd-party analysts RWA.xyz is the largest tokenized treasury and money market fund in the world, with<span>&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.rwa.xyz%2Ftreasuries&amp;esheet=54184391&amp;newsitemid=20250121703032&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=%241.52B&amp;index=2&amp;md5=956d07f2e9e10b38d99c53ec0963310c" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>$1.52B</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span>deployed into USYC as of January 15, 2025.</span></p>
<p><span>Circle intends to fully integrate USYC with USDC, offering seamless access between TMMF collateral and USDC, one of the world&rsquo;s most popular stablecoins. This will enable USYC to emerge as a preferred form of yield-bearing collateral on crypto exchanges, and also with custodians and prime brokers.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;The integration of USYC and Hashnote into Circle&rsquo;s platform marks a major moment in the evolution of the stablecoin market, as cash and yield-bearing short-duration treasury bill assets become fungible and convertible at the speed of blockchains and crypto capital markets. This is a huge unlock for a market that is increasingly being driven by institutional adoption, and where participants increasingly expect market structures that are common in TradFi,&rdquo;&nbsp;<b>said<span>&nbsp;</span>Jeremy Allaire, CEO and Chairman of Circle</b>. &ldquo;We helped invent tokenized cash, and are now leading the way in tokenized money markets, both of which we believe will become essential to the future of the global financial system. Circle&rsquo;s acquisition of Hashnote and our strategic partnership with DRW-affiliate Cumberland are crucial to driving and delivering these products at scale.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Hashnote&rsquo;s beginnings are rooted in recognizing the pivotal role blockchain-based transparency and settlement would play in future financial transactions,&rdquo;&nbsp;<b>said<span>&nbsp;</span>Leo Mizuhara, CEO and Founder of Hashnote.<span>&nbsp;</span></b>&ldquo;Joining Circle increases our ability to rapidly scale adoption by pairing USDC, a widely-used, liquid payment and trading stablecoin, with USYC, a safe, Tokenized Money Market Fund for yield-bearing collateral.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>The deal is bolstered by a strategic partnership with DRW, one of the largest institutional crypto traders via its subsidiary Cumberland. As marquee products for its trading operation, Cumberland will expand its institutional-grade liquidity and settlement capabilities in USDC and USYC, where permitted. Cumberland&rsquo;s expertise and own use cases will help drive innovation in the use of these products for more efficient and seamless collateral management.</span></p>
<p><span>USYC is already supported by many major digital asset trading firms and derivatives exchanges.</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally, alongside these strategic deals, Circle is also announcing its planned deployment of native USDC on Canton, the leading public blockchain for fully private and secure financial applications. With over $3.6 trillion in RWA issued and over $1.5 trillion repo/month, Canton is already used and supported by major traditional banks, trading firms, asset managers and exchanges. With USYC already supported on Canton, offering native USDC integration will enable a seamless and 24/7/365 convertibility between collateral and cash for use in TradFi markets onchain.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;For over a decade I have championed the opportunity for traditional finance to be made more efficient and resilient by leveraging public blockchains," said<span>&nbsp;</span>Don Wilson, CEO and Founder of DRW, a trading firm active in both traditional finance and cryptoassets. "I am excited to partner with Circle in its quest to make this a reality. By utilizing the Canton blockchain, which offers configurable privacy, for USDC, and acquiring Hashnote, which issues USYC, Circle unites the key elements necessary to enable 24/7 collateral and variation margin movement across both crypto and traditional markets."</span></p>

<title>EBA Publishes An Opinion On The Interaction Between The Output Floor And Pillar 2 Requirements</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/eba-publishes-an-opinion-on-the-interaction-between-the-output-floor-and-pillar/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published an Opinion on the interaction between the output floor and Pillar 2 Requirements (P2R) in the context of the mandate set forth in the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD). The Opinion considers that the nominal amount of P2R is not to increase as a result of an institution becoming bound by the output floor and highlights the possibility of double counting in setting the P2R of risks already covered by the effects of a binding output floor.</span></p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s Opinion describes how P2R&nbsp; is to be calculated temporarily based on the unfloored, instead of floored, total risk exposure amount (TREA) when an institution first becomes bound by the output floor, applying the P2R percentage previously&nbsp;communicated following the last supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP) cycle.&nbsp; The Opinion emphasises the importance of institutions informing early their competent authority of the potential impact so as to facilitate the review process.</p>
<p>The EBA expects competent authorities in their review on double counting of risks to only consider offsets regarding P2R add-ons in relation to &ldquo;regulatory model deficiencies&rdquo;. Furthermore, the EBA advises competent authorities using a methodology that calculates P2R amount based on a multiplication by TREA, to consider how they could ward off undue arithmetic effects from the output floor in the review on double counting.</p>
<p>The Opinion will be considered in the forthcoming comprehensive review of the EBA Guidelines on the SREP. Generally, and in line with what was highlighted in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-reflects-eu-stacking-orders-and-provides-insight-eu-institutions-management-buffers">July 2024 Report on the stacking order and capital buffers</a>, the EBA&rsquo;s efforts will continue to focus on clarifying, where necessary, the interactions of the different stacks, as well as interactions between P2R and the evolution of TREA in a wider manner.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<p>As per article 104a(7)&nbsp;of Directive 2013/36/EU, the EBA is mandated to issue guidelines to further specify how to operationalise, in particular, the following aspects: how competent authorities are to reflect in their supervisory review and evaluation process the fact that an institution has become bound by the output floor; how competent authorities and institutions are to communicate and disclose the impact on supervisory requirements of an institution becoming bound by the output floor, as per paragraph 6 of the same article. The EBA&rsquo;s competence to deliver this Opinion is based on Article 29(1)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 and the Opinion is without prejudice to the aforementioned mandate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<title>SEC Crypto 2.0: Acting Chairman Uyeda Announces Formation Of New Crypto Task Force - Commissioner Hester Peirce Will Lead Agency-Wide Effort</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-crypto-20-acting-chairman-uyeda-announces-formation-of-new-crypto-task-for/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-crypto-20-acting-chairman-uyeda-announces-formation-of-new-crypto-task-for/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="paragraph">Today SEC Acting Chairman Mark T. Uyeda launched a crypto task force dedicated to developing a comprehensive and clear regulatory framework for crypto assets. Commissioner Hester Peirce will lead the task force. Richard Gabbert, Senior Advisor to the Acting Chairman, and Taylor Asher, Senior Policy Advisor to the Acting Chairman, will serve as the task force&rsquo;s Chief of Staff and Chief Policy Advisor, respectively.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Drawing from talented staff across the agency, the Task Force will collaborate with Commission staff and the public to set the SEC on a sensible regulatory path that respects the bounds of the law. To date, the SEC has relied primarily on enforcement actions to regulate crypto retroactively and reactively, often adopting novel and untested legal interpretations along the way. Clarity regarding who must register, and practical solutions for those seeking to register, have been elusive. The result has been confusion about what is legal, which creates an environment hostile to innovation and conducive to fraud. The SEC can do better.</p>
<p class="paragraph">The Task Force&rsquo;s focus will be to help the Commission draw clear regulatory lines, provide realistic paths to registration, craft sensible disclosure frameworks, and deploy enforcement resources judiciously.</p>
<p class="paragraph">The Task Force will operate within the statutory framework provided by Congress and will coordinate the provision of technical assistance to Congress as it makes changes to that framework. The Task Force will coordinate with federal departments and agencies, including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and state and international counterparts.</p>
<p class="paragraph">&ldquo;I look forward to the efforts of Commissioner Peirce to lead regulatory policy on crypto, which involves multiple SEC divisions and offices,&rdquo; said Acting Chairman Uyeda.</p>
<p class="paragraph">&ldquo;This undertaking will take time, patience, and much hard work. It will succeed only if the Task Force has input from a wide range of investors, industry participants, academics, and other interested parties. We look forward to working hand-in-hand with the public to foster a regulatory environment that protects investors, facilitates capital formation, fosters market integrity, and supports innovation,&rdquo; stated Commissioner Peirce.</p>
<p class="paragraph">The Task Force anticipates holding roundtables in the future, but in the meantime welcomes public input at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:Crypto@sec.gov" target="_blank">Crypto@sec.gov</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that President Donald J. Trump has designated Mark T. Uyeda as Acting Chairman of the agency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am honored to serve in this capacity after serving as a Commissioner since 2022, and a member of the staff since 2006,&rdquo; Acting Chairman Uyeda said. &ldquo;I have great respect for the knowledge, expertise, and experience of the agency and its people. The SEC has a vital mission&mdash;protecting investors, maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitating capital formation&mdash;that plays a key role in promoting innovation, jobs creation, and the American Dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Acting Chairman Uyeda was first sworn into office as a Commissioner on June 30, 2022, after being confirmed by the U.S. Senate. He was subsequently re-nominated and confirmed for a five-year term expiring in 2028. During President Trump&rsquo;s first term, he served on detail to senior leadership at the U.S. Department of the Treasury and to Secretary Eugene Scalia at the U.S. Department of Labor. He has also served on detail to the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. At the SEC, he has served as Senior Advisor to Chairman Jay Clayton, Counsel to Commissioners Michael S. Piwowar and Paul S. Atkins, and Assistant Director and Senior Special Counsel in the Division of Investment Management.</p>
<p>Before joining the SEC, Acting Chairman Uyeda was appointed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to serve as the Chief Advisor to the California Corporations Commissioner, the state&rsquo;s securities regulator. Earlier in his career, he worked as a corporate and securities attorney at Kirkpatrick &amp; Lockhart in Washington, D.C., and O&rsquo;Melveny &amp; Myers in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Originally from Orange County, California, Acting Chairman Uyeda earned his bachelor's degree in business administration from Georgetown University in 1992 and his law degree with honors from Duke University in 1995, where he was a member of the Duke Law Journal. He is a past president of the Asian Pacific Bar Association of the Greater Washington, D.C. Area and a 2023 recipient of the Daniel K. Inouye Trailblazer Award from the National Asian Pacific American Bar Association.</p>

<div class="bw-subheadline-wrapper">
<ul>
<li><i>Facilitates Passive Investment in New Listings on NYSE Exchanges</i></li>
<li><i style="font-family: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">Includes 81 listings during the previous three years</i></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced the launch of the NYSE&reg; IPO Index (NYSEIPO), a new equal-weighted index to track the performance of companies listed on the NYSE Group&rsquo;s exchanges that have been spun off, directly listed, uplisted from OTC or ex-U.S. markets or completed initial public offerings (IPOs) during the last three years.</p>
<p>"This new index facilitates investment in the performance of NYSE-listed companies shortly after their arrival to the market. It combines the power of the NYSE and the quality of companies that choose to list here with ICE&rsquo;s robust index business,&rdquo; said Lynn Martin, President of NYSE Group. &ldquo;The NYSE continues to be the premier venue for companies seeking access to capital markets, with companies choosing the NYSE historically outperforming companies debuting on other exchanges in the weeks, months and years following their listing day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ICE provides a broad range of indices across asset classes, with approximately $2 trillion in assets under management benchmarked to ICE Indices. Using ICE&rsquo;s index expertise, the NYSE&reg; IPO Index will highlight the NYSE&rsquo;s community of listed companies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The index and methodology offer investors a unique benchmark for the market performance of companies newly listed on the NYSE,&rdquo; said Preston Peacock, Head of ICE Data Indices. &ldquo;It leverages our extensive experience of bringing new indices to market, including the initial idea through to launching the index, and in many cases working with partners on the issuance of an ETF.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The NYSE&reg; IPO Index is an equally-weighted index designed to track the performance of IPOs and other newly-listed companies with a minimum market cap of $200 million that listed in the last three years. The index includes direct listings, spin-offs and transfers from ex-U.S. exchanges or OTC markets, but excludes SPACs and post-SPAC operating companies.</p>
<p>For more information about the NYSE&reg; IPO Index, please visit&nbsp;<a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Findices.ice.com%2F&amp;esheet=54183685&amp;newsitemid=20250121449363&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=indices.ice.com&amp;index=1&amp;md5=bb2a34f678560832553f4e8de694c0d1" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">indices.ice.com</a>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.fasanara.com/">Fasanara Capital Ltd</a>&nbsp;(&ldquo;Fasanara&rdquo;), a London-based institutional investment manager and global leader in digital finance with over $4 billion in assets under management, has launched its first tokenized Money Market Fund, the &ldquo;Fasanara MMF Token&rdquo; (&ldquo;FAST&rdquo;), held on the&nbsp;<a href="https://polygon.technology/">Polygon</a>&nbsp;PoS (Proof of Stake) public blockchain. Developed in collaboration with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apexgroup.com/">Apex Group</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://chain.link/">Chainlink</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fireblocks.com/">Fireblocks</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.xbto.com/">XBTO</a>, FAST offers investors a faster, more cost-effective, and transparent way to access money market investments.</p>
<p>FAST integrates the stability of traditional money market investments with the operational efficiency of blockchain technology. By leveraging Polygon&rsquo;s scalable infrastructure, FAST enables real-time settlement and open distribution, eliminating manual processes and broadening investor access. This digital approach streamlines subscriptions, redemptions, and ongoing fund management, providing investors with a seamless investment experience.</p>
<div class="cl-review-quote-text"><q>With FAST, we are not only reshaping the future of money market investments but also redefining how investors engage with financial markets. By harnessing blockchain technology, we provide an innovative and compliant investment solution that enables seamless access to liquidity, real-time processing, and enhanced transparency &ndash; all while maintaining the rigor of traditional asset management practices.</q></div>

<div class="wpb_wrapper">
<p>The launch of Fasanara&rsquo;s first tokenized Money Market Fund represents a significant milestone for the firm, positioning it as a pioneer in technology-enabled investing. Through FAST, Fasanara is not only modernizing fund management but also setting a new benchmark for digital innovation in asset management. By tokenizing a stable asset class like a money market fund, Fasanara aims to redefine how investors engage with these investments, making them more accessible and adaptable to today&rsquo;s digital-first economy.</p>
<p>FAST is structured using ERC-3643 smart contracts, ensuring regulatory compliance and operational flexibility at the token level. Apex Group, the fund&rsquo;s administrator, uses Tokeny&rsquo;s blockchain-based platform for transfer agency management. Security is enhanced through Fireblocks&rsquo; key management and wallet infrastructure, safeguarding on-chain operations. To further enhance the transparency, utility, and liquidity of FAST, Fasanara will employ the Chainlink standard, including Proof of Reserve and Data Feeds to verify AUM and bring NAV data on-chain, and intends to leverage Chainlink&rsquo;s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to enhance connectivity and scalability across blockchain networks. To provide secure asset custody, XBTO&rsquo;s regulated custodial division, Stablehouse, will act as custodian.</p>
<p>This comprehensive, blockchain-native infrastructure is purpose-built to meet the evolving needs of modern investors who seek greater transparency, speed, and liquidity. By bridging traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi), FAST is part of Fasanara&rsquo;s strategic commitment to digital transformation in asset management, aligning with broader industry trends toward asset digitization.</p>

<title>EACHâs Women In Clearing Series â Inspiration With Laura Bayley, SIX x-clear AG, SIX Groupâs Swiss CCP</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/eachs-women-in-clearing-series-inspiration-with-laura-bayley-six-x-clear-ag/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/eachs-women-in-clearing-series-inspiration-with-laura-bayley-six-x-clear-ag/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Following the successful launch of the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12789353/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><b>Women in Clearing Network</b></a>,<b>&nbsp;</b>in March 2024 we launched&nbsp;<b>EACH&rsquo;s Women in Clearing Series</b>, an initiative with the objective of featuring a key female leader on a regular basis to inspire other professionals in the industry.</p>
<p>Laura Bayley is this month&rsquo;s contributor.&nbsp;Laura is the&nbsp;CEO of SIX x-clear AG, SIX Group&rsquo;s Swiss CCP. She leads on managing its various operational risks and day-to-day activities, while striving to foster organic growth and enhance the profitability of the wider business. Beyond being directly responsible for building and maintaining essential senior client relationships, she is a key spokesperson for SIX Group and a prominent thought leader in the industry.</p>
<p>Laura also holds the title of Head Clearing Services within SIX group. In this capacity she is responsible for strategic, regulatory and governance topics across the whole clearing area, encompassing the two SIX CCPs, BME Clearing and SIX x-clear.</p>
<p>She also represents SIX x-clear on the EACH Board and is a Member of the Swift Board of Directors.</p>
<p>She joined SIX in 2016, making a name for herself in the projects team, where she helped deliver numerous successful regulatory projects in the post-trade space. Prior to this, Laura worked in a renowned Swiss law firm while attaining her law degree, as well as in international procurement for a global manufacturing company. She holds a double degree in Sinology and Law.</p>
<p>When not immersed in her work, Laura enjoys rediscovering the world with her two young sons, baking extravagant cakes, and throwing elaborate birthday parties.</p>
<p>Laura has volunteered to share with us her personal and professional journey by responding to three questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>What was the aspect of yourself that you had to work on the most to get where you are now?</b></li>
</ul>
<p>For me, it is impossible to point to any one aspect in isolation. My journey &ndash; and I hope I haven&rsquo;t reached the finish line yet &ndash; has been a continuous transformation, not just in a professional sense, but in my personal life too.</p>
<p>I realised quickly that the business world has little time for passivity. I had to become more assertive, address conflicts head-on. To say this was a challenge would be an understatement. It required me to step out of my comfort zone and communicate my needs and opinions more decisively, even at times sternly. While tough, this has been hugely rewarding and beneficial to my career. Assertiveness has allowed me to advocate for myself and my team, helping to ensure our contributions are recognized and valued. Tackling conflicts directly has also allowed me to nip issues in the bud long before they escalate into fully blown confrontations and disrupt the positive working environment. This aspect of my character I continue to refine, as it has proven an essential tenet of effective leadership and professional growth.</p>
<p>Meanwhile,<b>&nbsp;</b>on a personal level, I have had to learn to accept that not everything can be perfect all the time. It&rsquo;s about making wise sacrifices and picking your battles. For instance, the kids don&rsquo;t need a five-star home-cooked meal every night &ndash; let&rsquo;s be honest, pasta with Barilla tomato sauce is fine enough for your average Tuesday. This shift in mindset may seem subtle, but it has helped me curb stress and achieve balance, leading to a more relaxed and happy home life. And a happy home is essential to a productive office life.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>What key tip would you give for professionals to successfully develop in their careers?</b></li>
</ul>
<p>It may sound a tad trite, but my key tip for career development is to&nbsp;<b>never give up or say no to an opportunity</b>,&nbsp;<b>no matter how tall the hurdle may seem</b>.</p>
<p>Persistence is essential in overcoming obstacles and achieving long-term goals. Embrace challenges as learning experiences and remain open to new opportunities, even if they seem daunting at first. Each and every opportunity will bestow valuable new skills, knowledge, and connections that will undoubtedly prove indispensable down the line. By maintaining a positive attitude and a willingness to take risks, you will chart a career path that will surprise you when you look back, and &ndash; most importantly &ndash; excite you when you look forward.<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>How do you see the future of clearing in 10 years?</b></li>
</ul>
<p>I am always pleasantly surprised and encouraged by the number of women who have reached leadership positions across the clearing space, whether within CCPs, regulators, or when engaging with members. But we&rsquo;re not there yet &ndash; there&rsquo;s still a long road ahead.</p>
<p>Looking at my own team, it would be great to see further progress on our cultural, racial and religious diversity over the next decade. And we are not alone. This is a pressing issue faced across the entire financial industry, at least in Switzerland and Spain. I hope in 10 years&rsquo; time we will attract more women from a wider array of cultures and geographies into leadership roles within clearing, contributing to a more inclusive and diverse industry.</p>
<p>Looking beyond diversity, shortening settlement cycles look set to transform the space considerably over the coming decade. I anticipate the role of CCPs evolving to focus to a greater extent on enabling settlement efficiency, while the introduction of more asset classes in the clearing space promises to expand scope.</p>
<p>The consolidation trend witnessed among European CCPs should also continue to gather momentum over the next decade, as greater numbers merge to create multi-asset firms with much broader market reach. Ultimately, this should beckon in a new era for clearing &ndash; one characterised by enhanced efficiency and transformative innovation.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) today announces that Susi de Verdelon has been appointed CEO of LCH Limited. Susi will assume the role in February 2025, subject to regulatory non-objection, and will report to Daniel Maguire, Group Head, LSEG Markets and CEO of LCH Group. The appointment follows the decision of Isabelle Girolami to leave LCH Limited as CEO, having held the position since November 2019.</p>
<p>Susi joined LCH Limited in 2017 and is currently Group Head of LCH SwapClear and Listed Rates, where she is responsible for driving performance and growth and ensuring the continued resilience of the&nbsp;SwapClear&nbsp;and Listed Rates clearing services. Prior to LCH Limited, Susi held a number of Sales &amp; Strategy roles in the Securities Division as a Managing Director at Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p><span>Daniel Maguire, Group Head, LSEG Markets, and CEO of LCH Group said:&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m delighted that Susi will be assuming the role of CEO, LCH Limited. As Group Head of LCH SwapClear &amp; Listed Rates, she has driven growth and expansion into new markets, extended LCH Limited&rsquo;s position in the rates market during benchmark reform, and most recently re-launched the Listed Rates service. I look forward to continuing to work with Susi as we expand our multi-asset class offering and deliver new products and services.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Susi de Verdelon</span>&nbsp;<span>said:&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;I am excited by the opportunity to become the CEO of LCH Limited. This role has tremendous responsibility, and I am committed to driving forward our strategic vision, fostering a culture of excellence, and strengthening our position as a market leader in risk management. I look forward to working with the team to deliver more innovation and efficiencies to our customers, regulators, and the markets we serve.&rdquo;</p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority Issues Warning To Former FMC Auditor</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-issues-warning-to-former-fmc-auditor/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-issues-warning-to-former-fmc-auditor/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana TÄtai Hokohoko &ndash; has issued a public warning to Mr Allan Facey, a Sydney-based auditor, regarding his conduct as the Engagement Quality Control Reviewer (EQR) for the audit of Alliant Perpetual.</p>
<p>The FMA is satisfied that Mr Facey did not comply with two standard conditions of his New Zealand auditor&rsquo;s licence, which was issued by the FMA under the&nbsp;Auditor Regulation Act 2011&nbsp;pursuant to the&nbsp;Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition Act 1997.</p>
<p>The decision stems from the audit of former FMC reporting entity Alliant Perpetual&rsquo;s financial statements for the year ended 31 January 2022 (the audit). Mr Sam Danieli, a Sydney based auditor, conducted the audit and Mr Facey was the EQR.</p>
<p>The FMA is satisfied there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate that, at the time the auditor&rsquo;s report was dated, Mr Facey had performed an objective evaluation of the significant judgements made by the engagement team and the conclusions reached in formulating the auditor&rsquo;s report. Audit work recorded by Mr Facey five months after the auditor&rsquo;s report was dated did not assist in establishing compliance with auditing and assurance standards.</p>
<p>Mr Facey also failed to promptly notify the FMA after he became aware that an FMC audit engagement he worked on or reviewed had not been carried out in accordance with auditing and assurance standards. It would have been clear to Mr Facey when he received the dated auditor&rsquo;s report his Engagement Quality Control Review had not been completed and the requirements of ISA (NZ) 220 had not been met. He was also aware that insufficient audit work had been done by Mr Danieli in respect of the audit.</p>
<p>FMA Head of Auditing, Financial Reporting, and Climate Related Disclosures, Jacco Moison, said:&nbsp;&ldquo;The EQR role is important because it should ensure that an objective evaluation of the significant judgements made by the engagement team has been performed and the conclusions on these judgements are supported by sufficient audit evidence. Licensed auditors must promptly notify the FMA after they become aware that an audit engagement they have worked on or reviewed has not been carried out according to the auditing and assurance standards. Remaining silent harms the transparency of the market and the integrity of the auditing profession.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>The FMA cancelled Mr Facey&rsquo;s licence at his request prior to the FMA&rsquo;s decision to issue the warning.</li>
<li>Alliant Perpetual was a registered building society that was struck off the register in September 2023.</li>
<li>The FMA cancelled Mr Danieli&rsquo;s licence for multiple failures relating to the audit and ordered that he not reapply for an audit licence for FMC audits in New Zealand for three years.</li>
</ul>

<title>The EBA Launches Its 2025 EU-Wide Stress Test</title>

<ul>
<li><em>The 2025 EU-wide stress test will assess EU banks&rsquo; performance under a baseline and adverse scenario during a three-year time horizon, from 2025 to 2027.</em></li>
<li><em>The adverse scenario assumes a hypothetical aggravation of geopolitical tensions leading to a severe decline in GDP by 6.3% cumulatively. The adverse scenario is designed to ensure a significant severity</em>&nbsp;<em>of various macro-economic and financial shocks across all EU countries and depicts a breakdown of the shocks (on real gross value added) by economic sectors.</em></li>
<li><em>The exercise will be conducted on a sample of 64 banks, thus covering 75% of total banking assets in the EU and Norway.&nbsp;</em></li>
</ul>
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today launched its 2025 EU-wide stress test and released the macroeconomic scenarios. This year&rsquo;s exercise is designed to provide valuable input for assessing the resilience of the European banking sector in the current uncertain and changing macroeconomic environment. The adverse scenario is based on a narrative of hypothetical worsening of geopolitical tensions, with large, negative, and persistent trade and confidence shocks having strong adverse effects on private consumption and investments, both domestically and globally. The severe nature of the adverse scenario reflects the purpose of the stress test exercise, which is to assess the resilience of the European banking system to a hypothetical severely deteriorated macroeconomic environment. The EBA expects to publish the results of the exercise at the beginning of August 2025.</span></p>
<h6><span>Scope of the exercise</span></h6>
<p>The stress test assesses the solvency of EU banks in a hypothetical adverse macroeconomic scenario over a three-year horizon (2025-27). The objectives of the stress test are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>assess and compare the overall resilience of EU banks to relevant severe economic shocks;</li>
<li>assess if bank capital levels are sufficient to ensure banks can support the economy in periods of stress;</li>
<li>foster market discipline through transparent publication of consistent, granular and comparable data at a bank-by-bank level;</li>
<li>provide input to the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) conducted by competent supervisory authorities.</li>
</ul>
<p>The EU-wide stress test will be conducted on a sample of 64 banks &ndash; thereof 51 from countries which are members of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) &ndash; covering roughly 75% of total banking sector assets in the EU and Norway.</p>
<h6><span>Key elements of the scenarios</span></h6>
<p>The adverse scenario is designed to ensure a significant severity of various macro-economic and financial shocks across all EU countries. It is based on a hypothetical severe escalation of geopolitical tensions, accompanied by increasingly inward-looking trade policies globally, that cause an increase in energy and commodity prices, disruptions in the supply chain and adverse effects on private consumption and investment coupled with a worldwide economic contraction.</p>
<p>The worsening of economic prospects is associated with a sustained drop in EU GDP by 6.3% cumulatively, in the period 2025-2027. At the end of the horizon, unemployment in the EU is projected to be 6.1&nbsp;percentage points (ppts) above its baseline level. Inflation shifts upwards to 5.0% and 3.5% respectively in 2025 and 2026, before falling back to 1.9% in 2027.</p>
<p>As in the 2023 EU-wide stress test, this year&rsquo;s scenario includes information on the growth of Gross Value Added (GVA) in 16 sectors of economic activity. Such break-down will help better assess EU banks&rsquo; performance depending on their business model and sectoral exposures.</p>
<h4>Background</h4>
<ol>
<li>The exercise will be run at the highest level of consolidation. The scope of consolidation is the perimeter of the banking group as defined by the Capital Requirements Regulation/Capital Requirements Directive (CRR/CRD). This exercise will involve close cooperation between the EBA and the competent authorities (including the Single Supervisory Mechanism - SSM, the European Central Bank &ndash; ECB, and the European Systemic Risk Board - ESRB).</li>
<li>The convention used in the calibration of the adverse scenario is one of &ldquo;no policy change&rdquo;. This means that no other monetary policy and fiscal policy reactions other than the ones considered under the baseline scenario are assumed under the adverse scenario.</li>
<li>The baseline scenario for EU countries is based on projections from the national central banks of December 2024. The adverse scenario assumes the materialisation of the main financial stability risks that have been identified by the ESRB in the fourth quarter of 2024, including recent risks assessments done by the EBA and the ECB.</li>
<li>The new EU banking package, which applies from 1 January 2025,&nbsp;is reflected in the 2025 EU-wide&nbsp;stress test methodology and templates, which should however continue being understood as a risk exercise, and not as an exercise that assesses the impact of regulatory changes.</li>
<li>Detailed information about the adverse scenario can be found in the note produced by the ESRB<span>.</span></li>
<li>The EBA&rsquo;s 2025 stress test methodology to be applied to the scenarios released today can be found on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/risk-and-data-analysis/risk-analysis/eu-wide-stress-testing" title="EU-wide stress testing">EBA website</a>.</li>
<li>The full sample<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-launches-its-2025-eu-wide-stress-test#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>[1]</span></a>&nbsp;of 64 banks participating in this year exercise can be found in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-01/0246e2f3-fa57-47d1-99f2-7a5b80cae509/2025%20EU-wide%20stress%20test%20-%20Methodological%20Note.pdf" title="2025 EU-wide stress test - Methodological Note">Annex 1 of the EBA methodology</a>.</li>

The following two banks were excluded from the sample (country code of the bank in brackets): Cassa Centrale Banca - Credito Cooperativo Italiano S.p.A (IT) and Mediobanca - Banca di Credito Finanziario S.p.A (IT). These banks were provisionally included in the sample for the 2025 EU-wide stress test to offset possible exclusions of banks before the launch of the exercise. Since no changes to the sample materialised by 15 December 2025, the banks were excluded from the sample.</p>

<title>Nearly Three-In-Five CEOs Optimistic About Global Economic Outlook As They Plan Headcount Increases And Continued AI Rollout: PwC 2025 Global CEO Survey</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/nearly-three-in-five-ceos-optimistic-about-global-economic-outlook-as-they-plan/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/nearly-three-in-five-ceos-optimistic-about-global-economic-outlook-as-they-plan/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul type="disc">
<li>Almost 60% of CEOs expect global growth to increase over the next 12 months, up from 38% last year and 18% two years ago</li>
<li>42% expect to increase headcount over the next 12 months &ndash; more than twice the number expecting to decrease it. CEOs more likely to say GenAI led to headcount increases than decreases</li>
<li>CEOs are seeing tangible impacts from GenAI: 56% reported efficiency gains, while one-third saw profitability (34%) and revenue (32%) increases</li>
<li>42% of CEOs believe their company will not be viable beyond the next 10 years without reinvention, as nearly four in ten say they have begun competing in new sectors in the last five years</li>
<li>Climate related investments six times more likely to have resulted in increased revenue than decreased revenue</li>
</ul>
<p>Almost 60% of CEOs around the world expect global economic growth to increase over the next 12 months, according to PwC's 28th&nbsp;Annual Global CEO Survey, launched today during the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div dir="ltr" id="dvprnejpg9518left"><img align="middle" alt="PwC Logo" id="prnejpg9518left" src="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1121790/PWC_Logo.jpg" title="PwC Logo" /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The report, which surveyed 4,701 CEOs across 109 countries and territories, also finds that 42% expect to increase headcount by 5% or more in the next 12 months &ndash; more than double the proportion who expect headcount decreases (17%), and up from 39% last year. The percentage is highest (48%) among smaller companies (less than US$100 million) and those in the technology (61%), real estate (61%), private equity (52%) and pharma and life sciences (51%) sectors.</p>
<p>While CEOs&nbsp;are optimistic about&nbsp;the&nbsp;global&nbsp;economy, macroeconomic&nbsp;volatility (29%)&nbsp;and inflation (27%) nevertheless remain the top risks for the year ahead cited by CEOs globally, but with clear differences between regions. Geopolitical conflict is seen as the biggest risk in the Middle East (41%)&nbsp;and&nbsp;Central&nbsp;and&nbsp;Eastern&nbsp;Europe&nbsp;(34%). In&nbsp;Western&nbsp;Europe,&nbsp;cyber&nbsp;risk&nbsp;(27%)&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;marginally higher concern than a lack of skilled workers (25%) and inflation (24%) &ndash; with macroeconomic volatility topping the list at 29%. Inflation is the top concern in Africa (39%), while North America and Asia-Pacific prioritise risks largely in line with the global averages.</p>
<p>Mohamed&nbsp;Kande,&nbsp;Global&nbsp;Chairman,&nbsp;PwC,&nbsp;said:</p>
<p><i>"This year's CEO Survey findings highlight a stark juxtaposition &ndash; business leaders around the world are optimistic about the year ahead, but also know they must reinvent how they create, deliver and capture value. Emerging technologies such as GenAI, shifts in geopolitics, and the climate transition are all revolutionising how the economy works. New business&nbsp;ecosystems&nbsp;are&nbsp;forming, transforming&nbsp;how&nbsp;companies&nbsp;compete&nbsp;and&nbsp;create value. To thrive, business leaders must act now and take bold decisions around their strategy &ndash; ranging from people, footprint and supply chain, right through to reinventing their business model."</i></p>
<p><b>The&nbsp;reinvention&nbsp;imperative</b></p>
<p>Consistent&nbsp;with&nbsp;the&nbsp;last&nbsp;two&nbsp;years, four&nbsp;in&nbsp;ten&nbsp;(42%)&nbsp;CEOs&nbsp;believe&nbsp;their&nbsp;company&nbsp;will&nbsp;not&nbsp;be&nbsp;viable beyond the next decade if it continues on its current path. Among those that do not expect to last without significant change, 42% cite shifts in the regulatory environment as having the biggest influence on their economic viability.</p>
<p>But CEOs are taking action &ndash; across all sectors, almost two-thirds (63%) have taken at least one significant action to change how their company creates, delivers, and captures value in the last five years, with CEOs that have taken more reinvention actions in the last five years reporting higher profit margins in the last 12 months.</p>
<p>As companies look to reinvent their business models, almost four in ten (38%) say they have begun competing in at least one new sector in the last five years &ndash; with about one-third (34%) noting this has represented over 20% of company revenue over this period.</p>
<p>However, the pace of reinvention is slow and a large majority of companies lack agility. When it comes to moving budget and people between projects and business units, around half of CEOs told&nbsp;us&nbsp;that&nbsp;they&nbsp;reallocate&nbsp;10%&nbsp;or less&nbsp;of&nbsp;financial&nbsp;and&nbsp;human&nbsp;resources from&nbsp;year&nbsp;to&nbsp;year.&nbsp;More than&nbsp;two-thirds&nbsp;reallocate&nbsp;less&nbsp;than&nbsp;20%.&nbsp;On&nbsp;average, only&nbsp;7%&nbsp;of&nbsp;revenue&nbsp;over&nbsp;the&nbsp;last&nbsp;five&nbsp;years has come from distinct new businesses.</p>
<p><b>CEOs&nbsp;are&nbsp;optimistic&nbsp;about&nbsp;the&nbsp;potential&nbsp;of&nbsp;GenAI,&nbsp;but&nbsp;are&nbsp;looking for&nbsp;stronger&nbsp;results</b></p>
<p>CEOs&nbsp;are&nbsp;reporting&nbsp;tangible impact&nbsp;from&nbsp;GenAI.&nbsp;More&nbsp;than&nbsp;half&nbsp;(56%)&nbsp;report&nbsp;seeing efficiency gains in their employees' time over the last 12 months, and one-third saw revenue (32%) increases.</p>
<p>However, performance is&nbsp;somewhat below expectations&nbsp;expressed&nbsp;last&nbsp;year.&nbsp;In&nbsp;2024, 46%&nbsp;said they expected to see profitability improvements. A year later, when we asked if they had seen those&nbsp;gains,&nbsp;only&nbsp;34% said they&nbsp;had. Trust in AI&nbsp;remains&nbsp;a&nbsp;hurdle to more&nbsp;widespread&nbsp;adoption. Only&nbsp;a&nbsp;third&nbsp;of&nbsp;CEOs&nbsp;said&nbsp;they&nbsp;have&nbsp;a&nbsp;high&nbsp;degree&nbsp;of&nbsp;trust&nbsp;in embedding&nbsp;the&nbsp;technology&nbsp;into&nbsp;key processes in their company.</p>
<p>Despite this, optimism about GenAI's impacts on profitability is slightly up on last year &ndash; with 49% expecting an increase in the next 12 months. Roughly half (47%) expect to integrate AI (including GenAI) into their technology platforms over the next three years, 41% plan to integrate it into core business processes and 30% have plans for new products and service development.</p>
<p>While&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;early days,&nbsp;there&nbsp;is&nbsp;nothing&nbsp;in&nbsp;our&nbsp;data&nbsp;to&nbsp;suggest a&nbsp;widespread&nbsp;reduction in&nbsp;employment opportunities across the global economy as a result of GenAI. More CEOs say GenAI has increased headcount than decreased it (17% v 13%).</p>
<p>Matt&nbsp;Wood,&nbsp;Global&nbsp;&amp; US&nbsp;Commercial&nbsp;Technology&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Innovation&nbsp;Officer (CTIO),&nbsp;PwC,&nbsp;said:</p>
<p><i>"This year's survey shows a more mature view of GenAI in the enterprise. CEOs are convinced it has the&nbsp;power to&nbsp;unlock new&nbsp;opportunities &ndash;&nbsp;in&nbsp;fact&nbsp;they are more optimistic than last year. At the same time, they are more aware of the challenges they need to navigate&nbsp;to&nbsp;realise that&nbsp;value.&nbsp;They&nbsp;see&nbsp;the&nbsp;importance&nbsp;of&nbsp;building&nbsp;trust&nbsp;into&nbsp;the&nbsp;way&nbsp;their AI systems are designed, and for now are prioritising integration into core business processes. It is important that they also see the potential GenAI has to generate growth through new products and services and create value in new ways."</i></p>
<p><b>Climate&nbsp;investments&nbsp;are&nbsp;paying&nbsp;off</b></p>
<p>As the climate transition continues to impact businesses, CEOs continue to take action. When we asked CEOs to take stock of the financial impact of climate related investments over the last five years, we found that these moves were six times more likely to have resulted in increased revenue (33%) than decreased revenue (5%). In addition, nearly two-thirds of CEOs reported that climate related investments had either reduced costs or had no significant impact on costs.</p>
<p>However, challenges remain around initiating climate related investments: CEOs that made such investments cite regulatory complexity as the&nbsp;top&nbsp;factor&nbsp;(24%) inhibiting their companies'&nbsp;ability to initiate&nbsp;those&nbsp;investments,&nbsp;as&nbsp;opposed&nbsp;to&nbsp;lower&nbsp;returns on&nbsp;investment&nbsp;(18%) or lack&nbsp;of&nbsp;buy-in&nbsp;from management or the board (6%).</p>
<p>Carol&nbsp;Stubbings,&nbsp;Global&nbsp;Chief Commercial&nbsp;Officer,&nbsp;PwC,&nbsp;said:</p>
<p><i>"Three-plus decades of digitisation have started to break down formerly impermeable boundaries between sectors, while the combined impact of the climate transition, AI, and other megatrends will hasten the process of reconfiguration. This survey shows that business&nbsp;leaders are&nbsp;facing&nbsp;this future&nbsp;with&nbsp;a&nbsp;combination&nbsp;of&nbsp;optimism&nbsp;about&nbsp;the&nbsp;economy and realism that business needs to fundamentally reinvent how it creates value if it is to thrive in the future."</i></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Today is Chair Gensler&rsquo;s final day at the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>Chair Gensler joined the Commission in 2021 with a lengthy career in public service.&nbsp; He previously served as the Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Under Secretary of the Treasury for Domestic Finance, the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Financial Markets, and as a senior advisor for U.S. Senator Paul Sarbanes.&nbsp; He brought that extensive experience and knowledge of the financial markets to bear as Chair, where together we have worked to further the Commission&rsquo;s mission to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although as Commissioners we approached policy issues from different perspectives, there was always dignity in our differences.&nbsp; Chair Gensler has been committed to bipartisan engagement and a respectful exchange of ideas, which has helped facilitate our service to the American public.&nbsp; For that we are deeply grateful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have finalized rules that have promoted market integrity and corporate governance, streamlined open-end fund disclosures, reduced settlement times, and passed needed reforms to the plans corporate insiders use to buy and sell company stock, among many other policy changes.&nbsp; Together we have returned billions of dollars to investors harmed by violations of the securities laws and helped educate the public on the risks and rewards of investing their savings. &nbsp;This record helps cement Chair Gensler&rsquo;s legacy of unwavering commitment, not only to public service, but to the American investor.</p>
<p>Thank you also to the Chair&rsquo;s hardworking staff, who took on significant tasks and approached each one with diligence and creativity.&nbsp; We appreciate your professionalism and commitment to public service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you, Chair, for your leadership, your zealous advocacy on behalf of our agency and investors, and your friendship. &nbsp;We are proud to have served this great agency alongside you.&nbsp; Your extensive public service over the past thirty years cautions against saying goodbye; instead, we will say &ndash; so long for now.&nbsp;</p>

<title>UK Chancellor Ramps Up Engagement With Financial Services Leaders To Bolster Plans To Grow The Economy - Financial Services Sector Set For Key Role In Designing First-Ever Financial Services Growth And Competitiveness Strategy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li> Chancellor to host series of Industry Forums with key sub-sectors such as banking, insurance, and asset management leaders over coming months. </li>
<li> Strategy will set out support for the financial services sector to innovate, grow and finance investment across the country, as part of Plan for Change to put more money in people&rsquo;s pockets. </li>
</ul>
<p>The financial services sector is set to play a key role in designing the first ever Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness Strategy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chancellor will host a series of Industry Forums with industry &ndash; covering the entire breadth of the financial services sector &ndash; to seek views about the best way to deliver long-term in the sector and across the country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Strategy, set to be published in the spring, aims to develop policies that foster growth in the financial services sector, as part of the Plan for Change to grow the economy and put more money in people&rsquo;s pockets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recognising its importance, financial services has been identified as one of the eight key growth-driving sectors in the government&rsquo;s Modern Industrial Strategy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Industry Forums, alongside extensive further engagement at official and ministerial levels, will ensure that industry and senior stakeholders are closely involved in the development of the upcoming Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness Strategy, so that it tackles the key issues that matter most to the industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will ensure that policy is informed by financial services professionals who know first-hand what is needed to deliver growth in each of the significant areas of financial services.â¯&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the coming weeks, the Chancellor and the Economic Secretary will chair the first of these Industry Forums bringing in leaders from retail banking, wholesale and international banking, insurance and reinsurance, asset management, fintech, and the mutuals and co-operatives sector.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>These sessions will build on the government&rsquo;s Call for Evidence to inform the Strategy, which closed in December 2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Growth is my number one mission. It&rsquo;s the only way to put more money in people&rsquo;s pockets and key to our Plan for Change.</p>
<p>The financial services sector is at the heart of this mission, supporting economic activity and financing investment across the country.</p>
<p class="last-child">I am committed to working hand-in-hand with the industry to make sure that our plans are informed by those who both provide and utilise financial services, including those who know first-hand what is needed to unlock growth in, and drive prosperity through, our world-leading financial services sector.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first meetings of the Industry Forums will run throughout January and February, reconvening ahead of the government&rsquo;s publication of the Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness Strategy as part of the Industrial Strategy later this year.</p>
<p>The government will continue to work closely with industry following the publication of the Strategy, to ensure that it is implemented effectively.</p>

<p><span><span>Aurojyoti Bose, Lead Analyst at GlobalData, comments: &ldquo;Many among the top 10 advisers by value experienced massive double-digit decline in the total value of deals advised by them in 2024 compared to 2023. In fact, Goldman Sachs registered a year-on-year decline of 46.9% in value but despite that it managed to occupy the top spot. Three of the five deals advised by Goldman Sachs during the year were billion-dollar deals* and these helped it secure the top spot by value. It is also noteworthy that the average value of these three deals was more than $4 billion.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&ldquo;In contrast, most of the top 10 advisers by volume registered growth in the number of deals advised by them in 2024 compared to 2023. Macquarie also registered growth as well as an improvement in its ranking. It went ahead from occupying the fifth position by volume in 2023 to top the chart by this metric in 2024.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/archax-achieves-s21-financial-promotion-approval-status/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Archax, the FCA-regulated global exchange for digital assets, is proud to announce that it has been approved as a Section 21 (s21) financial promotion approver. Prior to this formal confirmation, Archax was able to provide financial promotion approver services to its clients whilst the FCA considered it&rsquo;s application. This formal FCA approval positions Archax as a leading partner for crypto firms navigating the complex regulatory landscape, further solidifying its commitment to compliance, transparency, and fostering innovation in the digital asset space.</p>
<p>The FCA&rsquo;s guidance on cryptoasset financial promotions (PS23/6) mandates that all promotions for cryptoassets meet the same rigorous standards as traditional financial products. Financial promotions must be approved by an authorised entity to ensure they are clear, fair, and not misleading. Non-compliance can lead to significant penalties and reputational damage. With this approval, Archax is now fully authorised to approve financial promotions on behalf of unauthorised crypto firms, enabling them to market their products and services in compliance with UK regulations. This includes ensuring that promotions are accurate, transparent, and provide all necessary information for UK consumers to make informed decisions.</p>
<p>The digital asset space is undergoing rapid transformation, with increasing regulatory scrutiny to protect UK consumers. By achieving official s21 approval, Archax reinforces its role as a pioneer in the digital asset ecosystem, offering a robust infrastructure for institutions and businesses to operate compliantly. This capability also supports innovation by helping firms navigate the complex regulatory landscape with confidence.</p>
<p>Julia Loder, Head of Regulation at Archax, commented:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are immensely proud to have received the FCA&rsquo;s approval today. This marks a significant milestone as we transition out of the FCA&rsquo;s transition regime and become a fully approved s21 approver. Having been among the first cryptoasset approvers since the regime's inception in October 2023, we are excited to continue supporting our clients while adhering to the high standards set forth by the FCA. This approval is a testament to our commitment to compliance and regulation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Archax&rsquo;s s21 approval aligns with its mission to bridge the gap between traditional finance and digital assets. By providing compliant pathways for financial promotions, Archax enables innovation while upholding the integrity of the financial ecosystem. This achievement underscores Archax&rsquo;s leadership in shaping the future of financial services.</p>

<h4>Global Economic Headwinds</h4>
<p>Herbie Skeete, Managing Director of Mondo Visione and Co-founder of the Index, commented, &ldquo;The International Monetary Fund&rsquo;s lowered GDP forecast for 2025 underscores the risks posed by geopolitical conflicts and economic decoupling. These factors threaten to heighten market volatility and disrupt global recovery. The Federal Reserve&rsquo;s cautious stance&mdash;despite cutting interest rates by 25 basis points in December&mdash;further signals a challenging year ahead for markets.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Top Performers of December 2024</h4>
<p>Despite the turbulent backdrop, some exchanges posted notable gains in December. India&rsquo;s BSE led the charge with a remarkable 12.5% increase in share price, followed by Dubai Financial Market with an 8.7% rise and Brazil&rsquo;s B3 with a 7.7% gain.</p>
<p>Conversely, Cboe Global Markets recorded the steepest decline, falling 9.5%, while the Warsaw Stock Exchange and Intercontinental Exchange posted declines of 7.8% and 7.4%, respectively.</p>
<h4>Fourth Quarter Highlights</h4>
<p>The FTSE Mondo Visione Exchanges Index saw a 1.8% decline in Q4 2024, a stark contrast to the 17% surge in the previous quarter. However, Q4 featured standout performances, with the U.K.&rsquo;s Aquis Exchange soaring 76.0%, India&rsquo;s BSE rising 41.5%, and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange climbing 22.5%.<br />Romania&rsquo;s S.C. Bursa de Valori Bucuresti S.A. experienced the sharpest Q4 decline, dropping 24.1%, trailed by Brazil&rsquo;s B3 (-15.1%) and the Warsaw Stock Exchange (-14.2%).</p>
<h4>Year in Review: India&rsquo;s BSE Shines</h4>
<p>Over the past year, India&rsquo;s BSE emerged as a global standout, recording a staggering 133.0% increase. The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange also impressed with a 116.7% rise, while the Multi Commodity Exchange of India surged 89.4%.</p>
<p>On the downside, Brazil&rsquo;s B3 posted a 44.2% drop in 2024, with Romania&rsquo;s S.C. Bursa de Valori Bucuresti S.A. and Mexico&rsquo;s Bolsa Mexicana de Valores falling 35.7% and 22.7%, respectively.</p>
<h4>Looking Ahead</h4>
<p>As global markets brace for continued volatility, the FTSE Mondo Visione Exchanges Index will remain a key barometer for the performance of the world&rsquo;s leading exchanges.

<title>LME Approves Hong Kong As Warehouse Location</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/lme-approves-hong-kong-as-warehouse-location/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/lme-approves-hong-kong-as-warehouse-location/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The London Metal Exchange (LME) has today confirmed its approval of Hong Kong as an LME warehouse location. Hong Kong will join the LME&rsquo;s existing network of 32 locations spanning the USA, Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>Matthew Chamberlain, LME CEO, said:&nbsp;&ldquo;The addition of Hong Kong to our global warehousing network is an exciting development, providing warehouse facilities closer to the metals hubs of Mainland China than ever before. Mainland China is the world&rsquo;s largest consumer of metals, and with its outstanding commercial infrastructure, Hong Kong provides the natural hub for connectivity to the Chinese market that is so important to market participants and the wider metals industry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have had significant interest from warehouses, landlords and metal owners in the listing of Hong Kong as a metals delivery point and we look forward to being able to announce the first LME warehouse listing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The LME considers approvals for warehouse locations with the objective of securing a widespread network around the world in the most important areas of net consumption. Locations are assessed against a variety of factors such as local fiscal and regulatory systems and access to a good transport network.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is permitted to store LME-registered aluminium alloy, primary aluminium, copper, lead, nickel, tin, and zinc, and it will become an active warehouse location three months after the approval of the first warehouse company.</p>

<title>Nasdaq Helsinki Launches A New Segment For ETN Products</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/nasdaq-helsinki-launches-a-new-segment-for-etn-products/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Nasdaq (Nasdaq: NDAQ) today announced that Nasdaq Helsinki launches a new segment for ETN (Exchange Traded Notes) products. ETNs are exchange listed debt instruments issued against a direct investment by the issuer in an underlying asset or underlying derivatives contract. For example, the underlying can be a single share, a pair of shares, or a crypto asset. The liquidity of ETNs is supported by a market maker. ETN segments are already offered on Nasdaq Stockholm and Nasdaq Copenhagen. Virtune AB is the first issuer to list&nbsp; ETNs on Nasdaq Helsinki. Virtune AB is a registered financial institution by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority and an issuer of crypto Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) based in Stockholm, Sweden. Virtune has today listed the following five instruments on Nasdaq Helsinki: Virtune Bitcoin ETP, Virtune Staked Ethereum ETP, Virtune Crypto Altcoin Index ETP, Virtune Staked Solana ETP, and Virtune XRP ETP.</span><br /><br /><span>"We are thrilled to introduce the first crypto ETNs in Finland through Nasdaq Helsinki which aligns with Virtune&rsquo;s vision to become the leading crypto asset manager in the Nordics. These listings significantly deepen our engagement with the Finnish market. For the first time, Finnish investors can now invest in crypto through locally listed exchange traded products traded in EUR, offering a secure and easy way to integrate crypto investments into their traditional portfolios,&rdquo; said CEO Christopher Kock of Virtune.</span><br /><br /><span>In 2015, Nasdaq Stockholm was among the first exchanges in the world to accept listing of exchange traded products with Bitcoin as an underlying asset. These were followed in 2017 by&nbsp; the listing of exchange trade products with Ethereum as underlying asset, and subsequently by Exchange Traded Notes (ETN) tracking crypto currencies in 2020.</span><br /><br /><span>&ldquo;As a first mover in the Crypto ETP (Exchange Traded Products) market, we have been fortunate to be able to build a strong position in Europe with a market share of around 23%. We are now excited to be able to, with Virtune as first issuer, extend our listing and trading service to Nasdaq Helsinki, providing local access to these products,&rdquo; said Helena Wedin, European Head of Exchange Traded Products at Nasdaq.</span><br /><br /><span>&ldquo;ETN products provide access to alternative investments while maintaining the transparency of a regulated marketplace, and we are happy to launch this new segment at Nasdaq Helsinki with Virtune as the first issuer,&rdquo;&nbsp; said Henrik Husman, President of Nasdaq Helsinki.</span><br /><br /><span>Nasdaq Helsinki ETNs are available for trading through banks and brokers.</span></p>

<title>ASIC Invites Feedback On Proposed Remake Of Employee Incentive Scheme Instruments</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-invites-feedback-on-proposed-remake-of-employee-incentive-scheme-instrument/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-invites-feedback-on-proposed-remake-of-employee-incentive-scheme-instrument/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC is seeking feedback on a proposal to remake two employee incentive scheme (EIS) class orders due to expire on 1 April 2025:</p>
<ul>
<li>Class Order&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2014L01450/latest/text">[CO 14/1000</a>]&nbsp;<em>Employee incentive schemes: Listed bodies</em>, and</li>
<li>Class Order&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2014L01444/latest/text">[CO 14/1001]</a>&nbsp;<em>Employee incentive schemes: Unlisted bodies</em></li>
</ul>
<p>ASIC plans to combine the two class orders into one legislative instrument and proposes to remake the exemptions for a period of five years.</p>
<p>Entities have not been able to make offers of financial products to employees and other eligible participants under the EIS class orders since 1 March 2023. Employee share schemes are now operated under Division 1A of Part 7.12 of the&nbsp;<em>Corporations Act 2001</em>.</p>
<p>However, entities may need to continue issuing financial products because of employee incentive schemes established under the EIS class orders. For example, this may occur when an eligible participant becomes entitled to shares when they exercise an option or an incentive right vests.</p>
<p>The class orders currently contain exemptions that support the continued issue of financial products, including relief for secondary sales, advertising, licensing and contribution plans:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2022L01685/latest/text"><em>ASIC Corporations (Amendment) Instrument 2022/1022</em></a>.</p>
<p>While the exemptions will largely remain on the same terms, ASIC proposes some exemptions should only be required for &lsquo;underlying eligible products&rsquo;, such as shares, because entities should not need to issue &lsquo;overlying eligible products&rsquo;, such as options or incentive rights.</p>
<h2>Consultation&nbsp;</h2>
<p>ASIC invites feedback from stakeholders on its proposal to remake the EIS class orders, which are due to sunset on 1 April 2025: see&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/consultations/cs-14-proposed-remake-of-relief-for-employee-incentive-schemes/" title="CS 14 Proposed remake of relief for employee incentive schemes">CS 14&nbsp;<em>Proposed remake of relief for employee incentive schemes</em></a><em>.</em>&nbsp;Submissions should be sent&nbsp;<strong>by 5pm AEDT on Friday, 22 February 2025</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:rri.consultation@asic.gov.au">rri.consultation@asic.gov.au</a>.</p>

<title>Securities Commission Malaysia Release National Sustainability Reporting Framework Guidance To Help Companiesâ Board Of Directors Drive Sustainability Reporting</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/securities-commission-malaysia-release-national-sustainability-reporting-framewo/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/securities-commission-malaysia-release-national-sustainability-reporting-framewo/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) today released a simplified guide, &lsquo;Navigating the Transition: A Guide for Boards&rsquo; (Board Guide) to support board of directors of companies in adopting the National Sustainability Reporting Framework (NSRF). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Launched in September last year, the NSRF is a significant step in advancing Malaysia&rsquo;s corporate sustainability agenda.</p>
<p>Listed issuers on Bursa Malaysia&rsquo;s Main and ACE Markets, as well as large non-listed companies (NLCos) with annual revenue of RM2 billion and above are expected to comply with the new reporting requirements in a phased approach<a href="file://C:/Users/HLS/Downloads/20%20Jan%202025%20-%20SC%20Release%20NSRF%20Guidance%20to%20Help%20Companies%E2%80%99%20Board%20of%20Directors%20Drive%20Sustainability%20Reporting.pdf#_ftn1"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a>.</p>
<p>The NSRF addresses the use of the IFRS<sup>&reg;</sup> Sustainability Disclosure Standards issued by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), including IFRS S1 and IFRS S2. These standards ensure consistent and comparable sustainability-related financial disclosures.</p>
<p>The Board Guide provides board of directors with simplified and actionable steps on key areas such as governance, sustainability data boundaries, financial impact assessments, and integration with enterprise risk management systems. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Large companies (market capitalisation of RM2 billion and above) listed on Bursa Malaysia&rsquo;s Main Market start NSRF implementation this year, showcasing Malaysia&rsquo;s commitment to global best practices in corporate sustainability.</p>
<p>SC Chairman Dato&rsquo; Mohammad Faiz Azmi said, &ldquo;The NSRF is not a compliance tool, but a blueprint for embedding sustainability in corporate decision-making.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With this guide, we are equipping boards to not only meet global standards but to lead with purpose and resilience in shaping a sustainable future for Malaysia,&rdquo; he added.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>To further support this transition, the Advisory Committee on Sustainability Reporting</p>
<p>(ACSR), has introduced PACE (Policy, Assumptions, Calculators, Education), an initiative offering training, tools, and resources to meet NSRF requirements in adopting the ISSB standards.</p>
<p>Other upcoming PACE initiatives include an Interoperability Module between the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards, Illustrative Sustainability Reports to provide companies with illustrative references to guide their disclosures and an NSRF Preparers&rsquo; Programme to build capacity. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Board Guide and other related resources are available at <a href="http://www.sc.com.my/nsrf">www.sc.com.my/nsrf</a><a href="http://www.sc.com.my/nsrf">.</a> For more information or inquiries, please contact the ACSR Secretariat at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nsrf@seccom.com.my</span>.</p>

<p>



</p>
<p><i>Montage of Video Clips:</i></p>
<p><i>I got to give props to the SEC.</i></p>
<p><i>We are getting some breaking news here on GameStop.</i></p>
<p><i>This hearing is entitled GameStopped.</i></p>
<p><i>But, there are dark pools.</i></p>
<p><i>We have 58% of American households that are invested in the stock market.</i></p>
<p><i>Our agency put out an agenda&ndash;50 or 55 items on it.</i></p>
<p><i>Lowering risk in the system in the U.S. Treasury markets.</i></p>
<p><i>What are these now, half-penny increments we might be experiencing?</i></p>
<p><i>Screen fades to Chair Gary Gensler.</i></p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission is a remarkable agency entrusted by Congress and more importantly, by you, the American public, to oversee our $120 trillion capital markets. And ensure that the common sense rules of the road for those markets are followed. Common sense rules of the road help everyday folks like you, like me by lowering the cost in the markets, lowering the risk, and building trust in the markets themselves.</p>
<p>Over the last four years, I've had the great privilege to work alongside the SEC&rsquo;s incredibly talented staff, a staff committed to its mission. The staff here oversee more than 30,000 registrants. They conduct more than 3,000 examinations a year, and they respond to upwards to 100,000 inquiries from market participants each year. They respond to tens of thousands of tips, complaints, and referrals. In four years, this agency has returned more than $2.7 billion to harmed investors.</p>
<p>Now, technology, business models, and markets themselves, they don't stand still. They're constantly changing. And further, there's competitors around the globe that seek to take the U.S.'s mantle as the world's capital market leader. Can't take anything for granted.</p>
<p>That's why we at the SEC have taken on numerous projects over the past four years to ensure lower cost called efficiency, greater integrity that you can trust the markets and resiliency in our markets. We've done a lot over these four years, but it's for you and these capital markets.</p>
<p>We put out proposals with regard to more transparency about short selling, about where one borrows stock about insiders of big companies selling their stock. It's why, for the first time in 20 years, we comprehensively updated the rules in the nearly $60 trillion U.S. equity market, including narrowing the increments for stock quotes down to a half a penny, from a penny. You see, that saves you money.&nbsp;<i>I also think it promotes capital formation. If you narrow the spreads for those in the middle.</i></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s why we shortened what's called the settlement cycle, not only for stocks, but also corporate bonds and municipal bonds to one day. It means if you sell your stock on a Monday,&nbsp;<i>you get your cash on a Tuesday you no longer have to wait till Wednesday.</i></p>
<p>It's why we put in place reforms to lower costs and risk in one of the most consequential markets, the $28 trillion U.S. Treasury markets. It's why we adopted reforms for money market funds, $7 trillion in size.</p>
<p>It's why we updated important reporting tools for a critical part of our markets, the $30 trillion private funds sector.</p>
<p>But we also did things around corporate governance and disclosure. We adopted rules for when corporate insiders who might have material nonpublic information, how they can sell their shares and when they can sell their shares. It's also when they have to return compensation based on misstated financials.</p>
<p>It's why we adopted rules for disclosure of material information around cybersecurity incidents, around climate related risk, around how executive compensation actually relates to the company's financial performance.</p>
<p>And it's why we adopted rules in response to the boom of something called Special Purpose Acquisition Companies. You know it as SPACs. I think the Special Purpose Acquisition Companies, these blank check companies that the risk are to investors and the disclosure to the investors.</p>
<p>We also took on some issues around auditing and accounting. We helped reinvigorate an independent watchdog that Congress created more than 20 years ago, called the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. And in just the last three years, that board updated half of its interim standards and rules, some of which had gone unchanged since literally, I was in college. And yes, that was a little while ago.</p>
<p>It's why we worked on negotiations with China to solve a 20 year problem, to ensure that that board could fully inspect and investigate auditors of China related companies listed here in the United States.<i>&nbsp;You&rsquo;re going to have on-the-ground inspectors in Hong Kong.</i></p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission, now 90 years old, is central to our economic well-being. Our capital markets cover nearly every financial product you can think of. They affect your investments, your 401(K), your mortgage, your car loan, your employer's borrowings. They affect how your employer raises money and how you may fund your own business. The SEC touches all of these things, so the better this agency does, the better our economy does, the better that you do.</p>
<p>It's a remarkable agency, not only because of the breadth and scope of its authorities, but because of its mission driven staff who wake up every day to work for you, the American public, without fear or favor.</p>
<p>It's why I'm so honored to have served alongside my fellow commissioners and all of my SEC colleagues on behalf of everyday Americans.</p>

<title>SEC Announces Departure Of Acting Enforcement Director Sanjay Wadhwa</title>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Sanjay Wadhwa, the Acting Director of the Division of Enforcement, will depart the agency, effective January 31, 2025, after more than 21 years of service with the Commission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank Sanjay for leading the Division of Enforcement and his dedication to the SEC, which began as a staff attorney more than 20 years ago,&rdquo; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. &ldquo;He has led a division that has acted without fear or favor, and he has earned the deep respect of his colleagues during his more than two decades of service. I wish Sanjay all the best in his next pursuits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am grateful to Chair Gensler for giving me the opportunity to help lead the talented staff of the Enforcement Division, and I am proud of the Division&rsquo;s collaboration with colleagues throughout the agency to advance the Commission&rsquo;s mission to protect investors and promote fairness and integrity in the marketplace. Throughout my long tenure at the Commission, I have been inspired by my colleagues and their unwavering dedication to public service,&rdquo; said Mr. Wadhwa. &ldquo;And, we have been effective. During my time as Deputy and Acting Director, I have been gratified to see market participants stepping up their compliance efforts to embrace our shared goal of protecting investors. While the capital markets will always benefit from robust enforcement, the agency&rsquo;s effectiveness at combatting securities law violations is enhanced with buy-in from market participants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Wadhwa has served as Acting Director of Enforcement since October 2024 and, before that, served as the Division&rsquo;s Deputy Director since August 2021. During that time, Mr. Wadhwa oversaw the filing of more than 2,600 enforcement actions, resulting in orders for more than $20 billion in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties, and the return of billions of dollars to harmed investors. In his roles as Acting Director and Deputy Director, Mr. Wadhwa&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-program-corporate-compliance-enforcement-annual-fall-conference">emphasized</a>&nbsp;fostering a culture of compliance by market participants through vigorous enforcement of the securities laws while also crediting parties that cooperated with the Division&rsquo;s investigations. Those efforts bore fruit, as the Commission obtained orders for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2022-206">record amounts of financial remedies</a>&nbsp;while at the same time an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-program-corporate-compliance-enforcement-annual-fall-conference">increasing number of market participants</a>&nbsp;self-reported, remediated, and took other proactive steps to cooperate with the Division&rsquo;s investigations.</p>
<p>Earlier in his SEC career, Mr. Wadhwa served as the Senior Associate Director of the Division of Enforcement in the New York Regional Office (NYRO), Deputy Chief of the Market Abuse Unit, and Assistant Director in NYRO. He oversaw hundreds of investigations including several groundbreaking ones. For example, he led the agency&rsquo;s sustained and successful efforts to root out institutional insider trading, which resulted in successful enforcement actions against hedge fund advisers such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2011/2011-6.htm">Galleon Management</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2013-2013-41htm">S.A.C. Capital</a>&nbsp;and prominent Wall Street figures such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2011/2011-233.htm">Raj Rajaratnam</a>, the Galleon founder,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2011/2011-223.htm">Rajat Gupta</a>, the former head of McKenzie Consulting and a former Goldman Sachs and Procter &amp; Gamble board member, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2013-129">Steven A. Cohen</a>, the founder of S.A.C. Capital. Mr. Wadhwa also oversaw the agency&rsquo;s industry-wide investigation from 2016 to 2020 into&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2018-285">abusive American depositary receipts pre-release practices</a>, which resulted in monetary penalties against banks and broker-dealers exceeding $430 million. At the start of his tenure with the Commission, Mr. Wadhwa was the lead investigative attorney in the Commission&rsquo;s enforcement actions against&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2004-99.htm">all seven specialist member firms of the New York Stock Exchange</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2005-54.htm">twenty individual NYSE specialists</a>, and, subsequently,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2009/2009-42.htm">fourteen specialist firms on several regional and options exchanges</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to joining the SEC as a staff attorney in 2003, Mr. Wadhwa served as a tax associate at Cahill Gordon &amp; Reindel LLP and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom LLP. Mr. Wadhwa has a B.B.A. from Florida Atlantic University, a J.D. from South Texas College of Law Houston, and an LL.M. in Taxation from New York University School of Law.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Arete Wealth Broker-Dealer And Advisory Firms, Their Chief Compliance Officer, And Several Representatives In Connection With Illegal Securities Offering - One Additional Individual Agreed To Resolve The SECâs Charges For Unregistered Broker Activity</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-charges-arete-wealth-broker-dealer-and-advisory-firms-their-chief-complianc/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-charges-arete-wealth-broker-dealer-and-advisory-firms-their-chief-complianc/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against Joey Miller, Jeff Larson, and Randy Larson, formerly dually registered personnel with Arete Wealth Management LLC, a broker-dealer, and Arete Wealth Advisors LLC, an affiliated investment adviser, for fraud, registration violations, and aiding and abetting Arete Wealth Management&rsquo;s recordkeeping violations. The SEC also charged Arete Wealth Advisors and its Chief Compliance Officer and General Counsel, UnBo (Bob) Chung, with various violations of the federal securities laws related to a coverup of the representatives&rsquo; allegedly fraudulent conduct and other compliance failures, and charged Arete Wealth Management with recordkeeping violations.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s charges stem from a previously-described&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2021/comp-pr2021-61.pdf">scheme</a>&nbsp;in which Richard Dale Sterritt, Jr. and six others allegedly defrauded investors through a sham oil-and-gas company, Zona Energy Inc. The complaint alleges that from approximately October 2018 to May 2020, despite the fact that Arete had not approved Zona securities for offer and sale, Miller, Jeff Larson, and Randy Larson sold more than $8 million worth of Zona shares to many of their Arete clients and customers, a practice called "selling away,"&nbsp;which is prohibited by securities laws. The three defendants, as alleged in the complaint, tried to hide the sales by communicating through means not subject to surveillance by Arete, such as through personal phones and email. According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Miller and Jeff Larson frequently made false and misleading statements to prospective Zona investors and, in return for their fundraising efforts, Sterritt sold them deeply discounted Zona shares.</p>
<p>According to the complaint, after Chung and Arete management learned that many clients of Miller, Jeff Larson, and Randy Larson had invested in Zona, Chung and Arete ordered the three to obtain settlement agreements releasing the Arete entities and their management from liability relating to Zona. However, the settlement agreements ultimately signed by more than 100 Arete clients&mdash;which Chung claims that he did not read&mdash;allegedly contained false and misleading statements as well as an illegal broad liability disclaimer that could lead a client to incorrectly believe that the client had waived non-waivable causes of action against the adviser, thereby further victimizing already defrauded investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SEC also announced settled charges against Michael Sealy for allegedly acting as an unregistered broker-dealer in connection with his efforts to sell Zona shares. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, Sealy agreed to cease and desist from violations of the charged provision, to pay a civil money penalty of $200,000, and to be suspended from participating in an offering of a penny stock for a period of 12 months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As alleged in this case, after Arete&rsquo;s personnel defrauded investors, Arete, as aided by Chung, compounded the harm to these investors by having them sign releases that were false and misleading,&rdquo; said Sam Waldon, Acting Deputy Director of the Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s action is a reminder to gatekeepers that if you find potential evidence of misconduct and take steps to cover it up, you may expose yourself to liability.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, charges Miller, Jeff Larson, and Randy Larson with violations of the registration, recordkeeping, and anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws and related rules, and seeks permanent injunctions, conduct-based injunctions, officer-and-director bars, penny stock bars, and civil penalties. The SEC&rsquo;s complaint also charges Arete Wealth Advisors with violations of the antifraud and compliance rule provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, charges Chung with aiding and abetting the antifraud and compliance rule violations by Arete Wealth Advisors, and charges Arete Wealth Management with violating certain recordkeeping provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation is being conducted by Theresa H. Gue, Austin Thompson, Christopher Ferrante, Christine D. Ely, and Alison R. Levine under the supervision of Sheldon L. Pollock of the SEC&rsquo;s New York Regional Office. The SEC&rsquo;s litigation will be led by Oren Gleich and supervised by Preethi Krishnamurthy of the New York Regional Office.</p>
<p>The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York, the FBI, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.</p>

<title>US Justice Department Recovers An Additional $20M In Misappropriated 1MDB Funds</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-justice-department-recovers-an-additional-20m-in-misappropriated-1mdb-funds/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-justice-department-recovers-an-additional-20m-in-misappropriated-1mdb-funds/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Note:&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/media/1385611/dl">View the complaint here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.justice.gov/media/1385606/dl">View the stipulation and request to enter consent judgment of forfeiture here</a>.</p>
<p>The Justice Department announced today that it has reached an agreement to recover an additional $20 million in misappropriated 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) funds.&nbsp;In June 2024, the department announced it has already recovered and returned and assisted in returning to Malaysia approximately $1.4 billion.</p>
<p>Beginning in 2016, a landmark effort encompassing now 43 civil forfeiture actions filed in the Central District of California and one in the District of Columbia by the Criminal Division&rsquo;s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS) led to the seizure of over $1.7 billion in stolen assets. This is the largest recovery to date under the Justice Department&rsquo;s Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative. The funds include both funds finally forfeited to the government and funds the department assisted in recovering and returning. The department continues to litigate actions against additional assets allegedly linked to this scheme.</p>
<p>According to court documents, the funds from 1MDB, formerly Malaysia&rsquo;s investment development fund, were laundered through major financial institutions worldwide, including in the United States, Switzerland, Singapore, and Luxembourg.</p>
<p>As alleged in the civil forfeiture complaints, from 2009 through 2015, more than $4.5 billion in funds belonging to 1MDB were misappropriated by high-level officials of 1MDB and their associates, and Low Taek Jho, also known as aka Jho Low, through a criminal scheme involving international money laundering and embezzlement. Some of the embezzlement proceeds were also allegedly used to pay bribes. As alleged in the complaint filed in this case, tens of millions of dollars in funds misappropriated from 1MDB were paid to companies owned and controlled by Frank White Jr. and others. The unlawful source of these funds was unknown to White Jr. at the time of the payment. White Jr. has consented to $20 million in forfeiture in this case, all of which derives from these embezzled funds.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the agreement announced today, White Jr.&rsquo;s company, DuSable Capital Management LLC (DuSable), submitted amended filings pursuant to the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). The amended filings disclose additional political activities performed by DuSable for the government of Malaysia, including lobbying the U.S. government to provide non-financial support for a solar project in Malaysia.</p>
<p>1MDB was created by the government of Malaysia to promote economic development in Malaysia through global partnerships and foreign direct investment. Its funds were intended to be used for improving the well-being of the Malaysian people. Instead, funds held by 1MDB and proceeds of bonds issued for and on behalf of 1MDB were misappropriated and spent on a wide variety of extravagant items, including luxury homes and properties in Beverly Hills, California, New York, and London; a 300-foot superyacht; and fine art by Monet and Van Gogh. The funds also were sent into numerous business investments, including a boutique hotel in Beverly Hills, a movie production company that made &ldquo;The Wolf of Wall Street,&rdquo; the redevelopment of the Park Lane Hotel in Manhattan, and shares in EMI, the largest private music-rights holder. As alleged, other funds were provided to various public officials and co-conspirators.</p>
<p>Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brent S. Wible, head of the Justice Department&rsquo;s Criminal Division; Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department&rsquo;s National Security Division; Acting U.S. Attorney Carolyn Pokorny for the Eastern District of New York; and Assistant Director in Charge James E. Dennehy of the FBI New York Field Office made the announcement.</p>
<p>The FBI&rsquo;s International Corruption Squad in New York is leading this investigation.</p>
<p>MLARS Trial Attorney Joshua Sohn is prosecuting the civil forfeiture case. MLARS Trial Attorney Joshua Sohn and former MLARS Trial Attorney Sean Fern, Deputy Chief Erik Paulsen of the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Eastern District of New York&rsquo;s International Narcotics and Money Laundering Section, and Trial Attorney Christine Bonomo of the National Security Division&rsquo;s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section investigated the case. Asset Forfeiture Section Chief Jonathon Galatzan of the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Central District of California provided critical assistance with the investigation and prosecution.</p>
<p>The Justice Department&rsquo;s Office of International Affairs is providing substantial assistance.&nbsp;MLARS&rsquo; Program Operations Unit, the U.S. Marshals Service, and the U.S Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Central District of California have also provided significant support.</p>
<p>Significant assistance has also been provided to the Justice Department over the course of its work in the investigations and civil and criminal litigation by the&nbsp;Attorney General&rsquo;s Chambers of Malaysia, Royal Malaysian Police, Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission, U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, U.K. Prudential Regulation Authority, U.K. National Crime Agency, Attorney General&rsquo;s Chambers of the Territory of the British Virgin Islands, Attorney General&rsquo;s Office of the Bailiwick of Guernsey and Guernsey Economic Crime Division, International Anti-Corruption Coordination Centre, Attorney General&rsquo;s Chambers of Singapore, Singapore Police Force &mdash; Commercial Affairs Division, Office of the Attorney General and Federal Office of Justice of Switzerland, judicial investigating authority of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, Criminal Investigation Department of the Grand-Ducal Police of Luxembourg, Republic of Indonesia, Latvian authorities, and French authorities, including the Parquet National Financier and Agency for Management and Recovery of Seized and Confiscated Assets&nbsp;(AGRASC).</p>
<p>The Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative is led by a team of dedicated MLARS prosecutors in partnership with federal law enforcement agencies, and often with U.S. Attorneys&rsquo; Offices, to forfeit the proceeds of foreign official corruption and, where appropriate, to repatriate those recovered assets to governments for the benefit of the people harmed by these acts of corruption and abuse of office. Individuals with information about possible proceeds of foreign corruption located in or laundered through the United States should email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:kleptocracy@usdoj.gov">kleptocracy@usdoj.gov</a>&nbsp;or submit information at&nbsp;<a href="https://tips.fbi.gov/">tips.fbi.gov/</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li><span>Engaging in promotional activities on behalf of Baynsworth or another person that is reasonably expected to benefit from the promotional activity, and</span></li>
<li><span>Disseminating to the public, or authorizing the dissemination to the public, any information or record relating to any securities or investment advisory services offered by Baynsworth.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="BCSCParagraph">The panel cited evidence provided by BCSC staff at a December 9 hearing, which neither Baynsworth nor Burnett attended or otherwise participated in.</p>
<p class="BCSCParagraph">BCSC staff told the panel that Baynsworth and Burnett solicited investors through a website, Google posts and a WhatsApp business account. On its website, Baynsworth described itself as &ldquo;one of Canada&rsquo;s leading economic development houses&rdquo; that &ldquo;offers government contract procurement solutions, and through our profit-sharing approach, we help our clients thrive and flourish in a stable world class economy.&rdquo; It offered several investment programs, with annual rates of return ranging between 7.2 per cent to 18.3 per cent and a 100% money-back guarantee.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="BCSCParagraph">A BCSC investigator posing as a potential investor reached out to Baynsworth, which led to correspondence with Burnett, in which he said returns could be as high as 22 per cent with only a one-year term, and that &ldquo;all of our programs go through our lawyer.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="BCSCParagraph">The BCSC investigator contacted Baynsworth and Burnett using his true identity, asking them to remove the promotional material in a few days. Later, in a response to a BCSC demand to produce records by enforcement staff, Burnett communicated with staff on November 22 and met with them on December 3, denying that he deals in securities and saying that he had removed the website months ago. As of December 5, a day before the hearing, the website was still active.</p>
<p class="BCSCParagraph">The panel found that there was enough evidence to conclude on its face that:</p>
<ul>
<li>A deposit with Baynsworth met the definition of an &ldquo;investment contract&rdquo; and is a &ldquo;security&rdquo; under B.C.&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Securities Act</em></li>
<li>Baynsworth and Burnett engaged in illegal distribution of a security</li>
<li>They conducted trading of securities without being registered, and</li>
<li>They made false or misleading representations in the course of promotional activities.</li>
</ul>
<p class="BCSCParagraph">&ldquo;We are concerned that unsophisticated investors would be attracted by the promise of high returns with no risk,&rdquo; the panel wrote. &ldquo;&hellip; There is a risk that an unsuspecting member of the public will invest in the Baynsworth programs. It is also harmful to the integrity of the capital markets and public confidence in them to permit unregistered trading to continue even after [having] been notified and given an opportunity to cease trading.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="BCSCParagraph">The panel extended the order until December 9, 2025, which the panel said &ldquo;is reasonable given the typical timeframe for completing an investigation and holding a hearing before this tribunal.&rdquo;</p>

<title>US Secretary Of The Treasury Janet L. Yellen Sends Letter To Congressional Leadership On The Debt Limit</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen sent a letter to all members of Congressional leadership regarding the debt limit.</p>
<p>The full text of the letter can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Debt-Limit-Letter-to-Congress-1-17-25.pdf">here</a>&nbsp;and is available below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Honorable Mike Johnson</p>
<p>Speaker</p>
<p>U.S. House of Representatives</p>
<p>Washington, DC&nbsp; 20515</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Speaker:</p>
<p>I write to keep you apprised of actions the Treasury Department is taking in regard to the debt limit.&nbsp; In my letter of December 27, 2024, I noted that the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 suspended the statutory debt limit through January 1, 2025, and established a new limit effective January 2, and I informed you that Treasury expected to reach the new limit between January 14 and January 23.&nbsp; This letter serves to notify you, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &sect; 8348(l)(2), of the extraordinary measures that Treasury will begin using on January 21.</p>
<p>First, I have determined that, by reason of the statutory debt limit, I will be unable to fully invest the portion of the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (CSRDF) not immediately required to pay beneficiaries, and that a &ldquo;debt issuance suspension period&rdquo; will begin on Tuesday, January 21, 2025, and last through Friday, March 14, 2025.&nbsp; My predecessors have declared debt issuance suspension periods under similar circumstances.&nbsp; With these determinations, the Treasury Department will suspend additional investments of amounts credited to, and redeem a portion of the investments held by, the CSRDF, as expressly authorized by law.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, because the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006 provides that investments in the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund (PSRHBF) shall be made in the same manner as investments for the CSRDF, the Treasury Department will suspend additional investments of amounts credited to the PSRHBF.&nbsp; By law, the CSRDF and the PSRHBF will be made whole once the debt limit is increased or suspended.&nbsp; Federal retirees and employees will be unaffected by these actions.</p>
<p>The period of time that extraordinary measures may last is subject to considerable uncertainty, including the challenges of forecasting the payments and receipts of the U.S. Government months into the future.&nbsp; The debt limit does not authorize new spending, but it creates a risk that the federal government might not be able to finance its existing legal obligations that Congresses and Presidents of both parties have made in the past.&nbsp; I respectfully urge Congress to act promptly to protect the full faith and credit of the United States.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Janet L. Yellen</p>
<p>Identical letter sent to:</p>
<p>The Honorable Hakeem Jeffries, House Democratic Leader</p>
<p>The Honorable John Thune, Senate Majority Leader</p>
<p>The Honorable Charles E. Schumer, Senate Democratic Leader</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>cc:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Honorable Jason Smith, Chairman, House Committee on Ways and Means</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Honorable Richard E. Neal, Ranking Member, House Committee on Ways and Means</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Honorable Mike Crapo, Chairman, Senate Committee on Finance</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Honorable Ron Wyden, Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Finance</p>

<title>SEC Announces Record Enforcement Actions Brought In First Quarter Of Fiscal Year 2025 - Commission Continued To Emphasize Benefits Of Cooperation And Remediation</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-announces-record-enforcement-actions-brought-in-first-quarter-of-fiscal-year/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that, based on its preliminary results, it filed 200 total enforcement actions in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, which ran from October through December 2024, including 118 standalone enforcement actions. The Division filed a total of 75 enforcement actions in October 2024 alone. The foregoing numbers represent the most actions filed in their respective periods since at least 2000.</p>
<p>The actions filed in the first quarter addressed a wide range of violations, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-184">financial misstatements</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-178">misleading disclosures to brokerage customers</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-178">failures by advisory firms to disclose conflicts of interest,&nbsp;</a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-181">alleged bribery schemes</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-194">frauds targeting retail investors</a>, misleading statements about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-167">artificial intelligence</a>, and more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Investors and issuers alike benefit from the Commission&rsquo;s efforts to hold wrongdoers accountable,&rdquo; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud of the incredible work of the Division of Enforcement and colleagues around the agency to track down misconduct and protect the investing public.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As these impressive figures reflect, the Division has not taken its foot off the pedal in the new fiscal year,&rdquo; said Sanjay Wadhwa, Acting Director of the Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;On the contrary, the hard work of the dedicated staff in the Division, with assistance from throughout the Agency, has resulted in the busiest start to a fiscal year that I have witnessed in my 20-plus years at the Commission, providing invaluable protections to investors and promoting fairness and integrity in the securities markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-178">continued its emphasis</a>&nbsp;on crediting parties that self-police, self-report, remediate, and otherwise cooperate with the Division&rsquo;s investigations. The SEC filed more than 40 enforcement actions from Jan. 1, 2025, though Jan. 17, 2025, indicating that the Division&rsquo;s high level of productivity continues into the second quarter of fiscal year 2025.</p>
<p>The figures referenced above are based on preliminary data that will be finalized at the agency&rsquo;s fiscal year-end.</p>

<title>Treasury International Capital Data For November</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/treasury-international-capital-data-for-november-7/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/treasury-international-capital-data-for-november-7/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury today released Treasury International Capital (TIC) data for November 2024. The next release, which will report on data for December 2024, is scheduled for February 18, 2025.</p>
<p>The sum total in November of all net foreign acquisitions of long-term securities, short-term U.S. securities, and banking flows was a net TIC inflow of $159.9 billion. Of this, net foreign private inflows were $156.6 billion, and net foreign official inflows were $3.3 billion.</p>
<p>Foreign residents increased their holdings of long-term U.S. securities in November; their net purchases were $115.7 billion. Net purchases by private foreign investors were $124.0 billion, while net sales by foreign official institutions were $8.3 billion.</p>
<p>U.S. residents increased their holdings of long-term foreign securities, with net purchases of $36.7 billion.</p>
<p>After including adjustments, such as estimated foreign portfolio acquisitions of U.S. stocks through stock swaps, overall net foreign purchases of long-term securities are estimated to have been $79.0 billion in November.</p>
<p>Foreign residents increased their holdings of U.S. Treasury bills by $11.3 billion. Foreign resident holdings of all dollar-denominated short-term U.S. securities and other custody liabilities increased by $20.6 billion.</p>
<p>Banks&rsquo; own net dollar-denominated liabilities to foreign residents increased by $60.3 billion.</p>
<p>Complete data are available on the Treasury website at:</p>
<p><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/data/treasury-international-capital-tic-system">https://home.treasury.gov/data/treasury-international-capital-tic-system</a></p>
<h3>About TIC Data</h3>
<p>The monthly data on holdings of long-term securities, as well as the monthly table on Major Foreign Holders of Treasury Securities, reflect foreign holdings of U.S. securities collected primarily on the basis of custodial data. These data help provide a window into foreign ownership of U.S. securities, but they cannot attribute holdings of U.S. securities with complete accuracy. For example, if a U.S. Treasury security purchased by a foreign resident is held in a custodial account in a third country, the true ownership of the security will not be reflected in the data. The custodial data will also not properly attribute U.S. Treasury securities managed by foreign private portfolio managers who invest on behalf of residents of other countries. In addition, foreign countries may hold dollars and other U.S. assets that are not captured in the TIC data. For these reasons, it is difficult to draw precise conclusions from TIC data about changes in the foreign holdings of U.S. financial assets by individual countries.</p>

<title>Farewell Statement, SEC Commissioner Jaime LizÃ¡rraga</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>At close of business today, my time as SEC Commissioner will reach its end.</p>
<p>I am proud of all we accomplished. We modernized our regulatory framework to bring it in line with current realities, brought greater transparency to parts of our market that were opaque, and continued to harness our enforcement powers to fight and prevent fraud, market manipulation, and insider trading.</p>
<p>We promoted market integrity, transparency, resiliency, competition, and investor confidence by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modernizing mutual fund and exchange-traded fund disclosures for investors;</li>
<li>Updating truth-in-naming rules for funds that will ensure that a particular name means what it says and does what it means;</li>
<li>Empowering shareholders to assess whether executive compensation is tied to corporate performance;</li>
<li>Enhancing privacy protections for hundreds of millions of retail investors in our country;</li>
<li>Requiring public companies to disclose their material cybersecurity incidents, so that investors can better understand how such incidents affect a company&rsquo;s bottom line;</li>
<li>Requiring public companies to inform investors about how they are dealing with climate risks;</li>
<li>Approving updated auditing standards that make financial reporting more reliable;</li>
<li>Strengthening insider trading rules that enhance accountability of corporate insiders;</li>
<li>Modernizing stock market rules to lower prices and fees for investors;</li>
<li>Strengthening the resiliency of the $26 trillion U.S. treasuries market through more central clearing;</li>
<li>Reducing the securities transaction settlement cycle from two days to one;</li>
<li>Strengthening money market fund resiliency; and many others.</li>
</ul>
<p>These reforms will level the playing field for all investors &ndash; large and small &ndash; and benefit our capital markets for years to come.</p>
<p>It has been a great honor to serve alongside my distinguished colleagues: Chair Gary Gensler and Commissioners Hester Peirce, Caroline Crenshaw, and Mark Uyeda. Best wishes to them and to Commission staff for future success.</p>

<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-announces-departure-of-public-affairs-head-scott-schneider/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-announces-departure-of-public-affairs-head-scott-schneider/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the departure of Scott Schneider, a counselor to Chair Gary Gensler and Director of the Office of Public Affairs (OPA), effective next month. Mr. Schneider has served in the role since April 19, 2021.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to thank Scott for his leadership of the Office of Public Affairs,&rdquo; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. &ldquo;Scott is an exceptionally talented communications strategist and has been the key leader in ensuring the Commission&rsquo;s efforts have been communicated clearly and transparently to the public. He has been one of my most trusted advisers these last four years, and I&rsquo;m so pleased he came back for this round of government service after working with me at the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. I wish him all the best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Schneider served as Chair Gensler&rsquo;s principal adviser on communications and, as the Director of OPA, led Commission-wide external communications strategy, media relations, rulemaking and enforcement communications, digital strategy, updates to SEC.gov, and internal communications. He also oversaw the Chair&rsquo;s speechwriting and public engagement. He managed the announcement and rollout of senior personnel appointments, dozens of proposed and final rulemakings, and hundreds of enforcement actions. Under Mr. Schneider&rsquo;s leadership, OPA launched Chair Gensler&rsquo;s official X account and a series of &ldquo;Office Hours&rdquo; videos that explained important agency priorities and initiatives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been an honor to work alongside immensely qualified colleagues in the Office of Public Affairs and across all of the Divisions and Offices of the SEC,&rdquo; said Mr. Schneider. &ldquo;I thank Chair Gensler for giving me the opportunity to serve and for prioritizing proactive and honest communication to the public about the work of this critical agency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immediately before joining the SEC, Mr. Schneider was the Managing Director of Financial Communications at Ketchum, a global consultancy, where he provided counsel to leading U.S. and global companies to support major financial events, such as mergers, acquisitions, spinoffs, IPOs, earnings, and investor/analyst conferences. He previously served as the Director of Public Affairs at the CFTC immediately after the global financial crisis. Earlier in his career, Mr. Schneider held various roles for former U.S. Senator Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana, his home state.</p>
<p>Mr. Schneider holds a J.D. from the University of Pennsylvania Law School, an M.B.A. from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and a B.A. in political science from the University of Redlands.</p>

<title>IOSCO Issues Statement Of Support On The IESBAâs International Ethics Standards For Sustainability Assurance</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/iosco-issues-statement-of-support-on-the-iesbas-international-ethics-standards/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/iosco-issues-statement-of-support-on-the-iesbas-international-ethics-standards/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Board of IOSCO congratulates the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA) on achieving an important milestone of finalizing their International Ethics Standards for Sustainability Assurance (including International Independence Standards) (IESSA) and Other Revisions to the Code Relating to Sustainability Assurance and Reporting. IOSCO notes the extensive and thorough outreach program conducted by the IESBA throughout the lifecycle of the development of IESSA.</p>
<p>IOSCO reiterates its support for this work and commends the IESBA for its timely development of the standard in response to the public interest need for ethics (including independence) standards to cover all sustainability assurance providers.</p>
<p>The final standard is responsive to the key considerations and observations set out by IOSCO in its 2023 report and 2024 public statement. IOSCO believes the standard can support high-quality assurance over sustainability-related information and may enhance consistency, comparability and reliability of sustainability-related information provided to the market. The final standard together with the IESBA&rsquo;s plan to develop implementation support materials and other capacity-building efforts, can contribute to enhancing trust in the sustainability-related information provided to investors.</p>
<p>Recognizing that individual jurisdictions have different domestic arrangements regarding the consideration of international ethics and independence standards, IOSCO calls on members to consider ways in which they might apply or otherwise be informed by the IESSA when considering ethics and independence requirements for assurance or permissions within the context of their jurisdictional arrangements.</p>
<p><strong>Jean-Paul Servais</strong>, Chair of IOSCO, said: &ldquo;History has shown us that assurance is necessary to deliver trust in disclosures, which is instrumental for the good functioning of financial markets. Today&rsquo;s announcement from IESBA is a welcome development, providing a robust ethical framework for the assurance of sustainability reporting.</p>
<p>A strong assurance framework for sustainability related disclosures needs to be focused on the public interest and should be profession &ndash; and framework &ndash; agnostic. IESBA&rsquo;s new international standard will foster trust and integrity for years to come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;IOSCO will continue to play a key role in promoting global consistency in the assurance of sustainability-related information&rdquo;, he added.</p>
<p>Please&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iosco.org%2Flibrary%2Fpubdocs%2Fpdf%2FIOSCOPD785.pdf&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cmailing-lists%40iosco.org%7C60d36719e18344f3a71508dd372738a0%7Cbcc6c66cdb3b48328af2cc363a097444%7C0%7C0%7C638727363797176883%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=35FiAu%2Bg7CrjMNvxeMpQzYP3J0B%2F8UXPqpCNfxXii8M%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">click here</a>&nbsp;to read IOSCO&rsquo;s full Statement of Support.</p>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-announces-departure-of-chief-of-staff-amanda-fischer/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the departure of Amanda Fischer, who has served as Chief of Staff since Jan. 1, 2023. She joined the agency as a Senior Counselor to Chair Gary Gensler in June 2021.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to thank Amanda for serving as SEC Chief of Staff, and before that, as Senior Counselor to the Chair,&rdquo; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. &ldquo;Amanda is a remarkably talented leader, both as a manager and as a strategist. Critical to every aspect of our efforts, the Commission and entire agency are so fortunate that she has taken on leadership roles these last four years. She helped guide consequential reforms to the equity and Treasury markets as well as coordinated our work with the Financial Stability Oversight Council. She has been an excellent and respected leader of the SEC staff and a trusted adviser to me. I wish her very well in her next pursuits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ms. Fischer has served as one of Chair Gensler&rsquo;s lead advisers and has worked with Commission staff on all aspects of the agency&rsquo;s mission, including rulemaking and policy, enforcement, strategy, personnel, management, operations, communications, and legislative affairs. Her work focused on protecting the savings of working families, maintaining the agency&rsquo;s commitment to transparency and integrity, and cultivating the SEC as one of the best places to work in the Federal Government. She also served as the Chair&rsquo;s adviser on interagency engagements, including with the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the President&rsquo;s Working Group on Financial Markets, and multiple task forces convened by the White House, and she was the lead staff member on the agency&rsquo;s response to major market events.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank Chair Gensler for providing me with the opportunity to serve alongside the dedicated and talented staff at the Commission,&rdquo; said Ms. Fischer. &ldquo;The public servants at the SEC work every day to safeguard American families&rsquo; savings and to strengthen the resiliency and integrity of the financial system. It has been an honor to call them, the Chair, and Commissioners colleagues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immediately before joining the SEC, Ms. Fischer was the Policy Director at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a non-partisan research organization focused on economic policy. Earlier in her career, she worked for more than a decade on Capitol Hill in roles related to financial services policymaking, including as Chief of Staff for Congresswoman Katie Porter, Professional Staff on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, as a Policy Advisor for Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, and as Deputy Staff Director for the House Committee on Financial Services. She graduated with bachelor's degrees in business administration and public policy from the University at Buffalo and an M.A. in public policy from Georgetown University.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Digital Currency Group And Soichiro âMichaelâ Moro, Former CEO Of Genesis Global Capital, For Misleading Investors About Genesisâs Financial Condition</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-charges-digital-currency-group-and-soichiro-michael-moro-former-ceo-of-ge/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Digital Currency Group Inc. (DCG), and Soichoro &ldquo;Michael&rdquo; Moro, the former CEO of DCG&rsquo;s now-defunct subsidiary, Genesis Global Capital LLC, will pay a combined $38.5 million in civil penalties to settle charges for misleading investors about Genesis&rsquo;s financial condition. &nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, in mid-June 2022, Three Arrows Capital, a crypto asset hedge fund and one of Genesis&rsquo;s largest borrowers, defaulted on a margin call, which compromised Genesis&rsquo;s business. DCG and Moro, however, downplayed the impact of the approximately $1 billion loss and exaggerated what DCG did to help Genesis in the aftermath. Specifically, in the days following the default, Moro made false or misleading statements on Twitter, misleadingly characterizing Genesis&rsquo;s balance sheet as strong and falsely stating that Genesis had shed the risk related to the default. DCG executives retweeted certain of these statements. In addition, after DCG and Genesis entered into a promissory note with a 10-year term, Moro&mdash;with the knowledge and participation of DCG personnel&mdash;misleadingly tweeted that DCG had ensured that Genesis had &ldquo;adequate capital to operate&rdquo; when DCG had in fact not transferred any capital to Genesis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is vital that companies and their officers speak truthfully to the investing public, especially in times of financial instability or turmoil. The Commission found that DCG and Moro fell short in that regard,&rdquo; said Sanjay Wadhwa, Acting Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;Rather than being transparent about Genesis&rsquo;s financial condition and DCG&rsquo;s efforts to ensure Genesis&rsquo;s continued operation, DCG and Moro painted a misleadingly rosy picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings that they violated Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, DCG and Moro agreed to a cease-and-desist order and to pay civil penalties of $38 million and $500,000, respectively.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Yael Berger, Joy Guo, Amanda Rios, Ben Kuruvilla, Sam Wasserman, and William Garnett, assisted by Kenneth Gottlieb, and supervised by Mark R. Sylvester of the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit and Jorge G. Tenreiro.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>New York Attorney General Letitia James and a bipartisan, multistate coalition of 45 securities regulators, together with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), today&nbsp;<a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/settlements-agreements/executed-vg-aod-1.14.2025.pdf">secured $106 million from Vanguard Group, Inc., an investment advisory firm</a>, and its subsidiary Vanguard Marketing Corporation. The settlement follows Vanguard&rsquo;s failure to notify investors of changes to its retirement funds that resulted in higher capital gains tax bills for hundreds of thousands of investors. An investigation by the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) found that Vanguard lowered the minimum requirements on one of its retirement funds without telling investors that the changes would result in higher tax bills. More than 15,000 New York investors were forced to pay capital gains taxes on their retirement accounts that were exponentially higher because of those undisclosed changes. As a result of today&rsquo;s settlement with the bipartisan coalition led by New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, and the SEC, Vanguard will pay $106 million in restitution to hundreds of thousands of investors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;New Yorkers deserve the peace of mind that when they rely on trained professionals to help them save for retirement, those professionals won&rsquo;t end up costing them extra money,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>Attorney General James</span>. &ldquo;People pay&nbsp;Vanguard&nbsp;to help manage and safeguard their retirement funds, but instead these investors were left in the dark about changes that forced them to pay thousands of extra dollars. Today, my office along with a coalition of states and the SEC is holding&nbsp;Vanguard&nbsp;accountable for misleading hundreds of thousands of people nationwide. New Yorkers deserve to retire in comfort and dignity, and that means ensuring their lifetime of hard work and earnings are protected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vanguard is one of the largest investment advisors in the world, with approximately $7.9 trillion in retirement savings under its management. Vanguard offered investors &ldquo;target date&rdquo; retirement funds, known as Investor Target Date Retirement Funds (TRFs) and Institutional Target Date Retirement Funds. Both Vanguard Investor and Institutional TRFs were structured and invested according to a &ldquo;target date&rdquo; of the approximate year that an investor planned to retire. The main differences between Vanguard&rsquo;s Investor TRFs and its Institutional TRFs were the fund fees and expenses, and the minimum investment amounts to invest in the TRFs. The Investor TRFs were slightly more expensive to manage but had a minimum $1,000 investment amount, whereas the Institutional TRFs were cheaper to manage but had a $100 million minimum investment requirement.</p>
<p>In December 2020,&nbsp;Vanguard&nbsp;changed the minimum amount required to invest in its Institutional TRFs from $100 million to $5 million. As a result of the lowered investment minimums, many people sold their Investor TRF shares to purchase Institutional TRF shares. The large number of sales caused&nbsp;Vanguard&nbsp;to sell highly appreciated assets in the Investor TRFs, which resulted in significant capital gains taxes for hundreds of thousands of retail investors who relied on the Investor TRFs.&nbsp;Vanguard&nbsp;did not disclose potential capital gains tax consequences to Investor TRF shareholders as a result of the migration of shareholders from the Investor TRFs to the Institutional TRFs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The OAG investigation found that&nbsp;Vanguard&nbsp;organized a working group to study the impact of these changes and knew that investors would likely be responsible for paying taxes on the increased value of their accounts but failed to inform investors of those consequences.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s settlement requires&nbsp;Vanguard&nbsp;to pay $106 million into a fair fund managed by the SEC to distribute as restitution to impacted investors. Investors eligible for restitution will be contacted by the SEC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Forty-five jurisdictions are signatories to the term sheet for the settlement: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>The OAG investigation was conducted by Senior Enforcement Counsel Hannah K. Flamenbaum, and Assistant Attorneys General Melissa Gable and Stephanie Torre, as well as Legal Assistants Natalya Fadeyeva and with the assistance of Principal Accountant Shalendra Ramadhin and former law interns Alex MacDonald and Greg Zaffino, under the supervision of the Investor Protection Bureau Chief Shamiso Maswoswe and Deputy Bureau Chief Kenneth Haim. Data Scientist Gautam Sisodia and Senior Data Analyst Akram Hasanov provided additional support, under the supervision of Director Victoria Kahn, all of the Research and Analytics Unit.&nbsp; The Investor Protection Bureau is part of the Division of Economic Justice, which is led by Chief Deputy Attorney General Chris D&rsquo;Angelo and overseen by First Deputy Attorney General Jennifer Levy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<title>SEC: Vanguard To Pay More Than $100 Million To Resolve Violations Related To Target Date Retirement Funds</title>

<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that The Vanguard Group, Inc. will pay $106.41 million to settle charges for misleading statements related to capital gains distributions and tax consequences for retail investors who held Vanguard Investor Target Retirement Funds (Investor TRFs) in taxable accounts. The settlement amount will be distributed to harmed investors.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that, on December 11, 2020, Vanguard announced that the minimum initial investment amount of Vanguard Institutional Target Retirement Funds (Institutional TRFs) was lowered from $100 million to $5 million. In the following months, a substantial number of retirement plan investors redeemed their Investor TRFs and switched to the Institutional TRFs because the latter funds had lower expenses. According to the order, to meet the demand for these redemptions, the Investor TRFs had to sell underlying assets with gains due to the rising financial markets that had rebounded from pandemic lows. The order finds that, as a result, retail investors of the Investor TRFs who did not switch and continued to hold their fund shares in taxable accounts faced historically larger capital gains distributions and tax liabilities and were deprived of the potential compounding growth of their investments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The order also finds that Vanguard Investor TRFs&rsquo; prospectuses, effective and distributed in 2020 and 2021, were materially misleading because they stated that the funds&rsquo; distributions may be taxable as ordinary income or capital gains, and that capital gains distributions could vary considerably from year to year as a result of the funds&rsquo; &ldquo;normal&rdquo; investment activities and cash flows. However, the order finds the prospectuses failed to disclose the potential for increased capital gains distributions resulting from the redemptions of fund shares by newly eligible investors switching from the Investor TRFs to the Institutional TRFs. The order also finds that Vanguard failed to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations of the Advisers Act and rules thereunder with respect to the accuracy of the funds&rsquo; disclosures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Materially accurate information about capital gains and tax implications is critical to investors saving for their retirements,&rdquo; said Corey Schuster, Chief of the Division of Enforcement&rsquo;s Asset Management Unit. &ldquo;Firms must ensure that they are accurately describing to investors the potential risks and consequences associated with their investments.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This settlement resolves the SEC&rsquo;s investigation along with settlements of parallel investigations of Vanguard announced today by the Office of the New York Attorney General (NYAG), the Connecticut Department of Banking, and the New Jersey Office of the Attorney General (NJAG) on behalf of the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA).</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that Vanguard violated the Advisers Act and caused violations of the Securities Act and the Investment Company Act. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, Vanguard agreed to be censured, cease and desist from future violations, and pay $18.2 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest that will be deemed satisfied by the payment of $92.91 million in relief ordered by the states&rsquo; settlements and a $13.5 million civil penalty, for a total amount of $106.41 million to be distributed to affected investors through a Fair Fund. The $106.41 million in ordered relief is in addition to $40 million that Vanguard agreed to pay to settle an investor class action captioned, In re Vanguard Chester Funds Litigation, Case No. 2:22-cv-00955-JFM, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, which will be added to the Fair Fund if the settlement is terminated or rejected.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Mark Oh of the Home Office and Marie DeBonis of the Asset Management Unit, with assistance from Mark Dowdell and Andrea Dittert of the Division of Examinations, and supervised by Sarah Lamoree and Mr. Schuster. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the NYAG&rsquo;s Investor Protection Bureau, Connecticut Department of Banking&rsquo;s Securities and Business Investments Division, NJAG&rsquo;s Bureau of Securities, and NASAA.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged former Pennsylvania-based investment adviser Scott J. Mason, and his companies Rubicon Wealth Management LLC and Orchard Park Real Estate Holdings LLC, with misappropriating more than $20 million from at least 13 Rubicon advisory clients.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, from at least 2014 to 2024, Mason made unauthorized transfers of money from Rubicon clients&rsquo; accounts to his own accounts and those of his entities, Rubicon and Orchard Park. As the complaint alleges, Mason used the money for his own purposes, including to pay country club dues, transfer it to other clients, and purchase a portion of a miniature golf course in New Jersey. The complaint further alleges that Mason forged clients&rsquo; signatures, made numerous misrepresentations about what he was doing with clients&rsquo; money, and concealed his fraud for years by providing fake account statements and tax documents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As alleged, Mason&rsquo;s clients trusted him to invest their money as he said he would but, instead, he repeatedly abused that trust to enrich himself at their expense. He then lied to them and manipulated documents to cover his tracks,&rdquo; said Nicholas P. Grippo, Regional Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Philadelphia Regional Office. &ldquo;This action once again shows the SEC&rsquo;s commitment to holding advisers accountable when they violate the federal securities laws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, charges Mason, Rubicon, and Orchard Park with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.&nbsp; Mason, Rubicon, and Orchard Park have consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from committing future violations of those provisions and provides that the court will decide the amounts of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties at a later date. The settlement is subject to court approval.</p>
<p>In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against Mason.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Laura E.L. Gavin, Brian P. Thomas, and Norman P. Ostrove in the SEC&rsquo;s Philadelphia Regional Office. It was supervised by Scott A. Thompson and Nicholas P. Grippo in the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Spencer Willig and supervised by Gregory R. Bockin. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the FBI.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Paul McCabe And PMAC Consulting With Acting As Unregistered Brokers For Pre-IPO Stocks - McCabe Engaged In Unregistered Broker Activity After FINRA Bar</title>

<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Paul John McCabe Jr. and his unregistered firm PMAC Consulting LLC have agreed to pay $3 million to resolve SEC charges for illegally brokering transactions involving the stock of private companies that were expected to undertake an initial public offering (IPO).</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, McCabe consented to a permanent bar from broker activity by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in late 2016 after he refused to provide documents and information while affiliated with a registered broker-dealer being examined by FINRA. The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that McCabe concurrently established PMAC Consulting and continued engaging in broker activity without registering as a broker-dealer or associating with a registered broker-dealer. The order finds that McCabe negotiated the terms of transactions for the purchase and sale of pre-IPO shares, worked directly with issuers, provided advice or valuations to purchasers, and acted as the primary intermediary between buyers, sellers, and their agents or representatives. According to the order, McCabe received more than $16 million in transaction-based compensation through PMAC on behalf of several fund clients and nearly 100 sellers.</p>
<p>"Broker-dealers serve a critical function in the securities markets; here, McCabe tried to circumvent the registration requirements that are in place to ensure that markets operate with transparency, fairness, and accountability," said Sheldon L. Pollock, Associate Director of the SEC&rsquo;s New York Regional Office.&nbsp;&ldquo;The SEC remains committed to those principles by vigilantly policing pre-IPO transactions and exposing unregistered participants improperly performing broker activities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that McCabe, who is based in Bethesda, Maryland, and PMAC violated the broker-dealer registration provision of the federal securities laws. Without admitting or denying the findings, McCabe and PMAC agreed to industry and penny stock bars as well as joint and several civil penalties of $3 million. They also agreed to cease and desist from future violations.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Michael S. DiBattista, Megan R. Genet, Tian Wen, Douglas J. Smith, Sushila P. Rao, Patricia Schrage, Alistaire Bambach, Daniel Loss, and Steven G. Rawlings of the New York Regional Office. The case was supervised by Mr. Pollock.&nbsp; The SEC appreciates the assistance of FINRA.</p>

<p><span>Andrew Bailey reflects on the role that public institutions like the International Monetary Fund and World Bank have played over the last eighty years. As these institutions continue to face challenge to their legitimacy, Andrew says there is a need to reinforce these institutions and their governance in terms of accountability and their legitimacy.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>I am going to interpret my theme quite broadly this evening. That said, let me start &ndash; appropriately as we are at King&rsquo;s &ndash; with a quote from Keynes at Bretton Woods &ndash; on the importance of monetary stability as a prerequisite for reconstructing the world economy (with thanks to Martin Daunton for using it in his recent book on World Economic Government):</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without currency agreements you have no firm ground on which to discuss tariffs. In the same way plans for diminishing the fluctuation of international prices have no domestic meaning to the countries concerned until we have some firm ground in the value of money... It is very difficult while you have monetary chaos to have order of any kind in other directions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The focus on monetary frameworks and currency arrangements reflected the tension at the time between on the one hand national sovereignty and discretion and on the other hand multilateral frameworks. However, while monetary stability remains the bedrock today, the agenda has of necessity broadened out substantially in terms of economic policy. These days, global co-operation focuses more on ensuring a well-regulated financial system. That reflects the perennial tension between the national scope of governments and the more global scope of markets. Solving that tension requires multilateral frameworks and institutions.</p>
<p>Another theme concerns the Bretton Woods institutions themselves. We can&rsquo;t be misty eyed about Bretton Woods. On monetary stability, it was a halfway house solution to dealing with the implications of free international convertibility to gold for domestic economic management. It couldn&rsquo;t be implemented in full for some time, and didn&rsquo;t survive for long when it was. To borrow Dani Rodrik&rsquo;s phrase, Bretton Woods was shallow multilateralism with a small role for the Fund and the World Bank, and it didn&rsquo;t pass the test. Subsequently, global financial integration and its scale has become much more extensive and created its own instability. In doing so, this has required a reassessment of multilateralism and the Bretton Woods legacy, and brought the Fund and Bank to centre stage. They have been evolving, in response &ndash; but perhaps, so far, not fast or far enough. Understanding the drivers of global financial stability, and acting to preserve them is the new frontier.</p>
<p>But, we now live in a world where public institutions are under much more strenuous challenge to their legitimacy. The challenge now is to reinforce the institutions and their governance in terms of accountability and thus legitimacy. Otherwise, a democratic deficit exists which damages effectiveness. Can the institutions support the necessary multilateralism &ndash; to go back to the tension with national sovereignty? Can they embody the multilateral authority to speak truth to national power? There is nothing new about this challenge. But it has taken on greater force in a world of so-called populism which embodies at least three pertinent features: first a greater emphasis on domestic production and the distribution of wealth relative to stability and the benefits of openness; second, a tendency to attribute unfavourable conditions to outside forces in a context of low trust societies; and third, with this decline in trust institutions are viewed as distant, unresponsive and acting for the benefit of powerful and uncontrollable interests.</p>
<p>It is a mistake to dismiss these features as not a reflection of the real world as we see it. Other people do see it that way. The challenge for international organisations is to be seen as part of the solution, not the problem.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to use the rest of my time to try to put these issues into the current context and draw out some priorities to go forward.</p>
<p>The theme of balancing national interests with international co-operation runs through the last 80 years. How do we preserve and develop the view that international co-operation is the best way to protect national interests? The argument was won at Bretton Woods because of the terrible context of global war.</p>
<p>The issue is again with us today. Moreover, the whole issue of the benefits of international co-operation has become more pressing as markets &ndash; in goods and finance &ndash; become larger and more global, with a sense of diminished national control and greater exposure and susceptibility to shocks.</p>
<p>The question then becomes, how can multilateral institutions build influence in this context, to put themselves in a position to influence the balance of national interests and international co-operation? What is their comparative advantage? I think the answer lies in putting more emphasis on the surveillance role, and the effectiveness of the messaging of that work. In a more shock prone world, with the international monetary and financial system potentially being profoundly altered by a series of major transformative trends, the returns on effective surveillance will be much greater. Forewarned is forearmed. Prevention is more effective than cure. The Fund&rsquo;s voice remains a powerful one, but unless its surveillance activities keep pace with a changing world, risks and vulnerabilities could be missed. None of us will be forgiven for missing the next crisis.</p>
<p>In particular, to return to where I started, financial surveillance needs to be a particularly high priority for us all, including the IMF. There remain, and will do so, financial vulnerabilities to be fixed. We are seeing major changes in the form of financial intermediation as the role of non-banks grows. But &ndash; and just as Hyman Minsky predicted &ndash; there is a growing resistance to regulation and rule-making as memories of the Global Financial Crisis recede. We have to continue to win our arguments, and it is becoming more challenging. Bilateral and multilateral surveillance are an important tool here. We will have to lay out the risks and vulnerabilities with more prominence and thereby directly challenge the naysayers.</p>
<p>Now, let me be clear, the Fund&rsquo;s surveillance analysis is very high quality &ndash; the WEOs and GFSRs are excellent, and they are just the tip of the iceberg. But I think the work can and should evolve in a number of areas in response to a more shock-prone uncertain and complex global economic and financial system, with a focus on resilience building, spillovers, more systemic and macro-prudential assessment, and greater financial market surveillance.</p>
<p>Let me return to the main theme of balancing national interests and international co-operation. I want to draw out an element of the issue of national interests. It is the saddest and most dangerous. We are seeing the return of destructive nationalism, most obviously in Russia. I was an economic historian, not a central banker, when I was next door at Queens&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Of course, history doesn&rsquo;t end, and we are being reminded of that. Bretton Woods was an important part of the response to the most destructive and tragic nationalism of modern times. At Queens&rsquo; I was taught history by Richard Overy, who has written extensively on modern warfare. Recently, Richard has written a book called &ldquo;Why War?&rdquo; which seeks to understand the human propensity for conflict, no small task. He quotes the father of new realist political science, Kenneth Waltz, who wrote: &ldquo;Theorists explain what historians know: war is normal&rdquo;. Richard sets out four broad motives for war: resources, belief, power and security. I mention this because as well as powerful and more detailed surveillance, for multilateralism to have impact it has to speak to the big issues. A criticism of the early history of the Fund and Bank is that they were often invisible. To be fair, Bretton Woods was not designed with the Cold War in mind, so the world moved on very quickly. But, since resources, belief, power and security cannot be separated from economics, with the rising threat of destructive nationalism we have to go back and determine what role the multilateral institutions should play to re-establish &ndash; and explain the value of &ndash; economic co-operation.</p>
<p>Another dimension to the issue of balancing national interests and international co-operation is the question of how many poles are there in the system? Bretton Woods is often portrayed as the transfer of authority from one single pole (Britain) to another (the US), the creation of a new era. It also gets portrayed likewise as the wrestle between Keynes and Harry White.</p>
<p>At the time, the importance of enabling this transfer of poles was cast in terms of avoiding going forwards the dangerous nationalism of the 1930s. Very quickly, the issue became the different one of whether collective international co-operation could embrace capitalist and communist systems, it couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Over time, the issue moved on to the tension between advanced countries and those in the developing and emerging ones, and it is this tension that has been a persistent feature of the Fund and the Bank in their more mature and influential era since the 1970s. Even if issues around voting shares remain to be resolved, the Fund has been able to evolve its toolkit in order to lend more money to vulnerable countries. Today, the issue of whether / how much the world is multipolar is complicated by the question of whether it is possible to frame effective international co-operation in a world where the two largest economies, the US and China, have such different philosophical underpinnings. This strikes me as more fundamental than the traditional Bretton Woods issue of how to design a system which creates appropriate discipline for creditor and debtor nations, though I don&rsquo;t want to deny the importance of that issue. The conclusion I draw here in terms of making multilateralism work is that we have to do all we can to make it work, and that this should be an acknowledged objective. Not least because many of the challenges we face cannot be fixed within national borders. We may end up with shallow multilateralism, and that may or may not be a helpful outcome. What we can&rsquo;t do is give up in the face of a more difficult environment.</p>
<p>This brings me, finally, back to the point about speaking truth to national power. Clearly the context matters a lot. Global co-operation has a greater chance of success when economic benefits are widely shared, as are the risks perceived to be &ndash; i.e. we are all in this together, and know that we are so &ndash; and we exist in conditions of broad economic stability. We can hope, but hope is not a winning strategy. A world where there is greater actual and perceived risk of unequal outcomes and instability is one where collective action is harder and less likely to succeed.</p>
<p>At least up to a point, because I think the lesson of Bretton Woods as it played out is that the influence of collective action is non-linear. In other words, when the situation gets really bad, take the financial crisis, the call for international collective action and the willingness to submit to it, grows almost exponentially. It takes a good crisis as they say. But this is not a basis on which to run good policy. And this is the risk we face today &ndash; the vulnerabilities are growing, and the necessary solutions are global, but they are not sufficiently great to tip into crisis multilateralism. And we don&rsquo;t want that to happen.</p>
<p>As so we come back to the issue of how to influence by speaking truth to national power successfully, in a world of hostility to institutions. I will end with one thought on this, which I recognise may come across as too pious by half. We have to speak with humility and humanity. We don&rsquo;t know all the answers, and that is not a failing. The world is highly uncertain &ndash; and shock prone &ndash; and that is reality. By building its surveillance offer and working with members on how to build ex ante resilience, the Fund can be seen as a trusted problem solver which can be turned to in moments of crisis, rather than an institution which calls out where things went wrong and mops up after the crisis occurs. We serve the people as a whole at all times. I say this because when we look back at the last 80 years, it has not always been viewed this way by society as a whole.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Stuart Berry, Mark Joy, Karen Jude, Harsh Mehta, James Talbot and Matt Trott for their help in the preparation of these remarks.</p>

<title>SEC Charges GrubMarket With Overstating Revenue To Investors By More Than $500 Million</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against GrubMarket Inc., a private, California-based e-commerce food distributor, for providing investors with financial information that the company should have known was unreliable and that overstated its historical revenues by approximately $550 million.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s Order, between November 2019 and February 2021, GrubMarket raised approximately $80 million from investors in a private Series D offering. When soliciting prospective investors in the Series D round, GrubMarket emailed them financial information, including an investor presentation and financial statements, which prospective investors incorporated into their investment analyses and decisions. At the same time, GrubMarket was using a different set of financial information, including in its tax filings, that reflected significantly lower historical revenues for other corporate purposes. In doing so, GrubMarket should have known that the financial information it was using to solicit prospective Series D investors, which overstated the company&rsquo;s historical revenues by $550 million over a five-year period, was unreliable. Even so, GrubMarket did not inform any Series D investors about the significant discrepancy in historical revenues until after the fundraising round closed. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In our markets, when potential investors ask for and receive financial information from startups, they reasonably expect those financials to be accurate, reliable, and free from material misrepresentations and omissions,&rdquo; said Mark Cave, Associate Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s order finds that GrubMarket provided investors with financial information that painted a misleading picture of the company&rsquo;s historical performance, while at the same time using higher-quality financials for other business purposes. That practice cannot be squared with the company&rsquo;s obligations to investors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that GrubMarket violated certain antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, GrubMarket agreed to a cease-and-desist order and to pay an $8 million civil penalty.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Benjamin Wasserman, John Rossetti, and Gary Peters and supervised by Jeff Leasure and Mr. Cave.</p>

This is the third standard proposed by DMIST, an independent organization formed by FIA in July 2022, to promote greater efficiency in the trading and clearing workflow for derivatives.&nbsp;<br /><br />Today's action kicks off a&nbsp;</span><strong><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://email.fia.org/c/12o3S7O6GK9j1i2QRZDGcJDFRXrA4f" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">consultation process</a></strong><span>&nbsp;with industry stakeholders that will last until March 21. DMIST aims to finalize the standard by the end of the Q2 2025. Any member of the public may submit a comment, and DMIST will post all comments at its website.&nbsp;<br /><br />The proposed&nbsp;</span><strong><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://email.fia.org/c/12o3S8hLgO20pEMtjurmhTCHiLKnR8" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Standard Regarding Position Transfers</a></strong><span>&nbsp;applies to the process of moving an open position from one account to another at the same clearing member firm or between different clearing member firms. Position Transfers are used to manage risk, optimize margin, correct allocations, balance portfolios, change clearing relationships and address changes in beneficial ownership due to mergers and acquisitions.&nbsp;<br /><br />Today the Position Transfer process is almost completely manual. DMIST believes a standard would increase operational efficiency and resiliency, reduce operational and regulatory risk by minimizing manual touch points, and simplify communication between clearing members and their clients. The development of this standard represents the first step towards automating the process. &nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Samina Anwar</strong>, Director of Derivatives Operations at Cargill and Chair of the DMIST Sponsor Board, said: &ldquo;Position transfers are vital for clients to manage risk and optimize margins effectively. Many clients face inefficiencies and delays due to varying processes across clearing brokers. A standardized template for requesting position transfers will streamline workflows, enhance accuracy, and significantly reduce errors in both requesting and booking transfers.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Don Byron</strong>, Executive Director, DMIST: "Today's release of the proposed standard continues DMIST efforts to address some long-standing pain points in the trading and clearing process. The standard is designed to improve efficiency, reduce risk and increase the speed at which a position transfer can be completed. Through this effort, DMIST continues to serve the industry as a driving force for consistency, resilience, and common-sense solutions.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Tim Hoopes</strong>, Executive Director, Morgan Stanley and Leader of the DMIST Position Transfer Working Group: &ldquo;This is an exciting step toward improving an important process with longstanding challenges for the industry. &nbsp;Not only does the proposed Position Transfer Standard provide immediate efficiency and risk reduction benefits to clients, clearing members, and CCPs by streamlining communication and reducing the need for data transformation, it also strengthens the pathways to increased automation of this process in the future.&nbsp;<br /><br /></span><br /></td>

It recommends that simple position transfers requested five hours ahead of the market clearing close be completed the same day. Complex position transfers that require exchange approval should be completed 48 hours ahead of the nearest market clearing close. The standard also recommends that the Client send the Client Request Form simultaneously to both the originating and receiving clearing members. &nbsp;<br /><br />The FIA Operations Americas Division, with input from FIA's European and Asian Operations Committees, submitted a proposal to the DMIST Sponsor Board in May 2024 to standardize Position Transfers. The Sponsor Board approved the proposal and formed a DMIST Working Group, which reviewed and enriched the proposal. &nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Don Byron:&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;This was the first time a standard was proposed by a group external to DMIST.

<title>SEC Charges LPL Financial With Anti-Money Laundering Violations</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-charges-lpl-financial-with-anti-money-laundering-violations/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-charges-lpl-financial-with-anti-money-laundering-violations/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against broker-dealer and investment adviser LPL Financial LLC for multiple failures related to its anti-money laundering (AML) program. To resolve the SEC&rsquo;s charges, LPL agreed to pay a civil penalty of $18 million and to implement improvements to its AML policies and procedures.</p>
<p>According to the SEC order, from at least May 2019 through December 2023, LPL experienced longstanding failures in its customer identification program, including a failure to timely close accounts for which it had not properly verified the customer&rsquo;s identity. Furthermore, LPL failed to close or restrict thousands of high-risk accounts, such as cannabis-related and foreign accounts, that were prohibited under LPL&rsquo;s AML policies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Federal law requires broker-dealers to ascertain the identity of their customers and to conduct ongoing customer due diligence to aid the government in its efforts to detect and prevent money laundering,&rdquo; said Stacy Bogert, Associate Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;When broker-dealers like LPL fail to comply with their AML obligations, they put the securities markets at risk. Today&rsquo;s case underscores the importance of complying with applicable regulations in the areas of customer identification and ongoing customer due diligence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that LPL willfully violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17a-8 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, the firm agreed to a censure and a cease-and-desist order in addition to the $18 million penalty. The SEC&rsquo;s order also directs LPL to continue its engagement of a compliance consultant to review and recommend changes to the firm&rsquo;s AML policies and procedures.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Ada Fernandez Johnson and John Ponyicsanyi. The case has been supervised by Pei Y. Chung and Ms. Bogert.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Pair Of Wells Fargo Advisory Firms And Merrill Lynch With Compliance Failures Relating To Cash Sweep Programs - Firms Agree To Pay Civil Penalties Of $60 Million Combined To Settle SEC Charges</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against registered investment advisers Wells Fargo Clearing Services LLC and Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network LLC (collectively Wells Fargo Advisors) and against Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Incorporated (Merrill Lynch) for failing to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations of the Advisers Act and the rules thereunder relating to the firms&rsquo; cash sweep programs. The firms agreed to settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges and pay $60 million in total civil penalties.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s orders, Wells Fargo Advisors and Merrill Lynch offered bank deposit sweep programs (BDSPs) as the only cash sweep option for most advisory clients and received a significant financial benefit from advisory client cash in the BDSPs. The orders find that these firms or their affiliates set the interest rates offered in the BDSPs and that, during periods of rising interest rates, the yield differential between the BDSPs and other cash sweep alternatives at times grew to almost 4 percent. According to the orders, Wells Fargo Advisors and Merrill Lynch failed to adopt and implement reasonably designed policies and procedures (1) to consider the best interests of clients when evaluating and selecting which cash sweep program options to make available to clients, including during periods of rising interest rates, and (2) concerning the duties of financial advisors in managing client cash in advisory accounts. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cash sweep programs impact nearly all advisory clients, who often pay advisory fees on assets held in these accounts,&rdquo; said Sanjay Wadhwa, Acting Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;These actions reinforce that advisory firms must have reasonably designed policies and procedures to consider their clients&rsquo; best interest when evaluating potential sweep options for cash held in advisory accounts and to ensure that cash held in an advisory account is properly managed by financial advisers consistent with a client&rsquo;s investment profile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, Wells Fargo Clearing Services, Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network, and Merrill Lynch consented to the entry of orders finding that they violated the Advisers Act and ordering them to be censured and to cease and desist from violating the charged provisions. Wells Fargo Clearing Services agreed to pay a civil penalty of $28 million; Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network agreed to pay a civil penalty of $7 million; and Merrill Lynch agreed to pay a civil penalty of $25 million.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigations were conducted by John Mulhern of the Division of Enforcement&rsquo;s Asset Management Unit and&nbsp; Min Choi and Jonathan Shapiro of the Division of Enforcement&rsquo;s Complex Financial Instruments Unit, with assistance from David Mendel and James Carlson, under the supervision of Kimberly Frederick, Corey Schuster, and Reid Muoio.</p>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The three European Supervisory Authorities (EBA, EIOPA and ESMA &ndash; the ESAs) published today a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-01/JC_2024_108_Report_on_the_feasibility_for_further_Centralisation_of_reporting_of_major_ICT_incidents.pdf">report</a>&nbsp;on the feasibility of further centralisation in the reporting of major ICT-related incidents by financial entities according to Article 21 of the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA).</p>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify">In line with the DORA mandate, the ESAs&rsquo; joint report explores the potential for further centralisation regarding financial entities&rsquo; reporting of major ICT-related incidents to competent authorities.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">The report assesses the feasibility of three different models: the baseline model, a model with enhanced data sharing arrangements and a fully centralised model. It considers the potential burden and cost reductions, as well as the efficiency and effectiveness gains that each model would bring for cross-sector supervisory practices.</p>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Next steps</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify">The joint report has been submitted to the European Parliament, the European Council and the European Commission, which will consider its findings for potential future developments in relation to the further centralisation of major ICT-related incident reporting in the financial sector.</p>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Background</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify">The report, prepared jointly by the ESAs in accordance to Article 21 of DORA, is based on input received from Competent Authorities and the ESAs&rsquo; Stakeholders Groups.

<title>The UK Prudential Regulation Authority Announces A Delay To The Implementation Of Basel 3.1</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-uk-prudential-regulation-authority-announces-a-delay-to-the-implementation-o/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-uk-prudential-regulation-authority-announces-a-delay-to-the-implementation-o/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), in consultation with HM Treasury, has decided to delay the implementation of Basel 3.1 in the UK by one year until 1 January 2027. This allows more time for greater clarity to emerge about plans for its implementation in the United States.</p>
<p>Basel 3.1 is the final set of international banking reforms designed in response to the 2008 global financial crisis. It is designed to improve banks&rsquo; own measurement of risk, standardising approaches between firms to make their capital ratios more consistent and comparable.</p>
<p>On 12 September 2024, the PRA published PS9/24 &ndash; Implementation of the Basel 3.1 standards near-final part 2<sup><sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2025/january/the-pra-announces-a-delay-to-the-implementation-of-basel-3-1#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup></sup>&nbsp;&ndash; which set out its near-final rules to implement Basel 3.1 in the PRA rulebook. The publication delayed the implementation date by six months to 1 January 2026 based on consultation feedback and the PRA&rsquo;s ongoing monitoring of the implementation timelines of other jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Given the current uncertainty around the timing of implementation of the Basel 3.1 standards in the US, and taking into account competitiveness and growth considerations, the PRA, having consulted with HM Treasury, has decided to further delay implementation of the rules. We now expect to implement on 1 January 2027, but will continue to monitor developments. In line with the approach taken for the six-month delay in PS9/24, the transitional periods in the rules will be reduced to ensure the date of full implementation remains at 1 January 2030, as set out in the original proposals<sup><sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2025/january/the-pra-announces-a-delay-to-the-implementation-of-basel-3-1#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[2]</a></sup></sup>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;As part of the preparatory work to implement Basel 3.1, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation/key-initiatives/capital-requirements-directive-iv/basel-3-1-data-collection-exercise">PRA had indicated that it would conduct a firm data collection exercise</a>&nbsp;to inform an off-cycle review of firm-specific Pillar 2 capital requirements so that they could be updated at the same time as the implementation of Basel 3.1 standards. The stated deadline for firms to submit the data for the collection exercise was 31 March 2025.&nbsp;In light of the delay to implementation, we are immediately pausing this data collection exercise until further notice.</p>
<p>Also in light of the delay to implementation, the end-date of the time-window to join the Interim Capital Regime &ndash; previously set as 28 February 2025 &ndash; will be moved back. The PRA will provide further information in due course.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Two Sigma For Failing To Address Known Vulnerabilities In Its Investment Models - Firm Ignored Material Vulnerabilities For Years; Voluntarily Repaid Impacted Funds And Accounts $165 Million</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-charges-two-sigma-for-failing-to-address-known-vulnerabilities-in-its-invest/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-charges-two-sigma-for-failing-to-address-known-vulnerabilities-in-its-invest/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against New York-based investment advisers Two Sigma Investments LP and Two Sigma Advisers LP (collectively, Two Sigma) for breaching their fiduciary duties by failing to reasonably address known vulnerabilities in their investment models and for related compliance and supervisory failures, as well as for separately violating the Commission&rsquo;s whistleblower protection rule. Two Sigma voluntarily repaid impacted funds and accounts $165 million during the SEC&rsquo;s investigation and agreed to pay $90 million in civil penalties to settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, in or before March 2019, Two Sigma employees identified and recognized vulnerabilities in certain Two Sigma investment models that could negatively impact clients&rsquo; investment returns, but Two Sigma waited until August 2023 to address the issues. Despite recognizing these vulnerabilities, Two Sigma failed to adopt and implement written policies and procedures to address them and failed to supervise one of its employees who made unauthorized changes to more than a dozen models, which resulted in Two Sigma making investment decisions that it otherwise would not have made on behalf of its clients.</p>
<p>In addition, the SEC&rsquo;s order separately finds that Two Sigma violated the Commission&rsquo;s whistleblower protection rule by requiring departing individuals, in separation agreements, to state as fact that they had not filed a complaint with any governmental agency. This requirement, in effect, could identify whistleblowers and prohibit whistleblowers from receiving post-separation payments and benefits, both of which are actions to impede departing individuals from communicating directly with Commission staff about possible securities law violations, in violation of the whistleblower protection rule.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As investment advisers rely more heavily on models and advanced technology when investing client assets, the importance of a robust compliance program grows. When an investment adviser identifies material vulnerabilities to its core investment operations that may substantially impact client returns, it must address those vulnerabilities promptly and fully. Doing nothing for years is not the answer,&rdquo; said Sanjay Wadhwa, Acting Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement.&nbsp;&ldquo;Here, Two Sigma not only failed to respond reasonably to known vulnerabilities to its investment models, but also failed to adopt and implement reasonable policies and procedures governing such models. The federal securities laws require investment advisers like Two Sigma to take steps &ndash; both proactively and reactively &ndash; to minimize operational risks to protect their clients.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that Two Sigma Investments and Two Sigma Advisers willfully violated the antifraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Advisers Act&rsquo;s compliance rule, as well as Rule 21F-17(a) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which prohibits impeding an individual from communicating with SEC staff about a possible securities law violation. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, Two Sigma Investments and Two Sigma Advisers agreed to a cease-and-desist order imposing a censure and a penalty of $45 million each, totaling $90 million.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s continuing investigation is being conducted by Brian Kudon, David F. Benson, and Brian Fitzpatrick, and supervised by Lee A. Greenwood and Corey Schuster, all of the Enforcement Division&rsquo;s Asset Management Unit, as well as Christopher Colorado, senior trial counsel in the New York Regional Office, and Alan Lenarcic and Elcin Yildirim of the Division of Examinations&rsquo; Quantitative Analytics Unit. Jennifer Moldaver and Jennifer Duggins of the Division of Examinations&rsquo; Private Funds Unit and Carol Foehl of the Boston Regional Office assisted with the investigation.</p>

<p><i>[Chair Gary Gensler walking towards a coat closet. Text on screen: &ldquo;Heading to the last Office Hours with Gary Gensler recording&hellip;&rdquo; The Chair then knocks on the coat closer door and opens it.]</i></p>
<p>Hey team. We doing some more Office Hours?</p>
<p><i>[Office Hours Intro Animation]</i></p>
<p>What are the vast U.S. capital markets have to do with you? And what role does the SEC play in making sure that they work best for you?</p>
<p>You might think when I say capital markets, it's just the stock market, but it's so much more. Our capital markets, weighing in at $120 trillion in size, are five times larger than our entire banking system. And our capital markets touch nearly every part of our economy. They make it possible to take out a mortgage, an auto loan or credit card. Your employer may be raising money in the capital markets, or raising money from banks that then are going to the capital markets. And you see, even we as a nation borrow in our capital markets, it's something called the U.S. Treasury market. So it just touches all parts of our economy and that touches you.</p>
<p>Now how does the SEC fit into all of this? Well, 90 years ago, when President Roosevelt and Congress set up the Securities and Exchange Commission, they had just lived through the 1920s when fraudsters and Ponzi schemes took advantage of investors like yourselves. Roosevelt and Congress understood the importance of having common sense rules of the road.</p>
<p>I think of it this way, over the years I've slept better knowing that when one of my three daughters borrows the car keys, there are common-sense rules to protect them&mdash;stop signs, traffic lights, speed limits. There are laws against drunk driving, and there are cops on the street to enforce these laws. Now let's think about another thing. Let's think about football. What if there were no rules or referees? There'd be mayhem on the field and surely fans would lose confidence in the integrity of the game.</p>
<p>Well, it's just as true in the world of finance. Common-sense rules lower risk. And yes, they build trust in our capital markets that we might participate in them. The SEC fits in because we're this remarkable agency entrusted by Congress to do your work, the capital markets and enforce these common-sense rules of the road.</p>
<p>Our third chair, William O. Douglas, he said of the SEC that &ldquo;we are the investor&rsquo;s advocate.&rdquo; And over these last four years, I've had the great privilege to work alongside with the SEC&rsquo;s incredible talented staff. They are deeply committed to the mission of protecting you and everyday folks around this country in these capital markets. They also have the role of promoting capital formation, but ensuring that the markets in the middle work for investors and issuers alike.</p>
<p>One of the great privileges of the last four years has been engaging with you, the public, whether directly through meetings, through the many tens of thousands of comments that you've submitted on our rulemakings, through investor education, or, yes, through the tens of thousands of tips, complaints, and referrals you've sent us to help us do our jobs to protect you.</p>
<p>Well, there's another way that we've engaged with each other these last four years, and it's through these Office Hours. And I've thought it's important to explain what we were doing on your behalf and to meet you through these videos, whether we were talking about market structure, whether we were talking about the market plumbing like central clearing, the U.S. Treasury markets, or many other topics.</p>
<p>Before I wrap up, I just I think I'd be remiss not to say just one thing about public service. It's what we give back to our communities. We all do it in some form or fashion when we help out folks in our community. It could be family. It could be friends. It could be somebody at our synagogues or churches or mosques. It's just helping out our community.</p>
<p>Well, the great privilege is here at the SEC, there's 4,800 people strong that are doing that. They're helping the community, our great nation, 330 million strong.</p>
<p>I'll wrap up by saying what a privilege it is to work for you, for everyday folks looking to the markets to make a better life for their family. With that, I want to thank you and is that when we do the mic drop?</p>
<p><i>[Screen fades black and fades into Office Hours outtakes.]</i></p>
<p>I haven't read this. So how long is it?</p>
<p>We're going to have to do it at least twice because I'm going to goof around.</p>
<p>I'm ready. This law... I&rsquo;m sorry, can I go back? This law give...no, can I go back up?</p>
<p>She sells&hellip;she sells short sales by the seashore. She sells&hellip;she's, all right, sorry.</p>
<p>Oh, you want to do this with a different background?</p>
<p>So the dog is not hot If it doesn't have the bun?</p>
<p>She said she sells seashells by the seashore, but actually, she sold short those seashells by the sea shell shore.</p>
<p>That's a slam dunk.</p>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-announces-departure-of-director-of-international-affairs-yj-fischer/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that YJ Fischer, the Director of the Office of International Affairs (OIA) since August 2021, will leave her role on Jan. 20, 2025.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to thank YJ for her leadership of the Office of International Affairs,&rdquo; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. &ldquo;She has been a trusted advisor to and diplomat for this Commission in our relationships with regulators around the globe. I wish her very well in her next pursuits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Director for International Affairs, Ms. Fischer led the Commission&rsquo;s work in foreign jurisdictions to advance the agency&rsquo;s mission. During her tenure, OIA improved international enforcement cooperation in key jurisdictions, particularly regarding witness testimony, and access to audit workpapers and other financial records. OIA also addressed long-standing challenges to SEC examinations of market participants located overseas, systematized cooperation with counterparts during market stress events, and helped implement the requirements of the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, ensuring that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board could fully inspect and investigate public company auditors in China and Hong Kong. Finally, OIA grew its technical assistance program for foreign officials by expanding into remote programming and broadening the curriculum to address capital formation as a vehicle for fueling economic growth and prosperity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been an honor to work with such a talented and dedicated team over the past few years,&rdquo; said Ms. Fischer. &ldquo;OIA comprises the highest caliber public servants, and I am proud of what we&rsquo;ve accomplished together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prior to her arrival at the SEC, Ms. Fischer spent two decades conducting complex negotiations in foreign markets from both public and private sectors. During the Obama administration, she served at the U.S. State Department, where she launched a public-private infrastructure partnership to salvage a critical dam in Iraq, participated in UN-led negotiations for the Syrian conflict, and helped implement the Iran nuclear agreement. In the private sector, she worked on international policy at YouTube, oversaw global market entry for several start-ups, and secured multi-million-dollar government research and development investments. Earlier in her career, she practiced law at Kirkland and Ellis.</p>
<p>Ms. Fischer holds a bachelor&rsquo;s degree and a law degree from Columbia University. She is the recipient of awards including the State Department&rsquo;s Meritorious Honor Award and the Kirkland &amp; Ellis Pro Bono Service Award. She is a commissioned Kentucky Colonel, the highest title of honor bestowed by the Governor of Kentucky for the Commonwealth&rsquo;s ambassadors of goodwill and fellowship around the world.</p>

<title>EBA Publishes Its Peer Review On The Application Of Proportionality Under The Supervisory Review And Evaluation Process</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/eba-publishes-its-peer-review-on-the-application-of-proportionality-under-the-su/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<div>
<p>âThe European Banking Authority (EBA) today published its Peer Review on the application of proportionality under the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP). The Peer Review found that proportionality in the SREP, and in the liquidity assessment under the SREP, is largely implemented by the competent authorities under review, though with some adaptations to the local context and the risk profile of the institutions under their supervisory remit. However, the EBA set out a series of follow-up measures to address the deficiencies identified. In particular, the EBA encourages all competent authorities to ensure that they make use of the proportionality mechanisms embedded in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/activities/single-rulebook/regulatory-activities/supervisory-review-and-evaluation-process-srep-4" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">SREP Guidelines</a>. The EBA will also consider the outcome of this Peer Review in the context of the upcoming review of the SREP Guidelines.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>âThe Peer Review was conducted on six competent authorities selected to be broadly representative of the range of prudential supervisors across the EU. Despite the overall positive results of the peer review on the application on proportionality in SREP and in the liquidity risk assessment under SREP, the deficiencies identified concerned consistency of implementation of the SREP Guidelines, sources used for SREP categorisation and implementation of the minimum supervisory engagement model. While these do not lead to material risks being unaddressed, they undermine the aim of the SREP Guidelines of having a more consistent approach across the EU.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>âTo address these deficiencies, the EBA identified a number of follow-up measures addressed to all competent authorities across the European Economic Area (EEA). These include incorporating the classification of &lsquo;large&rsquo; and &lsquo;small and non-complex&rsquo; institutions under the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) into the categorisation of institutions for SREP purposes, and aligning to the minimum supervisory engagement model and in the area of liquidity stress testing.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>âIn addition, the Report sets out a number of best practices observed such as the use of benchmarking tools, &lsquo;pilot inspections&rsquo; where several institutions use the same service provider, and spot checks on the quality, accuracy and reliability of information provided by institutions in self-assessment questionnaires.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>ââThe EBA strongly encourages the use of provisions included in the SREP Guidelines for the application of proportionality in the SREP. The Peer Review exercise found that some of these were not being used in practice or not to their full extent. Examples include provisions allowing supervisors to:&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>âadapting the focus and granularity of the SREP assessments according to the risk profile of the institution regardless of their categorisation;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>âusing tailored methodologies for institutions with similar risk profiles; and,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>âconducting thematic SREP assessments on multiple institutions as a single assessment (&lsquo;clustering&rsquo;).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h4>âLegal basis and next steps</h4>
</div>
<div>
<p>âThe EBA will conduct a follow-up peer review of the implementation of the measures included in the Report in two years.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>âThe EBA will consider the outcome of this Peer Review in the context of the upcoming review of the SREP Guidelines. In particular, the EBA will consider providing more clarity on how the focus and granularity of the SREP assessment could be adapted to the risk profile of the institution and on the scope and level of assessments to be performed under the minimum supervisory engagement model.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<title>ISDA: Marking A Milestone â IQ January 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-marking-a-milestone-iq-january-2025/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-marking-a-milestone-iq-january-2025/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It was a different time and a very different market, but 1985 remains a seminal year in the history of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives &ndash; the year that ISDA was established and the very first industry standard document was published. While modest in its scope and ambitions, the Code of Standard Wording, Assumptions and Provisions for Swaps (Code of SWAPS) put in place a new status quo, based on the recognition that collaboration was the best way to solve shared industry challenges. Forty years on, collaboration remains at the heart of everything ISDA has achieved.</p>
<p>This edition of&nbsp;<span>IQ</span>&nbsp;kicks off a year of publications and events to mark ISDA&rsquo;s 40th anniversary by reflecting on some of the key documentation milestones, including the Code of SWAPS and the ISDA Master Agreement, as well as the development of protocols. It also recounts the story of how a group of bankers and lawyers set aside their competitive differences to discuss what could be done to alleviate the documentation bottlenecks in the nascent OTC derivatives market, and how that led to the formation of ISDA.</p>
<p>The anniversary year is an opportunity to share the perspectives of the many visionaries who have been responsible for ISDA&rsquo;s successes over the years &ndash; from the senior executives and board members to the lawyers and regulators. This edition features a roundtable with seven of those luminaries and an interview with Ashley Alder, chair of the UK Financial Conduct Authority.</p>
<p>In its 40th year, ISDA remains firmly focused on the future, with a wide-ranging work program for 2025. Among other projects, this year will see further progress on a landmark review of the 1998 FX and Currency Option Definitions, a continued push towards greater digitization of documentation and the planned launch of the ISDA Notices Hub.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a time of change on the ISDA board of directors, as Eric Litvack recently stepped down from his role as chairman. Reflecting on his 10 years at the helm, Litvack describes ISDA as &ldquo;professional, accountable and goals-driven&rdquo;, aiming at the very highest standards and delivering exceptional breadth of value.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<span dir="ltr" lang="fr">Autorit&eacute; des march&eacute;s financiers</span>&nbsp;(the &ldquo;<span dir="ltr" lang="fr">AMF</span>&rdquo;) today unveiled its updated&nbsp;<a href="https://lautorite.qc.ca/en/professionals/insurers/supervisory-framework">Supervisory Framework for Financial Institutions and Credit Assessment Agents</a>.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<span dir="ltr" lang="fr">AMF</span>&nbsp;has updated its supervisory approach to adjust for the accelerated pace of change in the financial sector. The updated approach is more forward-looking and will enable the AMF to be more proactive in intervening with regulated entities. In addition to promoting transparent communications with regulated entities, the new approach provides financial institutions and credit assessment agents with predictability.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Institutions are operating in an environment of unprecedented uncertainty, and our update to the supervisory framework focuses on the resilience of industry members and the protection of consumers doing business with them,&rdquo; said Patrick D&eacute;ry,&nbsp;<span dir="ltr" lang="fr">AMF</span>&nbsp;Superintendent of Financial Institutions. &ldquo;The adjustments we have made to our practices will enable us to more effectively coordinate our supervisory activities based on significant and rapid changes in risks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The changes will also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide institutions with greater predictability and a window into how the&nbsp;<span dir="ltr" lang="fr">AMF</span>, as a prudential regulator, carries out its mission</li>
<li>Support clear communications with institutions&rsquo; boards of directors and senior management regarding areas for improvement or about emerging issues not yet been fully integrated into existing practices</li>
<li>Specifically incorporate the assessment of commercial practice risk for clients so as to more clearly highlight the impact on clients</li>
<li>Introduce an improved risk profile for assessing regulated entity resilience</li>
</ul>
<p>An&nbsp;<a href="https://lautorite.qc.ca/en/professionals/insurers/supervisory-framework#c105435">information video</a>&nbsp;covering the main changes to the supervisory framework is available on the&nbsp;<span dir="ltr" lang="fr">AMF</span>&nbsp;website.</p>

<p>The European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) today published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-01/ESMA75-453128700-1391_Joint_Report_on_recent_developments_in_crypto-assets__Art_142_MiCA_.pdf">Joint Report on recent developments in crypto-assets</a>, analysing decentralised finance (DeFi) and crypto lending, borrowing and staking. This publication is the EBA and ESMA&rsquo;s contribution to the European Commission&rsquo;s report to the European Parliament and Council under Article 142 of the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR).</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>EBA and ESMA find that DeFi remains a niche phenomenon, with value locked in DeFi protocols representing 4% of all crypto-asset market value at the global level. The report also sets out that EU adoption of DeFi, while above the global average, is lower than other developed economies (e.g. the US, South Korea).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EBA and ESMA observe that the number of DeFi hacks and the value of stolen crypto-assets has generally evolved in correlation with the DeFi market size. Since flows on decentralised exchanges represent 10% of spot crypto trading volumes globally, DeFi protocols present significant risks of money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF).</p>
<p>The EBA and ESMA find the implications of maximal extractable value (MEV) on DeFi markets are widespread in DeFi and negative externalities of MEV would require technical solutions.</p>
<p>On the lending, borrowing and staking of crypto-assets, the report contains an analysis of the main types and typical features of the business models observed in the market, in both centralised and decentralised forms. These services are offered by a number of crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) in EU jurisdictions which in some cases also offer regulated crypto-asset services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the existing (limited) evidence, there appears to be limited engagement of EU consumers and financial institutions with crypto lending, borrowing and staking services. The report sets out and assesses the specific risks associated with each of them, such as excessive leverage, information asymmetries, exposure to ML/TF risks, and systemic risks arising from re-hypothecation and collateral chains, procyclicality and interconnectedness. In particular, some users may receive insufficient information on the terms and conditions of these services in areas such as fees, interest rates paid or yields, changes to collateral requirements, among other relevant disclosures. However, the EBA and ESMA have not identified current risks from a financial stability perspective. &nbsp;</p>
<h4><span>Background and next steps</span></h4>
<p>Article 142 of MiCAR mandates the European Commission (EC) to submit, after consulting the EBA and ESMA, a report to the European Parliament and Council on recent developments in crypto-assets. On the basis of that provision, the EC is mandated to assess, among others, a) the development of DeFi in crypto-asset markets and the appropriate regulatory treatment of decentralised crypto-asset systems without an issuer or CASPs, including an assessment of the need for and feasibility of regulating DeFi; and b) the feasibility and necessity of regulating the lending and borrowing of crypto-assets. In a letter dated 9 February 2024, the EC requested that EBA and ESMA provide a contribution focusing on certain elements related to DeFi and the lending and borrowing of crypto-assets, including staking.</p>
<p>The EBA and ESMA will continue to assess market developments as part of their ongoing mandate to monitor innovative activities in the EU banking, payments and securities sectors.</p>

<title>Russell US Indexes To Move To A Semi-Annual Reconstitution Frequency From 2026</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="VerticalSpacing VerticalSpacing--m">
<div class="RichText   ">
<ul>
<li>Reconstitution of Russell US Indexes will be held semi-annually in June and November from 2026</li>
<li>Decision based on data analysis and market consultation undertaken in response to the recent evolution of market dynamics and increased volatility</li>
<li>Moving Russell US Indexes to a semi-annual reconstitution frequency supports index goals of maintaining accurate representation of the US equity market and ensuring practical usability of the indexes&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="VerticalSpacing VerticalSpacing--l">
<div class="RichText   ">
<p>FTSE Russell, the global index provider, today announces that the Russell US Indexes reconstitution will move to a semi-annual frequency in 2026, with rebalancing continuing on the fourth Friday in June and with the additional implementation date of the second Friday in November.</p>
<p>Russell US Indexes are currently reconstituted annually in June and based on more recent market dynamics and increased volatility, FTSE Russell explored the impact of reconstituting the Russell US Indexes semi-annually. Based on this evaluation, FTSE Russell announces the decision to add a semi-annual Russell US Indexes reconstitution on the second Friday of November, beginning November 2026, contingent on a successful parallel test run in November 2025.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="VerticalSpacing VerticalSpacing--l">
<div class="RichText   ">
<p><span>Commenting on moving the Russell US Indexes to a semi-annual reconstitution, Catherine Yoshimoto, Director, Product Management of FTSE Russell, said:</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Since their inception, regular reconstitutions have been a critical part of maintaining the Russell US Indexes by accurately reflecting the ever-changing US equity market. With increased volatility within US equity markets over the past five years, compared to the prior fifteen years, moving to a semi-annual Russell reconstitution frequency to update membership changes earlier will enable greater alignment with the dynamic changes in the current market environment.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Proposed semi-annual reconstitution methodology overview:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The November semi-annual reconstitution will apply the Russell US Indexes construction rules across the size indexes such as the Russell 1000<span>&reg;</span>&nbsp;and Russell 2000<span>&reg;</span>&nbsp;Indexes, however Russell US Style Index changes will be made only to new additions or membership movements (such as for a stock moving from the Russell 1000 Index to the Russell 2000 Index and vice versa) due to the higher projected turnover of Growth and Value Style changes (Russell US Style Indexes will continue to be rebalanced completely in June).</li>
<li>The quarterly December IPO inclusion and float/share changes will be incorporated into the November semi-annual Russell reconstitution.</li>
<li>Derived indices, e.g. Russell factor indices, which currently rebalance in December, will also be rebalanced in November.</li>
<li>The non-Russell, FTSE equity indices will continue with their quarterly December reviews, however cut-off dates will be aligned with those of the Russell US Indexes semi-annual reconstitution in November.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Fiona Bassett, CEO of FTSE Russell, said:</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The annual Russell reconstitution in June is a major event within the US equity market, however, it is important to ensure the Russell US Indexes &ndash; which recently celebrated its 41<span>st</span>&nbsp;anniversary &ndash; continue to evolve to reflect the dynamic US economy. One of the most attractive features of the Russell US Indexes is that they are designed to represent the US equity market objectively in terms of capitalization and style. Moving to a semi-annual reconstitution frequency will ensure that the Russell US Indexes continue to represent the market, while maintaining the fundamental purpose of the index as a practical portfolio benchmark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As adoption of the Russell US Indexes has grown, so has the size of the trade at the annual Russell reconstitution. Since 2019, the dollar amount traded at the close of Russell reconstitution day across Nasdaq and NYSE exchanges has exceeded $100 billion; at market close of the June 2024 reconstitution $219.6 billion was traded.</p>
<p>Approximately $10.6 trillion in assets were benchmarked (by both active and passive funds) to the Russell US Indexes (including growth and value) as of the end of December 2023. Of this total AUM, approximately $2 trillion of the assets were passive, and ETF assets tracking a Russell US index (including styles, sectors, factors, etc.) stood at $658 billion as of the end of September 2024.</p>
<p>At launch in 1984, the Russell US Indexes were reconstituted quarterly, then semi-annually from 1987, and then annually from June 1989 onwards. Balancing representation and turnover have always been key considerations in determining the appropriate frequency of the Russell US Indexes reconstitution.</p>

<title>The EBA Consults On Guidelines On ESG Scenario Analysis</title>

<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today launched a public consultation on its draft Guidelines on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) scenario analysis. The draft Guidelines set out expectations for institutions when adopting forward-looking approaches and incorporating the use of scenario analysis as part of their management framework to test institutions&rsquo; financial and business model resilience to the negative impacts of ESG factors. They complement the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-01/fb22982a-d69d-42cc-9d62-1023497ad58a/Final%20Guidelines%20on%20the%20management%20of%20ESG%20risks.pdf"><span>EBA Guidelines on the management of ESG risks</span></a><span>, published on 9 January this year. The consultation runs until 16&nbsp;April&nbsp;2025.</span></p>
<p>Climate change, environmental degradation, social issues and other environmental, social and governance factors are posing considerable challenges for the economy that impact the financial sector. The risk profile and business model of institutions may be affected by ESG risks, in particular environmental risks through transition and physical risk drivers.</p>
<p>To ensure the safety and soundness of institutions in the short, medium and long term, the Guidelines set out expectations for developing a framework and using scenarios to support thinking and decision-making in a changing economic and physical environment. As part of this, the Guidelines set out principles for testing the financial resilience, capital and liquidity, of an institution to ESG-related shocks, starting with climate, and the resilience of its business model to different plausible scenarios, including the achievement of climate neutrality in the EU by&nbsp;2050.</p>
<h4>Consultation process</h4>
<p>Comments to the consultation paper can be sent by clicking on the "send your comments" on the EBA's consultation page. The deadline for the submission of comments is 16 April 2025. The EBA will consider the feedback received to this consultation when finalising the Guidelines.</p>
<p>All contributions received will be published following the end of the consultation, unless requested otherwise.</p>
<p>The EBA will hold a virtual public hearing on the consultation paper on 17 March 2025 from 14:30 to 16:00 CET. The EBA invites interested stakeholders to register using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/public-hearing-guidelines-esg-scenario-analysis" title="Public hearing on Guidelines on ESG scenario analysis">this link</a>&nbsp;by 13 March 2025 at 16:00. The dial-in details will be communicated to those who have registered for the meeting.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<p>The draft Guidelines were developed in line with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document_library/Publications/Reports/2022/ESG%20roadmap/1045378/EBA%20Roadmap%20on%20Sustainable%20Finance.pdf">EBA Roadmap on Sustainable Finance</a>&nbsp;and as part of the planned EBA&rsquo;s actions&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-12/9dc534e8-8a3d-438f-88e3-bc86e623d99e/EBA%20Roadmap%20on%20strengthening%20the%20prudential%20framework_1.pdf">&nbsp;for the implementation of the EU banking package</a>. Together with the Guidelines on the management of ESG risks, they deliver on the mandate laid down in Article 87(a)5 of the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD6), (Directive 2013/36/EU).&nbsp;</p>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/saudi-exchange-launches-its-fixed-income-market-making-framework/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Saudi Exchange announced the launch of its Fixed Income Market Making Framework which intends to ensure the availability of secondary market liquidity and increase price formation efficiency in the Saudi capital market.</p>
<p>The introduction of the Fixed Income Market Making Framework is a significant step in the further development of the Saudi capital market, cementing its position as a leading regional financial hub, under the directives of Vision 2030&rsquo;s Financial Sector Development Program.</p>
<p>The new Fixed Income Market Making Framework is a strategic initiative designed to stimulate secondary market activity on the fixed income market, This follows the successful onboarding of Market Makers on the Equities and Derivatives Market in 2023. This new framework aims to enhance liquidity, facilitating more frequent transactions, and thereby making the market more attractive to both domestic and international investors. The launch will also contribute significantly to a deeper and more balanced Saudi capital market.</p>
<p>Commenting on the launch, Mohammed Al Rumaih, CEO of the Saudi Exchange said, &ldquo;As the Saudi capital market continues to evolve, we have seen an increase in debt issuances in recent years. In response to this growing demand, we have introduced a new Fixed Income Market Making Framework demonstrating our continued efforts to support the development and depth of the debt market and position the Saudi Exchange as a global destination in this field. We aim to enhance the experience of investing in fixed income instruments and attract a broader range of investors both regionally and internationally.</p>
<p>Under the Market Making Regulations, Market Makers are required to be Exchange Members. These Exchange Members will be able to conduct market making activities in the capacity of principal on its own account or as an agent on behalf of clients. The Market Maker continuously enters buying and selling orders for the relevant listed debt security during official trading hours to ensure the availability of liquidity for that listed debt security in accordance with the Market Making Regulations.</p>
<p>Saudi Exchange will publish on its website a list of Market Makers and the securities on which they are performing this activity, and will provide incentives after the obligations are met.</p>
<p>For more information on the Saudi Exchange&rsquo;s Market Making Framework, please visit:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.saudiexchange.sa/wps/portal/saudiexchange/trading/participants-directory/market-makers/obligations-incentives/!ut/p/z1/lZBNDoIwFITP4gk6FFq6RQPVRH4KFKEbw8IYjKIL4_lt3Emjgdm95JvJvCGGtMSM_Ws498_hPvZXe3eGH1nEQbcCuagTgMt4ozzp-ZCUHCaALmML1GGmygZWxCzzp5JDZZHKacggG2-hH1XBoJIi9fcoIcHn-fFD0Yz-ZoK4C3wDUFrYilWyZgIUCJwEd4NJgvvkB_jzRXUayeOmtW4x7C7B6g0evvtH/?uri=nm:oid:Z6_5A602H80O8URE06GT7NQRV0000" target="_blank">Obligations and Incentives</a></p>

<title>U.S. Department Of The Treasury Releases Guidance On Domestic Content Bonus For Clean Energy Credits - Bonus Will Help Boost American Manufacturing Of Solar Wafers And Other Components Critical For U.S. Energy Security</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-department-of-the-treasury-releases-guidance-on-domestic-content-bonus-for/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) are releasing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-25-08.pdf">additional guidance</a>&nbsp;on the Inflation Reduction Act&rsquo;s domestic content bonus for Clean Electricity Production and Investment Tax Credits.</p>
<p>The domestic content bonus boosts American manufacturing of iron, steel, and manufactured products used in clean energy projects like solar and wind farms, helping to ensure that American workers and American companies continue to benefit from investments in the clean energy economy. Under the Biden-Harris Administration, companies have announced more than $196 billion in investments in clean power and $92 billion in clean energy manufacturing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ensuring American workers are building the growing clean energy economy is a top priority for the Biden-Harris Administration,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>U.S. Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo</span>. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s guidance will help fuel America&rsquo;s clean energy investment and manufacturing boom and create good-paying jobs.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The domestic content bonus is one of several tax incentives that are boosting U.S. manufacturing, alongside the advanced manufacturing production credit (45X), the qualifying advanced energy project credit (48C), and the CHIPS advanced manufacturing investment credit (48D), as well as incentives to produce clean energy that are increasing demand for components.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The guidance Treasury released today updates and builds upon the domestic content safe harbor that Treasury and the IRS published in May of 2024 that provides clean energy developers the option to rely on default cost percentages provided by Department of Energy (in lieu of obtaining direct cost information from suppliers) to determine eligibility for the domestic content bonus.&nbsp;&nbsp; Today&rsquo;s guidance reflects improved default values that more closely align with the characteristics and costs of applicable project components and manufactured product components in the marketplace, as analyzed by the Department of Energy.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s guidance establishes optional alternative cost percentages for developers of solar projects that use solar cells manufactured with domestically-produced wafers to appropriately recognize cost differentials for manufacturers who use cells made with domestic wafers, thereby enhancing incentives for onshoring wafer manufacturing.</p>
<p>The guidance also provides a variety of updates to clarify use of the safe harbor tables, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Solar:&nbsp;</span>The updated tables update cost percentages, make certain adjustments to the characterizations of applicable project components and manufactured product components, and offer clarifying definitions.</li>
<li><span>Domestic Solar Wafers:</span>&nbsp;For each solar table, there are new optional alternative cost percentages for projects using domestic solar cells manufactured with domestic wafers.</li>
<li><span>Land-Based Wind:&nbsp;</span>The updated table for Land-Based Wind includes minor adjustments to the characterizations of applicable project components and manufactured product components.&nbsp;</li>
<li><span>Battery Electric Storage System (BESS):</span>&nbsp;The updated table updates cost percentages, makes certain adjustments to the characterizations of applicable project components and manufactured product components, and offers clarifying definitions.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, today&rsquo;s guidance provides additional clarity on the use of the tables for retrofits, projects utilizing elective pay (also known as direct pay), as well as carport and floating solar projects. Taxpayers may utilize the safe harbor tables included in this guidance for projects beginning construction up to 90 days after the release of further guidance.</p>

<title>FSB Develops Analytical Framework And Toolkit To Assess Climate-Related Vulnerabilities</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fsb-develops-analytical-framework-and-toolkit-to-assess-climate-related-vulnerab/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fsb-develops-analytical-framework-and-toolkit-to-assess-climate-related-vulnerab/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a><span>Analytical framework will help the FSB and its members assess the build-up of climate-related vulnerabilities in the global financial system.</span></a></li>
<li><span>A new toolkit of forward-looking metrics based on this framework will help identify the drivers of climate risks and related exposures in the financial system and real economy, and to quantify their financial impact.</span></li>
<li><span>The framework and toolkit will be refined as understanding of climate-related vulnerabilities evolves and as methodological and data issues are resolved.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) today published a report on<em>&nbsp;</em>the&nbsp;<a class="status-publish" href="https://www.fsb.org/2025/01/assessment-of-climate-related-vulnerabilities-analytical-framework-and-toolkit/">assessment of climate-related vulnerabilities</a>. Building on the&nbsp;<a class="status-publish" href="https://www.fsb.org/2021/09/fsb-financial-stability-surveillance-framework/">FSB Financial Stability Surveillance Framework</a>&nbsp;and work carried out by members, the report provides an analytical framework and toolkit to assess climate-related vulnerabilities, particularly from a cross-border and cross-sectoral perspective.</p>
<p>Climate shocks trigger the typical vulnerabilities in financial stability assessments &ndash; such as credit, market and liquidity risks &ndash; but they are more complicated to analyse given their nature and uncertainties around timing and magnitude. The analytical framework traces how physical and transition climate risks can be transmitted and amplified within the global financial system.</p>
<p>A toolkit accompanying the framework comprises three categories of metrics to monitor climate-related vulnerabilities from a forward-looking perspective. These are: (i)&nbsp;<em>proxies</em>&nbsp;to provide early signals on potential drivers of transition and physical risks; (ii)&nbsp;<em>exposure metrics</em>&nbsp;to gauge the extent of direct and indirect exposures in the real economy and the financial system; and (iii)&nbsp;<em>risk metrics</em>&nbsp;to quantify the impacts for financial institutions and the system as a whole. While these metrics are already used by some FSB members domestically, various methodological and data challenges need to be overcome for them to be used for global monitoring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The framework provides a forward-looking approach to be able to capture the unique aspects of climate risks while staying rooted in traditional financial stability analysis&rdquo;, said Sarah Breeden, Deputy Governor for Financial Stability at the Bank of England and Chair of the FSB group that prepared the report. Nellie Liang, Under Secretary for Domestic Finance at the US Treasury Department and Chair of the Standing Committee on Assessment of Vulnerabilities (SCAV) that oversaw the preparation of the report added: &ldquo;The framework is a welcome addition to the FSB&rsquo;s financial stability surveillance. The case study in the report examining the potential consequences of the crystallisation of climate physical risks via real estate markets and changes in insurance coverage illustrates how the framework can be applied in practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The framework and toolkit are live documents, subject to refinement as understanding evolves on how climate-related vulnerabilities could affect financial stability. The FSB will continue to develop the framework by operationalising the toolkit and conducting in-depth analyses of specific climate vulnerabilities that may have global financial stability implications.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h2>
<p>The FSB&rsquo;s work to assess climate-related vulnerabilities forms part of the&nbsp;<a class="status-publish" href="https://www.fsb.org/2021/07/fsb-roadmap-for-addressing-climate-related-financial-risks/">FSB Roadmap to Address Climate-related Financial Risks</a>. The Roadmap, which was endorsed by G20 Leaders in July 2021, outlines key actions to be taken by standard-setting bodies and international organisations over a multi-year period in four policy areas: firm-level disclosures, data, vulnerabilities analysis, and regulatory and supervisory practices and tools.</p>
<p>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. The FSB also conducts outreach with approximately 70 other jurisdictions through its six Regional Consultative Groups.</p>
<p>The FSB is chaired by Klaas Knot, President of De Nederlandsche Bank. The FSB Secretariat is located in Basel, Switzerland and hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>

<title>The Canton Network And QCP Announce Crypto Derivatives Margining Collaboration</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-canton-network-and-qcp-announce-crypto-derivatives-margining-collaboration/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-canton-network-and-qcp-announce-crypto-derivatives-margining-collaboration/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canton Network today announced the initiation of a project in partnership with Digital Asset, QCP, and a select group of their counterparties as the initial users. This solution will create a cutting-edge, on-chain collateral and margin management solution for bilateral derivatives, leveraging the Canton Network's unique privacy capabilities.</p>
<p>The project will address the inefficiencies and constraints the crypto derivatives market has experienced due to the absence of comprehensive and accessible regulatory frameworks. Existing bilateral markets are often fully or over-collateralized, creating capital inefficiencies, while the use of tri-party agents for collateral management adds additional cost burdens. Digital Asset's collaboration with these leading market participants will introduce an automated and cost-effective alternative powered by the Canton Network.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This collaboration underscores Digital Asset's dedication to revolutionizing market infrastructure through innovative, blockchain-powered solutions within the Canton Network,&rdquo;&nbsp;<b>said Georg Schneider, Head of Financial Products at Digital Asset.</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;We are excited to bring privacy to on-chain collateral management, which will allow for the automated flow of funds between counterparties in a secure way without publicly disclosing open derivatives positions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are excited to spearhead this initiative with the Canton Network to redefine the future of derivatives markets,"&nbsp;<b>said Darius Sit, Founder and CIO at QCP.</b>&nbsp;"Its unique ability to deliver privacy forms the foundation for a groundbreaking global collateral network, enabling seamless and secure connections across trading venues, brokers, investors, and FMIs. By addressing inefficiencies in collateral management, this initiative reinforces our commitment to providing clients with trusted, efficient, and scalable solutions that redefine market standards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The collaboration will deliver a solution with several key capabilities, including on-chain collateral agreements encoded as smart contracts to allow for automatic execution and enforcement of terms in line with ISDA CSA Initial and Variation Margin compliance requirements. Using the Canton Network&rsquo;s shared ledger, parties gain real-time access to a single source of truth, streamlined automated margin workflows, instant tokenized collateral pledging, and automated dispute resolution. The solution also ensures the privacy of collateral transactions, limiting the access of confidential terms and on-chain movements to the relevant counterparties.</p>
<p>The ability to provide on-chain collateral and margin management for bilateral derivatives on the Canton Network will provide several key advantages: 24/7 margining regimes where margin can be paid on-demand, shorter margin cycles, and the incorporation of stablecoins and RWAs in the Canton Network.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Amid the surge in stablecoin market capitalisation, leading crypto bank AMINA has removed custody fees for Stablecoin Rewards Account clients holding USDC in both hot and cold storage, with EURC set to be added soon.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>AMINA&rsquo;s Stablecoin Rewards account offers both </span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://aminagroup.com/individuals/stablecoin-rewards-account/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>individuals</span></a><span> and </span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://aminagroup.com/corporates/stablecoin-rewards-account/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>businesses</span></a><span> fee-free custody alongside compelling benefits, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr"> <span>Quarterly rewards on USDC holdings, providing the same benefits typically associated with fiat, but without the traditional banking fees.</span> </li>
<li dir="ltr"> <span>Clients have the confidence that their stablecoins will never be lent out, moved or reinvested.</span> </li>
<li dir="ltr"> <span>Assets safeguarded in segregated wallets and held off balance sheet, which ensures they remain independent from AMINA&rsquo;s liabilities &ndash; eliminating counterparty risk.&nbsp;</span> </li>
<li dir="ltr"> <span>The secure and private asset vault clients expect from a Swiss bank, seamlessly combined with the advanced protection of cutting-edge custody technology.</span></li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This offering represents a key milestone in the bank's ongoing commitment to driving stablecoin adoption and delivering value to clients worldwide. USDC and EURC are stablecoins, digital currencies pegged to the US dollar and euro, respectively. Fully backed 1:1 by reserves, they offer stability and global reach for holders. By enabling faster, more cost-efficient transactions, they provide businesses and individuals with enhanced liquidity within the crypto ecosystem. Widely used for digital transactions, remittances, and as a store of value, these stablecoins align with and support AMINA's mission to advance and empower the crypto industry.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://aminagroup.com/about-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>Myles Harrison</span></a><span>, Chief Product Officer at AMINA Bank, said: &ldquo;As one of the first regulated banks to offer fee-free custody of USDC with rewards on holdings across both hot and cold wallets, AMINA Bank is solidifying its commitment to advancing the growth and adoption of stablecoins. This offering provides a great addition to the products that help our clients thrive in the world of crypto. We will soon expand this offering to include EURC, further enhancing the stablecoin ecosystem.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Eligible USDC holders will receive quarterly rewards directly from AMINA Bank, delivering ongoing value.</span></p>

<p><span><span>For instance, India, Japan, Australia, South Korea and Thailand experienced improvement in deal volume by 13.7%, 30.2%, 6.7%, 8.2% and</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>6.5%, respectively, during 2024 compared to the previous year.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>On the other hand, China, Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Indonesia and New Zealand witnessed their respective deal volume decline by 20.8%, 13%, 10.6%, 3.6%, 33.7% and 8.2% in 2024 compared to 2023.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Meanwhile, the trend across different deal types also remained a mixed bag for the APAC region. While M&amp;A deals volume grew by 5.9% during 2024 over 2023, the number of private equity and venture financing deals declined by 8.8%, and 8.9% YoY, respectively.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Bose concludes: &ldquo;APAC&rsquo;s ability to outpace other regions reflects the region's dynamic and evolving market landscape. The performance of key markets such as India and Japan suggest that targeted growth strategies and regional resilience continue to offer significant opportunities for investors and businesses looking to navigate a challenging global environment.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p>To better streamline multi-asset post-trade processing and operational reporting,&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.broadridge.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc.</a>&nbsp;(NYSE: BR), a global Fintech leader, today announced it added an GenAI-powered advanced analytics feature to its platform.

<h4><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">KEY POINTS</span></b></h4>
<ul>
<li>SET Carbon, the anticipated carbon footprint management platform is collaboratively launched with the SET-DCCE- EXIM BANK partnership on January 16.</li>
<li>The new platform provides a more cost-effective and reliable tool, integrating with government database to avoid redundant reporting. It also enhances access to green finance and prepares businesses for increasingly stringent environmental regulations.</li>
</ul>
</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p><b>SET President Asadej Kongsiri</b><b> </b>today<b> </b>announced the launch of SET Carbon that the platform has been developed in response to escalating demands for carbon footprint transparency from government agencies and investors. With only 30 percent of Thai listed companies currently achieving verified carbon footprint disclosure in 2024, the platform addresses a critical market need for tools that enable compliance with increasingly stringent regulations, and also enhance access to green financing. SET Carbon offers businesses a cost-effective and reliable solution for comprehensive carbon footprint calculation and data management. SET also signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Department of Climate Change and Environment (DCCE) and Export-Import Bank of Thailand (EXIM Bank) to establish an end-to-end data management ecosystem through SET Carbon, from upstream data collection to downstream processing for green financial product development. The collaboration will reduce the duplication in reporting and expand funding access for Thai businesses.</p>
<p><b>DCCE Director-General Phirun Saiyasitpanich</b> highlighted the platform's alignment with Thailand's upcoming Climate Change Act. Following the National Climate Change Policy Committee's approval of the draft legislation in December 2024, the Act is scheduled for cabinet consideration in January 2025. The legislation will introduce crucial mechanisms including the Climate Fund, Thailand Taxonomy, and Carbon Pricing schemes, designed to balance regulatory enforcement with supportive measures for Thailand's transition to a low-carbon economy, and also protect national interests within international trade frameworks amid global climate change efforts.</p>
<p>This collaboration between SET and DCCE through the MOU marks a step towards building robust infrastructure to facilitate and support the private sector&rsquo;s reporting under the forthcoming legislation. The Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) will be integrated with the voluntary carbon credit program to drive success within the capital market, advance Thailand's greenhouse gas reduction goals and create sustainable economic opportunities for stakeholders.</p>
<p><b>EXIM BANK President Rak Vorrakitpokatorn</b><b> </b>reinforced the critical role of climate finance in fostering sustainable and balanced development across economic, social, and environmental dimensions, highlighting global demand for climate finance continues to surge. As a green development bank, EXIM Bank is intensifying efforts to bridge Thailand's climate finance gap by empowering businesses to accelerate their green transformation and adopt carbon footprint reporting based on international standards. This approach enhances transparency and credibility for projects targeting greenhouse gas reduction and sustainable development. To support businesses in managing their carbon footprint across value chains, EXIM Bank is offering&nbsp;preferential financing solutions, including working capital facilities at special interest rates starting from 1.99 percent per annum, with a three-year average rate of 4.99 percent per annum.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>This tripartite partnership will establish a comprehensive sustainability data ecosystem and streamline sustainability reporting processes for Thai businesses with a more efficient disclosure. &nbsp;This database will be leveraged to create supporting mechanisms for Thai businesses in order to foster their sustainable growth and strengthen their global competitiveness.</p>
<p>For more information about SET Carbon system, please visit www.setlink.set.or.th or contact Sustainability Service Development Department, The Stock Exchange of Thailand, at Tel. +66 (0) 2009 9887 or +66 (0) 2009 9868.</p>

<title>ASIC Appoints Scott Gregson As CEO</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-appoints-scott-gregson-as-ceo/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-appoints-scott-gregson-as-ceo/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC has appointed Scott Gregson as Chief Executive Officer.</p>
<p>Mr Gregson will join ASIC on 17 March 2025 following a nearly 30 year career with the ACCC and takes over from ASIC&rsquo;s retiring interim CEO Greg Yanco.</p>
<p>ASIC Chair Joe Longo said Mr Gregson had stood out in an executive search of domestic and international candidates.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Scott is an impressive leader and will bring extensive experience to this important role at ASIC,&rsquo; Mr Longo said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;His commitment to achieving regulatory outcomes that benefit all Australians makes him a strong addition to support ASIC&rsquo;s commission and head the agency&rsquo;s executive leadership team.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Longo said Mr Gregson&rsquo;s appointment was the next step in ASIC&rsquo;s transformation following the organisation&rsquo;s most significant redesign in 15 years, and follows appointments in the past 12 months of new Executive Directors for Enforcement and Compliance, Regulation and Supervision, Data, Digital and Technology and a new Chief People, Culture and Transformation Officer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As ASIC enters the next phase of the program of transformation we began three years ago, Scott&rsquo;s experience supporting digital and technology delivery, and his pedigree in enforcement and compliance, will continue to ensure ASIC is well placed to meet future challenges.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Longo thanked retiring interim CEO Greg Yanco for his contribution to helping make ASIC a modern, confident and ambitious regulator.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Greg has been an integral part of Australia&rsquo;s financial services landscape not just in his various senior executive roles at ASIC, but previously at the ASX,&rsquo; Mr Longo said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;On behalf of all of ASIC, I thank Greg for his exemplary service, dedication and work ethic, and we wish him all the best for the future.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Gregson said he was looking forward to being part of ASIC&rsquo;s continued transformation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The momentum ASIC is showing in its work and impact is very appealing for me,&rsquo; Mr Gregson said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In an increasingly complex world with heightened cost of living pressures, the work of ASIC is more important than ever and I look forward to taking the step up and helping ASIC meet the challenges ahead.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Mr Gregson is currently the ACCC&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer (previously Chief Operating Officer). He commenced work at the agency as a graduate in 1996.</p>
<p>Mr Gregson previously served in Executive General Manager roles for mergers and enforcement. He has spent much of his time at the ACCC in investigation and enforcement roles developing strong experience and appreciation for the regulatory role.</p>
<p>He led teams that litigated high-profile matters including against Volkswagen, Coles and Apple, and more recently has led the ACCC&rsquo;s digital and data transformation program as CEO. He is a graduate of Curtin University and holds a Bachelor of Commerce majoring in Economics and Business Law.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Four Individuals For Long-Running Scheme To Unlawfully Trade In Advance Of Numerous Follow-On Offerings</title>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed fraud charges against John Lowe, Randy Grewal, Richard Ringel, and David Cooper arising from their longstanding fraudulent scheme to trade in advance of the public announcement of the timing or price, or both, of numerous follow-on offerings of NASDAQ-listed issuers.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendants engaged in the following arrangement: Cooper, a registered representative at a broker-dealer with frequent access to material, nonpublic information about the timing or price, or both, of follow-on offerings, provided this information to Ringel, while Cooper&rsquo;s colleague shared similar information with Lowe. As alleged, Lowe then provided this information to Grewal. Then, Ringel, Lowe, and Grewal and their associated entities used the information to short issuers in advance of numerous follow-on offerings before they were publicly announced, making hundreds of thousands of dollars in illicit profits. The complaint alleges that in exchange for the material, non-public information that they received, Lowe and Ringel agreed to buy shares of stock in follow-on offerings that the broker-dealer was selling, which resulted in substantial compensation for Cooper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The defendants, several of them investment professionals, allegedly engaged in a years-long scheme to share and trade on material, nonpublic information,&rdquo; said Sanjay Wadhwa, Acting Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;Detecting and prosecuting illegal conduct like this, which is highly detrimental to the integrity of our securities markets, is an enduring priority for the Commission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Eastern District of New York also announced parallel criminal charges today against Cooper, Ringel, Lowe and Grewal.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint charges the four individual defendants, along with entities under their control &ndash; JJL Capital LLC, Great South Bay Capital LLC, Kierland Capital LLC, and BMEN Trading LLC &ndash; with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s ongoing investigation is being conducted by Stephen Johnson, Peter Pizzani, Eric Taffet, and Alison Conn under the supervision of Tejal D. Shah, all of the New York Regional Office, with the assistance of Alex Lefferts of the SEC&rsquo;s Office of Investigative and Market Analytics. The SEC&rsquo;s litigation will be led by Mr. Taffet and Oren Gleich, under the supervision of Preethi Krishnamurthy. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Eastern District of New York, Homeland Security Investigations, the United States Postal Inspection Service and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.</p>

The report, which tracks the issuance of new security identifiers as an early indicator of debt and capital markets activity over the next quarter, found a monthly decrease in request volume for new corporate and municipal identifiers. On an annualized basis, total identifier request volume surged in 2024 versus 2023 totals.</p>
<p>North American corporate CUSIP requests totaled 7,139 in December, which is down 10.2% on a monthly basis. Year-over-year, North American corporate requests closed 2024 up 11.0% over 2023 totals. The monthly decrease in volume was driven by an 18.8% decline in requests for U.S. corporate debt identifiers. Request volumes for short-term certificates of deposit (-9.3%) and longer-term certificates of deposit (-6.4%) also fell in December.</p>
<p>The aggregate total of identifier requests for new municipal securities &ndash; including municipal bonds, long-term and short-term notes, and commercial paper &ndash; fell 13.3% versus November totals. On a year-over-year basis, overall municipal volumes were up 9.0%. Texas led state-level municipal request volume with a total of 76 new CUSIP requests in December, followed by New York (73) and New Jersey (62).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monthly CUSIP request volume may have slowed in December, but when we take a look back at 2024 in total, we see a significant increase in new issuance activity across most major asset classes, including corporate debt and equity and municipal securities,&rdquo; said Gerard Faulkner, Director of Operations for CGS. &ldquo;As we head into the New Year with uncertainty around interest rates sure to be a factor, it will be telling to see what kind of CUSIP request volume we see during the first part of the year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Requests for international equity CUSIPs fell 43.6% in December and international debt CUSIP requests declined 22.1%. On an annualized basis, international equity CUSIP requests were up 11.3% and international debt CUSIP requests were up 97.7%.</p>

<p><span>Nat outlines the Bank of England's new approach to stress testing banks, and developments in stress tests of other parts of the financial sector. He sets out his aspirations for the future, including the importance of joining the dots between exercises to understand system-wide dynamics further.</span></p>
<h2>Speech</h2>
<p>Hi everyone, thank you for the opportunity to be with you today, and thanks to The City UK for hosting us. Let&rsquo;s talk about stress testing.</p>
<p>Last November, the Bank of England released a number of stress testing publications alongside the Financial Stability Report (FSR). We published our 2024 desk-based stress test results, the results of our system-wide exploratory scenario (the &ldquo;SWES&rdquo;), and we also published our new approach to stress testing the UK banking system. This replaces the previous framework set out in 2015 and is a significant step forward for us.</p>
<p>Today I want to outline the features of our new approach to stress testing banks, and set it in context of the history of stress tests as well as the other stress testing work that the we do. Looking ahead, I will set out some of our aspirations for the future, including the need to &lsquo;join the dots&rsquo; between stress tests.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about the importance of: stress testing in good times so that we&rsquo;re prepared for bad times; focusing on how the system as a whole supports households and businesses; being nimble and proportionate; and understanding behaviours.</p>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>Our approach to stress testing is rooted in the 2008 global financial crisis. Although there have been stresses since then, we should not forget the sheer impact of that crisis worldwide, the far-reaching consequences for households and businesses, and the considerable loss of economic growth that ensued in many economies, including here in the UK.</p>
<p>Stress testing was used by supervisors and firms for some time before the crisis.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/january/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-the-city-uk-the-future-of-stress-testing#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;But as we noted at the time, the results from these early exercises could be somewhat &lsquo;preliminary and partial&rsquo;. And focused on specific risks rather than a detailed analysis of a scenario at both the individual and banking system-wide levels.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/january/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-the-city-uk-the-future-of-stress-testing#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[2]</a></sup>&nbsp;When the crisis struck, stress testing took on a different dynamic, becoming a powerful tool used by authorities internationally to stem it. Regulators could evaluate how bad things were, how much banks stood to lose, how much more capital they needed. And then recapitalised them accordingly.</p>
<p>During the height of the financial crisis, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) undertook sequential firm-by-firm stress tests. And EU-wide stress tests were carried out in 2009 and 2010. I will never forget my own participation &ndash; during my time at the Federal Reserve over that period &ndash; in what was to become the first public concurrent stress tests of banks. It was a pioneering exercise, which achieved its ultimate goal of stemming the crisis, by providing evidence and taking action to increase capital so that regulators, firms and commentators felt able to call its bottom.</p>
<p>Stress tests proved to be a useful tool for understanding, quantifying and communicating financial resilience. Regulators globally developed ongoing stress testing programmes. In the UK, that allowed the FSA, and then the Bank, to enhance their analysis of banks&rsquo; balance sheets under stress. Many UK banks are global in nature, and stress testing enabled us to understand how the impact of both UK and international stresses impacted their resilience. After the acute period of the crisis was over, stress tests by regulators continued to support the strengthening of banks&rsquo; capital and the improvement in their internal stress testing and broader risk management. They were part of a wider package of measures &ndash; such as Basel III, the UK leverage ratio, and closer supervision &ndash; to enhance the resilience of the banking system to shocks. And crucially its ability to support the real economy through bad times, rather than causing and amplifying stresses, as in 2008.</p>
<p>When the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) was first established, one of its first priorities was to complete the capital build post-crisis. Stress testing was key to achieving that. In 2014, the Bank of England launched its first public, concurrent stress test of the UK banking system. It assessed simultaneously the performance of major UK banks&rsquo; capital positions under the same scenario &ndash; and their ability to recover while still lending to the real economy. It compared results across banks, and assessed the broader impact on financial stability. The test used our approach of combining submissions from participating banks with our own modelling and judgements to derive and publish firm-specific results.</p>
<p>Then in 2015, we set out our approach to concurrent stress testing, which had two components. The first was financial resilience stress tests, called the annual cyclical scenario, which enabled us to assess banks&rsquo; capital positions against a severe but plausible adverse scenario. The scenarios in these exercises were countercyclical. And we set them so they could be used to inform the setting of capital buffers. Our latest annual cyclical scenario results were published in 2023.</p>
<p>The second component was the biennial exploratory scenario (BES) which is used to test risks not neatly linked to the financial cycle. For example, in 2021 we published the results of our test of the risks from climate change.</p>
<p>On a micro-prudential level &ndash; the level of individual firms, relevant to the Prudential Regulation Committee &ndash; the objective was to promote the safety and soundness of UK banks by assessing their capital adequacy in the face of a range of adverse shocks. This helped identify necessary improvements in risk and capital management practices within firms. And it has informed the setting of firm-specific capital buffers. On a macroprudential level &ndash; the level of the banking system, relevant to the FPC &ndash; the tests helped us form a view on the resilience of the banking system as a whole. As a result, we used them to inform decisions that apply to the whole sector, such as setting the countercyclical capital buffer.</p>
<p>So stress tests have supported the significant and much-needed build-up of capital in the UK banking system. Over time, as banks became better capitalised they got to and stayed where we would expect them to be in the scenario: above the test&rsquo;s hurdle rate. As a result, the role of the annual cyclical scenario has become less about obtaining specific point estimates of capital and more about understanding how different stresses can impact banks in different ways, and wider learnings.</p>
<p>As well as this role in the capital build, stress testing strengthened our approach to supervising banks and ensuring financial stability in a number of ways. It helped identify risks on banks&rsquo; balance sheets, and supported a continued improvement in banks&rsquo; own risk management and capital planning capabilities. It has proved to be one of the best tools we have to benchmark across banks and compare their activities. Our stress tests also revealed issues about banks&rsquo; performance in stress which informed policy developments, for example to address pro-cyclicality in mortgage risk weights. And crucially, they served a key role externally as an accountability device and a way to enhance public confidence in banks and the financial system. Quite simply, it is one of the most effective tools we have to demonstrate that major UK banks are safe and sound, and can support households and businesses in bad times, rather than make things worse. We&rsquo;ve seen the benefits of that in the recent challenging years in the wake of the pandemic, where for example banks could afford to give many households more time to repay their mortgages.</p>
<h3>Developments since our previous approach</h3>
<p>Alongside this gradual shift in what we learn from stress tests, the major macroeconomic and global shocks we have faced in recent years have led to change. They have required us to take a more adaptable and nimble approach, more informed by prevailing economic conditions. The Covid pandemic in particular had a big impact on our approach to stress testing: in the face of such a major shock hitting the UK economy, we had to adapt, reflecting that this was the first time we had to do a stress test during an actual stress since the global financial crisis.</p>
<p>In 2020, we ran an internal desktop exercise that gave us rapid insights into the potential impacts of the pandemic, instead of the usual lengthier test with firm submissions. Doing this also allowed banks to divert resources to where they were most needed at the time.</p>
<p>We also ran a &lsquo;reverse stress test&rsquo; in 2020, to analyse the unfolding macroeconomic conditions and how bad things could get. Specifically we tested how much worse the economic outcome would need to get to deplete banks&rsquo; capital by as much as in the 2019 annual cyclical scenario.</p>
<p>In 2021, we returned to a test involving firm submissions, but instead of the usual severe but plausible scenario, we tested to a more extreme adverse scenario to gain insights into the potential impact of a worsening of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Through these episodes we learned the value of being adaptable, and being able to carry out different exercises, using different scenarios, and at varying levels of granularity and speed. These different types of tests are useful in telling us what we need to know at the time. They provide a reliable assessment of a particular scenario we want to explore &ndash; without undue burden on us or firms &ndash; which we can trust to inform our decisions even in times of great uncertainty. Rather than having to speculate or rely overly on subjective judgments.</p>
<p>Most recently in 2024, we ran a desk-based stress test. By being desk-based we were able to test the resilience of the banking system to two alternate scenarios (as opposed to just one scenario in the full tests involving firm submissions). We tested an aggregate demand shock where growth collapses and interest rates fall rapidly, and an aggregate supply shock where inflation and interest rates go up. The test was based on our own modelling and judgements rather than requiring firm submissions.</p>
<p>As well as testing the banking system, the Bank has also developed its wider toolkit for stress testing to cover different parts of the financial sector. Since 2015 we have been undertaking insurance stress tests assessing the financial resilience of the general insurance sector and since 2019 of the life insurance sector, too. Those exercises give us valuable insights into the sector and its firms, beyond what can be obtained from a firm&rsquo;s own solvency and risk management reports. They also help the Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA) be better prepared to respond to potential shocks affecting the insurance sector.</p>
<p>In 2025, the PRA&rsquo;s stress testing framework for the life insurance sector will be enhanced by the intent to publish individual firm results.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/january/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-the-city-uk-the-future-of-stress-testing#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[3]</a></sup>&nbsp;This will provide market participants with additional transparent and independent measures of an insurer&rsquo;s resilience, and facilitate market education and self-discipline. And actually the next life insurance stress test will be launched tomorrow, so keep an eye out for that!</p>
<p>Since 2022, the Bank has also conducted annual stress tests of UK Central Counterparties (CCPs), which are used to assess CCPs&rsquo; financial resilience, and to promote transparency and confidence in the UK&rsquo;s clearing system. They include &ldquo;reverse&rdquo; stress testing, subjecting CCPs to different combinations of increasingly severe scenarios, numbers of defaulters, and costs of liquidating concentrated positions. CCP exercises have also included more agile desk-based stress testing, which can shed light on dark corners by exploring the impact of a wider range of scenarios. CCP stress tests consider the impact on liquidity needs of their clearing members as part of the test, highlighting the system-wide analysis we do and need to do more of, which I will come onto later.</p>
<p>And most recently, we undertook a new and first-of-its-kind system-wide exercise, the SWES. The SWES aimed to test the resilience of UK markets that are core to our country&rsquo;s economy. By improving our understanding of the behaviours under stressed conditions of banks and non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) participating in those markets. And most importantly how those behaviours might interact to amplify shocks and cascade from one market to another. We published the results of it at the end of 2024, and my colleague Lee Foulger discussed these in a recent speech.<sup><sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/january/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-the-city-uk-the-future-of-stress-testing#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[4]</a></sup></sup>&nbsp;We and the participants learned a lot from this exercise &ndash; it proved incredibly insightful.</p>
<h3>The updated approach to stress-testing the banks</h3>
<p>Taking stock of these changes since our original approach to bank stress testing in 2015, we have reflected on the need to be adaptable, the shift in the context of our stress tests more broadly, and how we have been using them in practice.</p>
<p>Our updated approach combines the predictability of regular stress testing for cyclical risks with the adaptability the Bank has used in recent years to explore different risks. It also benefitted from engagement with participating banks, academics, and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>It has three key components:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, we will continue to run a financial resilience test of risks related to the financial cycle, involving submissions from participating banks, but it will be every other year. It will otherwise be akin to the previous annual cyclical scenario test and, will inform capital buffer setting. Going forward we are calling this biennial exercise simply the Bank Capital Stress Test. Because it does what it says on the tin.</li>
<li>Second, in the intervening years we will supplement our assessment of the resilience of the banking system using stress testing when appropriate, but in a way that is much less burdensome for banks than our full Bank Capital Stress Tests. For example, through desk-based exercises.</li>
<li>Third, the Bank will continue to use exploratory exercises involving participation from banks, akin to the BES of the previous framework, but not strictly biennially. These tests will be a means of assessing other risks, including structural and emerging risks that are not closely linked to the financial cycle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reducing the frequency of big firm submission tests represents a considerable efficiency gain, without compromising our assessment of financial stability. It ensures the burden placed on participating banks is proportionate, and supports the UK banking sector&rsquo;s competitiveness and growth. This change creates space for banks, and for us, to assess and address a wider set of risks facing the banking sector and will provide better insights in an evolving risk environment.</p>
<p>It will also give participating banks greater capacity to invest in improvements in data (particularly crucial if they want to make the most of artificial intelligence, by the way), modelling, and risk management. In turn that will further enhance the ability of stress tests to deliver insights over the medium- to long-term.</p>
<p>The new approach does not represent a reduction in the importance and value we place on stress testing, quite the opposite. But it reflects an evolution of how we use it.</p>
<p>A key reason why we are comfortable reducing the frequency of the full cyclical tests involving bank submissions is because banks are now much better capitalised. The last time we asked a participating bank to submit a capital plan to increase its level of capital as a result of a stress test was 2016. The tests have become increasingly about wider insights. So while we will still be keeping an eye on capital adequacy as a matter of routine, we no longer feel it needs to be done via a big set-piece every year. Especially given the cost of doing so and the benefits of exploring a wider range of risks.</p>
<p>Now while we value adaptability and the ability to use a range of tests to be more nimble, we also know the importance of predictability for participants to plan ahead. We intend for the Bank Capital Stress Test to be carried out every other year. And for other exercises involving firm submissions, as we have done in recent exploratory exercises, we&rsquo;ll engage with participants well in advance so they have time to prepare, and we&rsquo;ll endeavour to ensure submissions are proportionate. And when considering the timing of a future exercise, we will watch carefully the sequencing with other exercises.</p>
<p>The new approach will also allow scope for synergies between the various bank stress tests, as well as between those and stress tests of other parts of the financial sector. For example, a desk-based stress test might allow initial exploration of a risk which could subsequently be incorporated into the scenario for a Bank Capital Stress Test. Alternatively, a Bank Capital Stress Test may reveal a vulnerability that could become the focus of an exploratory stress test or targeted exercise.</p>
<p>The new approach is more adaptable and risk responsive. It represents a pivot away from looking at point estimate capital positions, to instead look at wider learnings about vulnerabilities and pockets of risk. It provides space to explore scenarios and the sources of potential future crises, but without losing the indispensable regular checks on financial resilience.</p>
<p>Now while we love stress tests &ndash; as you can tell! &ndash; we need to remember that they can&rsquo;t give us all the answers. Credit Suisse was a perfect example of this. It is not a lack of capital that caused their failure, and indeed they passed many stress tests. Some answers have to come from elsewhere &ndash; although this is not the topic of today.</p>
<h3>Joining the dots</h3>
<p>We are excited about this updated approach. We feel it reflects the changes to the sector since the inception of the framework and draws out what we have found useful in practice over the first decade of concurrent stress testing. I believe it gives us the flexibility we need without losing the rigour of the previous approach.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the next challenge we face is what I call &lsquo;joining the dots&rsquo;. We have been running relatively separate tests of different sectors &ndash; those of banks, insurers, CCPs and system-wide &ndash; expanding our understanding with each successive exercise. In the future, I would like to use our approach to draw together even better our broader toolkit of exercises across sectors to enhance our understanding of system-wide dynamics.</p>
<p>Risk-taking has shifted across the financial sector since the early days of stress tests, and we must use our toolkit to widen our understanding of the financial system and gain an increasingly comprehensive view of the risks affecting it. By joining the dots between exercises and findings, we can take an increasingly &ldquo;macro&rdquo; view of risks and vulnerabilities across the system. This will allow us to focus on testing the provision of vital services, and this requires a better understanding of the dynamics of the system not just a focus on individual institutions, as Sarah Breeden recently spoke to.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/january/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-the-city-uk-the-future-of-stress-testing#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Lending and market-making is increasingly shifting away from banks to NBFIs. The figures are striking. NBFIs now account for around half of total UK financial assets. Over the last two decades, NBFIs has accounted for the entirety of the cumulated increase in new UK corporate lending in the UK, and for example, NBFIs now account for 50% of the stock of corporate lending. However, importantly, banks remain exposed to these risks through providing repo, leverage, and other forms of wholesale finance to non-banks &ndash; so banks remain very much involved, but in a different way. There has also been a recent increase in Significant Risk Transfer transactions, which can help banks achieve capital relief on the risk transferred to investors, through securitisation. That trend provides further evidence of interconnectedness between banks and the rest of the financial sector, and how risks can be distributed from banks to different corners of the financial system. The consequences of this need to be understood.</p>
<p>We are also seeing risks transferred from banks to insurers, or shared between them. For example, we need to continue to explore the links between banks&rsquo; mortgage lending and insurance policies against flooding, and the impact of climate change on both sectors. As highlighted in our latest FSR, we have been looking at the vulnerabilities emerging at the intersection of life insurance and private equity.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/january/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-the-city-uk-the-future-of-stress-testing#footnote-7" id="footnote-ref-7"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[6]</a></sup>&nbsp;Life insurance and reinsurance premiums are increasingly used as funding for lending activities in private credit via private-equity-backed insurers and reinsurers. In this regard, and with respect to UK insurers&rsquo; use of funded reinsurance, the 2025 life insurance stress test will provide useful insights into potential channels of disruptions. This highlights that some risks are very difficult to understand without taking a cross-sectoral view.</p>
<p>These examples underscore the need to &lsquo;join the dots&rsquo; and take in the broader picture, where a &lsquo;sum of the parts&rsquo; approach may not give the right view.</p>
<p>The idea is of course to continue our sectoral stress tests, but ensuring we are increasingly linking the findings from them, and using one exercise to inform another. In practice, this could start with exploring scenario consistency and coherence between tests. We might consider where common scenarios could be used and the results of one stress test can inform another. One example of joining up our findings might be if market-focussed exercises reveal behaviours under stress that are relevant for the way we test resilience within specific sectors of firms.</p>
<p>Over time, we could seek a deeper understanding of interconnections, combined effects, and amplifications. I think we should aim for that. My aspiration is towards future stress tests that capture interlinkages and feedback loops between sectors. That could help us spot risks that are truly system-wide and not otherwise identifiable in isolation.</p>
<p>This is clearly part of a journey, and we won&rsquo;t have all the answers immediately about how best to do this. But it is our direction of travel. We will learn by doing, gradually, and together with market participants themselves. This important work will allow us to provide a fuller picture of whether the financial sector, as a whole, is able to do its job of supporting households and businesses in both good and bad times. Which is our ultimate goal.</p>
<p>The recent SWES has represented a big leap towards this goal. It proved to be an effective tool for understanding vulnerabilities that would not be apparent from sector-specific analysis alone. By including firms from a range of sectors and running it in two rounds we could explore how the collective actions of firms in markets can amplify a shock (such as through forced sales), and understand system-level liquidity flows (such as how a shock at one fund causes them to redeem from another or how initial margin is recycled in the system). We can better understand how the actions of one firm can impact its investors or counterparties and the system-level consequences (such as whether repo will be rolled and the consequences if not). We are committed to continuing to invest in our capabilities in this area, to be able to carry out system-wide exercises in a more desk-based way, allowing us to monitor risks and understand how different shocks could play out, leading to more informed policy-making. And there will certainly be other system-wide dynamics or ecosystems that would benefit from future SWES-style exercises.</p>
<p>And as part of this increasingly holistic view of stress tests, we continue to consider their interaction with those we run on our own central bank balance sheet.</p>
<p>The need for this more joined-up approach is greater than ever, because the shape of risks to financial stability are evolving fast and with increasing interconnectedness. To stay on top of things we need to consider the broader macro picture at the level of the whole financial sector. Otherwise, we would risk engaging in a &lsquo;whack-a-mole game&rsquo; that would be difficult to win.</p>
<p>For example, increasing digitalisation over recent years has changed the risk environment &ndash; firms are more vulnerable, for instance, to rapid liquidity outflows. Cyber risks are another consequence of this changing risk landscape, and the Bank will increasingly need to focus on such non-financial stresses to support our wider understanding. The Bank has been undertaking stress tests of cyber resilience since 2019 and continues to do so. As we outlined in our last FSR, cyber-attacks are one channel of increased risks that come with elevated geopolitical tensions. My FPC colleague Carolyn Wilkins will be speaking soon on this subject, and the increasing importance of how we capture geopolitical risks.</p>
<h3>The value of stress testing for understanding systemic risks</h3>
<p>Indeed, the need to join the dots is set against a broader context of a transition away from the last decade into a new era marked by a tighter monetary environment, digitalisation, and climate change, against a broader backdrop of increased geopolitical tensions. As outlined in our most recent FSR, &ldquo;uncertainty around, and risks to, the central outlook have increased and global risks associated with geopolitical tensions, global fragmentation and pressures on sovereign debt levels remain material&rdquo;.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/january/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-the-city-uk-the-future-of-stress-testing#footnote-8" id="footnote-ref-8"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[7]</a></sup>&nbsp;The world is an unpredictable place. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023 also served as a sharp reminder of how quickly risks can crystalise and how losses of confidence can impact a bank or cohort of banks.</p>
<p>In this uncertainty lies a key strength of our approach to stress testing: the scenarios we test are not predictions of macroeconomic and financial conditions in the UK or abroad. Instead, they are hypothetical scenarios that we believe are useful to explore because they help spot the right risks and vulnerabilities in the system. They allow us, and just as importantly, firms themselves, to take steps to prepare for a range of plausible outcomes. And to emphasise, this is a great strength of stress testing in an uncertain world: it helps ensure the financial system is able to support the economy under a range of circumstances, at a time when it&rsquo;s difficult to work out which ones are most likely.</p>
<p>On the topic of helping firms prepare themselves for plausible scenarios, it is clear that a valuable aspect of our stress tests is the disclosure of the results. That supports market discipline and enables the financial sector to be the first line of defence and take necessary action to manage risks. Publishing the results enables us to convey key messages about risks and vulnerabilities in a constructive manner. The more we do so in benign times, the more we enable the industry to fix the roof while the sun is shining, ahead of real stresses.</p>
<p>Moreover, in a test involving firms, we can also provide private bilateral feedback on participants&rsquo; modelling or judgements, and explore where their approach departs from peers. This can help speak to the lack of perfect information for individual participants in a system, allowing us to play out the reactions of many actors. For example, the SWES highlighted mismatches in firms&rsquo; expectations of how each other will act in a stress &ndash; and that led us to recommend that market participants consider taking steps to prepare for the risk that they cannot access additional repo during market stresses. By shining a light on how scenarios might unfold, our stress tests allow us and market participants to mitigate risks pre-emptively. We have received a positive response on the usefulness of the information we shared from the SWES results, including for firms own internal risk management.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s important because market participants need to be able to deal with severe but plausible scenarios themselves, without expecting authorities to intervene and put taxpayer money at risk, as in 2008. Having said that, some scenarios are so severe and extreme that they can&rsquo;t reasonably be mitigated in advance. Indeed if we tried to eradicate all possible risks, this would lead to the &lsquo;stability of the graveyard&rsquo; and stunt growth. So we do not expect firms to have ex ante resilience for each and every shock. We are not seeking through stress testing to remove all risk-taking from the system. And like other companies, financial institutions can and should be able to fail in an orderly way.</p>
<p>What we as policymakers care about is the resilience of the system as a whole, and its ability to continue supporting the real economy in severe but plausible scenarios without the need for intervention by public authorities.</p>
<p>Even then, some shocks may be so large, and the cost of the whole sector insuring itself against them would be so great, that trying to do so would hamper the provision of vital financial services in normal times.</p>
<p>So as well as ensuring firms are prepared for risks, it is also important we at the Bank of England have tools in our toolkit to step in when financial stability comes under threat. For example, in recognition of the increased importance of NBFIs, which I mentioned earlier, the Bank has been working to develop tools to lend to them directly in times of severe dysfunction in core UK financial markets when financial stability is under threat, as Dave Ramsden spoke about in December.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/january/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-the-city-uk-the-future-of-stress-testing#footnote-9" id="footnote-ref-9"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[8]</a></sup>&nbsp;This is the latest addition to our toolbox. Not all resilience can be built in ex ante. Some resilience has to come from having the right tools to manage the stresses that threaten stability as they arise.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>We need to be selective and deliberate. Financial stability is indispensable for sustained economic growth &ndash; as the considerable loss of growth caused by the 2008 crisis starkly reminds us. The focus of our stress tests has to be guided by the ultimate aim of financial stability, which is the provision &ndash; by the financial sector as a whole &ndash; of vital services to the real economy, such as lending, saving, insurance, payments, etc. in both good and bad times. Stress tests help us be focussed and selective, and therefore enable us to be proportionate.</p>
<p>That means future Bank Capital Stress Tests will continue to test banks&rsquo; ability to keep lending through a stress &ndash; maintaining sufficient capital to absorb losses as they occur whilst continuing to support UK households and businesses, rather than closing shop to protect themselves. But our approach is also pivoting towards identifying vulnerabilities and pockets of risk, in step with a changing world. Directing resources where needed, being increasingly nimble, and ensuring the burden on firms is reasonable.</p>
<p>And importantly, it allows us to continue joining the dots between various stress tests across the financial sector. By better linking insights and the design of our tests, we can gradually build a comprehensive, holistic, view of the interaction between the financial sector and the economy. In doing so, we can respond to the changing risk environment and uncertainty of today&rsquo;s world. We can reflect the shift or sharing of risk between sectors. And we can do so in a way that is proportionate and selective, and provides the stability needed to support growth.</p>
<p>Finally, I encourage firms across the industry to adopt a similar mindset of joining the dots. The financial system is increasingly interconnected, and participants having open lines of communication with their financial counterparties to understand each other&rsquo;s reaction function in a stress is very helpful for the resilience of the system as a whole. It&rsquo;s part of being the first line of defence.</p>
<p>Stress tests have a bright future. I am proud of how far we have come, and excited about how much more we can get out of them.</p>

<title>The Bank Of England And The Commodity Futures Trading Commission Input Into Report On Initial Margin Transparency And Responsiveness In Centrally Cleared Markets</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="page-section">
<p>The Bank of England (the Bank) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC) have co-chaired international work on centrally cleared margin practices stemming from the March 2020 market turmoil, also known as the &lsquo;dash for cash&rsquo;. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), the Bank for International Settlements&rsquo; Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) today published their final report: &ldquo;Transparency and responsiveness of initial margin in centrally cleared markets &ndash; review and policy proposals&rdquo; which sets out policy proposals designed to increase the resilience of centrally cleared markets.</p>
<p>The Bank and the CFTC support the report&rsquo;s findings, including the policy proposals which aim to improve centrally cleared market participants&rsquo; understanding of potential future margin requirements and margin responsiveness through enhanced central counterparty (CCP) and clearing member transparency and governance practices. Some of the key conclusions include the need for greater transparency on initial margin models (including through appropriate disclosures and the provision of enhanced margin simulation tools) and appropriate governance arrangements on the setting of initial margin requirements.</p>
<p>This report builds on the BCBS-CPMI-IOSCO report&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d537.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Review of margining practices<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;published in September 2022 which identified six areas for further policy work in conjunction to the Financial Stability Board&rsquo;s (the FSB) work programme on non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI). The Financial Policy Committee has supported work to reduce vulnerabilities through internationally coordinated reforms. This includes work on margining practices and leverage in NBFI which may contribute to sudden spikes in the demand for cash in stress, disrupting financial stability.</p>
<p>Highlighting the analytical efforts and industry consultations undertaken, the co-chairs Sasha Mills and Richard Haynes thanked the members of the ad hoc BCBS-CPMI-IOSCO margin group for their collaborative participation in finalising the policy proposals.</p>
<p><strong>Sasha Mills, Executive Director, Financial Market Infrastructure, Bank of England, said:</strong></p>
<p><em>"</em>The international work on centrally cleared initial margin is a powerful example of addressing financial stability risks through international coordination across authorities and committees. The Bank will continue to support this work as standard-setting bodies consider how best to implement the proposals."</p>
<p><strong>Richard Haynes, Deputy Director of Risk Surveillance, CFTC, said:</strong></p>
<p>"<a id="_Hlk187752104"></a>The BCBS-CPMI-IOSCO margin group, by focusing on detailed data from a broad set of global regions, was able to sift between market rumours and reality, and achieve a balanced and pragmatic set of policy conclusions for implementation"</p>

<title>For The First Time, The Listing Of ETFs On Digital Assets - Tel Aviv Stock Exchange Continues To Develop The Israeli Capital Market And Introduce Innovative Products - Facilitating, For The First Time, The Listing Of ETFs On Digital Assets</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>TASE published today a draft for public comments that introduces the listing on TASE of ETFs on digital assets, such as Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The amendment of the Guidelines will enable the listing of ETFs that track digital currencies. This move, which is the first of its kind in Israel, is aligned with steps implemented by advanced global capital markets to facilitate the public&rsquo;s exposure to innovative financial assets in a controlled, regulated and transparent environment. The listing of ETFs on digital assets will give the Israeli public, for the first time, access to digital assets through local issuers, accompanied by international index editors - locally on TASE.</p>
<p>By investing in digital assets through financial instruments that would be issued and listed on TASE, the Israeli public can enjoy innovation and progress without being required to maintain a personal digital wallet.</p>
<p>As previously reported, one of the stated goals of TASE&rsquo;s strategic plan is venturing into the digital assets sector. This move is another step in TASE&rsquo;s mission of introducing innovations in the field of digital assets.</p>
<p>The option of listing of ETFs on digital assets became available following the Israel Securities Authority&rsquo;s approval of the issue of mutual funds on digital assets. TASE now aims to realize this option by expanding the Guidelines to also support the listing of ETFs on digital assets.</p>
<p>According to the proposed amendment, a digital asset could be used as a tracked asset if it is traded on trading platforms whose published prices are used by an international index calculator to calculate indices. The assumption is that the international index calculators rely on the data of leading global digital asset trading platforms to perform their calculations, as these meet stringent qualitative and quantitative criteria of the international index calculators.</p>
<p>TASE will continue to further the public&rsquo;s access to innovative investment instruments in a regulated, effective and transparent environment, on par with advanced global markets.</p>

<title>SEC Announces Departure Of Chief Economist Jessica Wachter</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-announces-departure-of-chief-economist-jessica-wachter/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-announces-departure-of-chief-economist-jessica-wachter/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Jessica A. Wachter, the Chief Economist and Director of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis (DERA), will depart the agency on January 17.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank Jessica for her leadership of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, her judgement, and her thoughtful economic analysis,&rdquo; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. &ldquo;As Chief Economist, she ably led a division that has a seat at the table for all of the SEC&rsquo;s critical decision making, whether it&rsquo;s policymaking, enforcement, or monitoring markets. I have enjoyed and learned so much from working with Jessica who has been one of my closest advisors. I wish her very well as she returns to academia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under Dr. Wachter&rsquo;s leadership, DERA provided sound economic analysis in support of rulemaking and enforcement matters. The 190-person division conducted more than 100 economic analyses for Commission rule proposals and adoptions, including those bringing the Treasury market into central clearing, shortening the settlement cycle, bringing greater resiliency to money market funds, and promoting greater transparency with regard to the risks of cyber attacks. In addition, DERA assisted enforcement in determining ill-gotten gains and returning funds to investors. Dr. Wachter consistently advocated for making data more accessible and easier to use, both within and without the Commission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been an honor and privilege to serve as the Chief Economist and Director of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis,&rdquo; Dr. Wachter said. &ldquo;I am grateful to Chair Gensler for giving me this tremendous opportunity. I am also grateful to the Chair and the Commission for their support through the last three and a half years and to the Division&rsquo;s talented staff, who have taught me so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Wachter joined the SEC from the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. She has served on the boards of the American Finance Association and the Western Finance Association. In addition to Wharton, Dr. Wachter has also taught at NYU&rsquo;s Stern School of Business. She holds an A.B. in Mathematics and Ph.D. in Business Economics from Harvard University.</p>
<p>Dr. Wachter will return to the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania where she will be the Dr. Bruce I. Jacobs Chair of Quantitative Finance.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul type="disc">
<li>Cboe's exchange technology platform branded as Cboe Titanium<sup>SM</sup>&nbsp;(Cboe Ti<sup>SM</sup>)</li>
<li>Titanium chosen as namesake to reflect Cboe Ti's lightweight strength, durability and resilience</li>
<li>New brand marks the milestone of Cboe's final technology migrations to be completed in the first half of 2025</li>
</ul>
<p>Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe: CBOE), the world's leading derivatives and securities exchange network, today unveiled a new brand identity for its exchange technology platform, signaling an exciting new chapter in Cboe's ongoing evolution and deepening commitment to delivering best-in-class trading technology and innovation for market participants around the globe. The technology platform powering Cboe's world-class exchange operations for trading options, futures and equities across its markets globally is now named Cboe Titanium<sup>SM</sup>&nbsp;(Cboe Ti<sup>SM</sup>).</p>
<div class="PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference" id="DivAssetPlaceHolder1">
<p title="Introducing Cboe Titanium"></p>
</div>
<p>"Cboe capped off another strong year of growth, delivering trading solutions and products to help customers around the globe navigate markets. Underpinning this success is Cboe's leading-edge technology, which not only powers every aspect of our business and operations, but also helps to enable innovation across our markets, products, data and insights," said Chris Isaacson, Chief Operating Officer at Cboe Global Markets. "Inspired by titanium's exceptional durability and resilience, our new brand identity &ndash; Cboe Titanium, or Cboe Ti for short &ndash; aims to reflect the enduring strength, reliability and transformative power of our technology platform.&nbsp; As we look to the next chapter of Cboe's growth, Cboe Ti will continue to deliver the world-class trading experience that our equities and derivatives customers globally have come to expect, helping to enable efficient price discovery, robust liquidity and opportunities for diverse trading strategies &ndash; all on a unified global technology platform."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cboe Ti (pronounced "T-I", like the element symbol) powers Cboe's options, equities and futures markets in the U.S., UK, Europe, Japan and Australia, with Cboe Canada expected to migrate to Cboe Ti on March 3, 2025. Cboe also plans to transition its cash-settled&nbsp;<span>bitcoin</span>&nbsp;and ether futures contracts, currently available for trading on the Cboe Digital Exchange, to the Cboe Futures Exchange (CFE) running on Cboe Ti in the second quarter of 2025, pending regulatory review. This will conclude a multi-year effort to bring all Cboe's equities and derivatives markets across the globe onto a unified, globally consistent, yet locally optimized technology platform.</p>
<p>Using common protocols and features, Cboe's unified technology platform is designed to offer customers an efficient, consistent experience regardless of where they are in the world.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the flexibility of Cboe Ti allows Cboe to locally optimize and customize the platform for the unique needs of any market or asset class. This enables enhanced consistency and scalability, allowing Cboe to build a feature or product once and then deploy it globally, bringing innovative products, features and data to new markets and customers at greater speed. This effort aligns with Cboe's global strategy and commitment to expanding access to its markets, products, data and services to customers across the world.</p>
<p>Cboe expects to continue to invest in and scale its global technology infrastructure, operations and capabilities to meet market demand. Amid heightened volatility and record trading volumes in 2024, Cboe maintained 100% uptime across 25 of its 27 global platforms and achieved greater than 99.9% uptime across all 27 platforms. In U.S. options, where Cboe handled in 2024 approximately 100 billion quotes and orders a day across its four options exchanges, Cboe introduced a new access architecture to provide customers greater consistency for quoting and accessing liquidity. In equities, Cboe introduced Dedicated Cores, an optional service designed to help enhance consistency and improve overall performance for customers. Dedicated Cores reduced latency for customers who have purchased the service by 60% in the U.S. and has now been introduced in the UK and European Union, with plans to launch in Australia this month, pending regulatory approval.</p>
<p>Through powering trading operations, Cboe is committed to utilizing Cboe Ti to build a trusted global marketplace.

<p><strong>Solactive is pleased to extend its collaboration with Hanwha Asset Management with the launch of the Hanwha PLUS Global Nuclear Energy Value Chain ETF, which tracks the Solactive Global Nuclear Energy Value Chain Index. Amidst the ongoing global push for decarbonization, this ETF offers investors targeted exposure to the nuclear energy sector, a cornerstone of the global transition to clean, reliable energy systems.</strong></p>
<p>Nuclear energy is regaining momentum as a critical component of green energy transition. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) projects that global nuclear capacity could double by 2050, driven by technological advancements in Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) and increasing investments.&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.solactive.com/hanwha-asset-management-launches-hanwha-plus-global-nuclear-energy-value-chain-etf-tracking-the-solactive-global-nuclear-energy-value-chain-index/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></span>&nbsp;To achieve these ambitious targets, annual global investment in nuclear energy will need to increase to USD 125 billion, up from an average of around USD 50 billion between 2017 and 2023, which indicates significant growth opportunities for companies operating in the sector.&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.solactive.com/hanwha-asset-management-launches-hanwha-plus-global-nuclear-energy-value-chain-etf-tracking-the-solactive-global-nuclear-energy-value-chain-index/#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;</span>In addition, the increasing use of nuclear energy by major technology companies such as Microsoft and Google underlines its importance in meeting the energy-intensive needs of the digital economy.<span><a href="https://www.solactive.com/hanwha-asset-management-launches-hanwha-plus-global-nuclear-energy-value-chain-etf-tracking-the-solactive-global-nuclear-energy-value-chain-index/#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></span>&nbsp;Hence, these developments highlight the transformative potential of the industry, and represent captivating investment opportunities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.solactive.com/indices/?index=DE000SL0NR65" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Solactive Global Nuclear Energy Value Chain Index</a>&nbsp;aims to provide exposure to companies operating across the entire nuclear energy value chain. The index selects North America or Developed Markets Europe companies involved in upstream activities, such as uranium mining and fuel cycle operations, and downstream activities, including nuclear technology, power generation and reactor design using a granular classification framework. In addition, the index utilizes ARTIS&reg;, Solactive&rsquo;s proprietary natural language processing technology, to identify companies with significant exposure and relevance to the nuclear energy industry. Also, the index incorporates Uranium Trust ETFs, such as the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust, providing direct exposure to uranium as a key resource. 50% of the total weight is allocated to upstream activities, 40% to downstream activities and 10% to Uranium Trust ETFs, with the weight of each constituent capped at 20% to ensure diversification and balanced exposure to both large-cap leaders and niche players in the nuclear energy sector.</p>
<p><strong>The ETF listed on 14 January on the Korea Stock Exchange with the ticker code A0007G0.</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Timo Pfeiffer, Chief Markets Officer at Solactive, commented</span>:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;We are excited to partner with Hanwha Asset Management on the launch of the Hanwha PLUS Global Nuclear Energy Value Chain ETF. The Solactive Global Nuclear Energy Value Chain Index provides a comprehensive investment portfolio of the dynamic and evolving nuclear energy industry, capturing key players across the value chain and highlighting the sector&rsquo;s role in meeting global energy demands.&rdquo;</em></p>

<title>Publication Of "Japan Financial Services Agency Analytical Notes (2025.1) Vol.1"</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/publication-of-japan-financial-services-agency-analytical-notes-20251-vol1-1/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/publication-of-japan-financial-services-agency-analytical-notes-20251-vol1-1/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The FSA published the English version of "FSA Analytical Notes (2025.1) vol.1".ã&nbsp;<img class="pdf" src="https://www.fsa.go.jp/images/common/icon_pdf.gif" /><a href="https://www.fsa.go.jp/en/about/fsaanalyticalnotes/20250115/01.pdf">full text</a></p>
<p>As financial institutions&rsquo; business environments and profit structures change, it is important to understand economic and market trends based on data, and to accurately grasp the business conditions of individual financial institutions and also the resilience and vulnerabilities of the financial system as a whole. From this perspective, the FSA&nbsp;has been focusing on the utilization of granular data, such as transaction-level bank loan data and financial data on individual corporations. Some case examples of data analyses using such granular data are published as a series of reports titled &ldquo;FSA Analytical Notes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This issue contains &ldquo;Analysis of Japanese Stock Market Turbulence in Early August 2024.&rdquo; It is notable in that it uses granular order/transaction level data to understand market conditions, while also taking into account information gathered from market participants and considerations based on macroeconomic and financial statistics.</p>
<div><span><img class="pdf" src="https://www.fsa.go.jp/images/common/icon_pdf.gif" /><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"><strong><a href="https://www.fsa.go.jp/en/about/fsaanalyticalnotes/20250115/02.pdf">Analysis of Japanese Stock Market Turbulence in Early August 2024</a></strong></span></span></div>
<div>
<p>This paper presents a detailed analysis of the sharp swings that occurred in the Japanese stock market on August 5, 2024. With the use of granular order/transaction level data of the Nikkei 225 Futures, the FSA has developed several indicators to evaluate market supply, demand and liquidity conditions, including dominance by buyers/sellers, concentration by specific entities in transactions, price impact per contract amount and liquidity around the best quote.</p>
<p>Closely following the year-to-date (until early August) and August 5 intraday movements of these indicators, the followings were suggested. On a daily basis from mid-July to early August, excessive imbalances were not observed but the market liquidity was markedly declining, making prices more susceptible to fluctuations. Furthermore, on an intraday basis focusing on August 5, market liquidity subsided rapidly toward the afternoon session. At these hours, take orders were found to be concentrated on the seller side. Combined, they may have caused rapid market turbulence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The use of granular data has provided a new insight into the background and mechanism of the market turbulence on August 5, 2024, compared to previous literature that has been based mainly on the views of market participants or macro-level aggregated statistics. This is a novelty of this paper. On the other hand, there is one important caveat. The analysis is obliged to focus on the Japanese stock market. While other domestic and overseas markets, including bond, foreign exchange and derivatives, should be ideally analyzed all together given their close interconnectedness, it was not possible due predominantly to the lack of data availability.</p>
<p>Evaluating the impact of market fluctuations on financial stability is an important issue on the regulatory agenda. The FSA will continue to analyze the mechanism of sharp market turbulence and its impact on financial stability by enhancing analytical capabilities and expanding the scope of its analyses.</p>
</div>
<p>Enhancing the use of data in financial supervision and policy-making is a medium- to long-term agenda. The FSA will continue to build its data analysis capabilities and data infrastructure.</p>

<title>Japan Securities Clearing Corporation: Global Standardization Of Regulatory Reporting Leveraging DRR &amp; CDM</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/japan-securities-clearing-corporation-global-standardization-of-regulatory-repo/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/japan-securities-clearing-corporation-global-standardization-of-regulatory-repo/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Leveraging the new standardized framework for regulatory reporting based upon ISDA&rsquo;s (*1) globally promoted "Digital Regulatory Reporting (DRR)" solution and the FINOS (*2) open source managed "Common Domain Model (CDM)", JSCC plans to begin production-parallel operations of its regulatory reporting to the Financial Services Agency (FSA, the Japanese financial regulatory authority) and the CFTC (U.S. financial regulatory authority) from June 2025. JSCC is the first CCP (Central Counterparty) and Japanese entity to announce the adoption of DRR and CDM within a production environment.</span><br /><br /><span>JSCC joined The Linux Foundation in October 2023 and FINOS in June 2024 prior to its proof of concept utilizing DRR/CDM in August 2024, and has since conducted extensive discussions and experiments with major financial market organizations on the possibilities and future potential of open source software (OSS) and ecosystem-friendly solutions that can be shared globally and across industries. At the FINOS premier "Open Source in Finance Forum" held in New York in September 2024, JSCC's visionary efforts to date were recognized with JSCC being awarded the "Trailblazer Award."</span><br /><br /><span>JSCC President and CEO Konuma Yasuyuki said "Firstly, I would like to express my respect and gratitude to ISDA, FINOS, supporting developers, and all others involved with this cutting-edge global standard solution of DRR/CDM. I am also very pleased to now announce our plans to integrate DRR/CDM within our clearing organization processes. I want JSCC to continue its mid-long term perspective by proactively exploring further initiatives with global standardization and open sourced ecosystems that contribute to the advancement and stabilization of global financial markets."</span><br /><br /><span>&ldquo;We are delighted that JSCC is adopting ISDA&rsquo;s DRR as part of its regulatory reporting processes. By taking an industry-agreed interpretation of the reporting rules and converting it into code using the CDM, the ISDA DRR brings greater efficiency, automation, accuracy and consistency to the reporting of derivatives trades. ISDA has pledged to support 11 reporting rule sets in nine major jurisdictions through the DRR, so we look forward to working with JSCC as it rolls out its adoption,&rdquo; said Scott O&rsquo;Malia, Chief Executive of ISDA.</span><br /><br /><span>&ldquo;We are proud to have such an integral participant in the global market infrastructure like JSCC in the FINOS Community and to witness their swift adoption of the CDM,&rdquo; said Gabriele Columbro, Executive Director of FINOS and GM of Linux Foundation Europe. &ldquo;Since becoming an open standard in 2023 within our Open RegTech initiative, the CDM has seen substantial adoption by major financial institutions for regulatory applications. As this momentum continues, we anticipate more firms investing in open tooling to accelerate CDM adoption across a broader range of business use cases.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>With the production parallel from June 2025, JSCC will begin comparative verification against its production data from the current system for IRS (interest rate swaps) transaction reporting to FSA and CFTC. JSCC will furthermore add CDS (credit default swaps) to its DRR/CDM based regulatory reporting and incrementally expand the DRR functionality (together with ISDA's plans to increase the number of target regulatory authorities).</span><br /><span>Additionally, because CDM's future-oriented design framework may contribute to the innovative evolution of future financial systems, JSCC will continue on a mid-long term perspective to explore through experiments CDM's applicable scope.</span></p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The FSA has decided to establish a &ldquo;Working Group on Improving Internal Audits of Financial Institutions&rdquo; to discuss issues involved in internal audits with related organizations and external experts.<br />In September 2024, the FSA published &ldquo;<a href="https://www.fsa.go.jp/en/news/2024/20241218/ia/20241218.html">Monitoring Report for Improving Internal Audits of Financial Institutions (2024)</a>&rdquo; which summarizes the monitoring results of not only large banking groups but also regional financial institutions, large securities companies, and large insurance companies, with the FSA&rsquo;s recognition of issues and expectations.<br /> The report mentions that the FSA will continue to promote the improvement of internal audits by proceeding with in-depth monitoring of financial institutions and that the FSA will consider the necessity of updating the &ldquo;<span class="icon-pdf"><img alt="PDF" src="https://www.fsa.go.jp/images/common/icon_pdf.gif" /></span><a href="https://www.fsa.go.jp/en/news/2024/20240220/01.pdf">Current Situation and Issues for Improving Internal Audits of Financial Institutions</a>&rdquo;&nbsp; (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;Current Situation and Issues&rdquo;) based on the results of the monitoring and international trends regarding internal audit, including reconsideration of classification of internal audits levels (phases).<br /> The FSA believes that &ldquo;Current Situation and Issues&rdquo; should be updated to be able to present viewpoints that encourage improvements in the internal audits of entire financial institutions and that secure trust in them from domestic and foreign stakeholders.

<title>The SECâs Unusual Capacity To Serve The Public, SEC Chair Gary Gensler, Washington D.C., Jan. 14, 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-secs-unusual-capacity-to-serve-the-public-sec-chair-gary-gensler-washingt/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-secs-unusual-capacity-to-serve-the-public-sec-chair-gary-gensler-washingt/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good afternoon, welcome to this town hall, my final as Securities and Exchange Commission Chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;[Y]ou need administrators who are equipped to meet the best legal brains whom Wall Street always has at its disposal, who have stamina and do not weary of the fight, who are moved neither by blandishments nor fears, who in a word, unite public zeal with unusual capacity.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sec-011425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>So wrote Felix Frankfurter, a friend and advisor to President Franklin Roosevelt, and later Supreme Court Justice, in May of 1934 about the setting up of this great agency, the SEC.</p>
<p>For most people, when they reflect back on their lives and a life well lived, they generally focus on what counts, their loved ones&mdash;families and friends&mdash;and their broader communities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I think about public service. It&rsquo;s about giving back to our community, whether it be our neighborhood, county, or state&mdash;or, as we are so privileged to do as part of this agency, to this great nation of 335 million Americans.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the nearly 5,000 staff do at this remarkable agency. Your dedication to public service matters to everyday Americans, our economy, and U.S. standing in the world today. Further, your dedication to public service matters to everyday Americans, our economy, and U.S. standing in the world in the future.</p>
<p>We owe a debt of gratitude to those who set up our nation&rsquo;s great institutions, including the SEC, which serve the public and promote an inclusive society.</p>
<p>We owe a debt of gratitude to Roosevelt, Frankfurter, Chair Sam Rayburn,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sec-011425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Chair Duncan Fletcher,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sec-011425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;and the SEC&rsquo;s first Chair Joe Kennedy. They all had significant roles in enacting the securities laws or setting up this agency.</p>
<p>They all had lived through the 1920s when hucksters, fraudsters, scam artists, and Ponzi-like schemers took advantage of investors. They learned what happens when unregulated markets were left on their own.</p>
<p>Roosevelt and Congress understood that capital markets work best when they have both competition and common-sense rules of the road that lower risk and build trust.</p>
<p>I, too, deeply believe in capital markets, competition, and common-sense rules of the road that benefit investors and issuers alike.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you and this agency play such a critical role in overseeing the markets and ensuring for compliance with U.S. securities laws&rsquo; common-sense rules of the road.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so impressed by your dedication to public service, helping build better lives for the communities of today and tomorrow. No doubt many of you have made significant tradeoffs, financial and otherwise, to serve at the SEC. Most could get paid more working outside of government.</p>
<p>You work to ensure that our capital markets are competitive and inclusive, that they work for investors and issuers alike and not the other way around.</p>
<p>Our great institution has helped support this country&rsquo;s economic success these last 90 years. You have helped make our capital markets the deepest, most liquid, and best in the world. Your work maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets has helped raise the stature of the dollar and U.S. geopolitical standing.</p>
<p>As we all know, Joe Kennedy wasn&rsquo;t the only one in his family who was drawn to the great privilege of public service. His son, President John F. Kennedy, said, &ldquo;Let the public service be a proud and lively career.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sec-011425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;So inspired by these words, I also referenced them at the town hall held 11 years ago when leaving the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.</p>
<p>Serving the public in everchanging markets, technology and, yes, leadership of this agency, you all certainly have signed up for a proud and lively career.</p>
<p>My mom and dad never went to college. Three of my grandparents never got past 8<span>th</span>&nbsp;grade. They wanted what every Americans wants: a better future for their family.</p>
<p>William O. Douglas, the third SEC Chair and friend of Frankfurter, Roosevelt, and both Kennedys, said when speaking of the SEC, that we&rsquo;re &ldquo;the investors&rsquo; advocate.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sec-011425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s so appropriate that protecting investors is the first part of our three-part mission. The other two parts of our mission&mdash;maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets and facilitating capital formation&mdash;are deeply reliant on protecting investors. Investors won&rsquo;t come to a market they don&rsquo;t trust.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to pick a favorite among the various roles in which I&rsquo;ve had the privilege to serve over the years. I will say, though, that a distinguishing feature of this agency and you the staff is just how clearly you know, understand, and are truly dedicated to the agency&rsquo;s mission.</p>
<p>I thank you for taking me into your family these last four years and sharing this journey.</p>
<p>I thank my fellow Commissioners with whom I&rsquo;ve served: Allison Lee, Elad Roisman, Hester Peirce, Caroline Crenshaw, Mark Uyeda, and Jaime Liz&aacute;rraga.</p>
<p>I thank President Biden for nominating me and the U.S. Senate for confirming me to be Chair of the SEC. I thank my fellow regulators, here in the United States and abroad.</p>
<p>I want to give a special shoutout and thanks for all of those who have served these last four years in the Chair&rsquo;s office, as division directors, and as office heads. Though there&rsquo;s not enough time to name everyone, a special thank you to our two chiefs of staff over the years, Prashant Yerramalli and Amanda Fischer, for their wise counsel and help guiding the agency.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve gotten a lot done together for the American public. It&rsquo;s not measured in the thousands of cases (though there have been 2,700). It&rsquo;s not measured in the monetary returns to the public (though there have been $2.7 billion). It&rsquo;s not measured in rules we&rsquo;ve finalized (though we completed 46). It&rsquo;s not measured in the votes this Commission has taken together (though there have been more than 4,000). To me, it&rsquo;s best measured by what we gave back to our community, helping Americans in their everyday lives now and into the future.</p>
<p>You helped lower costs, lower risks, and enhance integrity in our two largest markets, the nearly $60 trillion stock market<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sec-011425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;and the $28 trillion Treasury market.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sec-011425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;You shortened the settlement cycle in half so people who sell their stock on a Monday now get their cash on a Tuesday.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sec-011425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p>You helped enhance the transparency and integrity of public company corporate governance, including by imposing new cooling-off periods and other conditions before corporate insiders who may have material nonpublic information can trade in their company&rsquo;s securities.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sec-011425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p>You met the demands of investors for greater disclosure around issuers&rsquo; material cyber<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sec-011425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;and climate<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sec-011425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;risks and promoted greater integrity in the market for special purpose acquisition companies.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sec-011425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>
<p>You helped put in place rules requiring covered broker-dealers and investment advisers to notify customers of data breaches that might put personal information at risk.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sec-011425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p>With an eye on financial stability, you updated rules for the $7 trillion money market funds sector<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sec-011425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;and the information we collect from the $30 trillion private funds sector.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sec-011425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></p>
<p>You helped reinvigorate the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and, for the first time, ensure that Chinese authorities would allow the PCAOB to inspect and investigate audit firms in China.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sec-011425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>You vigorously followed the facts and the law without fear or favor to ensure that market participants comply with the securities laws, whether it be regarding traditional financial products or more recent ones like crypto.</p>
<p>You set the stage for important debates to come with regard to the growing use of artificial intelligence in the world of finance.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve done all this great work while also maintaining the SEC as one of the best places to work in government.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sec-011425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></p>
<p>In that same 1934 letter, Frankfurter wrote these additional words to Roosevelt: &ldquo;Now the administration of the Stock Exchange Act will, I am sure, be even more difficult and call for greater skill, resourcefulness, firmness as well as fairness of temper, a wil1 not worn down by fatigue, than has been the work of the older regulatory commissions. The problems are more subtle, the abuses less obvious, the public more misleadable and the consequences of non-action more far reaching.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sec-011425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></p>
<p>I want to thank you for your stamina. For not wearying of the fight. For not being moved my blandishment nor fears. For your unusual capacity to serve the public.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Elon Musk For Violating The Beneficial Ownership Reporting Requirements Of The Federal Securities Laws</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-charges-elon-musk-for-violating-the-beneficial-ownership-reporting-requireme/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-charges-elon-musk-for-violating-the-beneficial-ownership-reporting-requireme/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it has filed an action against Elon Musk alleging that he failed to timely file a beneficial ownership report with the Commission after acquiring beneficial ownership of more than five percent of the outstanding shares of Twitter, Inc. common stock, in violation of the beneficial ownership reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;). According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Musk saved at least $150 million at the expense of Twitter shareholders by failing to timely file the beneficial ownership report.</p>
<p>Congress enacted the beneficial ownership reporting requirements to, among other things, help investors make informed investment decisions by providing information about accumulations of certain classes of equity securities by persons who have the potential to change or influence control of the issuer companies.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, after Musk failed to timely file a beneficial ownership report by March 24, 2022, he purchased more than $500 million worth of Twitter common stock between March 25, 2022 and April 1, 2022. As alleged, because Musk failed to timely file a beneficial ownership report with the SEC, he was able to make these purchases of Twitter common stock at artificially low prices from the unsuspecting public, who had not yet priced in the undisclosed material information of Musk&rsquo;s beneficial ownership of more than five percent of Twitter common stock and investment purpose. According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Musk underpaid by at least $150 million for his purchases of Twitter common stock in this period. The complaint further alleges that, due to Musk&rsquo;s failure to timely file a beneficial ownership report with the SEC, investors that sold Twitter common stock between March 25, 2022 and April 1, 2022 did so at artificially low prices, thereby suffering substantial economic harm.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, charges Musk with violating Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13d-1 thereunder. Section 13(d) imposes a strict liability standard. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.</p>

<title>US Office Of The Comptroller Of The Currency Imposes Civil Money Penalties Against Three Former Executives Of Wells Fargo</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today announced enforcement actions against three former senior executives of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Sioux Falls, South Dakota (bank). These actions were taken in response to the former executives&rsquo; unsafe or unsound banking practices related to the bank&rsquo;s systemic and widespread sales practices misconduct.</p>
<p>The enforcement actions are described in two written decisions issued by Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael J. Hsu, covering Claudia Russ Anderson and jointly covering David Julian and Paul McLinko, as follows:</p>
<table class="row-border stripe dataTable no-footer dtr-inline" id="example_limited_1">
<thead> 
<tr>
<th>Name</th><th>Former Position</th><th>Relief Ordered</th>
</tr>
</thead> 
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Claudia Russ Anderson</td>
<td>Community Bank Group Risk Officer</td>
<td>Prohibition Order and $10,000,000 Civil Money Penalty (CMP)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>David Julian</td>
<td>Chief Auditor</td>
<td>Personal Cease &amp; Desist Order and $7,000,000 CMP</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Paul McLinko</td>
<td>Executive Audit Director</td>
<td>Personal Cease &amp; Desist Order and $1,500,000 CMP</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The decision covering Ms. Anderson found that from 2013 to 2016, she failed to credibly challenge the bank&rsquo;s incentive compensation program, failed to institute effective controls to manage risks posed by sales practices misconduct, failed to escalate known or obvious risks, and repeatedly and consistently downplayed the sales practices misconduct. The decision also noted that Ms. Anderson committed violations of law by failing to provide information or providing false, incomplete, or misleading information to the OCC during its 2015 examinations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A separate decision concluded that during the same period, Mr. Julian and Mr. McLinko failed to plan and manage audit activity that would detect and document sales practices misconduct and failed to adequately escalate the sales practices misconduct. Mr. McLinko also failed to maintain professional independence from the Community Bank, the Bank&rsquo;s largest business line that housed the retail branches.</p>
<p>The decisions issued today explained that under pressure to meet unreasonable sales goals, thousands of employees at the bank engaged in widespread sales practices misconduct.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s written decisions and orders stem from the Notice of Charges the OCC filed in January 2020, which began the administrative litigation. An Administrative Law Judge issued three recommended decisions in December 2022 following a 38-day administrative hearing. These are the remaining outstanding enforcement actions among those that the OCC pursued against 11 individuals related to the bank&rsquo;s systemic and widespread sales practices misconduct. The OCC previously reached resolution with eight other former Wells Fargo senior bank executives, resulting in their payment of civil money penalties totaling $43,175,000.</p>

<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Chief Accountant Paul Munter plans to retire from federal service effective Jan. 24, 2025. Mr. Munter joined the agency in 2019, was named Acting Chief Accountant in 2021, and was appointed Chief Accountant in January 2023.</p>

I wish him the best in his retirement from federal service.&rdquo;</p>

<title>US Federal And State Financial Regulatory Agencies Issue Interagency Statement On Supervisory Practices Regarding Financial Institutions Affected By The California Wildfires And Straight-Line Winds</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board, the National Credit Union Administration, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, collectively the agencies, recognize the serious impact of the California wildfires and straight-line winds on the customers and operations of many financial institutions and will provide appropriate regulatory assistance to affected institutions subject to their supervision. The agencies encourage institutions operating in the affected areas to meet the financial services needs of their communities.</p>
<p>A complete list of the current disaster areas can be found at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fema.gov/disaster/declarations" target="_blank">https://www.fema.gov/disaster/declarations</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Lending:</strong>&nbsp;The agencies encourage financial institutions to work constructively with borrowers in communities affected by the California wildfires and straight-line winds. Prudent efforts to adjust or alter terms on existing loans in affected areas are supported by the agencies and should not be subject to examiner criticism. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, institutions should individually evaluate modifications of existing loans to determine whether modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty should be accounted for as a new loan or a continuance of an existing loan. In making this evaluation, institutions should consider the facts and circumstances of each borrower and appropriately report the modification in the institution's call report. In supervising institutions affected by the California wildfires and straight-line winds, the agencies will consider the unusual circumstances these institutions face. The agencies recognize that efforts to work with borrowers in communities under stress can be consistent with safe-and-sound practices as well as in the public interest.</p>
<p><strong>Temporary Facilities:</strong>&nbsp;The agencies understand that many financial institutions face staffing, power, telecommunications, and other challenges in re-opening facilities after the California wildfires and straight-line winds. In cases in which operational challenges persist, the primary federal or state regulator will expedite, as appropriate, any request to operate temporary facilities to provide more convenient availability of services to those affected by the California wildfires and straight-line winds. In most cases, a telephone notice to the primary federal or state regulator will suffice initially to start the approval process, with necessary written notification being submitted shortly thereafter.</p>
<p><strong>Publishing Requirements:</strong>&nbsp;The agencies understand that the damage caused by the California wildfires and straight-line winds may affect compliance with publishing and other requirements for branch closings, relocations, and temporary facilities under various laws and regulations. Institutions experiencing disaster-related difficulties in complying with any publishing or other requirements should contact their primary federal or state regulator.</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory Reporting Requirements:</strong>&nbsp;Institutions affected by the California wildfires and straight-line winds that expect to encounter difficulty meeting the agencies' reporting requirements should contact their primary federal or state regulator to discuss their situation. The agencies do not expect to assess penalties or take other supervisory action against institutions that take reasonable and prudent steps to comply with the agencies' regulatory reporting requirements if those institutions are unable to fully satisfy those requirements because of the California wildfires and straight-line winds.</p>
<p>The agencies' staffs stand ready to work with affected institutions that may be experiencing problems fulfilling their reporting responsibilities, taking into account each institution's particular circumstances, including the status of its reporting and recordkeeping systems and the condition of its underlying financial records.</p>
<p><strong>Community Reinvestment Act (CRA):</strong>&nbsp;Financial institutions may receive CRA consideration for community development loans, investments, or services that revitalize or stabilize federally designated disaster areas in their assessment areas or in the states or regions that include their assessment areas. For additional information, refer to the Interagency Questions and Answers Regarding Community Reinvestment at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ffiec.gov/cra/qnadoc.htm" target="_blank">https://www.ffiec.gov/cra/qnadoc.htm</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Investments:</strong>&nbsp;Institutions are encouraged to monitor municipal securities and loans affected by the California wildfires and straight-line winds. The agencies realize local government projects may be negatively affected by the disaster and encourage institutions to engage in appropriate monitoring and take prudent efforts to stabilize such investments.</p>
