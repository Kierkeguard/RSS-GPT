<p><span>Nat outlines the Bank of England's new approach to stress testing banks, and developments in stress tests of other parts of the financial sector. He sets out his aspirations for the future, including the importance of joining the dots between exercises to understand system-wide dynamics further.</span></p>
<h2>Speech</h2>
<p>Hi everyone, thank you for the opportunity to be with you today, and thanks to The City UK for hosting us. Let&rsquo;s talk about stress testing.</p>
<p>Last November, the Bank of England released a number of stress testing publications alongside the Financial Stability Report (FSR). We published our 2024 desk-based stress test results, the results of our system-wide exploratory scenario (the &ldquo;SWES&rdquo;), and we also published our new approach to stress testing the UK banking system. This replaces the previous framework set out in 2015 and is a significant step forward for us.</p>
<p>Today I want to outline the features of our new approach to stress testing banks, and set it in context of the history of stress tests as well as the other stress testing work that the we do. Looking ahead, I will set out some of our aspirations for the future, including the need to &lsquo;join the dots&rsquo; between stress tests.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about the importance of: stress testing in good times so that we&rsquo;re prepared for bad times; focusing on how the system as a whole supports households and businesses; being nimble and proportionate; and understanding behaviours.</p>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>Our approach to stress testing is rooted in the 2008 global financial crisis. Although there have been stresses since then, we should not forget the sheer impact of that crisis worldwide, the far-reaching consequences for households and businesses, and the considerable loss of economic growth that ensued in many economies, including here in the UK.</p>
<p>Stress testing was used by supervisors and firms for some time before the crisis.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/january/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-the-city-uk-the-future-of-stress-testing#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;But as we noted at the time, the results from these early exercises could be somewhat &lsquo;preliminary and partial&rsquo;. And focused on specific risks rather than a detailed analysis of a scenario at both the individual and banking system-wide levels.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/january/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-the-city-uk-the-future-of-stress-testing#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[2]</a></sup>&nbsp;When the crisis struck, stress testing took on a different dynamic, becoming a powerful tool used by authorities internationally to stem it. Regulators could evaluate how bad things were, how much banks stood to lose, how much more capital they needed. And then recapitalised them accordingly.</p>
<p>During the height of the financial crisis, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) undertook sequential firm-by-firm stress tests. And EU-wide stress tests were carried out in 2009 and 2010. I will never forget my own participation &ndash; during my time at the Federal Reserve over that period &ndash; in what was to become the first public concurrent stress tests of banks. It was a pioneering exercise, which achieved its ultimate goal of stemming the crisis, by providing evidence and taking action to increase capital so that regulators, firms and commentators felt able to call its bottom.</p>
<p>Stress tests proved to be a useful tool for understanding, quantifying and communicating financial resilience. Regulators globally developed ongoing stress testing programmes. In the UK, that allowed the FSA, and then the Bank, to enhance their analysis of banks&rsquo; balance sheets under stress. Many UK banks are global in nature, and stress testing enabled us to understand how the impact of both UK and international stresses impacted their resilience. After the acute period of the crisis was over, stress tests by regulators continued to support the strengthening of banks&rsquo; capital and the improvement in their internal stress testing and broader risk management. They were part of a wider package of measures &ndash; such as Basel III, the UK leverage ratio, and closer supervision &ndash; to enhance the resilience of the banking system to shocks. And crucially its ability to support the real economy through bad times, rather than causing and amplifying stresses, as in 2008.</p>
<p>When the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) was first established, one of its first priorities was to complete the capital build post-crisis. Stress testing was key to achieving that. In 2014, the Bank of England launched its first public, concurrent stress test of the UK banking system. It assessed simultaneously the performance of major UK banks&rsquo; capital positions under the same scenario &ndash; and their ability to recover while still lending to the real economy. It compared results across banks, and assessed the broader impact on financial stability. The test used our approach of combining submissions from participating banks with our own modelling and judgements to derive and publish firm-specific results.</p>
<p>Then in 2015, we set out our approach to concurrent stress testing, which had two components. The first was financial resilience stress tests, called the annual cyclical scenario, which enabled us to assess banks&rsquo; capital positions against a severe but plausible adverse scenario. The scenarios in these exercises were countercyclical. And we set them so they could be used to inform the setting of capital buffers. Our latest annual cyclical scenario results were published in 2023.</p>
<p>The second component was the biennial exploratory scenario (BES) which is used to test risks not neatly linked to the financial cycle. For example, in 2021 we published the results of our test of the risks from climate change.</p>
<p>On a micro-prudential level &ndash; the level of individual firms, relevant to the Prudential Regulation Committee &ndash; the objective was to promote the safety and soundness of UK banks by assessing their capital adequacy in the face of a range of adverse shocks. This helped identify necessary improvements in risk and capital management practices within firms. And it has informed the setting of firm-specific capital buffers. On a macroprudential level &ndash; the level of the banking system, relevant to the FPC &ndash; the tests helped us form a view on the resilience of the banking system as a whole. As a result, we used them to inform decisions that apply to the whole sector, such as setting the countercyclical capital buffer.</p>
<p>So stress tests have supported the significant and much-needed build-up of capital in the UK banking system. Over time, as banks became better capitalised they got to and stayed where we would expect them to be in the scenario: above the test&rsquo;s hurdle rate. As a result, the role of the annual cyclical scenario has become less about obtaining specific point estimates of capital and more about understanding how different stresses can impact banks in different ways, and wider learnings.</p>
<p>As well as this role in the capital build, stress testing strengthened our approach to supervising banks and ensuring financial stability in a number of ways. It helped identify risks on banks&rsquo; balance sheets, and supported a continued improvement in banks&rsquo; own risk management and capital planning capabilities. It has proved to be one of the best tools we have to benchmark across banks and compare their activities. Our stress tests also revealed issues about banks&rsquo; performance in stress which informed policy developments, for example to address pro-cyclicality in mortgage risk weights. And crucially, they served a key role externally as an accountability device and a way to enhance public confidence in banks and the financial system. Quite simply, it is one of the most effective tools we have to demonstrate that major UK banks are safe and sound, and can support households and businesses in bad times, rather than make things worse. We&rsquo;ve seen the benefits of that in the recent challenging years in the wake of the pandemic, where for example banks could afford to give many households more time to repay their mortgages.</p>
<h3>Developments since our previous approach</h3>
<p>Alongside this gradual shift in what we learn from stress tests, the major macroeconomic and global shocks we have faced in recent years have led to change. They have required us to take a more adaptable and nimble approach, more informed by prevailing economic conditions. The Covid pandemic in particular had a big impact on our approach to stress testing: in the face of such a major shock hitting the UK economy, we had to adapt, reflecting that this was the first time we had to do a stress test during an actual stress since the global financial crisis.</p>
<p>In 2020, we ran an internal desktop exercise that gave us rapid insights into the potential impacts of the pandemic, instead of the usual lengthier test with firm submissions. Doing this also allowed banks to divert resources to where they were most needed at the time.</p>
<p>We also ran a &lsquo;reverse stress test&rsquo; in 2020, to analyse the unfolding macroeconomic conditions and how bad things could get. Specifically we tested how much worse the economic outcome would need to get to deplete banks&rsquo; capital by as much as in the 2019 annual cyclical scenario.</p>
<p>In 2021, we returned to a test involving firm submissions, but instead of the usual severe but plausible scenario, we tested to a more extreme adverse scenario to gain insights into the potential impact of a worsening of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Through these episodes we learned the value of being adaptable, and being able to carry out different exercises, using different scenarios, and at varying levels of granularity and speed. These different types of tests are useful in telling us what we need to know at the time. They provide a reliable assessment of a particular scenario we want to explore &ndash; without undue burden on us or firms &ndash; which we can trust to inform our decisions even in times of great uncertainty. Rather than having to speculate or rely overly on subjective judgments.</p>
<p>Most recently in 2024, we ran a desk-based stress test. By being desk-based we were able to test the resilience of the banking system to two alternate scenarios (as opposed to just one scenario in the full tests involving firm submissions). We tested an aggregate demand shock where growth collapses and interest rates fall rapidly, and an aggregate supply shock where inflation and interest rates go up. The test was based on our own modelling and judgements rather than requiring firm submissions.</p>
<p>As well as testing the banking system, the Bank has also developed its wider toolkit for stress testing to cover different parts of the financial sector. Since 2015 we have been undertaking insurance stress tests assessing the financial resilience of the general insurance sector and since 2019 of the life insurance sector, too. Those exercises give us valuable insights into the sector and its firms, beyond what can be obtained from a firm&rsquo;s own solvency and risk management reports. They also help the Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA) be better prepared to respond to potential shocks affecting the insurance sector.</p>
<p>In 2025, the PRA&rsquo;s stress testing framework for the life insurance sector will be enhanced by the intent to publish individual firm results.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/january/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-the-city-uk-the-future-of-stress-testing#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[3]</a></sup>&nbsp;This will provide market participants with additional transparent and independent measures of an insurer&rsquo;s resilience, and facilitate market education and self-discipline. And actually the next life insurance stress test will be launched tomorrow, so keep an eye out for that!</p>
<p>Since 2022, the Bank has also conducted annual stress tests of UK Central Counterparties (CCPs), which are used to assess CCPs&rsquo; financial resilience, and to promote transparency and confidence in the UK&rsquo;s clearing system. They include &ldquo;reverse&rdquo; stress testing, subjecting CCPs to different combinations of increasingly severe scenarios, numbers of defaulters, and costs of liquidating concentrated positions. CCP exercises have also included more agile desk-based stress testing, which can shed light on dark corners by exploring the impact of a wider range of scenarios. CCP stress tests consider the impact on liquidity needs of their clearing members as part of the test, highlighting the system-wide analysis we do and need to do more of, which I will come onto later.</p>
<p>And most recently, we undertook a new and first-of-its-kind system-wide exercise, the SWES. The SWES aimed to test the resilience of UK markets that are core to our country&rsquo;s economy. By improving our understanding of the behaviours under stressed conditions of banks and non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) participating in those markets. And most importantly how those behaviours might interact to amplify shocks and cascade from one market to another. We published the results of it at the end of 2024, and my colleague Lee Foulger discussed these in a recent speech.<sup><sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/january/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-the-city-uk-the-future-of-stress-testing#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[4]</a></sup></sup>&nbsp;We and the participants learned a lot from this exercise &ndash; it proved incredibly insightful.</p>
<h3>The updated approach to stress-testing the banks</h3>
<p>Taking stock of these changes since our original approach to bank stress testing in 2015, we have reflected on the need to be adaptable, the shift in the context of our stress tests more broadly, and how we have been using them in practice.</p>
<p>Our updated approach combines the predictability of regular stress testing for cyclical risks with the adaptability the Bank has used in recent years to explore different risks. It also benefitted from engagement with participating banks, academics, and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>It has three key components:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, we will continue to run a financial resilience test of risks related to the financial cycle, involving submissions from participating banks, but it will be every other year. It will otherwise be akin to the previous annual cyclical scenario test and, will inform capital buffer setting. Going forward we are calling this biennial exercise simply the Bank Capital Stress Test. Because it does what it says on the tin.</li>
<li>Second, in the intervening years we will supplement our assessment of the resilience of the banking system using stress testing when appropriate, but in a way that is much less burdensome for banks than our full Bank Capital Stress Tests. For example, through desk-based exercises.</li>
<li>Third, the Bank will continue to use exploratory exercises involving participation from banks, akin to the BES of the previous framework, but not strictly biennially. These tests will be a means of assessing other risks, including structural and emerging risks that are not closely linked to the financial cycle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reducing the frequency of big firm submission tests represents a considerable efficiency gain, without compromising our assessment of financial stability. It ensures the burden placed on participating banks is proportionate, and supports the UK banking sector&rsquo;s competitiveness and growth. This change creates space for banks, and for us, to assess and address a wider set of risks facing the banking sector and will provide better insights in an evolving risk environment.</p>
<p>It will also give participating banks greater capacity to invest in improvements in data (particularly crucial if they want to make the most of artificial intelligence, by the way), modelling, and risk management. In turn that will further enhance the ability of stress tests to deliver insights over the medium- to long-term.</p>
<p>The new approach does not represent a reduction in the importance and value we place on stress testing, quite the opposite. But it reflects an evolution of how we use it.</p>
<p>A key reason why we are comfortable reducing the frequency of the full cyclical tests involving bank submissions is because banks are now much better capitalised. The last time we asked a participating bank to submit a capital plan to increase its level of capital as a result of a stress test was 2016. The tests have become increasingly about wider insights. So while we will still be keeping an eye on capital adequacy as a matter of routine, we no longer feel it needs to be done via a big set-piece every year. Especially given the cost of doing so and the benefits of exploring a wider range of risks.</p>
<p>Now while we value adaptability and the ability to use a range of tests to be more nimble, we also know the importance of predictability for participants to plan ahead. We intend for the Bank Capital Stress Test to be carried out every other year. And for other exercises involving firm submissions, as we have done in recent exploratory exercises, we&rsquo;ll engage with participants well in advance so they have time to prepare, and we&rsquo;ll endeavour to ensure submissions are proportionate. And when considering the timing of a future exercise, we will watch carefully the sequencing with other exercises.</p>
<p>The new approach will also allow scope for synergies between the various bank stress tests, as well as between those and stress tests of other parts of the financial sector. For example, a desk-based stress test might allow initial exploration of a risk which could subsequently be incorporated into the scenario for a Bank Capital Stress Test. Alternatively, a Bank Capital Stress Test may reveal a vulnerability that could become the focus of an exploratory stress test or targeted exercise.</p>
<p>The new approach is more adaptable and risk responsive. It represents a pivot away from looking at point estimate capital positions, to instead look at wider learnings about vulnerabilities and pockets of risk. It provides space to explore scenarios and the sources of potential future crises, but without losing the indispensable regular checks on financial resilience.</p>
<p>Now while we love stress tests &ndash; as you can tell! &ndash; we need to remember that they can&rsquo;t give us all the answers. Credit Suisse was a perfect example of this. It is not a lack of capital that caused their failure, and indeed they passed many stress tests. Some answers have to come from elsewhere &ndash; although this is not the topic of today.</p>
<h3>Joining the dots</h3>
<p>We are excited about this updated approach. We feel it reflects the changes to the sector since the inception of the framework and draws out what we have found useful in practice over the first decade of concurrent stress testing. I believe it gives us the flexibility we need without losing the rigour of the previous approach.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the next challenge we face is what I call &lsquo;joining the dots&rsquo;. We have been running relatively separate tests of different sectors &ndash; those of banks, insurers, CCPs and system-wide &ndash; expanding our understanding with each successive exercise. In the future, I would like to use our approach to draw together even better our broader toolkit of exercises across sectors to enhance our understanding of system-wide dynamics.</p>
<p>Risk-taking has shifted across the financial sector since the early days of stress tests, and we must use our toolkit to widen our understanding of the financial system and gain an increasingly comprehensive view of the risks affecting it. By joining the dots between exercises and findings, we can take an increasingly &ldquo;macro&rdquo; view of risks and vulnerabilities across the system. This will allow us to focus on testing the provision of vital services, and this requires a better understanding of the dynamics of the system not just a focus on individual institutions, as Sarah Breeden recently spoke to.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/january/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-the-city-uk-the-future-of-stress-testing#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Lending and market-making is increasingly shifting away from banks to NBFIs. The figures are striking. NBFIs now account for around half of total UK financial assets. Over the last two decades, NBFIs has accounted for the entirety of the cumulated increase in new UK corporate lending in the UK, and for example, NBFIs now account for 50% of the stock of corporate lending. However, importantly, banks remain exposed to these risks through providing repo, leverage, and other forms of wholesale finance to non-banks &ndash; so banks remain very much involved, but in a different way. There has also been a recent increase in Significant Risk Transfer transactions, which can help banks achieve capital relief on the risk transferred to investors, through securitisation. That trend provides further evidence of interconnectedness between banks and the rest of the financial sector, and how risks can be distributed from banks to different corners of the financial system. The consequences of this need to be understood.</p>
<p>We are also seeing risks transferred from banks to insurers, or shared between them. For example, we need to continue to explore the links between banks&rsquo; mortgage lending and insurance policies against flooding, and the impact of climate change on both sectors. As highlighted in our latest FSR, we have been looking at the vulnerabilities emerging at the intersection of life insurance and private equity.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/january/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-the-city-uk-the-future-of-stress-testing#footnote-7" id="footnote-ref-7"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[6]</a></sup>&nbsp;Life insurance and reinsurance premiums are increasingly used as funding for lending activities in private credit via private-equity-backed insurers and reinsurers. In this regard, and with respect to UK insurers&rsquo; use of funded reinsurance, the 2025 life insurance stress test will provide useful insights into potential channels of disruptions. This highlights that some risks are very difficult to understand without taking a cross-sectoral view.</p>
<p>These examples underscore the need to &lsquo;join the dots&rsquo; and take in the broader picture, where a &lsquo;sum of the parts&rsquo; approach may not give the right view.</p>
<p>The idea is of course to continue our sectoral stress tests, but ensuring we are increasingly linking the findings from them, and using one exercise to inform another. In practice, this could start with exploring scenario consistency and coherence between tests. We might consider where common scenarios could be used and the results of one stress test can inform another. One example of joining up our findings might be if market-focussed exercises reveal behaviours under stress that are relevant for the way we test resilience within specific sectors of firms.</p>
<p>Over time, we could seek a deeper understanding of interconnections, combined effects, and amplifications. I think we should aim for that. My aspiration is towards future stress tests that capture interlinkages and feedback loops between sectors. That could help us spot risks that are truly system-wide and not otherwise identifiable in isolation.</p>
<p>This is clearly part of a journey, and we won&rsquo;t have all the answers immediately about how best to do this. But it is our direction of travel. We will learn by doing, gradually, and together with market participants themselves. This important work will allow us to provide a fuller picture of whether the financial sector, as a whole, is able to do its job of supporting households and businesses in both good and bad times. Which is our ultimate goal.</p>
<p>The recent SWES has represented a big leap towards this goal. It proved to be an effective tool for understanding vulnerabilities that would not be apparent from sector-specific analysis alone. By including firms from a range of sectors and running it in two rounds we could explore how the collective actions of firms in markets can amplify a shock (such as through forced sales), and understand system-level liquidity flows (such as how a shock at one fund causes them to redeem from another or how initial margin is recycled in the system). We can better understand how the actions of one firm can impact its investors or counterparties and the system-level consequences (such as whether repo will be rolled and the consequences if not). We are committed to continuing to invest in our capabilities in this area, to be able to carry out system-wide exercises in a more desk-based way, allowing us to monitor risks and understand how different shocks could play out, leading to more informed policy-making. And there will certainly be other system-wide dynamics or ecosystems that would benefit from future SWES-style exercises.</p>
<p>And as part of this increasingly holistic view of stress tests, we continue to consider their interaction with those we run on our own central bank balance sheet.</p>
<p>The need for this more joined-up approach is greater than ever, because the shape of risks to financial stability are evolving fast and with increasing interconnectedness. To stay on top of things we need to consider the broader macro picture at the level of the whole financial sector. Otherwise, we would risk engaging in a &lsquo;whack-a-mole game&rsquo; that would be difficult to win.</p>
<p>For example, increasing digitalisation over recent years has changed the risk environment &ndash; firms are more vulnerable, for instance, to rapid liquidity outflows. Cyber risks are another consequence of this changing risk landscape, and the Bank will increasingly need to focus on such non-financial stresses to support our wider understanding. The Bank has been undertaking stress tests of cyber resilience since 2019 and continues to do so. As we outlined in our last FSR, cyber-attacks are one channel of increased risks that come with elevated geopolitical tensions. My FPC colleague Carolyn Wilkins will be speaking soon on this subject, and the increasing importance of how we capture geopolitical risks.</p>
<h3>The value of stress testing for understanding systemic risks</h3>
<p>Indeed, the need to join the dots is set against a broader context of a transition away from the last decade into a new era marked by a tighter monetary environment, digitalisation, and climate change, against a broader backdrop of increased geopolitical tensions. As outlined in our most recent FSR, &ldquo;uncertainty around, and risks to, the central outlook have increased and global risks associated with geopolitical tensions, global fragmentation and pressures on sovereign debt levels remain material&rdquo;.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/january/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-the-city-uk-the-future-of-stress-testing#footnote-8" id="footnote-ref-8"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[7]</a></sup>&nbsp;The world is an unpredictable place. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023 also served as a sharp reminder of how quickly risks can crystalise and how losses of confidence can impact a bank or cohort of banks.</p>
<p>In this uncertainty lies a key strength of our approach to stress testing: the scenarios we test are not predictions of macroeconomic and financial conditions in the UK or abroad. Instead, they are hypothetical scenarios that we believe are useful to explore because they help spot the right risks and vulnerabilities in the system. They allow us, and just as importantly, firms themselves, to take steps to prepare for a range of plausible outcomes. And to emphasise, this is a great strength of stress testing in an uncertain world: it helps ensure the financial system is able to support the economy under a range of circumstances, at a time when it&rsquo;s difficult to work out which ones are most likely.</p>
<p>On the topic of helping firms prepare themselves for plausible scenarios, it is clear that a valuable aspect of our stress tests is the disclosure of the results. That supports market discipline and enables the financial sector to be the first line of defence and take necessary action to manage risks. Publishing the results enables us to convey key messages about risks and vulnerabilities in a constructive manner. The more we do so in benign times, the more we enable the industry to fix the roof while the sun is shining, ahead of real stresses.</p>
<p>Moreover, in a test involving firms, we can also provide private bilateral feedback on participants&rsquo; modelling or judgements, and explore where their approach departs from peers. This can help speak to the lack of perfect information for individual participants in a system, allowing us to play out the reactions of many actors. For example, the SWES highlighted mismatches in firms&rsquo; expectations of how each other will act in a stress &ndash; and that led us to recommend that market participants consider taking steps to prepare for the risk that they cannot access additional repo during market stresses. By shining a light on how scenarios might unfold, our stress tests allow us and market participants to mitigate risks pre-emptively. We have received a positive response on the usefulness of the information we shared from the SWES results, including for firms own internal risk management.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s important because market participants need to be able to deal with severe but plausible scenarios themselves, without expecting authorities to intervene and put taxpayer money at risk, as in 2008. Having said that, some scenarios are so severe and extreme that they can&rsquo;t reasonably be mitigated in advance. Indeed if we tried to eradicate all possible risks, this would lead to the &lsquo;stability of the graveyard&rsquo; and stunt growth. So we do not expect firms to have ex ante resilience for each and every shock. We are not seeking through stress testing to remove all risk-taking from the system. And like other companies, financial institutions can and should be able to fail in an orderly way.</p>
<p>What we as policymakers care about is the resilience of the system as a whole, and its ability to continue supporting the real economy in severe but plausible scenarios without the need for intervention by public authorities.</p>
<p>Even then, some shocks may be so large, and the cost of the whole sector insuring itself against them would be so great, that trying to do so would hamper the provision of vital financial services in normal times.</p>
<p>So as well as ensuring firms are prepared for risks, it is also important we at the Bank of England have tools in our toolkit to step in when financial stability comes under threat. For example, in recognition of the increased importance of NBFIs, which I mentioned earlier, the Bank has been working to develop tools to lend to them directly in times of severe dysfunction in core UK financial markets when financial stability is under threat, as Dave Ramsden spoke about in December.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/january/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-the-city-uk-the-future-of-stress-testing#footnote-9" id="footnote-ref-9"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[8]</a></sup>&nbsp;This is the latest addition to our toolbox. Not all resilience can be built in ex ante. Some resilience has to come from having the right tools to manage the stresses that threaten stability as they arise.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>We need to be selective and deliberate. Financial stability is indispensable for sustained economic growth &ndash; as the considerable loss of growth caused by the 2008 crisis starkly reminds us. The focus of our stress tests has to be guided by the ultimate aim of financial stability, which is the provision &ndash; by the financial sector as a whole &ndash; of vital services to the real economy, such as lending, saving, insurance, payments, etc. in both good and bad times. Stress tests help us be focussed and selective, and therefore enable us to be proportionate.</p>
<p>That means future Bank Capital Stress Tests will continue to test banks&rsquo; ability to keep lending through a stress &ndash; maintaining sufficient capital to absorb losses as they occur whilst continuing to support UK households and businesses, rather than closing shop to protect themselves. But our approach is also pivoting towards identifying vulnerabilities and pockets of risk, in step with a changing world. Directing resources where needed, being increasingly nimble, and ensuring the burden on firms is reasonable.</p>
<p>And importantly, it allows us to continue joining the dots between various stress tests across the financial sector. By better linking insights and the design of our tests, we can gradually build a comprehensive, holistic, view of the interaction between the financial sector and the economy. In doing so, we can respond to the changing risk environment and uncertainty of today&rsquo;s world. We can reflect the shift or sharing of risk between sectors. And we can do so in a way that is proportionate and selective, and provides the stability needed to support growth.</p>
<p>Finally, I encourage firms across the industry to adopt a similar mindset of joining the dots. The financial system is increasingly interconnected, and participants having open lines of communication with their financial counterparties to understand each other&rsquo;s reaction function in a stress is very helpful for the resilience of the system as a whole. It&rsquo;s part of being the first line of defence.</p>
<p>Stress tests have a bright future. I am proud of how far we have come, and excited about how much more we can get out of them.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<title>The Bank Of England And The Commodity Futures Trading Commission Input Into Report On Initial Margin Transparency And Responsiveness In Centrally Cleared Markets</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-bank-of-england-and-the-commodity-futures-trading-commission-input-into-repo/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-bank-of-england-and-the-commodity-futures-trading-commission-input-into-repo/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="page-section">
<p>The Bank of England (the Bank) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC) have co-chaired international work on centrally cleared margin practices stemming from the March 2020 market turmoil, also known as the &lsquo;dash for cash&rsquo;. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), the Bank for International Settlements&rsquo; Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) today published their final report: &ldquo;Transparency and responsiveness of initial margin in centrally cleared markets &ndash; review and policy proposals&rdquo; which sets out policy proposals designed to increase the resilience of centrally cleared markets.</p>
<p>The Bank and the CFTC support the report&rsquo;s findings, including the policy proposals which aim to improve centrally cleared market participants&rsquo; understanding of potential future margin requirements and margin responsiveness through enhanced central counterparty (CCP) and clearing member transparency and governance practices. Some of the key conclusions include the need for greater transparency on initial margin models (including through appropriate disclosures and the provision of enhanced margin simulation tools) and appropriate governance arrangements on the setting of initial margin requirements.</p>
<p>This report builds on the BCBS-CPMI-IOSCO report&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d537.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Review of margining practices<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;published in September 2022 which identified six areas for further policy work in conjunction to the Financial Stability Board&rsquo;s (the FSB) work programme on non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI). The Financial Policy Committee has supported work to reduce vulnerabilities through internationally coordinated reforms. This includes work on margining practices and leverage in NBFI which may contribute to sudden spikes in the demand for cash in stress, disrupting financial stability.</p>
<p>Highlighting the analytical efforts and industry consultations undertaken, the co-chairs Sasha Mills and Richard Haynes thanked the members of the ad hoc BCBS-CPMI-IOSCO margin group for their collaborative participation in finalising the policy proposals.</p>
<p><strong>Sasha Mills, Executive Director, Financial Market Infrastructure, Bank of England, said:</strong></p>
<p><em>"</em>The international work on centrally cleared initial margin is a powerful example of addressing financial stability risks through international coordination across authorities and committees. The Bank will continue to support this work as standard-setting bodies consider how best to implement the proposals."</p>
<p><strong>Richard Haynes, Deputy Director of Risk Surveillance, CFTC, said:</strong></p>
<p>"<a id="_Hlk187752104"></a>The BCBS-CPMI-IOSCO margin group, by focusing on detailed data from a broad set of global regions, was able to sift between market rumours and reality, and achieve a balanced and pragmatic set of policy conclusions for implementation"</p>

<title>For The First Time, The Listing Of ETFs On Digital Assets - Tel Aviv Stock Exchange Continues To Develop The Israeli Capital Market And Introduce Innovative Products - Facilitating, For The First Time, The Listing Of ETFs On Digital Assets</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>TASE published today a draft for public comments that introduces the listing on TASE of ETFs on digital assets, such as Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The amendment of the Guidelines will enable the listing of ETFs that track digital currencies. This move, which is the first of its kind in Israel, is aligned with steps implemented by advanced global capital markets to facilitate the public&rsquo;s exposure to innovative financial assets in a controlled, regulated and transparent environment. The listing of ETFs on digital assets will give the Israeli public, for the first time, access to digital assets through local issuers, accompanied by international index editors - locally on TASE.</p>
<p>By investing in digital assets through financial instruments that would be issued and listed on TASE, the Israeli public can enjoy innovation and progress without being required to maintain a personal digital wallet.</p>
<p>As previously reported, one of the stated goals of TASE&rsquo;s strategic plan is venturing into the digital assets sector. This move is another step in TASE&rsquo;s mission of introducing innovations in the field of digital assets.</p>
<p>The option of listing of ETFs on digital assets became available following the Israel Securities Authority&rsquo;s approval of the issue of mutual funds on digital assets. TASE now aims to realize this option by expanding the Guidelines to also support the listing of ETFs on digital assets.</p>
<p>According to the proposed amendment, a digital asset could be used as a tracked asset if it is traded on trading platforms whose published prices are used by an international index calculator to calculate indices. The assumption is that the international index calculators rely on the data of leading global digital asset trading platforms to perform their calculations, as these meet stringent qualitative and quantitative criteria of the international index calculators.</p>
<p>TASE will continue to further the public&rsquo;s access to innovative investment instruments in a regulated, effective and transparent environment, on par with advanced global markets.</p>

<title>SEC Announces Departure Of Chief Economist Jessica Wachter</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-announces-departure-of-chief-economist-jessica-wachter/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-announces-departure-of-chief-economist-jessica-wachter/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Jessica A. Wachter, the Chief Economist and Director of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis (DERA), will depart the agency on January 17.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank Jessica for her leadership of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, her judgement, and her thoughtful economic analysis,&rdquo; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. &ldquo;As Chief Economist, she ably led a division that has a seat at the table for all of the SEC&rsquo;s critical decision making, whether it&rsquo;s policymaking, enforcement, or monitoring markets. I have enjoyed and learned so much from working with Jessica who has been one of my closest advisors. I wish her very well as she returns to academia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under Dr. Wachter&rsquo;s leadership, DERA provided sound economic analysis in support of rulemaking and enforcement matters. The 190-person division conducted more than 100 economic analyses for Commission rule proposals and adoptions, including those bringing the Treasury market into central clearing, shortening the settlement cycle, bringing greater resiliency to money market funds, and promoting greater transparency with regard to the risks of cyber attacks. In addition, DERA assisted enforcement in determining ill-gotten gains and returning funds to investors. Dr. Wachter consistently advocated for making data more accessible and easier to use, both within and without the Commission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been an honor and privilege to serve as the Chief Economist and Director of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis,&rdquo; Dr. Wachter said. &ldquo;I am grateful to Chair Gensler for giving me this tremendous opportunity. I am also grateful to the Chair and the Commission for their support through the last three and a half years and to the Division&rsquo;s talented staff, who have taught me so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Wachter joined the SEC from the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. She has served on the boards of the American Finance Association and the Western Finance Association. In addition to Wharton, Dr. Wachter has also taught at NYU&rsquo;s Stern School of Business. She holds an A.B. in Mathematics and Ph.D. in Business Economics from Harvard University.</p>
<p>Dr. Wachter will return to the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania where she will be the Dr. Bruce I. Jacobs Chair of Quantitative Finance.</p>

<p>Cboe Ti (pronounced "T-I", like the element symbol) powers Cboe's options, equities and futures markets in the U.S., UK, Europe, Japan and Australia, with Cboe Canada expected to migrate to Cboe Ti on March 3, 2025. Cboe also plans to transition its cash-settled&nbsp;<span>bitcoin</span>&nbsp;and ether futures contracts, currently available for trading on the Cboe Digital Exchange, to the Cboe Futures Exchange (CFE) running on Cboe Ti in the second quarter of 2025, pending regulatory review. This will conclude a multi-year effort to bring all Cboe's equities and derivatives markets across the globe onto a unified, globally consistent, yet locally optimized technology platform.</p>
<p>Using common protocols and features, Cboe's unified technology platform is designed to offer customers an efficient, consistent experience regardless of where they are in the world.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the flexibility of Cboe Ti allows Cboe to locally optimize and customize the platform for the unique needs of any market or asset class. This enables enhanced consistency and scalability, allowing Cboe to build a feature or product once and then deploy it globally, bringing innovative products, features and data to new markets and customers at greater speed. This effort aligns with Cboe's global strategy and commitment to expanding access to its markets, products, data and services to customers across the world.</p>
<p>Cboe expects to continue to invest in and scale its global technology infrastructure, operations and capabilities to meet market demand. Amid heightened volatility and record trading volumes in 2024, Cboe maintained 100% uptime across 25 of its 27 global platforms and achieved greater than 99.9% uptime across all 27 platforms. In U.S. options, where Cboe handled in 2024 approximately 100 billion quotes and orders a day across its four options exchanges, Cboe introduced a new access architecture to provide customers greater consistency for quoting and accessing liquidity. In equities, Cboe introduced Dedicated Cores, an optional service designed to help enhance consistency and improve overall performance for customers. Dedicated Cores reduced latency for customers who have purchased the service by 60% in the U.S. and has now been introduced in the UK and European Union, with plans to launch in Australia this month, pending regulatory approval.</p>
<p>Through powering trading operations, Cboe is committed to utilizing Cboe Ti to build a trusted global marketplace.

Also, the index incorporates Uranium Trust ETFs, such as the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust, providing direct exposure to uranium as a key resource. 50% of the total weight is allocated to upstream activities, 40% to downstream activities and 10% to Uranium Trust ETFs, with the weight of each constituent capped at 20% to ensure diversification and balanced exposure to both large-cap leaders and niche players in the nuclear energy sector.</p>

Some case examples of data analyses using such granular data are published as a series of reports titled &ldquo;FSA Analytical Notes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This issue contains &ldquo;Analysis of Japanese Stock Market Turbulence in Early August 2024.&rdquo; It is notable in that it uses granular order/transaction level data to understand market conditions, while also taking into account information gathered from market participants and considerations based on macroeconomic and financial statistics.</p>

<p>This paper presents a detailed analysis of the sharp swings that occurred in the Japanese stock market on August 5, 2024. With the use of granular order/transaction level data of the Nikkei 225 Futures, the FSA has developed several indicators to evaluate market supply, demand and liquidity conditions, including dominance by buyers/sellers, concentration by specific entities in transactions, price impact per contract amount and liquidity around the best quote.</p>
<p>Closely following the year-to-date (until early August) and August 5 intraday movements of these indicators, the followings were suggested. On a daily basis from mid-July to early August, excessive imbalances were not observed but the market liquidity was markedly declining, making prices more susceptible to fluctuations. Furthermore, on an intraday basis focusing on August 5, market liquidity subsided rapidly toward the afternoon session. At these hours, take orders were found to be concentrated on the seller side. Combined, they may have caused rapid market turbulence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The use of granular data has provided a new insight into the background and mechanism of the market turbulence on August 5, 2024, compared to previous literature that has been based mainly on the views of market participants or macro-level aggregated statistics. This is a novelty of this paper. On the other hand, there is one important caveat. The analysis is obliged to focus on the Japanese stock market. While other domestic and overseas markets, including bond, foreign exchange and derivatives, should be ideally analyzed all together given their close interconnectedness, it was not possible due predominantly to the lack of data availability.</p>
<p>Evaluating the impact of market fluctuations on financial stability is an important issue on the regulatory agenda. The FSA will continue to analyze the mechanism of sharp market turbulence and its impact on financial stability by enhancing analytical capabilities and expanding the scope of its analyses.</p>
</div>
<p>Enhancing the use of data in financial supervision and policy-making is a medium- to long-term agenda. The FSA will continue to build its data analysis capabilities and data infrastructure.</p>

<title>Japan Securities Clearing Corporation: Global Standardization Of Regulatory Reporting Leveraging DRR &amp; CDM</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/japan-securities-clearing-corporation-global-standardization-of-regulatory-repo/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/japan-securities-clearing-corporation-global-standardization-of-regulatory-repo/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Leveraging the new standardized framework for regulatory reporting based upon ISDA&rsquo;s (*1) globally promoted "Digital Regulatory Reporting (DRR)" solution and the FINOS (*2) open source managed "Common Domain Model (CDM)", JSCC plans to begin production-parallel operations of its regulatory reporting to the Financial Services Agency (FSA, the Japanese financial regulatory authority) and the CFTC (U.S. financial regulatory authority) from June 2025. JSCC is the first CCP (Central Counterparty) and Japanese entity to announce the adoption of DRR and CDM within a production environment.</span><br /><br /><span>JSCC joined The Linux Foundation in October 2023 and FINOS in June 2024 prior to its proof of concept utilizing DRR/CDM in August 2024, and has since conducted extensive discussions and experiments with major financial market organizations on the possibilities and future potential of open source software (OSS) and ecosystem-friendly solutions that can be shared globally and across industries. At the FINOS premier "Open Source in Finance Forum" held in New York in September 2024, JSCC's visionary efforts to date were recognized with JSCC being awarded the "Trailblazer Award."</span><br /><br /><span>JSCC President and CEO Konuma Yasuyuki said "Firstly, I would like to express my respect and gratitude to ISDA, FINOS, supporting developers, and all others involved with this cutting-edge global standard solution of DRR/CDM. I am also very pleased to now announce our plans to integrate DRR/CDM within our clearing organization processes. I want JSCC to continue its mid-long term perspective by proactively exploring further initiatives with global standardization and open sourced ecosystems that contribute to the advancement and stabilization of global financial markets."</span><br /><br /><span>&ldquo;We are delighted that JSCC is adopting ISDA&rsquo;s DRR as part of its regulatory reporting processes. By taking an industry-agreed interpretation of the reporting rules and converting it into code using the CDM, the ISDA DRR brings greater efficiency, automation, accuracy and consistency to the reporting of derivatives trades. ISDA has pledged to support 11 reporting rule sets in nine major jurisdictions through the DRR, so we look forward to working with JSCC as it rolls out its adoption,&rdquo; said Scott O&rsquo;Malia, Chief Executive of ISDA.</span><br /><br /><span>&ldquo;We are proud to have such an integral participant in the global market infrastructure like JSCC in the FINOS Community and to witness their swift adoption of the CDM,&rdquo; said Gabriele Columbro, Executive Director of FINOS and GM of Linux Foundation Europe. &ldquo;Since becoming an open standard in 2023 within our Open RegTech initiative, the CDM has seen substantial adoption by major financial institutions for regulatory applications. As this momentum continues, we anticipate more firms investing in open tooling to accelerate CDM adoption across a broader range of business use cases.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>With the production parallel from June 2025, JSCC will begin comparative verification against its production data from the current system for IRS (interest rate swaps) transaction reporting to FSA and CFTC. JSCC will furthermore add CDS (credit default swaps) to its DRR/CDM based regulatory reporting and incrementally expand the DRR functionality (together with ISDA's plans to increase the number of target regulatory authorities).</span><br /><span>Additionally, because CDM's future-oriented design framework may contribute to the innovative evolution of future financial systems, JSCC will continue on a mid-long term perspective to explore through experiments CDM's applicable scope.</span></p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The FSA has decided to establish a &ldquo;Working Group on Improving Internal Audits of Financial Institutions&rdquo; to discuss issues involved in internal audits with related organizations and external experts.<br />In September 2024, the FSA published &ldquo;<a href="https://www.fsa.go.jp/en/news/2024/20241218/ia/20241218.html">Monitoring Report for Improving Internal Audits of Financial Institutions (2024)</a>&rdquo; which summarizes the monitoring results of not only large banking groups but also regional financial institutions, large securities companies, and large insurance companies, with the FSA&rsquo;s recognition of issues and expectations.<br /> The report mentions that the FSA will continue to promote the improvement of internal audits by proceeding with in-depth monitoring of financial institutions and that the FSA will consider the necessity of updating the &ldquo;<span class="icon-pdf"><img alt="PDF" src="https://www.fsa.go.jp/images/common/icon_pdf.gif" /></span><a href="https://www.fsa.go.jp/en/news/2024/20240220/01.pdf">Current Situation and Issues for Improving Internal Audits of Financial Institutions</a>&rdquo;&nbsp; (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;Current Situation and Issues&rdquo;) based on the results of the monitoring and international trends regarding internal audit, including reconsideration of classification of internal audits levels (phases).<br /> The FSA believes that &ldquo;Current Situation and Issues&rdquo; should be updated to be able to present viewpoints that encourage improvements in the internal audits of entire financial institutions and that secure trust in them from domestic and foreign stakeholders. In addition, &ldquo;Current Situation and Issues&rdquo; should be able to be utilized also by non-financial institutions and overseas financial regulators.<br />Based on discussions in the working group, the FSA will consider updating &ldquo;Current Situation and Issues.&rdquo;</p>

<title>The SEC’s Unusual Capacity To Serve The Public, SEC Chair Gary Gensler, Washington D.C., Jan. 14, 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-secs-unusual-capacity-to-serve-the-public-sec-chair-gary-gensler-washingt/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-secs-unusual-capacity-to-serve-the-public-sec-chair-gary-gensler-washingt/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good afternoon, welcome to this town hall, my final as Securities and Exchange Commission Chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;[Y]ou need administrators who are equipped to meet the best legal brains whom Wall Street always has at its disposal, who have stamina and do not weary of the fight, who are moved neither by blandishments nor fears, who in a word, unite public zeal with unusual capacity.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sec-011425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>So wrote Felix Frankfurter, a friend and advisor to President Franklin Roosevelt, and later Supreme Court Justice, in May of 1934 about the setting up of this great agency, the SEC.</p>
<p>For most people, when they reflect back on their lives and a life well lived, they generally focus on what counts, their loved ones&mdash;families and friends&mdash;and their broader communities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I think about public service. It&rsquo;s about giving back to our community, whether it be our neighborhood, county, or state&mdash;or, as we are so privileged to do as part of this agency, to this great nation of 335 million Americans.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the nearly 5,000 staff do at this remarkable agency. Your dedication to public service matters to everyday Americans, our economy, and U.S. standing in the world today. Further, your dedication to public service matters to everyday Americans, our economy, and U.S. standing in the world in the future.</p>
<p>We owe a debt of gratitude to those who set up our nation&rsquo;s great institutions, including the SEC, which serve the public and promote an inclusive society.</p>
<p>We owe a debt of gratitude to Roosevelt, Frankfurter, Chair Sam Rayburn,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sec-011425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Chair Duncan Fletcher,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sec-011425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;and the SEC&rsquo;s first Chair Joe Kennedy. They all had significant roles in enacting the securities laws or setting up this agency.</p>
<p>They all had lived through the 1920s when hucksters, fraudsters, scam artists, and Ponzi-like schemers took advantage of investors. They learned what happens when unregulated markets were left on their own.</p>
<p>Roosevelt and Congress understood that capital markets work best when they have both competition and common-sense rules of the road that lower risk and build trust.</p>
<p>I, too, deeply believe in capital markets, competition, and common-sense rules of the road that benefit investors and issuers alike.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you and this agency play such a critical role in overseeing the markets and ensuring for compliance with U.S. securities laws&rsquo; common-sense rules of the road.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so impressed by your dedication to public service, helping build better lives for the communities of today and tomorrow. No doubt many of you have made significant tradeoffs, financial and otherwise, to serve at the SEC. Most could get paid more working outside of government.</p>
<p>You work to ensure that our capital markets are competitive and inclusive, that they work for investors and issuers alike and not the other way around.</p>
<p>Our great institution has helped support this country&rsquo;s economic success these last 90 years. You have helped make our capital markets the deepest, most liquid, and best in the world. Your work maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets has helped raise the stature of the dollar and U.S. geopolitical standing.</p>
<p>As we all know, Joe Kennedy wasn&rsquo;t the only one in his family who was drawn to the great privilege of public service. His son, President John F. Kennedy, said, &ldquo;Let the public service be a proud and lively career.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sec-011425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;So inspired by these words, I also referenced them at the town hall held 11 years ago when leaving the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.</p>
<p>Serving the public in everchanging markets, technology and, yes, leadership of this agency, you all certainly have signed up for a proud and lively career.</p>
<p>My mom and dad never went to college. Three of my grandparents never got past 8<span>th</span>&nbsp;grade. They wanted what every Americans wants: a better future for their family.</p>
<p>William O. Douglas, the third SEC Chair and friend of Frankfurter, Roosevelt, and both Kennedys, said when speaking of the SEC, that we&rsquo;re &ldquo;the investors&rsquo; advocate.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sec-011425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s so appropriate that protecting investors is the first part of our three-part mission. The other two parts of our mission&mdash;maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets and facilitating capital formation&mdash;are deeply reliant on protecting investors. Investors won&rsquo;t come to a market they don&rsquo;t trust.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to pick a favorite among the various roles in which I&rsquo;ve had the privilege to serve over the years. I will say, though, that a distinguishing feature of this agency and you the staff is just how clearly you know, understand, and are truly dedicated to the agency&rsquo;s mission.</p>
<p>I thank you for taking me into your family these last four years and sharing this journey.</p>
<p>I thank my fellow Commissioners with whom I&rsquo;ve served: Allison Lee, Elad Roisman, Hester Peirce, Caroline Crenshaw, Mark Uyeda, and Jaime Liz&aacute;rraga.</p>
<p>I thank President Biden for nominating me and the U.S. Senate for confirming me to be Chair of the SEC. I thank my fellow regulators, here in the United States and abroad.</p>
<p>I want to give a special shoutout and thanks for all of those who have served these last four years in the Chair&rsquo;s office, as division directors, and as office heads. Though there&rsquo;s not enough time to name everyone, a special thank you to our two chiefs of staff over the years, Prashant Yerramalli and Amanda Fischer, for their wise counsel and help guiding the agency.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve gotten a lot done together for the American public. It&rsquo;s not measured in the thousands of cases (though there have been 2,700). It&rsquo;s not measured in the monetary returns to the public (though there have been $2.7 billion). It&rsquo;s not measured in rules we&rsquo;ve finalized (though we completed 46). It&rsquo;s not measured in the votes this Commission has taken together (though there have been more than 4,000). To me, it&rsquo;s best measured by what we gave back to our community, helping Americans in their everyday lives now and into the future.</p>
<p>You helped lower costs, lower risks, and enhance integrity in our two largest markets, the nearly $60 trillion stock market<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sec-011425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;and the $28 trillion Treasury market.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sec-011425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;You shortened the settlement cycle in half so people who sell their stock on a Monday now get their cash on a Tuesday.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sec-011425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p>You helped enhance the transparency and integrity of public company corporate governance, including by imposing new cooling-off periods and other conditions before corporate insiders who may have material nonpublic information can trade in their company&rsquo;s securities.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sec-011425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p>You met the demands of investors for greater disclosure around issuers&rsquo; material cyber<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sec-011425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;and climate<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sec-011425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;risks and promoted greater integrity in the market for special purpose acquisition companies.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sec-011425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>
<p>You helped put in place rules requiring covered broker-dealers and investment advisers to notify customers of data breaches that might put personal information at risk.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sec-011425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p>With an eye on financial stability, you updated rules for the $7 trillion money market funds sector<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sec-011425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;and the information we collect from the $30 trillion private funds sector.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sec-011425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></p>
<p>You helped reinvigorate the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and, for the first time, ensure that Chinese authorities would allow the PCAOB to inspect and investigate audit firms in China.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sec-011425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>You vigorously followed the facts and the law without fear or favor to ensure that market participants comply with the securities laws, whether it be regarding traditional financial products or more recent ones like crypto.</p>
<p>You set the stage for important debates to come with regard to the growing use of artificial intelligence in the world of finance.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve done all this great work while also maintaining the SEC as one of the best places to work in government.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sec-011425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></p>
<p>In that same 1934 letter, Frankfurter wrote these additional words to Roosevelt: &ldquo;Now the administration of the Stock Exchange Act will, I am sure, be even more difficult and call for greater skill, resourcefulness, firmness as well as fairness of temper, a wil1 not worn down by fatigue, than has been the work of the older regulatory commissions. The problems are more subtle, the abuses less obvious, the public more misleadable and the consequences of non-action more far reaching.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sec-011425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></p>
<p>I want to thank you for your stamina. For not wearying of the fight. For not being moved my blandishment nor fears. For your unusual capacity to serve the public.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Elon Musk For Violating The Beneficial Ownership Reporting Requirements Of The Federal Securities Laws</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-charges-elon-musk-for-violating-the-beneficial-ownership-reporting-requireme/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-charges-elon-musk-for-violating-the-beneficial-ownership-reporting-requireme/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it has filed an action against Elon Musk alleging that he failed to timely file a beneficial ownership report with the Commission after acquiring beneficial ownership of more than five percent of the outstanding shares of Twitter, Inc. common stock, in violation of the beneficial ownership reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;). According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Musk saved at least $150 million at the expense of Twitter shareholders by failing to timely file the beneficial ownership report.</p>
<p>Congress enacted the beneficial ownership reporting requirements to, among other things, help investors make informed investment decisions by providing information about accumulations of certain classes of equity securities by persons who have the potential to change or influence control of the issuer companies.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, after Musk failed to timely file a beneficial ownership report by March 24, 2022, he purchased more than $500 million worth of Twitter common stock between March 25, 2022 and April 1, 2022. As alleged, because Musk failed to timely file a beneficial ownership report with the SEC, he was able to make these purchases of Twitter common stock at artificially low prices from the unsuspecting public, who had not yet priced in the undisclosed material information of Musk&rsquo;s beneficial ownership of more than five percent of Twitter common stock and investment purpose. According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Musk underpaid by at least $150 million for his purchases of Twitter common stock in this period. The complaint further alleges that, due to Musk&rsquo;s failure to timely file a beneficial ownership report with the SEC, investors that sold Twitter common stock between March 25, 2022 and April 1, 2022 did so at artificially low prices, thereby suffering substantial economic harm.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, charges Musk with violating Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13d-1 thereunder. Section 13(d) imposes a strict liability standard. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.</p>

<title>US Office Of The Comptroller Of The Currency Imposes Civil Money Penalties Against Three Former Executives Of Wells Fargo</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-office-of-the-comptroller-of-the-currency-imposes-civil-money-penalties-again/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today announced enforcement actions against three former senior executives of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Sioux Falls, South Dakota (bank). These actions were taken in response to the former executives&rsquo; unsafe or unsound banking practices related to the bank&rsquo;s systemic and widespread sales practices misconduct.</p>
<p>The enforcement actions are described in two written decisions issued by Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael J. Hsu, covering Claudia Russ Anderson and jointly covering David Julian and Paul McLinko, as follows:</p>
<table class="row-border stripe dataTable no-footer dtr-inline" id="example_limited_1">
<thead> 
<tr>
<th>Name</th><th>Former Position</th><th>Relief Ordered</th>
</tr>
</thead> 
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Claudia Russ Anderson</td>
<td>Community Bank Group Risk Officer</td>
<td>Prohibition Order and $10,000,000 Civil Money Penalty (CMP)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>David Julian</td>
<td>Chief Auditor</td>
<td>Personal Cease &amp; Desist Order and $7,000,000 CMP</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Paul McLinko</td>
<td>Executive Audit Director</td>
<td>Personal Cease &amp; Desist Order and $1,500,000 CMP</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The decision covering Ms. Anderson found that from 2013 to 2016, she failed to credibly challenge the bank&rsquo;s incentive compensation program, failed to institute effective controls to manage risks posed by sales practices misconduct, failed to escalate known or obvious risks, and repeatedly and consistently downplayed the sales practices misconduct. The decision also noted that Ms. Anderson committed violations of law by failing to provide information or providing false, incomplete, or misleading information to the OCC during its 2015 examinations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A separate decision concluded that during the same period, Mr. Julian and Mr. McLinko failed to plan and manage audit activity that would detect and document sales practices misconduct and failed to adequately escalate the sales practices misconduct. Mr. McLinko also failed to maintain professional independence from the Community Bank, the Bank&rsquo;s largest business line that housed the retail branches.</p>
<p>The decisions issued today explained that under pressure to meet unreasonable sales goals, thousands of employees at the bank engaged in widespread sales practices misconduct.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s written decisions and orders stem from the Notice of Charges the OCC filed in January 2020, which began the administrative litigation. An Administrative Law Judge issued three recommended decisions in December 2022 following a 38-day administrative hearing. These are the remaining outstanding enforcement actions among those that the OCC pursued against 11 individuals related to the bank&rsquo;s systemic and widespread sales practices misconduct. The OCC previously reached resolution with eight other former Wells Fargo senior bank executives, resulting in their payment of civil money penalties totaling $43,175,000.</p>

<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Chief Accountant Paul Munter plans to retire from federal service effective Jan. 24, 2025. Mr. Munter joined the agency in 2019, was named Acting Chief Accountant in 2021, and was appointed Chief Accountant in January 2023.</p>

<title>US Federal And State Financial Regulatory Agencies Issue Interagency Statement On Supervisory Practices Regarding Financial Institutions Affected By The California Wildfires And Straight-Line Winds</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-federal-and-state-financial-regulatory-agencies-issue-interagency-statement-o-12/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-federal-and-state-financial-regulatory-agencies-issue-interagency-statement-o-12/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board, the National Credit Union Administration, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, collectively the agencies, recognize the serious impact of the California wildfires and straight-line winds on the customers and operations of many financial institutions and will provide appropriate regulatory assistance to affected institutions subject to their supervision. The agencies encourage institutions operating in the affected areas to meet the financial services needs of their communities.</p>
<p>A complete list of the current disaster areas can be found at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fema.gov/disaster/declarations" target="_blank">https://www.fema.gov/disaster/declarations</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Lending:</strong>&nbsp;The agencies encourage financial institutions to work constructively with borrowers in communities affected by the California wildfires and straight-line winds. Prudent efforts to adjust or alter terms on existing loans in affected areas are supported by the agencies and should not be subject to examiner criticism. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, institutions should individually evaluate modifications of existing loans to determine whether modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty should be accounted for as a new loan or a continuance of an existing loan. In making this evaluation, institutions should consider the facts and circumstances of each borrower and appropriately report the modification in the institution's call report. In supervising institutions affected by the California wildfires and straight-line winds, the agencies will consider the unusual circumstances these institutions face. The agencies recognize that efforts to work with borrowers in communities under stress can be consistent with safe-and-sound practices as well as in the public interest.</p>
<p><strong>Temporary Facilities:</strong>&nbsp;The agencies understand that many financial institutions face staffing, power, telecommunications, and other challenges in re-opening facilities after the California wildfires and straight-line winds. In cases in which operational challenges persist, the primary federal or state regulator will expedite, as appropriate, any request to operate temporary facilities to provide more convenient availability of services to those affected by the California wildfires and straight-line winds. In most cases, a telephone notice to the primary federal or state regulator will suffice initially to start the approval process, with necessary written notification being submitted shortly thereafter.</p>
<p><strong>Publishing Requirements:</strong>&nbsp;The agencies understand that the damage caused by the California wildfires and straight-line winds may affect compliance with publishing and other requirements for branch closings, relocations, and temporary facilities under various laws and regulations. Institutions experiencing disaster-related difficulties in complying with any publishing or other requirements should contact their primary federal or state regulator.</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory Reporting Requirements:</strong>&nbsp;Institutions affected by the California wildfires and straight-line winds that expect to encounter difficulty meeting the agencies' reporting requirements should contact their primary federal or state regulator to discuss their situation. The agencies do not expect to assess penalties or take other supervisory action against institutions that take reasonable and prudent steps to comply with the agencies' regulatory reporting requirements if those institutions are unable to fully satisfy those requirements because of the California wildfires and straight-line winds.</p>
<p>The agencies' staffs stand ready to work with affected institutions that may be experiencing problems fulfilling their reporting responsibilities, taking into account each institution's particular circumstances, including the status of its reporting and recordkeeping systems and the condition of its underlying financial records.</p>
<p><strong>Community Reinvestment Act (CRA):</strong>&nbsp;Financial institutions may receive CRA consideration for community development loans, investments, or services that revitalize or stabilize federally designated disaster areas in their assessment areas or in the states or regions that include their assessment areas. For additional information, refer to the Interagency Questions and Answers Regarding Community Reinvestment at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ffiec.gov/cra/qnadoc.htm" target="_blank">https://www.ffiec.gov/cra/qnadoc.htm</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Investments:</strong>&nbsp;Institutions are encouraged to monitor municipal securities and loans affected by the California wildfires and straight-line winds. The agencies realize local government projects may be negatively affected by the disaster and encourage institutions to engage in appropriate monitoring and take prudent efforts to stabilize such investments.</p>
<p>For more information, refer to the&nbsp;<em>Interagency Supervisory Examiner Guidance for Institutions Affected by a Major Disaster</em>, which is available as follows:</p>
