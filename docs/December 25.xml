<title>Standard Chartered Goes Live On CLSNet</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/standard-chartered-goes-live-on-clsnet-2025122/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>CLS, a financial market infrastructure group delivering settlement, processing and data solutions across the global FX ecosystem, announced today that Standard Chartered, a leading international cross-border bank, has gone live on CLSNet, its automated bilateral payment netting calculation service for over 120 currencies.</p>
<p>CLSNet standardizes and automates post-trade matching and netting processes, delivering risk mitigation, liquidity optimization and operational efficiencies for currency flows outside of CLSSettlement, including emerging market and developing economy (EMDE) currencies and same-day trades.</p>
<p>Adoption of CLSNet has continued to grow significantly, with the service recording an average daily netted value<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;of USD169 billion in the first half of 2025, up 18% compared to the same period in 2024. The CLSNet community now includes the top 12 global banks, alongside a growing roster of regional banks, funds, corporates and non-bank financial institutions.</p>
<p>As settlement risk in the FX market remains a focus, particularly in EMDE currencies and other growing segments, market participants are looking for ways to mitigate risk effectively via automated post-trade services such as CLSNet. The service reduces payments exposed to settlement risk by centralizing, standardizing and automating the netting calculation process. Demand for CLSNet continues to grow, particularly among financial institutions seeking to align with the best practices outlined in Principle 35 of the FX Global Code.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Alongside Standard Chartered, several Asian banks are joining the service. CTBC, the Hong Kong branch of a Taiwanese commercial bank, has gone live on CLSNet, meanwhile Maybank, a Malaysian bank, and Taishin, one of the largest commercial banks in Taiwan, have also committed to joining the CLSNet network to mitigate settlement risk within Asian currencies, particularly USD/CNH.</p>
<p><b>Lisa Dani</b><b>no-Lewis, Chief Growth Officer, CLS commented:</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;We are delighted to welcome Standard Chartered, CTBC, Maybank and Taishin to the CLSNet community. We are seeing increased demand for proven solutions to address the challenges facing the FX market. As more participants join CLSNet, the resulting network effect will deliver even greater risk reduction and efficiency benefits for all users.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Tony Hall, Global Head, Markets Trading and XVA, Standard Chartered commented:</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;Standard Chartered is proud to join CLSNet, reaffirming our commitment to strong risk management, liquidity efficiency and operational excellence in FX. This step aligns with our role as a signatory to the Global FX Code and our ambition to be the leading Emerging Markets FX house. By leveraging CLSNet capabilities, we&rsquo;ll deliver safer, faster and more efficient post-trade processing&mdash;freeing up intraday liquidity and reducing settlement risk for our clients. Another stride towards world-class infrastructure, smarter execution, and market leadership.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;<span>Netted value refers to bilateral net payment amounts calculated by CLSNet.</span></li>
<li>Principle 35 states,&nbsp;<i style="font-family: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">inter alia</i><span>:</span>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;<span>Where practicable, Market Participants should eliminate Settlement Risk, for example by using settlement services that provide PvP settlement.</span></li>
<li>Where Settlement Risk cannot be eliminated, Market Participants should reduce the size and duration of their Settlement Risk as much as practicable. The netting of FX settlement obligations (in&nbsp;particular the use of automated netting systems) is encouraged.</li>

<title>Minimising The Risk Of Investor Harm Is A Shared Responsibility - Keynote Address By ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland At The Professional Planner Researcher Forum In The Blue Mountains On 2 December 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul>
<li>Australian investors rely on the expertise and integrity of everyone in the investment chain to secure their financial future.</li>
<li>ASIC&rsquo;s primary concern is minimising the risk of harm for Australian investors and consumers.</li>
<li>To ensure better outcomes for investors, ASIC has prioritised tackling poor practices in private credit and holding those responsible for Shield and First Guardian to account.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good afternoon.</p>
<p>I'd like to acknowledge the Traditional Owners of the land on which we meet today, the Dharug and Gundungurra people and pay my respects to Elders past and present.</p>
<p>I extend that respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people here today.</p>
<p>Thank you to Conexus for the invitation to speak today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great to be back at the Researcher Forum and to have the opportunity to update you on ASIC&rsquo;s priorities.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I spoke to a room of financial literacy educators about the importance of equipping Australians with the knowledge they need to confidently navigate the financial system.</p>
<p>I made the point that when it comes to financial decisions, people can sometimes be vulnerable to exploitation, because for many of the decisions they make, they have less financial knowledge or experience than the person or firm on the other side of the transaction.</p>
<p>And when it comes to investment decisions, that knowledge imbalance is even greater, with bigger consequences if something goes wrong.</p>
<p>Even the most sophisticated investors are reliant on the expertise &ndash; and the integrity - of others when making major investment decisions.</p>
<p>Financial advisers, fund managers, research houses &ndash; all of you here today &ndash; all play a role, either directly or indirectly, in influencing how investors choose to invest their money.</p>
<p>And so, it&rsquo;s important, as the theme of today&rsquo;s forum suggests, that we have &lsquo;<strong>world-class</strong>&nbsp;investment governance and research&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what Australian investors want and deserve, and it&rsquo;s what ASIC expects.</p>
<p>In pursuing this expectation, our primary concern is to minimise the risk of harm to consumers and investors.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see this reflected across our regulatory and enforcement priorities.</p>
<p>There are two enforcement priorities I want to talk about today, both of which relate directly to the work many of you do.</p>
<p>The first is holding those responsible for the Shield and First Guardian collapses to account.</p>
<p>And the second &ndash; to crack down on poor practice in private credit.</p>
<h2>Pursuing accountability for Shield and First Guardian</h2>
<p>Let me start with Shield and First Guardian &ndash; partly because those matters combined represent one of our biggest priorities at the moment &ndash; and partly because they have implications for everybody working in the advice and investment ecosystem.</p>
<p>If you wonder why this is relevant to you, the numbers should make it clear.</p>
<p>With more than 11,000 investors impacted and close to $1 billion of retirement savings put at risk, this is the most egregious example of consumer harm that I have seen in my time at ASIC.</p>
<p>And the people affected are Australians who were trying to do the right thing to boost their retirement savings and were instead lured into switching their super into high-risk investments.</p>
<p>These weren&rsquo;t people rolling the dice in some get-rich-quick gamble. These were people making considered decisions which they believed to be in their financial interests.</p>
<p>People like Gary, in his early 60s and looking forward to retirement<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/minimising-the-risk-of-investor-harm-is-a-shared-responsibility/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Gary was aware that his existing super fund wasn&rsquo;t performing as well as it had been.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He was contacted by a comparison site, which put him on to financial advisers who set him up with a self-managed super fund and invested all his funds into First Guardian.</p>
<p>He stands to lose almost $700,000.</p>
<p>Or Juan<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/minimising-the-risk-of-investor-harm-is-a-shared-responsibility/#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>, a 41-year old at risk of losing his entire super, after being convinced to roll all his savings into First Guardian.</p>
<p>These are shocking stories, and there are&nbsp;<strong>thousands</strong>&nbsp;like them.</p>
<p>Each of them involving financial losses with a very human cost.</p>
<p>And there is a long chain of participants involved.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lead generators, including data brokers and telemarketers</li>
<li>Financial advisers, and financial advice firms</li>
<li>Superannuation trustees, like Macquarie, Equity Trustees, Diversa and Netwealth</li>
<li>Research houses</li>
<li>Auditors</li>
<li>And of course, the fund operators themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p>We believe all hold some degree of culpability.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s first priority in both the Shield and First Guardian matters has been to preserve assets so that they can be recovered for investors while our investigations are continuing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve:</p>
<ul>
<li>issued stop orders to prevent ongoing harm</li>
<li>obtained asset-freezing orders</li>
<li>sought the appointment of receivers and liquidators</li>
<li>obtained travel restraints</li>
<li>cancelled financial services licenses; and</li>
<li>banned financial advisers.</li>
</ul>
<p>We&rsquo;ve instituted proceedings against&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-215mr-macquarie-admits-to-shield-contraventions-and-commits-to-pay-affected-members/" title="25-215MR Macquarie admits to Shield contraventions and commits to pay affected members">Macquarie</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-176mr-asic-sues-equity-trustees-alleging-due-diligence-failures-relating-to-shield/" title="25-176MR ASIC sues Equity Trustees alleging due diligence failures relating to Shield">Equity Trustees</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-274mr-asic-sues-interprac-over-alleged-shield-and-first-guardian-licensee-failures/" title="25-274MR ASIC sues Interprac over alleged Shield and First Guardian licensee failures">Interprac&nbsp;</a><a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-274mr-asic-sues-interprac-over-alleged-shield-and-first-guardian-licensee-failures/">Financial Planning</a><a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-274mr-asic-sues-interprac-over-alleged-shield-and-first-guardian-licensee-failures/" title="25-274MR ASIC sues Interprac over alleged Shield and First Guardian licensee failures"></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-275mr-asic-sues-sqm-research-alleging-misleading-reports-related-to-shield/" title="25-275MR ASIC sues SQM Research alleging misleading reports related to Shield">SQM Research</a>.</p>
<p>In a significant win for some investors,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-215mr-macquarie-admits-to-shield-contraventions-and-commits-to-pay-affected-members/" title="25-215MR Macquarie admits to Shield contraventions and commits to pay affected members">Macquarie has committed to repaying investors</a>&nbsp;100% of the net cash they invested in Shield through Macquarie&rsquo;s wrap platform.</p>
<p>Importantly for those in the room today, our action against SQM Research is the first we have taken against a research house.</p>
<p>It is our view that SQM Research prepared reports containing misleading representations and its processes fell short of expected standards when it published &ldquo;Favourable&rdquo; ratings for Shield.</p>
<p>More generally, it is our view that research houses should serve as gatekeepers against poor quality investments or unsuitable products.</p>
<p>They need to do all things necessary to ensure that they go about their work efficiently, honestly and fairly. And they need to avoid issuing ratings or commentary that can&rsquo;t be justified by evidence.</p>
<p>In addition to the proceedings I have already mentioned, we are also seeking leave to commence proceedings against&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-276mr-asic-takes-action-against-mwl-financial-services-former-director-nicholas-maikousis-and-imperial-capital-group-australia-over-alleged-shield-advice-failures/" title="25-276MR ASIC takes action against MWL Financial Services, former director Nicholas Maikousis, and Imperial Capital Group Australia over alleged Shield advice failures">MWL Financial Services</a>, a former MWL director and Imperial Capital Group &ndash; a lead generator &ndash; for allegedly operating a scheme resulting in hundreds of clients investing superannuation into Shield.</p>
<p>At this point in time, we have 10 separate Federal Court proceedings against 18 defendants, and there is more to come.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, holding those responsible for the collapse of the Shield and First Guardian Master Funds to account is one of our enforcement priorities - and our investigations are ongoing.</p>
<p>While this has some time to play out, there are lessons to be learned now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I mentioned at the outset, Australian investors are reliant on the chain of financial experts behind their investments - financial advisers, research houses, investment platforms, superannuation trustees, advice licensees.</p>
<p>When every part of that chain fulfils its role &ndash; with its multiple layers of knowledge, expertise, duties and obligations &ndash; the system works as it should.</p>
<p>Investors can be confident that they will be offered products that are safe, and appropriate for them and their financial goals.</p>
<p>But when there are failures in that chain &ndash; far too often it is investors who pay the price.</p>
<p>The failures involved in Shield and First Guardian have highlighted some potential regulatory gaps.</p>
<p>These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the regulation of lead generators, whose activities may not be adequately captured by the anti-hawking provisions</li>
<li>the super switching process</li>
<li>the obligations of super trustees who provide platform products; and</li>
<li>the regulation of managed investment schemes, which ASIC has previously identified as a priority for reform.</li>
</ul>
<p>We welcome the Government&rsquo;s commitment to exploring sensible reforms that can better protect consumers in the future, and we are committed to working with the Government to identify what would be most effective, based on what we have uncovered through our investigations.</p>
<h2>Improving practices in private credit</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;d now like to turn to private credit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>ASIC recognises that private credit &ndash; done well &ndash; plays an important role in Australia&rsquo;s financial system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an important source of funding for sectors that are under-served by the traditional banking sector, and it provides diversification and choice for borrowers and investors alike.</p>
<p>According to one estimate, private credit in Australia is now valued at more than $200 billion<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/minimising-the-risk-of-investor-harm-is-a-shared-responsibility/#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>While this amount is not systemically important, the same source estimates that private credit has grown&nbsp;<strong>500 per cent</strong><a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/minimising-the-risk-of-investor-harm-is-a-shared-responsibility/#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><span>[4]</span></a>&nbsp;over the past 10 years. And with increasing investment in private credit via superannuation, that growth seems likely to continue.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important that we are alert to the potential risks.</p>
<p>Here in Australia, we have a higher concentration of private credit lending to the property sector, including loans to higher risk development and construction.</p>
<p>Over time, this could amplify the system-wide vulnerability related to residential property identified by APRA in last month&rsquo;s system-wide stress test.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private credit at current volumes is untested in a stress scenario and we are already seeing a wide variance in practices across the sector.</p>
<p>A lack of transparency across the sector is a particular concern.</p>
<p>Australia lags behind our international peers in terms of the data that we as a regulator have access to.</p>
<p>We have neither the breadth, depth, or frequency of data needed to monitor and supervise retail and wholesale funds confidently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Countries like Singapore, Canada, and the UK with similar regulatory frameworks have greater access to more reliable and recurrent data on private markets.</p>
<p>Given that our domestic private credit growth outstrips that seen in many of these countries, we would like to see this data gap addressed to enable ASIC to more confidently supervise funds.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, we undertook a surveillance of 28 retail and wholesale private credit funds to assess how fund managers are managing the risks that underpin investor confidence and market operation.</p>
<p>We released the findings of that surveillance a few weeks ago in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-820-private-credit-surveillance-report-retail-and-wholesale-surveillance/" title="REP 820 Private credit surveillance report: Retail and wholesale surveillance">Report 820</a>.</p>
<p>We observed some better practices, but we also identified areas that fell short of expectations, including practices that are potentially in breach of the law.</p>
<p>Areas for improvement include governance and transparency; fees and interest rates; valuation methodologies; liquidity; and credit management.</p>
<p>Today, I&rsquo;ll focus on three areas that will be relevant to many in the room because they are key to how researchers understand and evaluate private credit funds:</p>
<ul>
<li>The use of terminology</li>
<li>Fee and interest disclosure; and</li>
<li>Valuations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Terminology</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start with the use of terminology.</p>
<p>In our review, we found market-wide inconsistencies in terminology that make it difficult for investors to compare the nature and risks of private credit funds.</p>
<p>Fund operators and investment managers defined and applied terms such as &lsquo;default&rsquo; and &lsquo;investment grade&rsquo; differently.</p>
<p>Such inconsistent use of terms makes it difficult for investors to meaningfully compare loan default or arrears levels across funds.</p>
<p>There were also variabilities in how funds described their underlying assets.</p>
<p>Some funds primarily categorised their assets using terms that describe the&nbsp;<strong>ranking&nbsp;</strong>or&nbsp;<strong>seniority</strong>&nbsp;of the security &ndash; for example &lsquo;first mortgage&rsquo; and &lsquo;mezzanine&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Other funds categorised their&nbsp;<strong>assets</strong>&nbsp;with reference to direct lending, securitised loans or the use of funding &ndash; for example &lsquo;commercial real estate development&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Concerningly, we found that asset descriptions sometimes failed to include clear information that would help investors understand the risks of the assets held by a fund.</p>
<p>For example, a failure to disclose that loans will fund higher-risk real estate construction and development. Or that the fund primarily invests in unsecured loans.</p>
<p>Again, this inconsistency makes it difficult for investors and advisers to accurately compare funds and make informed choices about what products they are investing in and the risks associated with them.</p>
<p>The adoption of consistent industry terminology &ndash; or at least a clear explanation of key terms &ndash; would be an important step towards greater transparency for investors.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Fee and interest disclosure</h2>
<p>Transparency was also an issue when it came to fee and interest disclosure.</p>
<p>Of the 28 funds we reviewed,&nbsp;<strong>only four</strong>&nbsp;published information about the interest rates or range of interest rates charged to borrowers.</p>
<p>If these rates are accurately disclosed, investors are better able to judge the riskiness of the investment.</p>
<p>Conversely, where borrowers pay fees on top of interest that are not disclosed, this masks a clear signal about the level of risk involved in the lending.</p>
<p><strong>Only two</strong>&nbsp;retail funds quantified the interest earned from their assets and borrower fees and disclosed the retained amounts as part of their wider management fee in the product disclosure statement.</p>
<p><strong>Only one</strong>&nbsp;<strong>wholesale fund</strong>&nbsp;passed on to investors the full economic benefits of interest earned from its assets and income earned from borrower fees.</p>
<p>To enable investors to better assess the true cost of investing in a fund, fund managers and trustees should disclose&nbsp;<strong>ALL</strong>&nbsp;revenue they earn in connection with their funds.</p>
<p>Clear and accurate disclosure enables investors to understand what they are paying for, directly and indirectly, and to better judge whether they are being appropriately compensated for the associated risk.</p>
<h2>Valuations</h2>
<p>The final area that I wanted to touch on is valuations.</p>
<p>Investors rely on fair valuations to assess performance and make informed investment decisions.</p>
<p>Private assets in particular are subject to heightened valuation risks, due to infrequent trading and limited price discovery.</p>
<p>Many of the private credit funds we reviewed were open-ended funds, with regular monthly or quarterly redemption periods.</p>
<p>For open-ended funds in times of stress, failure to adjust valuations in a timely manner could allow some fund members to exit at a higher price, at the expense of the remaining investors.</p>
<p>Some of the poorer valuation practices we observed involved infrequent valuations, incomplete or absent valuation policies, insufficient independence and inconsistent approaches to valuing collateral.</p>
<p>Where valuations are not accurate, reliable, timely or comparable, this raises serious questions about the ability of investors &ndash; and indeed researchers &ndash; to assess the performance of a fund.</p>
<p>To guide fund managers in uplifting their practices, our report outlines ten guiding principles for private credit &lsquo;done well&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The principles provide guidance on the three areas that I&rsquo;ve mentioned - terminology, fee disclosure and valuations - as well as other areas like design and distribution, organisational capability, liquidity and governance.</p>
<p>Each of these principles is grounded in the law. And we will be monitoring how well private credit funds adhere to them.</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier that poor private credit practices are an enforcement priority for ASIC in 2026.</p>
<p>We have already issued stop orders on several target market determinations and one PDS due to poor disclosure and distribution.</p>
<p>And in instances of more egregious conduct, we have commenced enforcement investigations.</p>
<p>We have also announced the&nbsp;<strong>second phase of our private credit surveillance</strong>.</p>
<p>On the&nbsp;<strong>retail</strong>&nbsp;side, this surveillance will look at disclosures of fees and margins, and the distribution practices of private credit funds to retail investors, with a specific focus on the adviser channel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to understand how retail private credit funds are distributed and, when distributed through advisers, test the quality of their advice.</p>
<p>On the&nbsp;<strong>wholesale</strong>&nbsp;side, there are plans to look at fees, margin structures and conflicts of interest in the management of wholesale private credit funds, with a particular focus on real estate lending.</p>
<p>Through this ongoing program of work, which will hopefully be complemented by industry efforts to lift standards, we hope that private credit will increasingly be done well in Australia, with benefits to individual investors and the broader economy.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I mentioned at the start that ASIC is focussed on minimising harm to consumers and investors. That&rsquo;s a responsibility we all share.</p>
<p>Whatever role you play in the investment ecosystem, you can help to ensure that consumers who engage in investing, within or outside superannuation, are presented with products that are safe, appropriate, and aligned with their best interests.</p>
<p>When that occurs, it not only means better outcomes for individuals, it is also fundamental to building and maintaining trust in the system.</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today. I&rsquo;m now happy to take some questions.</p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority Cancels HGL’s Financial Advice Provider Licence</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-cancels-hgls-financial-advice-provider-2025122/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) - Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; has cancelled the Financial Advice Provider licence of Christchurch-based Hope Group Limited (HGL).</p>
<p>HGL has held a full financial advice provider licence and provided personal risk insurance advice (life and health insurance, income protection insurance, trauma and disability insurance) to retail clients.   &nbsp;</p>
<p>Louise Unger, FMA Executive Director, Response and Enforcement, said HGL&rsquo;s cancellation followed the termination of its distribution agreement with the impacted insurer, and the FMA&rsquo;s subsequent inquiry into its affairs.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the notification from the impacted insurer, the FMA reviewed 14 insurance policy applications submitted by HGL&rsquo;s sole director and financial adviser, Mr Junpu Wang, on behalf of 13 customers. The inquiries identified serious conduct issues resulting in material breaches of obligations. Specifically, the conduct included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Submitting second policy applications for existing clients using incorrect or false customer information to conceal that the policies were duplicates&nbsp;</li>
<li>Completing an authority to accept a direct debit form on behalf of a client without obtaining the client&rsquo;s authentic signature&nbsp;</li>
<li>Failing to obtain client consent for both first and second policies (with the same or similar cover) to remain active during a significant period, causing clients to pay two premiums. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Misleading clients by recommending second policies to benefit from lower premiums under a promotional offer, despite clients being ineligible (e.g., already existing policyholders) </li>
<li>Failing to ensure clients understood the advice provided. In some cases, clients were incorrectly advised that a new policy was needed because their existing policy would become more expensive after 24 months; in two cases, clients were told to take out a new policy to obtain a second luxury item &ndash; despite being ineligible for that benefit.  &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Mr Wang deliberately misled impacted clients to take out second policies after the 24-month clawback period for the sole purpose to obtain commission payments from the insurer,&rdquo; said Ms Unger.</p>
<p>In doing so, HGL and Mr Wang obtained $37,374 in upfront commissions. In addition, clients paid two premiums for the same or similar cover while both policies remained active for up to 27 weeks, resulting in overpayments totalling $5,342.34.</p>
<p>&ldquo;HGL and Mr Wang&rsquo;s actions represent a serious and deliberate departure from the standards expected of a licensed financial advice provider.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr Wang has not accepted his conduct, all allegations have been denied and attempts made to blame another financial adviser who was never engaged by HGL at the time the applications were submitted,&rdquo; said Ms Unger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cancellation of HGL&rsquo;s licence is critical to ensuring we protect consumers and the integrity of the market. A key function of the FMA is to ensure the quality of financial advice and financial advice services &ndash; which is clearly missing here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A public notification helps the FMA to raise awareness about standards we expect, deter future contraventions by other market participants, and publicly express disapproval for contraventions under the FMC Act and the relevant regulations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The insurer has contacted all impacted clients and made arrangements to ensure they are supported. In addition, HGL and Mr. Wang have been deregistered from the Financial Service Providers Register (FSPR), and the matter had been reported to the Police.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>ASIC has released updated regulatory guidance on industry codes of conduct in the financial services and credit sectors.<br /><br />The updates to Regulatory Guide 183&nbsp;<em>Codes of conduct for the financial services and credit sectors</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/regulatory-guides/rg-183-codes-of-conduct-for-the-financial-services-and-credit-sectors/" title="RG 183 Approval of financial services sector codes of conduct">RG 183</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>reflect legislative reform since the guidance was last updated in 2013,</li>
<li>clarify ASIC&rsquo;s role in relation to industry codes, and the criteria and process for code approval, and</li>
<li>simplify and streamline the guidance.</li>
</ul>
<p>These updates follow consultation with stakeholders through Consultation Statement 26&nbsp;<em>Proposed update to RG 183</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/consultations/cs-26-proposed-update-to-rg-183/" title="CS 26 Proposed update to RG 183">CS 26</a>). Stakeholders were broadly supportive of the proposed updates.<br /><br />A copy of the non-confidential submissions made to ASIC and an outline of our response is available below.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>It is not mandatory for any industry in the financial services or credit sectors to develop a code. Where a code exists, it does not require ASIC&rsquo;s approval. However, seeking and obtaining ASIC&rsquo;s approval is a signal that the code is one that consumers can have confidence in and rely on.</p>
<p>RG 183 provides guidance on ASIC&rsquo;s role in relation to codes, the criteria for code approval by ASIC, and the process for obtaining (and retaining) ASIC&rsquo;s approval for a code.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>Universiti Utara Malaysia (&ldquo;UUM&rdquo;) made a clean sweep of the top three spots at the recent Bursa Inter-Varsity Stock Challenge (&ldquo;BISC&rdquo;) 2025 Grand Finale.</p>
<p>After a tightly contested final round, Chong Jia Hong emerged as Champion while Ponny Ling Hsing Yu and Bryan Lim Wei Chin were named first and second runners-up, respectively.</p>
<p>The nationwide challenge, which ran from August to November 2025, attracted 850 teams and nearly 1,300 students from 10 universities<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;in an immersive stock trading competition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organised by Bursa Malaysia since 2022, the annual BISC aims to cultivate informed, confident and responsible future investors. By simulating real-world investing in a riskfree environment, participants gain early hands-on experience whilst sharpening their analytical skills.</p>
<p>Dato&rsquo; Fad&rsquo;l Mohamed, Chief Executive Officer of Bursa Malaysia, said: &ldquo;This year&rsquo;s strong participation reflects not only rising interest in the stock market among the youth, but also their determination to challenge themselves, master financial knowledge and apply investing concepts. Such enthusiasm reinforces the importance of BISC as part of Bursa Malaysia&rsquo;s ongoing efforts to educate and empower the next generation of informed investors in an engaging yet structured approach.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Three-phase Competition Structure and Mentorship</h4>
<p>To maximise learning outcomes, BISC 2025 featured three phases, with each phase building on the previous to simulate the full cycle of investing.</p>
<ol>
<li>evaluated based on analytical depth, originality, and accuracy, covering areas such as catalysts, sensitivity analysis, financial performance and valuation. </li>
<li>Phase 2 &ndash; Virtual Portfolio: Equipped with a virtual initial capital of RM100,000 per team, participants traded eligible listed securities in a simulated environment on MyBURSA, complete with transaction-related fees and stamp duty, to replicate real trading.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Phase 3 &ndash; Grand Finale: The top 20 teams presented their portfolio strategies and results to a panel of industry judges. This phase tested the participants&rsquo; real understanding, presentation skills and poise under pressure as they defended their investment decisions to seasoned market professionals.</li>
</ol>
<p>Throughout the three-month challenge period, participants received continuous guidance and mentorship from participating brokerage firms &mdash; Affin Hwang Investment Bank, AmInvestment Bank, CGS International Securities Malaysia, Maybank Investment Bank and RHB Investment Bank &mdash; who provided expert advice, professional resources and practical insights to deepen their understanding of market dynamics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Participating in BISC 2025 was a meaningful experience for me. The competition offered a chance to put a trading strategy to the test under conditions that felt close to the real market. Along the way, it became clear where the approach worked and where it needed refining, all without taking on any actual risk. The exposure and hands-on learning have been invaluable in building confidence to continue growing as an investor,&rdquo; said Chong Jia Hong from Universiti Utara Malaysia (UUM), the Champion of BISC Grand Finale 2025.</p>
<p>As part of Bursa Malaysia's commitment to promoting inclusive capital market and investor empowerment, initiatives such as BISC play an essential role in expanding the nation's retail investor base and nurturing a more knowledgeable and financially savvy investment community. Encouraged by the success of BISC 2025, Bursa Malaysia will continue positioning this annual competition as a cornerstone initiative for strengthening financial literacy among youth.&nbsp; The Exchange invites interested universities and students to participate in the next edition of BISC 2026.

<title>Opening Remarks, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell, At The George P. Shultz Memorial Lecture Series: Shultz And Economic Policy, Hoover Institution, Stanford University, Stanford, California</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/opening-remarks-federal-reserve-chair-jerome-h-powell-at-the-george-p-shultz-2025122/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>I am deeply honored to have been asked to speak here today about the remarkable legacy of George Shultz. Just to be clear, I will not address current economic conditions or monetary policy.</p>
<p>I have been an admirer of George Shultz since my college years. I saw him then and now as a great role model, as I mentioned a few months ago when delivering the Baccalaureate address to Princeton's class of 2025, 50 years after my own graduation.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20251201a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>As I told the graduates, when I faced the world after college, I had no real plan, but knew that I wanted to combine a private-sector career with public service. I had in mind a few well-known public figures of the era, especially George Shultz, whose picture was on the wall of the Princeton eating club of which both of us were members. George may also have caught my attention because my dad was a labor lawyer who represented one of the major steel companies in collective bargaining. Like George, my father had both a belief in the collective bargaining process and a deep respect for workers.</p>
<p>I followed George's career with interest through the years. It didn't occur to me that I would ever have the honor of meeting him. But I did meet him after I joined the Fed in 2012, as I visited Stanford from time to time. I remember energetic economic discussions at group lunches in his conference room at Hoover. George was also kind enough to host John Taylor, Michael, and me for a chilly round of golf on a rainy March day.</p>
<p>Today, our focus is on George's extraordinarily broad economic accomplishments. I also want to celebrate the remarkable man and policymaker that he was. Several things stand out for me.</p>
<p>He was a man who combined strong principles and unshakeable integrity with common sense and a practical, problem-solving approach to policy. He had a deep belief in the wisdom of markets and a desire to let them work whenever possible without government direction. That theme runs through many issues we will discuss, including collective bargaining, wage and price controls, and exchange rates.</p>
<p>But he was not an absolutist and saw that there are sometimes market failures that should be addressed by public policy. As one of the most successful policymakers of his era, George brought the intellectual rigor of an academic to the practical, constrained, messy work of policymaking. Through four cabinet appointments, he dealt with many of the great issues of his day, with remarkable success. And he kept at it long after leaving public office, making important contributions on health care reform, climate change and nuclear disarmament.</p>
<p>He may be less well known for this, but George Shultz was deeply concerned about racial discrimination in the workplace and our society more broadly. He consistently and effectively used his positions of authority to increase opportunities for minorities. He later noted that there was both a moral and an economic basis for this.</p>
<p>He stuck to his principles while also treating people with honesty and respect, including those with whom he had policy disagreements.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20251201a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;Labor leaders welcomed his appointment as Secretary of Labor. As many of his contemporaries remarked, faced with divergent views and difficult issues, he was extraordinarily good at steering people toward agreement. A key part of that strategy was to let the parties reach the final agreement themselves. That way, they owned the agreement and were more likely to honor it. His friendships and collaborations were beyond number, and knew no partisan bounds.</p>
<p>He often said that trust is the coin of the realm, and that good things were only possible where there was mutual trust.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20251201a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;His integrity provided the basis for that trust. All of those who aspire to serve the public can learn from his example.</p>
<hr align="left" size="1" width="33%" />
<p><a name="fn1"></a>1. See Jerome H. Powell (2025),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/powell20250525a.pdf">"Baccalaureate Remarks," (PDF)</a>&nbsp;speech delivered at Princeton University, Princeton, N.J., May 25.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn2"></a>2. See Charles Moritz, ed. (1970),&nbsp;<em>Current Biography Yearbook 1969</em>&nbsp;(New York: The H.W. Wilson Company). Shultz's background as a mediator served him well in economic policymaking, and Paul Volcker would later say of Shultz, "Time and again he would work with almost inhuman patience to bring a group to agreement upon a decision all could support, at times submerging his own preferences"; see Philip Taubman (2023),&nbsp;<em>In the Nation's Service: The Life and Times of George P. Shultz</em>&nbsp;(Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press), p. 23.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn3"></a>3. Shultz summed up his views in this area in the mottoes "Trust is the coin of the realm" and "Respect your adversaries"; see George P. Shultz (2016),&nbsp;<em>Learning from Experience</em>&nbsp;(Stanford, Calif.: Hoover Institution Press).&nbsp;</p>
