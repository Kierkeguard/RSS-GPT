<title>ASIC Extends Transitional Relief For Foreign Financial Services Providers</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-extends-transitional-relief-for-foreign-financial-services-providers-2025125/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-extends-transitional-relief-for-foreign-financial-services-providers-2025125/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>ASIC has extended the transitional relief for foreign financial services providers (FFSPs) by an additional 12 months. This relief exempts FFSPs from the requirement to hold an Australian financial services (AFS) licence when providing financial services to Australian wholesale clients.</p>
<p>Under the current arrangements, ASIC&rsquo;s sufficient equivalence relief and limited connection relief were due to expire on 31 March 2026. With this extension, the transitional relief will remain in place until 31 March 2027.</p>
<p>On 26 November 2025, the Australian Government introduced legislation for a new licensing exemption regime for FFSPs under the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r7409"><em>Treasury Laws Amendment (Genetic Testing Protections in Life Insurance and Other Measures) Bill 2025</em></a>&nbsp;(the Bill). The new regime is due to commence 12 months after the Bill receives Royal Assent.</p>
<p>FFSPs that have been granted a foreign AFS licence will be able to continue to operate their financial services business in Australia under the licence issued by ASIC.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2025L01494/latest/text"><em>ASIC Corporations (Foreign Financial Services Providers) Instrument 2025/798</em></a>&nbsp;remakes the relief previously provided under&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2022C00873"><em>ASIC Corporations (Repeal and Transitional) Instrument 2016/396</em></a>. As a result, FFSPs currently relying on an individual relief instrument&mdash;where the expiry is linked to 2016/396&mdash;can continue to rely on that relief until 31 March 2027.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2025L01495/latest/text"><em>ASIC Corporations (Amendment) Instrument 2025/799</em></a>&nbsp;extends the relief contained in the following instruments:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2022C00867"><em>ASIC Corporations (CSSF-Regulated Financial Services Providers) Instrument 2016/1109</em></a>, and</li>
<li><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2022C00864"><em>ASIC Corporations (Foreign Financial Services Providers&mdash;Limited Connection) Instrument 2017/182</em></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The date of commencement of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2020L00238/latest/text"><em>ASIC Corporations (Foreign Financial Services Providers&mdash;Funds Management Financial Services) Instrument 2020/199</em></a>&nbsp;will be 1 April 2027. This is subject to the passage of the Bill.</p>

<title>Time To Get On With Business, Speech By ASIC Commissioner Kate O’Rourke At The 2025 Small Business Association Of Australia (SBAA) International Small Business Summit On 5 December 2025.</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/time-to-get-on-with-business-speech-by-asic-commissioner-kate-orourke-at-the-2-2025125/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul>
<li>ASIC recognises that small businesses are often time-poor and resource-stretched &ndash; and ASIC is working to ease some of the pressure through our regulatory simplification program.</li>
<li>This includes by making our guidance and information clearer, simpler and easier to access and improving our registry services for the millions of small businesses who rely on them.</li>
<li>While climate reporting obligations apply mainly to larger entities, over time they will have some impact on some small businesses and ASIC is working to help businesses prepare.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I would like to begin by acknowledging the traditional owners and custodians of the land on which we meet today, the Yugambeh people. I pay my respects to their elders past and present &ndash; and extend that respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people here today.</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone. It&rsquo;s lovely to be here. I want to thank the Small Business Association of Australia for inviting me to speak to you.</p>
<p>The small business sector is ASIC&rsquo;s largest stakeholder group. But that&rsquo;s not typically what comes to mind when most people think of us. Present company excepted, of course.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably because, when ASIC is covered in the media, it&rsquo;s more often about some other aspect of our work &ndash; usually enforcement-related and usually involving a large or well-known entity.</p>
<p>But, in fact, one of the key drivers for taking enforcement action is to help ensure a fair playing field and protect small businesses from unfair practices and harmful conduct.</p>
<p>We regularly take regulatory and enforcement action, for example, against financial services and credit providers that engage in misconduct that impacts small business &ndash; and we have a dedicated small business enforcement team.</p>
<p>We also have a highly active small business team, who engage with government agencies, industry associations and small business representatives to share insights, improve regulatory coordination, and minimise duplication and unnecessary regulatory burden for small businesses.</p>
<p>In the last financial year, we took part in around 100 small business events and meetings &ndash; in every state and territory. This face-to-face engagement is a critical part of ASIC&rsquo;s small business strategy.</p>
<p>What I want to focus on today, though, is the important work that ASIC does to support the sector through our regulatory guidance and information &ndash; and by providing efficient registry services.</p>
<p>In particular, I want to talk about the work we&rsquo;re doing through our regulatory simplification program to improve those services &ndash; for the millions of small businesses who rely on them.</p>
<p>I will also talk about climate reporting. These obligations apply mainly to larger entities. They&rsquo;re new and still being phased in. But, over time, they will have some impact on some small businesses. So, we&rsquo;re doing a range of things to help those businesses prepare.</p>
<h2>Regulatory simplification</h2>
<p>So, first to regulatory simplification. This is a multi-year program that touches on almost every part of our work, including our registry services. But, at its heart, it&rsquo;s designed to make it easier for our regulated entities to meet their obligations &ndash; small businesses very much included.</p>
<p>We understand that small businesses are often time-poor and resource-stretched. Unlike the big corporates, they don&rsquo;t have legions of support staff to help out. So, it&rsquo;s often very much a DIY situation &ndash; and that means time out of an already busy day. Time that could have been spent doing business.</p>
<p>ASIC wants to give small businesses some of that time back &ndash; and that&rsquo;s one of the things we&rsquo;re aiming for with our regulatory simplification program.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve broken the program down into four workstreams:</p>
<ol>
<li>Improving access to regulatory information</li>
<li>Reducing complexity in regulatory instruments</li>
<li>Making it easier to interact with ASIC</li>
<li>Simplification through law reform.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to focus on the first and the third: &lsquo;improving access to regulatory information&rsquo; and &lsquo;making it easier to interact with ASIC&rsquo;.</p>
<p>These are the areas that will make the biggest difference to small businesses, day to day. We&rsquo;ve already made some improvements, with more planned &ndash; as I&rsquo;ll explain.</p>
<h2>Improving access to regulatory information</h2>
<p>So, to workstream number one: improving access to regulatory information. What have we done so far?</p>
<p>We've redesigned the ASIC website.</p>
<p>We heard that finding the right information could be &lsquo;hit and miss&rsquo;. So, we gave it an overhaul. We&rsquo;ve improved the navigation, put in a better search function and removed more than 9,000 pages of duplicated content.</p>
<p>This means users will be able to access the information they need quicker &ndash; and can be confident all the relevant information has been surfaced.</p>
<p>The new website features a specific&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/regulatory-resources-search/" title="Regulatory resources search">regulatory resources search</a>&nbsp;&ndash; a click away from the homepage. Here, users can find all ASIC forms, instruments and regulatory documents in one place. You can filter these by topic and/or type by selecting the advanced search option at the top of the page.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also got a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/for-business-and-companies/business-basics/" title="Business basics">business basics</a>&nbsp;area, with useful information for small businesses including &lsquo;registering a business name&rsquo; and &lsquo;business name requirements for different types of businesses&rsquo;. You can find that by entering it into the search bar on our homepage.</p>
<p>Of course, being able to find the information you&rsquo;re looking for is one thing. But if it&rsquo;s confusing or hard to understand, then the benefits are limited.</p>
<p>So as part of this workstream, we&rsquo;re also looking at how to make our information simpler and clearer. That&rsquo;s not just about how it&rsquo;s written, though that&rsquo;s obviously important. It&rsquo;s also about thinking through how the different materials we produce work together.</p>
<p>While all designed to help our regulated populations understand their obligations, we understand that the range of materials available can be a source of confusion in itself.</p>
<p>Users have told us they don&rsquo;t always feel sure they&rsquo;re looking at the most relevant information for their purposes &ndash; or that they&rsquo;ve found all the information they need on a topic.</p>
<p>So, we&rsquo;re working to better structure these materials &ndash; and are considering some proposals to take this forward. To help us, we engaged some experts. As part of their work, they reviewed the needs of our different audiences &ndash; including small businesses and directors of small companies.</p>
<p>This is an important audience group for us &ndash; and one that has distinct needs. We appreciate that it can be difficult for them to find materials that really help them &ndash; and it can be equally difficult to find the time to engage with them if they do.</p>
<p>One way we&rsquo;re working to address their needs is through a regulatory roadmap we&rsquo;re developing for small-company directors. This will guide users through all the stages of starting and running a company &ndash; as well as closing and/or reinstating it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s some of what we&rsquo;ve done so far &ndash; and some of what&rsquo;s to come.</p>
<h2>Making it easier to interact with ASIC</h2>
<p>Turning now to workstream number three: making it easier to interact with ASIC.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start with some of the pain points we know users are experiencing and that we&rsquo;re working to address.</p>
<p>To begin with, we&rsquo;ve got multiple portals, each with their own purpose, access and authentication methods. That&rsquo;s creating a fragmented experience for users. There are also issues with navigation and usability, system slowness &ndash; and difficulties being able to quickly lodge and update information.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a time cost to all of that &ndash; and, to my earlier point, that&rsquo;s time that could be spent doing business.</p>
<p>So, what are we doing about it?</p>
<p>We have a major multi-year program of work underway to improve our business registry related technology and processes. Through that program, which we call RegistryConnect, we are working to stabilise, secure and modernise the ASIC registers.</p>
<p>Importantly, from a user&rsquo;s perspective, this will enable simpler and more reliable interactions with ASIC. It will also improve the quality and integrity of our registry data.</p>
<p>While these longer-term improvements are being implemented, we&rsquo;ve been working to ease the pressure through some short-term solutions to some of the most pressing issues.</p>
<p>For example, we&rsquo;ve started accepting email lodgements in place of any paper forms that can&rsquo;t be lodged online. We now accept electronic signatures on all ASIC forms. We&rsquo;ve also cut call waiting times &ndash; by expanding our team of customer service officers and investing in new technology.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve upgraded ASIC&rsquo;s mainframe, which supports our online registry services, to help address that system slowness. We&rsquo;ve also reduced scheduled downtime for planned maintenance, delivering more reliable access to company searches.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got a new professional registers search, with a refreshed and modern interface and advanced search functionality across multiple registers. It also incorporates a simple and secure payment process.</p>
<p>In addition to these relative quick fixes, as I mentioned, we have other, more substantial improvements underway in relation to our registry services.</p>
<p>In this next phase of our RegistryConnect program, we&rsquo;re working to improve online company registration and lodgement services. This will provide a better user experience, allow users to track the status of their interactions with ASIC and make secure digital payments.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll also expand our streamlined digital services to support more professional registrations and licence types. This is part of a broader effort to reduce the number of transaction channels &ndash; responding to the issue of fragmentation I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>Separately, through our new and improved companies register search, it will be easier to access company information &ndash; thanks to its enhanced search functionality and improved service availability.</p>
<p>We are also working to improve the integrity of the data held on our registers by strengthening our authentication processes. This will reduce the risk of fraudulent or misleading lodgements and provide greater assurance to users and the public.</p>
<p>Lastly, another key priority will be to link director IDs to the companies register. Over time, this will improve the traceability of director&ndash;company relationships and further prevent the use of fraudulent identities.</p>
<p>In doing so, it will provide the public and stakeholders &ndash; including small businesses &ndash; with greater certainty about who they are dealing with when engaging with directors and corporate entities.</p>
<p>As our work in this area develops, we will continue engaging with our stakeholders in the design of future services. This includes ongoing collaboration through the Registry Business Advisory Group, whose membership includes end users of these services.</p>
<p>We will also continue to engage with Treasury and others, including on policy and law reform to improve registry outcomes.</p>
<h2>Climate reporting</h2>
<p>Turning now to a different category of law reform &ndash; and that&rsquo;s the new mandatory climate-related financial disclosure requirements, which came into effect just over a year ago.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still some way from this being fully phased in. But are expecting to see the first reports &ndash; from the largest of the three cohorts &ndash; from around March next year.</p>
<p>These requirements won&rsquo;t directly apply to any small businesses.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll only apply to large companies that meet two of the three following criteria: revenue of over $50 million, assets of over $25 million and/or companies with more than 100 employees.</p>
<p>However, many small businesses form part of the value chains of larger businesses. That means they may need to engage with climate reporting considerations in the future. Even though they do not have any direct climate reporting obligations.</p>
<p>So, if a small business has a customer or supplier that is a large business or financial institution, they may request further information to help them meet their reporting obligations.</p>
<p>For example, that large business or financial institution may need to report on their energy usage &ndash; and may ask for records, such as electricity bills, so they can create a full picture.</p>
<p>ASIC has been developing our capability in this area for a number of years &ndash; and we&rsquo;ve been working with reporting entities to help them prepare. So, it&rsquo;s been a learning experience for all &ndash; and we do appreciate that there are some concerns.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s acknowledged by academia &ndash; and was identified in public submissions to the law reform process &ndash; that there is a need for capacity-building in this area across the financial system.</p>
<p>So, in that sense, small business is not alone on the learning journey. But, for all the reasons mentioned previously, we recognise that the smaller the business the bigger the relative impact of any additional requirements.</p>
<p>That said, there will be time to prepare &ndash; and ASIC will be assisting with that however we can.</p>
<p>For those who want more detail, I would recommend visiting our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/sustainability-reporting/sustainability-reporting-for-small-business/" title="Sustainability reporting for small business">sustainability reporting for small business</a>&nbsp;page, which, incidentally, you can also find by using the search bar on our homepage. There&rsquo;s some good information there.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also developing a suite of educational materials in partnership with the University of Technology Sydney and the Australian Accounting Standards Board.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re aimed at the smallest reporting cohort as well as SMEs who are required to submit emissions-related information &ndash; and they&rsquo;re focused on the foundational concepts underpinning the sustainability reporting requirements.</p>
<p>These educational materials will help those who are interested to understand, for example, the basics of climate change, what climate-related physical risks and transition risks are, case studies on identifying climate-related opportunities, and an introduction to emissions accounting.</p>
<p>Once these materials are complete, we&rsquo;ll make them available on our website &ndash; and will also be holding a series of roadshows to take people through them.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, finally, I just want to thank you all for your time. I hope that has been useful. I know we have a Q&amp;A session coming up. So, if there&rsquo;s anything more you want to know about these topics &ndash; or anything else &ndash; I&rsquo;ll be happy to answer your questions.</p>

<title>ASIC Issues DDO Stop Order Against FXCM For TMD Deficiencies</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-issues-ddo-stop-order-against-fxcm-for-tmd-deficiencies-2025125/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-issues-ddo-stop-order-against-fxcm-for-tmd-deficiencies-2025125/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>ASIC has made an interim stop order preventing Stratos Trading Pty Limited (trading as FXCM) from issuing contracts for difference (CFDs) to retail clients because of deficiencies in its target market determination (TMD).</p>
<p>ASIC acted because it was concerned that the TMD inappropriately included investors with a medium risk appetite in the target market for FXCM&rsquo;s CFDs.</p>
<p>ASIC considers that the risks associated with trading FXCM&rsquo;s CFDs, including leverage, volatility, liquidity and pricing risk, make them unlikely to be suitable for investors who have a &lsquo;medium risk appetite&rsquo;, regardless of any other investment criteria noted in the TMD.</p>
<p>The interim stop order prohibits FXCM from issuing CFDs to retail clients and opening trading accounts for new retail clients to trade in those CFDs. It covers CFDs issued by FXCM that reference the following underling asset classes:</p>
<ul>
<li>currency pairs and forex baskets</li>
<li>treasuries and commodities</li>
<li>stock indices</li>
<li>stocks and stock baskets, and</li>
<li>cryptocurrencies.</li>
</ul>
<p>ASIC made the interim order to prevent FXCM from issuing CFDs to retail clients, where distribution of the products is unlikely to be consistent with the financial objectives, situation or needs of consumers in its target market. The order does not prevent FXCM&rsquo;s existing clients from varying or closing their CFD positions.</p>
<p>The order is valid for 21 days unless revoked earlier.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Under the design and distribution obligations (DDO), financial product issuers must define an appropriate target market for a financial product offered to retail clients, having regard to the risks and features of the product. Issuers also need to consider how their product will be distributed and specify appropriate conditions on distribution conduct so that the product is directed to the target market and is unlikely to be acquired by consumers outside the target market.</p>
<p>CFDs are leveraged derivative contracts that allow a client to speculate in the change in value of an underlying asset, such as foreign exchange rates, stock market indices, single equities, commodities or crypto assets.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s product intervention order for CFDs strengthened consumer protections after reviews in 2017, 2019 and 2020 found that most retail clients lose money trading CFDs (refer&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2020-releases/20-254mr-asic-product-intervention-order-strengthens-cfd-protections/" title="20-254MR ASIC product intervention order strengthens CFD protections">20-254MR</a>). In April 2022, ASIC extended this order for a further five years to 23 May 2027 (refer&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2022-releases/22-082mr-asic-s-cfd-product-intervention-order-extended-for-five-years/" title="22-082MR ASIC&rsquo;s CFD product intervention order extended for five years">22-082MR</a>).</p>
<p>On 6 September 2023, ASIC released Report 770&nbsp;<em>Design and distribution obligations: Retail OTC derivatives</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-770-design-and-distribution-obligations-retail-otc-derivatives/" title="REP 770 Design and distribution obligations: Retail OTC derivatives">REP 770</a>), outlining how issuers of retail OTC derivatives are meeting DDO and highlighting areas for improvement, including their over-reliance on client questionnaires as a primary distribution filter and making greater use of available data to assist the distribution arrangements.</p>
<p>On 10 September 2024, ASIC released REP 795&nbsp;<em>Design and distribution obligations: Compliance with the reasonable steps obligation&nbsp;</em>(<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-795-design-and-distribution-obligations-compliance-with-the-reasonable-steps-obligation/" title="REP 795 Design and distribution obligations: Compliance with the reasonable steps obligation">REP 795</a>), outlining our key observations on how issuers of high-risk products including CFDs are complying with the reasonable steps obligation and highlighting further areas for improvement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a transformative opportunity for both organizations and for the capital markets as a whole,&rdquo; said David Lawrence, Chairman of PNGX Group. &ldquo;If cleared, the integration of PNG Registries into our group will not only enhance our service offering but also help drive innovation and efficiency in financial market operations.&rdquo;</p>

This development is intended to enhance liquidity and facilitate broader market participation.</p>
<h4>Continuity for Customers</h4>
<p>Until regulatory clearance is obtained, PNG Registries and PNGX Group will continue to operate as separate businesses. There will be no changes to services or operations in the interim. Customers and partners of both companies have been notified and will be kept informed as the process progresses.</p>
<p>MUFG Pension &amp; Market Services and PNGX Group are committed to a smooth and transparent transition, with a focus on continuity and customer service.</p>

<title>Federal Reserve Board Announces Pricing, Effective January 1, 2026, For Payment Services The Federal Reserve Banks Provide To Banks And Credit Unions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday announced pricing, effective January 1, 2026, for payment services the Federal Reserve Banks provide to banks and credit unions, such as the clearing of checks, automated clearing house (ACH) transactions, instant payments, and wholesale payment and settlement services.</p>
<p>By law, the Federal Reserve must establish fees to recover the costs, including imputed costs, of providing payment services over the long run. The Federal Reserve expects to recover 108 percent of actual and imputed expenses in 2026, including the return on equity that would have been earned if a private-sector firm provided the services. Overall, price changes for 2026 will result in an estimated 0.9 percent average price increase for established, mature services.</p>
<p>The entire 2026 fee schedule is published on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.frbservices.org/resources/fees">FRBservices.org</a><span>&reg;</span>. Additional information on the Federal Reserve's payments services, including service usage statistics, is available on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems.htm">Board's website</a>.</p>

<title>Federal Reserve Board Requests Public Input On The Impact Of Potential Strategic Changes To Check Services Provided By The Fed, As Well As Check Usage And Preferences</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/federal-reserve-board-requests-public-input-on-the-impact-of-potential-strategic-2025125/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday requested public input on the impact of potential strategic changes to check services provided by the Fed, as well as check usage and preferences.</p>
<p>The Reserve Banks offer check collection and processing services at a fee to banks and credit unions. Over time, check use has steadily declined, digital payment methods have grown in availability and use, and check fraud has risen. Also, the Reserve Banks will need to make substantial investments in their check infrastructure to continue providing the same level of check services going forward. To help the Board understand stakeholder needs and balance tradeoffs as it considers the future of the Reserve Banks' check services, the Board is seeking input on potential future changes to check services with varying effects on the level of check services offered and their costs. For example, potential future changes could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Foregoing investments in the Reserve Banks' check infrastructure to keep operating costs at existing levels with reduced reliability of check services over time;</li>
<li>Investing in the Reserve Banks' check infrastructure to maintain and potentially improve check services with higher operating costs; or</li>
<li>Significantly reducing check services, or alternatively, substantially winding them down, both resulting in reduced operating costs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Board's request for public input asks several questions about these potential changes, including the impact on consumers and businesses. This request for public input is preliminary. Accordingly, if commenters and the Board's analysis support a strategy that may have significant longer-run effects on the nation's payments system, the Board would seek additional public comment on such changes to check services prior to adoption.</p>
<p>Comments are due within 90 days after publication in the&nbsp;<em>Federal Register</em>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On Thursday, December 11, Secretary of the Treasury Scott K. H. Bessent will preside over a meeting of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council) at the Treasury Department. The meeting will consist of an executive session and an open session. The preliminary agenda for the executive session includes an update on the Council&rsquo;s workstreams, as well as an update on the Council&rsquo;s interpretive guidance on nonbank financial company determinations and the Council&rsquo;s analytic framework for financial stability risk identification, assessment, and response.* The preliminary agenda for the open session includes a presentation and vote on the Council&rsquo;s 2025 annual report, and an update on banking supervision and regulatory reforms.</p>
<p>The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires the Council to convene no less than quarterly, but the Council has historically convened on a more frequent basis. The meetings bring Council members together to discuss and analyze emerging market developments and financial regulatory issues. The Council is committed to conducting its business as openly and transparently as practicable, given the confidential supervisory and sensitive information at the center of its work. Consistent with the&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/261/The%20Council%26%23039%3Bs%20Transparency%20Policy_1.pdf">Council's transparency policy</a>, the Council opens its meetings to the public whenever possible.</p>
<p><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/webcasts">Open session Council meetings are made available to the public via live webcast and can also be viewed after they occur</a>. Upcoming Council meeting dates and times are posted following the official notification to Council members of an upcoming meeting.</p>
<p>Meeting minutes and readouts for past Council meetings are available below. Meeting minutes for the most recent Council meeting are generally approved at the next Council meeting and posted online soon afterwards.</p>
<p><small>* In accordance with the Council&rsquo;s Transparency Policy, which is available at&nbsp;</small><a href="http://www.fsoc.gov/"><small>www.fsoc.gov</small></a><small>, this portion of the meeting will be held in a closed session to prevent the potential disclosure of information contained in or related to investigation, examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of, an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial markets or financial institutions; information which would lead to significant financial speculation, significantly endanger the stability of any financial market or financial institution, or significantly frustrate implementation of a proposed agency action; information exempted from disclosure by statute or by regulation, or authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order to be kept secret; trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential; and inter-agency and intra-agency memoranda or letters which would not otherwise be available by law.&nbsp;</small></p>

<title>Remarks At The Meeting Of The Investor Advisory Committee, SEC Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw, Washington D.C., Dec. 4, 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Good morning.&nbsp;Welcome to the members of the Committee as well as the panelists.&nbsp;This is the final Investor Advisory Committee meeting of my tenure as an SEC Commissioner, so today&rsquo;s meeting is bittersweet for me.</p>
<p>First and foremost, I want to express my sincere gratitude to all of the members of this Committee.&nbsp;Your work on behalf of investors is deeply important; it is meaningful and tireless; it is thoughtful and balanced.&nbsp;You do this work in your free time, even though, for many of you, it could be a full-time job. You bring diverse expertise to the table, as well as the clear-eyed, common goal of making the markets better for investors, so that Americans of all stripes can live their own versions of the American Dream. That is no small task, but it is one that you all have approached with steel and grace. These are more than just platitudes.</p>
<p>I want each of you to know that I&rsquo;ve listened to your recommendations and they have universally improved our policy making.&nbsp;As you move forward, I hope you will continue to bring energy and enthusiasm to the tasks that lie ahead.&nbsp;As the Commission will no doubt continue to deregulate in the months ahead, please act as a voice for those investors who stand to benefit from those rules that will be threatened with potential revision or repeal.&nbsp;I have no doubt that you are up for the challenge.</p>
<p>And for my fellow Commissioners, I hope that you will continue to seek a diversity of viewpoints as you select Committee members in the future, because I believe sincerely that a robust and respectfully dissonant discussion leads to more considered policy advice and outcomes.</p>
<p>And another big thank you to Cristina [Martin Firvida], who leaves us at the end of this month. You have been a leader and a friend, and your work will benefit investors well beyond your time here.&nbsp;The agency will miss you. I wish you great success in your future endeavors.</p>
<h3>Changing Corporate Governance Landscape</h3>
<p>Shifting gears, there is no better topic to underscore the important work of this Committee on behalf of investors than the changing corporate governance landscape.</p>
<p>In under one year, this landscape has shifted dramatically.</p>
<ul>
<li>Staff rescinded Staff Legal Bulletin 14L, making it easier to exclude certain shareholder proposals;<a class="ck-anchor" id="_ftnref1"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-meeting-investor-advisory-committee-120425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a></li>
<li>Staff has determined not to weigh in on the majority of no-action requests as part of the 14a-8 process, except that it will issue &ldquo;no objection&rdquo; relief to those who ask for it, based on no substantive review of underlying requests;<a class="ck-anchor" id="_ftnref2"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-meeting-investor-advisory-committee-120425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2">[2]</a></li>
<li>the Chairman has indicated that the Commission will greenlight the exclusion of most precatory proxy proposals, based not on changes in state law, but on the speculations of certain Delaware practitioners;<a class="ck-anchor" id="_ftnref3"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-meeting-investor-advisory-committee-120425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3">[3]</a></li>
<li>the Commission has issued a policy statement effectively permitting public companies to employ mandatory arbitration clauses to prevent shareholders from litigating either their singular or class-action claims in federal court;<a class="ck-anchor" id="_ftnref4"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-meeting-investor-advisory-committee-120425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4">[4]</a></li>
<li>staff has granted no-action relief to allow retail shareholders to &ldquo;check the box&rdquo; to a standing instruction that automatically votes their shares in conformance with board recommendations, without individual consideration of specific issues, including, potentially, merger or divestiture votes;<a class="ck-anchor" id="_ftnref5"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-meeting-investor-advisory-committee-120425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5">[5]</a></li>
<li>staff has issued guidance under Rules 13D/G that limits investor interaction with management to chill those communications;<a class="ck-anchor" id="_ftnref6"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-meeting-investor-advisory-committee-120425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6">[6]</a></li>
<li>and, as stated by the Chairman, we know it is his intention to seek to reduce the cadence of quarterly reporting requirements, and diminish disclosures in areas such as executive compensation.<a class="ck-anchor" id="_ftnref7"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-meeting-investor-advisory-committee-120425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7">[7]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And that is just the beginning.</p>
<p><em><span>Any one</span></em>&nbsp;of these changes would be groundbreaking;&nbsp;<em><span>together</span></em>, they represent a seismic shift in the corporate governance landscape happening right under our feet.</p>
<p>And yet, as my colleagues know because I keep reminding everyone, not a single one of the changes effected to date has been done through notice-and-comment rulemaking.&nbsp;That means that we have not had the benefit of statutorily mandated economic analysis to assess the impacts of the deeply important policy shifts that we&rsquo;re making.&nbsp;We haven&rsquo;t measured the economic costs or benefits of any single change, and we&nbsp;<em><span>certainly</span></em>&nbsp;have not measured the cumulative effect of these policy changes, which I have been told repeatedly in the past<em><span>&nbsp;</span></em>is important to members of the industry.&nbsp;Moreover, we have not benefitted from the considered feedback of impacted investors &ndash; investors who will have fewer disclosures; less input over how the management of the companies&nbsp;<em><span>they own</span></em>&nbsp;put their investor dollars to work; and, potentially fewer (if any) avenues of redress when they are the victims of fraud.</p>
<p>Indeed, all of these changes lopsidedly inure to the benefit of management and to the detriment of shareholders, corporate accountability, and the governance structures that provide checks on corporate decision makers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why today&rsquo;s panel is so timely and so important.&nbsp;Help us understand both the singular and cumulative impacts that our deregulatory efforts in this space will have on investors.&nbsp;Bring data, analysis and precedent to the conversation.&nbsp;Help lend a voice to investors who didn&rsquo;t have the opportunity to weigh in before these changes were made because the Commission chose to leave them out in the cold.</p>
<h3>Tokenization</h3>
<p>I am also looking forward to today&rsquo;s panel on tokenization, which will tackle the many challenges associated with tokenized equity products.&nbsp;As I have said before,<a class="ck-anchor" id="_ftnref8"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-meeting-investor-advisory-committee-120425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8">[8]</a>&nbsp;tokenization raises a host of complex, novel issues on how tokenized securities could be issued, traded, cleared, and settled.&nbsp;Altering established regulatory standards to accommodate these novel processes would carry significant risk, both to market integrity and to investors.&nbsp;At the same time, new rules may be warranted to address these products&rsquo; unique risks.</p>
<p>For example, tokenized equities are commonly marketed as &ldquo;wrapped securities&rdquo; that provide exposure to an underlying asset.&nbsp;Some are touted as expanding access to assets, such as private company shares, that are typically inaccessible to retail investors. But in truth, these tokenized products are far from one-to-one replicas of the underlying asset to which they are supposedly linked.&nbsp;The ownership rights and entitlements are different, often unclear, and potentially entirely unconnected to the issuer of the underlying asset.&nbsp;They are generally less liquid than traditional securities and much harder to price and trade.</p>
<p>How can investors, or their advisors, fairly evaluate the risks of these wrapped tokenized securities?&nbsp;Should the regulatory requirements that govern them be relaxed just because the product exists on a blockchain?&nbsp;Do wrapped tokenized securities offer any clear benefits to investors that may justify their heightened risks?</p>
<p>Most importantly, what are we actually trying to achieve by tokenizing equities in secondary markets?&nbsp;If the purpose is to achieve settlement efficiencies, then that presents a much different use case than if the purpose is to allow tokenized equities to trade without any front-end investor protections, which would create an environment ripe for regulatory arbitrage at the expense of the traditional equities markets.&nbsp;If this new ecosystem does not provide either common market transparency about price or visible customer protections, I ask again&mdash;what is the goal and the likely outcome here?</p>
<p>These are difficult and complex questions, and I look forward to hearing the panelists&rsquo; views.</p>
<p class="text-align-center">***</p>
<p>Many thanks again to the Committee for both your hard work leading up to today&mdash;including what I thought was a very helpful recommendation on disclosures around artificial intelligence&mdash;and thank you in advance for your continued work in the future.&nbsp;I sincerely hope that our paths will cross again.&nbsp;</p>

<title>You Cannot Regulate What You Cannot Define + The Clone Wars, By Kelvin To, Founder And President Of Data Boiler Technologies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>One cannot jump to the &ldquo;How&rdquo; when the &ldquo;What&rdquo; has <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> been properly defined. Despite the EU being the first to come up with their Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act and Canada being at the forefront of digital assets laws, there is NO first mover advantage in rule making. It is better late than never if we can get it right when framing the regulatory solutions to the problems in the AI and Crypto spaces. This 3-part sequel aims to decipher the noumenon of and define what AI, DeFi, tokenization and cryptocurrencies truly are.</p>
<p><img alt="KTO_AI_Part_1_2025" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/KTO_AI_Part_1_2025.jpg" title="KTO_AI_Part_1_2025" /></p>
<h2>Definition of AI</h2>
<p>AI is NO ordinary <i>&ldquo;machine-based systems&rdquo;</i> or <i>&ldquo;automations&rdquo;</i>, but a <i>&ldquo;cognitive system&rdquo; </i>capable of <i>&ldquo;learning&rdquo;</i> to continuously improve the Functioning of a Computer / to any Other Technology or Technical Field (e.g. a GPS Satellite system is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> AI, but traffic predictions and personalized recommendations are). By referring to AI as <i>&ldquo;cognitive&rdquo;</i>, the focus is on the system&rsquo;s internal (mental like) processes, rather than SOLELY on external behaviors and consequences.</p>
<p>Learning per the <i>&ldquo;</i><a href="https://cavcanine.com/classical-conditioning/"><i>Dog Salivating Theory</i></a><i>&rdquo;</i> that nurtures voluntary behavior by pairing external conditioned stimulus to associate two or more phenomena, such technique alone does <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> constitute it as AI. Computational techniques that mimic pet training in itself are insufficient or unlikely to pose an existential threat to humanity, except exploitation of Dopamine for addictive behaviors. Also, the presence or absence of <i>&ldquo;</i><a href="https://psychcentral.com/health/operant-conditioning"><i>operant conditions</i></a><i>&rdquo;</i> could merely be automation in itself to modify voluntary behavior through external consequences (reacting to the laws) of reward and punishment. Without combining it with other internal (mental like) computational techniques, such systems should <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> be considered as AI.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA">CAPTCHA</a> &ndash; a security test that uses a <i>"</i><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/Turing-test"><i>Turing test</i></a><i>"</i> to differentiate between humans and bots is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> AI in itself.&nbsp; However, Google reCAPTCHA system is part of an AI that consists of internal processes (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystroke_logging">keylogging</a> to track and analyze user interactions, such as mouse movement and typing patterns) to determine if a user is human. Keylogging without a user&rsquo;s consent could be invasive to privacy; hence it should be a regulated activity. Another computing activity that should be regulated is &ndash; the <a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/future-technology/ai-vs-captcha">use of AI to help bots bypass CAPTCHA</a> or the like security test, except when used for ethical hacking.</p>
<p>fA crawler or web scraper that automatically extracts data from an external environment (web) is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> inherently an AI. When combining crawler&rsquo;s function with internal processes involving intelligent data analysis to enhance the data collection with contextual understanding (rather than just the keywords search), then such system is an AI.</p>
<p>A scanner or camera to surveil the public area outside of private property is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> an AI. Adding a sophisticated system that has internal processes to control one or orchestrate multiple surveillance camera(s) to enhance the monitoring with contextual awareness (e.g. facial recognition to analyze identity) is an AI.</p>
<p>We despise heavy-handed government policies to brutally force AI firms to censor / filtering so-called <i>&ldquo;unsafe behaviors / outputs&rdquo;</i> or require adversarial training to ban or reveal what authoritarian may constitute as <i>&ldquo;vulnerabilities&rdquo;</i>. We are thankful for <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-vice-president-the-artificial-intelligence-action-summit-paris-france">Vice President JD Vance remarks</a> at the AI Action Summit, in particular <i>&ldquo;AI must remain free from ideological bias, and that American AI will not be co-opted into a tool for authoritarian censorship.&rdquo; </i>It helps address civic concerns over <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/cs181/projects/ethics-of-surveillance/ethics.html">massive government surveillance</a>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOTE</span>: <i>&ldquo;Ideological bias&rdquo;</i> is a human bias driven by political or social belief. Whereas <i>&ldquo;bias&rdquo;</i> in many domains &ndash; especially competitive ones like defense or finance &ndash; bias is not just inevitable, it is essential to: prioritize certain outcomes (e.g. speed over accuracy, stealth over transparency), reflect strategic performance (e.g. risk tolerance, adversary modeling), and/or to exploit asymmetries (e.g. alpha in trading, deception in war).</p>
<p>There are different AI machine learning algorithms, some use cognitive reasoning for multi-step strategic plans (e.g. chess game) where <i>&ldquo;bias&rdquo;</i> is essential. Others use non-reasoning (or generative) models excel at fast, pattern-based tasks like content generation or chatbots where consensus building and/or optimization for the most commonly accepted respond (consistency in reproducibility of outcomes) is prioritized. One size does not fit all.</p>
<p>Bias can be <i>&ldquo;conscious&rdquo;</i> and <i>&ldquo;unconscious&rdquo;</i>. A cognitive system does <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> have to be conscious. Neuroscientists believe consciousness could be a distributed process that does not depend on a singular <i>&ldquo;self&rdquo;</i>. Unconscious bias can inflict harm amid unintentional &ndash; negligence. <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/cs/cognitive-computing-vs-ai">Cognitive systems with no recommendations</a> should <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> escape AI responsibilities. <i>&ldquo;Bias&rdquo;</i> depends on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_norm">social norm</a>. Social norm evolves overtime.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Signal amplification&rdquo;</i> is an absolute necessity in sequencing technologies. It enables detection, ensures accuracy via redundancy, and is particularly useful when working with limited input material. However, amplification inherently introduces <i>&ldquo;technical bias&rdquo;</i> into sequencing data &ndash; a known and acknowledged challenge, but it may be better than the inability to generate any data at all.</p>
<p>The US trade surveillance process <i>objectively</i> checks if a trade has the effect of altering the worth of a target. It is a <i>red flag</i> of market manipulation if the trade caused a <i>&ldquo;bias&rdquo;</i> in market mechanism. The challenge is how to distinguish between a <i>systematic technical bias</i> or human-made <i>artifact</i> in data, from <i>natural evolutionary bias</i> or <i>selection</i>. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/joc/article/73/5/463/7190600">Content preference</a> and <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jrsssa/article/185/Supplement_2/S620/7069513">context bias</a> are highly dependent on the specific use case or application, i.e. largely <i>subjective</i> and situational.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Normalization&rdquo; is the statistical data smoothing process that meant to address <i>&ldquo;bias&rdquo;</i>. Yet, whenever one applies computational methods to the data, the relationship between the true <i>&ldquo;signal&rdquo;</i> and the technical <i>&ldquo;noise&rdquo;</i> is inherently altered. There is a trade-off in gaining clarity of signal at the potential cost of introducing subtle <i>&ldquo;new biases&rdquo;</i> or <i>suppressing</i> real, but weak, <i>&ldquo;signals&rdquo;</i>. Strive for the most timely, accurate, relevant, and complete data where possible to avoid excessive manipulation in normalization for the best sequencing results. Unfortunately, consolidated tape without <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/market-data-available-securely-synchronized-time-kelvin-to/">time-lock encryption to make market data available securely in synchronized time</a> caused <i>&ldquo;initial bias&rdquo; </i>that exacerbates the gap between subscribers of proprietary feeds and the public SIPs.</p>
<p>Hallucination is considered an output that is out of norms. Hallucinations are like dreams (a state of consciousness that one&rsquo;s <i>&ldquo;awareness&rdquo;</i> of external environments may be out of synch), except dreams may be more vivid / emotion than hallucinations. Human&rsquo;s five senses are less active when dream. When AI sensory attenuation primarily focused on language or visual images, it undermines other sensory inputs, such as sound, touch, smell and taste, etc.</p>
<p>AI is often being mythologized by humans as all-knowing. People expect instant gratification. Yet, AIs are like <i>replicas</i> of humans. There will be occasions of <i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo;</i>, irrelevant fluff being generated, stuttering, or words could not catch up with thoughts. The ability to form and process complex thoughts is distinct from the ability to articulate fluently and coherently. Improve context awareness, better adversary training, use of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/381994127_Ensemble_Deep_Learning_and_Machine_Learning_Applications_Opportunities_Challenges_and_Future_Directions">ensemble learning</a>, and <a href="https://www.sdu.dk/en/forskning/cmc/key-terms/multimodality">multimodality</a> all contribute to reducing AI hallucinations but cost extra time, efforts, and may introduce noise.</p>
<p>Unlike <i>data</i> extraction that can be <i>timely</i>, <i>accurate</i> and <i>complete</i> if one is willing to pay extra, <i>intelligence</i> may never be 100%. I.e. AI <i>prediction</i> or <i>advice</i> seldom possess all attributes simultaneously due to in inherent constraints, such as information asymmetry, the tension between speed and quality, cognitive limitations, and the dynamic nature of reality. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Do <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> lambast AI for hallucination. Humans often fail to think critically, unable to synthesize information from various sources for evaluating information to find deeper meaning, and lack adaptability and creativity. Yet, humans like to dream and imagine. Should cognitive systems be allowed to dream &ndash; a possible indicator of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence">Artificial General Intelligence</a>? AI hallucinations may discover <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_unknown_unknowns">unknown unknowns</a> which were previously nonsensical to human. To better understand nuances and enhance AI performance, policy makers should incentivize the industry to turn <i>&ldquo;unknowns&rdquo;</i> into <i>&ldquo;knowns.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>The last administration inappropriately assumed or interpreted <i>&ldquo;AI bias&rdquo;</i> as systematic and repeatable error in a computer system that creates unfair outcomes, such as disadvantaging a particular gender or race. This contradicts with the current administration&rsquo;s merit-based policy (<a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-02097.pdf">EO 14173</a>) that dismantles Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives. Trying to <i>&ldquo;neutralize&rdquo;</i> biases in pursuit of consensus or fairness can dilute the US strategic advantage, especially when foreign adversaries are not playing by the same rules.</p>
<p>The EU AI Act mandates development of a Code of Practice on General-Purpose AI is problematic. Best practice sharing is not wrong. Concern is &ndash; how they would consider <i>&ldquo;the Code&rsquo;s design and build coherence where needed&rdquo;</i>? Regurgitating GRC tools as AI compliance is the wrong approach. <i>&ldquo;Coherence&rdquo;</i> limits creativity. Differentiation is what drives innovation. The EU Digital Markets Act aims to ensure <i>&ldquo;fair competition and practices among large online &lsquo;gatekeeper&rsquo; platforms like search engines and app store&rdquo; </i>is nothing but a protectionism policy. Invoke Antitrust laws may suffice.</p>
<p>China recently released their <i>&ldquo;AI Safety Governance Framework 2.0&rdquo; </i>(<a href="https://www.cac.gov.cn/2025-09/15/c_1759653448369123.htm">CN-AISGF2</a>). Their <a href="https://digichina.stanford.edu/work/translation-cybersecurity-law-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china-effective-june-1-2017/">cybersecurity law</a>, computer crime criminal law (<a href="https://www.warnathgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/China-Criminal-Code.pdf">Articles 285-287</a>), and <a href="https://digichina.stanford.edu/work/translation-personal-information-protection-law-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china-effective-nov-1-2021/">Personal Information Protection Law</a> are their broader policies that prioritize their national security and state control. CN-AISGF2 looks undeniably comprehensive as we compared it against the 2022 version of the US NIST-AIRMF (see pages 9-10 of our <a href="https://www.databoiler.com/index_htm_files/DataBoiler%20WHOSTP%2020251027R.pdf">comment letter</a>). Their usage of familiar GRC best practices make it appealing for foreign jurisdictions to adopt it. The US NIST-AIRMF playbook and related guidances if blindly continuing the oversimplified <i>&ldquo;Govern&rdquo;</i> in center of <i>&ldquo;Map, Measure, and Manage&rdquo;</i> (GMMM) path may end-up similar to CN-AISGF2.</p>
<p>In order for the US to exert influence on Global AI policies, the US AI regulatory regime should re-center the focus on the identified key AI risks (energy; addictive, herd and/or polarized behaviors / destroy humans&rsquo; abilities to think independently; censorship; hyper optimization; insurgent / unhealthy competition) to mitigate the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-risks-downfall-humanity-kelvin-to-yhzge/">downfall of humanity</a>. Policy Makers should consider the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics">Asimov&rsquo;s Three Laws</a> and <a href="https://www.streetdirectory.com/travel_guide/120083/technology/the_fourth_law_of_robotics.html">Zeroth (Forth) Law</a> for AI. The ISO 23894 Risk, ISO 42001 management system, and ISO 38507 governance frameworks should be redirected accordingly. Meanwhile, the Department of Justice&rsquo;s Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (<a href="https://www.justice.gov/jm/jm-9-48000-computer-fraud">CFAA</a>) has a narrower statute if <a href="https://digitalcommons.harrisburgu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1006&amp;context=other-works">compared to other jurisdictions</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; CFAA is meant to target external hackers&rsquo; unauthorized access and damage; it does <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> impute liability to internal workers who disregard a use policy. Bypassing code would constitute a cybercrime ONLY if the code is a <i>&ldquo;</i><a href="https://columbialawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Orin-S.-Kerr.pdf"><i>real barrier</i></a><i>&rdquo;</i> as opposed to a <i>&ldquo;speed bump&rdquo;</i>. <i>&ldquo;</i><a href="https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/function-creep"><i>Function creep</i></a><i>&rdquo;</i> is concern we identified with the FINRA Consolidated Audit Trail (<a href="https://www.databoiler.com/index_htm_files/DataBoiler%20SEC%20CAT%2020210503.pdf">CAT</a>) system. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden">Adverse</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015%E2%80%932016_SWIFT_banking_hack">scenarios</a> with government and bank systems have happened with serve consequences.</p>
<p>The original inventor may never come up with an exhaustive list of usage purposes or anticipate the possible repurpose of his/her technology. It is unjust to require AI firms to <i>&ldquo;establish comprehensive and explicit enumeration of AI systems&rsquo; context of business use and expectations.&rdquo; </i>&nbsp;Do not expect examiners to truly understand every bit of &ldquo;contextual factors may interact with AI lifecycle actions&rdquo;, for they are rule and law enforcers not technologists.&nbsp; Free enterprise should NOT be obligated to reveal the secret ingredient of their technologies, unless it is being identified with evidence for suspicious crime.</p>
<p>We agree with the NIST AI Risk Management Framework <a href="https://www.acc.com/sites/default/files/2024-08/2023.01.26-AI_RMF_Playbook.pdf">(NIST-AIRMF) Playbook</a> (page 63 - Map 1.4) where it said, <i>&ldquo;Socio-technical AI risks emerge from the interplay between technical development decisions and how a system is used, who operates it, and the social context into which it is deployed.&rdquo;</i> Yet, these are applicable to all technologies, not just AI. There are already a long list of US data / information security standards and technical safeguarding requirements, such as PCI DSS, GLBA, SOX DS 5.7, 5.8, 5.11, 11.6, HIPPA ePHI &sect;164.306, &sect;164.312, etc. Rights to revoke a user agreement with a standard provision, such as <i>&ldquo;no illicit or manipulative use of technology&rdquo;</i> may suffice.</p>
<p>The collective thoughts above lead us to recommend a revised definition of AI under 15 U.S.C. &sect; 9401(3) to preempt state AI laws, we suggest using the following or the like:</p>
<div>
<p><i>&ldquo;Covered AI technologies refer to cognitive systems (beyond learning from pairing a neutral stimulus that becomes a conditioned stimulus), comprise of memory AND topology of known lessons, that learn from regularities and irregularities of pattern(s) / knowns and unknowns / models/ simulations, AND </i></p>
<p><i>the system&rsquo;s internal process EITHER comprises of multi-steps reasoning (understand in a way that mimics humans; NOT merely extracting signals to generate alerts; NOT unconscious thinking) OR capable of generating datum uniquely different from a plagiarized copy, that </i></p>
<p><i>manipulates or presents at least an abstracted </i><i>phenomenon</i><i> (person or avatar, thing or computer-generated element, or real or virtual event that is hypothetical or observed to exist or happen in a distanced past, real-time, or irrespective of space-time) in a metaverse, real, or virtual environment </i></p>
<p><i>autonomously OR follow commands/ instructions, to generate expectations, make-believe, or assert that certain selected or perceived phenomenon is or will occur / available for use (regardless of the system internalizes, consumes, or makes feed(s) / datum available to its users in a domain, a dark web, or any iteration of the internet or intranet), AND </i></p>
<p><i>through action (including provision of customized or generic recommendation that reinforces, strengthen or weaken an ideology) OR inaction to stimulate the thought processes of at least an individual human OR the operations of a machine.&rdquo;</i></p>

<title>Iceboxes And Soapboxes: Remarks At The Meeting Of The SEC Investor Advisory Committee, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, Washington D.C., Dec. 4, 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good morning and thank you, Brian [Schorr]. And good morning to all of today&rsquo;s panelists and members of the Committee. Thank you for your participation in this last Investor Advisory Committee meeting of the year.</p>
<p>Before discussing today&rsquo;s agenda, I want to thank Cristina Martin Firvida&nbsp;whose dedication and passion for her job and commitment to investors has greatly benefited this Committee, the Commission, and investors. Today is Cristina&rsquo;s last IAC meeting as the Commission&rsquo;s Investor Advocate. Cristina has served as the Commission&rsquo;s second Investor Advocate for the last three years. I have enjoyed working with her and particularly have appreciated her willingness to brainstorm on any issue of concern to investors, even the hard ones that nobody else wants to discuss.</p>
<p>We are a week past Thanksgiving, and I am wondering if I will ever reclaim my refrigerator. Leftovers still occupy every shelf and have spilled into my backup refrigerator, aka my balcony. I am paying for my overly ambitious menu planning. Maybe if I had concentrated on making fewer dishes of higher quality, my guests would have eaten more, and I would not be eating mashed potatoes, stuffing, and cranberry sauce for breakfast for the foreseeable future. This experience got me thinking about corporate governance and shareholder engagement, which happen to be on the menu for our first panel today.</p>
<p>When it comes to shareholder engagement with corporations, some people seem to believe that more is always better and that quality does not matter. In this view, every shareholder deserves&mdash;as often as she likes&mdash;to have her concerns&mdash;as many as she has&mdash;aired on the corporate ballot, discussed in corporate boardrooms, and reflected in corporate budgets. But, as my former colleague Elad Roisman noted, &ldquo;While we all have a right to get on our soapboxes, we have no right to force others to pay for them.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-meeting-sec-investor-advisory-committee-120425#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Where the SEC has a role to play in shaping corporate governance, those rules should recognize both the benefits and the costs of shareholder engagement. Rules should provide avenues for shareholders to be heard when they speak to the mutual interests of the company and its shareholders writ large. On the other hand, rules should dissuade shareholders that seek to de-prioritize financial return as the sine qua non of corporate purpose. Amplifying those voices could drive companies into the treacherous terrain of catering to shareholders&rsquo; idiosyncratic objectives, which may undermine rather than enhance corporate value.</p>
<p>A well-calibrated ruleset gives shareholders a voice in proportion to their alignment with the corporation. Therefore, I support broad shareholder engagement by enabling all shareholders to enter standing proxy voting instructions. Mechanisms that facilitate shareholder voting make sense and may save the company money that would otherwise have been spent on drumming up votes to meet quorum requirements. I also supported the Commission&rsquo;s recent acknowledgment that mandatory arbitration provisions do not run afoul of the federal securities laws. Shareholder litigation&mdash;even when it is baseless&mdash;costs companies a lot of money and time, so some companies and their shareholders may prefer resolving their disputes through arbitration. The SEC should not override their preferences. Finally, eligibility to submit a shareholder proposal under Rule 14a-8 should be limited to shareholders whose interests align with those of the corporation. Otherwise, shareholders, to extract special interest concessions from the company, will submit shareholder proposals, which divert company time, attention, and resources.</p>
<p>The second panel is linked to the first because, among other benefits, tokenization could facilitate informed shareholder engagement by making it easier for companies to communicate with shareholders and for shareholders to vote. More generally, the tokenization of equity securities has the potential to transform how securities are issued, traded, and settled and empower investors by giving them more direct control over their assets. Investors will benefit from near-instantaneous settlement, reduced counterparty risk, enhanced transparency through immutable ledgers, and lower transaction costs.</p>
<p>At the same time, tokenization raises a host of interesting legal and policy questions. For example, tokenization models vary widely. On the one hand, issuer-sponsored securities issued directly on blockchain networks maintain full integration with master security holder files; they preserve traditional ownership rights while enabling direct ownership. Conversely, third-party sponsored tokens, depending on how they are structured, may provide synthetic exposure to an equity&rsquo;s price movements though derivative instruments, such as through tokenized structured notes or security-based swaps, but offer no ownership or voting interest in the issuer.</p>
<p>Additional questions arise because technologically savvy investors will be able to buy, sell, and hold assets without a traditional intermediary (or without any intermediary at all). Determining how to fit this activity into our rulebook, which is built around intermediaries, is challenging. Some rules may not be necessary to advance the regulatory objective they ostensibly serve given distributed ledger technology&rsquo;s ability to reduce certain risks and enhance transparency.</p>
<p>We do not have the luxury of time in tackling these questions. Tokenization of U.S. equities is already happening: Anybody can spin up a liquidity pool or launch a trading protocol that enables investors to get exposure to our equities markets. Only the quick, careful, and creative development of a workable regulatory framework for the issuance and trading of tokenized securities will provide American investors with the protections they have come to expect when trading U.S. equities. Otherwise, American investors will buy tokenized securities overseas. Commission staff is working on a tailored innovation exemption that would permit this activity in the United States, with strong investor protection guardrails, including Commission oversight.</p>
<p>As we embark on this important discussion, I encourage our panelists to consider several key questions that will help shape our path forward. These questions do not have easy answers, but addressing them thoughtfully will be essential as we work to create a regulatory framework that both protects investors and allows innovation to flourish.</p>
<ol>
<li>Are we adequately considering the full range of emerging tokenization models, and are there additional benefits or drawbacks the Commission should consider that are unique to certain models?</li>
<li>What are the broader implications for fundamental market mechanics like settlement processes and short selling?</li>
<li>What parts of our existing rulebook simply do not work for this emerging market structure? For instance, should Regulation NMS apply to tokenized equities in its current form?</li>
<li>How do we ensure interoperability across different blockchain networks while maintaining the market integrity on which investors depend?</li>
<li>What might an appropriately tailored innovation exemption look like? What type of activity should it permit? What conditions would be both necessary and workable?</li>
<li>Looking longer term, how can we build a regulatory framework that is fit for a future where intermediaries have less sway and investors exercise more autonomy as they move through our markets?</li>
</ol>
<p>Another captivating technology is the subject of the final discussion of the day: artificial intelligence (&ldquo;AI&rdquo;). The Committee will discuss a draft recommendation about public company disclosures related to AI.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-meeting-sec-investor-advisory-committee-120425#_ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;In some ways, the Committee&rsquo;s discussion is timely. AI has been a theme of 2025: eye-popping valuations of AI companies, hopes for AI&rsquo;s ability to increase productivity, questions about how AI will affect companies&rsquo; hiring needs, and fears about AI&rsquo;s ability to turbocharge cybercriminals. But, in other ways, today&rsquo;s discussion is just the latest iteration of the evergreen tug-of-war between principles-based rules and prescriptive rules responding to the hottest issue du jour. Principles-based disclosure rules allow companies to tell investors how&nbsp;<em>they</em>&nbsp;are approaching challenges and opportunities, while companies following prescriptive disclosure mandates merely fill in the blanks of the SEC&rsquo;s script.</p>
<p>I look forward to your discussion and have several questions for your consideration before you finalize the draft recommendation:</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>The draft recommendation laments that current disclosures related to AI are &ldquo;uneven and inconsistent&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-meeting-sec-investor-advisory-committee-120425#_ftn3">[3]</a>&nbsp;and that practices &ldquo;var[y] significantly among industries.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-meeting-sec-investor-advisory-committee-120425#_ftn4">[4]</a>&nbsp;But are such differences problematic? A small, recently-public company with only a handful of employees, for example, certainly has a different relationship with AI than mature, global companies with thousands of employees. If company and industry adoption of AI is not entirely homogenous why should our disclosure regime force conformity? Would any attempt to do so open the Commission up to critiques similar to those leveled against the SEC for its predictive data analytics proposal, which critics feared would chill advisers&rsquo; and broker-dealers&rsquo; use of AI and other technologies?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-meeting-sec-investor-advisory-committee-120425#_ftn5">[5]</a></li>
<li>Is this an area where prescriptive disclosure requirements would shape corporate behavior, which is not a proper role for merit-neutral SEC disclosure rules? For example, a requirement to disclose board oversight, if any, of AI implementation and utilization could nudge companies to set up a superfluous AI oversight function.</li>
<li>Why did the Committee include a materiality qualifier in only the third prong of the draft recommendation? Such a qualifier is entirely sensible here as it is with our existing disclosure rules. In fact, I would contend that absent a Congressional directive to the contrary, the SEC does not have the authority to mandate immaterial disclosure.</li>
<li>The Committee notes that participants from a prior panel held by the Committee agreed that the Commission should give guidance on the definition of AI so that &ldquo;issuers know whether they are using AI in the first place.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-meeting-sec-investor-advisory-committee-120425#_ftn6">[6]</a>&nbsp;Even if we draw on a definition drafted by another agency, why should the Commission attempt to define the limits of emerging technologies? Why not leave that task to the companies using the technologies?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you all once more for your willingness to dedicate so much of your time to the Investor Advisory Committee. Thank you also to Cristina Martin-Firvida, Marc Sharma, and Adam Moore for their work with the Committee.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) announced the launch of InnovateSafe, a regulatory sandbox designed to allow CIRO-regulated firms to safely test innovative products and technologies in a controlled environment with CIRO oversight.</p>
<p>As the financial industry continues to evolve rapidly, keeping pace with the change is crucial for CIRO to retain the trust of investors and the organizations and people it regulates. InnovateSafe reinforces CIRO&rsquo;s commitment to delivering efficient, effective regulation that responds to the evolving needs of investors, dealers, and markets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;InnovateSafe reflects CIRO&rsquo;s vision to be an agile and trusted regulator &ndash; helping the industry deliver the right financial outcomes for investors,&rdquo; said Alexandra Williams, Senior-Vice President, Strategy, Innovation and Stakeholder Protection. &ldquo;This initiative will ensure we are enabling innovation while keeping our mandate of investor protection and supporting fair and efficient markets at the forefront.&rdquo;</p>
<p>InnovateSafe will support CIRO-regulated firms in building compliant solutions that are ready for full market deployment by granting temporary approvals and, where warranted, targeted exemptive relief. The testing environment could help accelerate the adoption of transformative or novel products, services, ideas or technologies that could help position Canada as a global leader in financial innovation. InnovateSafe would also enable CIRO to gather essential evidence and insights needed to provide regulatory clarity in areas that have not been previously addressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By providing a controlled environment to responsibly test new products and technologies, we will also be able to collect real data needed to shape clearer and more complete regulatory positions on matters we haven&rsquo;t dealt with before,&rdquo; said Williams. &ldquo;This initiative will advance our ability to become a more data-driven regulator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>InnovateSafe will operate under CIRO oversight, with safeguards in place to protect investors. Approved projects will have mandatory reporting requirements throughout the testing period, which include reporting deviations from the test plan and unexpected outcomes.</p>
<p>Key metrics and performance data reported by participants will also enable CIRO to generate regulatory insights that will help it better understand risks and their implications, as well as shape future policy development and supervisory approaches.</p>
<p>More information on InnovateSafe, including how to apply and details on approved projects, will be available in the coming weeks on CIRO&rsquo;s website.</p>

<p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. It is a pleasure to join you for the fourth and final Investor Advisory Committee meeting of 2025. Before I share a few reflections, I must note that the views I express here today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the SEC as an institution or of the other Commissioners. Of course, I also want to thank each of you for the time, expertise, and spirited commitment that you brought to the Committee this year. Your work is essential&mdash;our markets prosper when investors have confidence that our rules are fair, our processes are predictable, and our regulators are not smothering innovation out of fear. I convey and share in the agency&rsquo;s appreciation for your dedicated service, and extend special thanks to Cristina Firvida, who will conclude her tenure as Investor Advocate at the end of January. Our work at the SEC should always be responsive to the needs and interests of investors, and Cristina has provided essential support in service of these objectives. Cristina, we wish you every success in your future endeavors and we thank you for the contributions that you have made to our agency and to investors as a whole.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am also grateful for the valuable insights that we heard during this morning&rsquo;s panel discussion regarding regulatory changes in corporate governance. One of my top priorities as Chairman is to make being a public company an attractive proposition for more firms&mdash; and I look forward to engaging in this important work over the coming months as we guide the SEC back to the bedrock fundamentals on which our mandate is based.</p>
<p>The next panel, meanwhile, will focus on how the Commission can modernize our rules to enable our markets to move on-chain. Distributed ledger technology and the tokenization of financial assets, including securities, have the potential to transform our capital markets. Our financial markets have long been the envy of the world, and to ensure that they remain so, U.S. firms and investors must have the opportunity to leverage this technology as they lead the future of global capital markets.</p>
<p>Today, our rules assume that securities are issued, traded, and managed through layers of intermediaries, which help to address risks like information asymmetry and operational friction. But as we consider the rise of public blockchains and tokenization, we must acknowledge that these technologies have the capacity to streamline not only trading but the entire issuer-investor relationship.</p>
<p>In other words, tokenization is not just about transforming how trades occur. It can also enable direct connectivity for proxy voting, dividend payments, and shareholder communications, reducing the need for multiple intermediaries in those processes as well. As we modernize our rules, we must consider the full scope of these changes, both in how markets trade and in how security ownership is recorded and serviced. I welcome the IAC&rsquo;s assistance in helping us think through how to respond appropriately to these innovations.</p>
<p>As with any technological shift, market participants are experimenting with different tokenization models, and I am interested to hear the panel&rsquo;s thoughts about the implications of these approaches. Several models may warrant discussion. First, some companies are issuing equity directly on public distributed ledgers in the form of programmable assets that, in some cases, have the ability to embed compliance, voting rights, and other governance functions. This path allows investors to hold a security in digital format, with fewer intermediaries and more transparency.</p>
<p>Second, third parties are tokenizing equities by creating on-chain security entitlements, which represent ownership interests in equities that exist off-chain.</p>
<p>Third, we are seeing synthetic exposures&mdash;tokenized products that seek to mirror public equity performance. While today the offer and sale of these products are proliferating offshore, they illustrate the global demand for U.S. market exposure built on distributed ledger-powered infrastructure.</p>
<p>Of course, the shift to on-chain capital markets requires more than just issuance. We must also tackle other stages in the securities transaction lifecycle. For example, tokenized shares risk becoming nothing more than conversation pieces if their owners cannot trade them competitively in liquid on-chain environments. But making this possible requires the Commission to think carefully about how our regulatory mandate intersects with technological realities. Furthermore, issuers should be at the center of the discussion to help ensure that these new systems work effectively and align with the overarching goals of transparency and investor protection.</p>
<p>The previous Commission attempted to address on-chain markets through a brute-force redefinition of &ldquo;exchange&rdquo; to include even basic &ldquo;communication protocols,&rdquo; and then subjecting whatever was captured by that new definition to the full panoply of our regulatory framework for exchanges. That approach lacked limiting principles, expanded the SEC&rsquo;s reach beyond what Congress intended, and ultimately created uncertainty that chilled innovation.</p>
<p>We must not repeat that mistake. If we want to boost innovation, investment, and jobs here in the United States, we must provide compliant pathways that allow market participants to leverage the unique capabilities of this new technology. That is why I have asked staff to recommend to the Commission ways in which we can use our exemptive authorities to allow for on-chain innovation while we continue to work on long-term, durable rules of the road.</p>
<p>Congress has given the SEC broad exemptive authorities under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, and we must use these authorities responsibly. A thoughtful exemptive framework&mdash;cabined, time limited, transparent, and anchored in strong investor protections&mdash;could allow the markets to develop on-chain models and give investors innovative new choices. And, drawing on input from market participants, we will be able to craft rules that distinguish between truly decentralized finance and the wide spectrum of centralized, on-chain finance in existence today.</p>
<p>A durable rulebook must recognize this spectrum without forcing square pegs into round holes. If we attempt to regulate decentralized protocols as if they were centralized brokers, we will undermine the very innovation that makes them resilient and transparent. But if we allow centralized intermediaries to benefit from regulatory arbitrage just because they operate on-chain, we erode the principles of accountability and investor protection that have contributed to our global market dominance. Our task, as well as our responsibility, is to write rules that match functional reality. I look forward to working with my counterparts across the Administration in the coming years to do just that.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s role is not to resist the market&rsquo;s transition to on-chain capital markets, nor to force it into legacy definitions, nor to push innovators offshore. Rather, it is to allow market participants to operate and innovate subject to clear guardrails that protect the public, ensuring that U.S. markets remain the most dynamic, transparent, and trusted in the world. If we stay true to this course, we can ensure that the United States leads&mdash;not follows&mdash;in the next chapter of capital markets innovation.</p>
<p>Finally, just as tokenization represents one evolution in our markets, so does the subject of the recommendation that the Committee will be considering today. The advent of artificial intelligence promises to transform workflows and business models. Yet with every emerging development, the question for the SEC to consider is not necessarily its novelty, but whether our existing disclosure framework sufficiently provides investors with material information about it. And on that point, I believe that investors can rely on our current principles-based rules to inform them of how AI impacts companies.</p>
<p>Indeed, we should resist the temptation to adopt prescriptive disclosure requirements for every &ldquo;new thing&rdquo; that affects a business. Our principles-based rules were intentionally designed to allow companies to inform investors of material impacts of any new development, including how AI affects their financial results, how AI can be a material risk factor to an investment, and how AI is a material aspect of their business model. These rules have stood the test of time because they rely on the fundamental principle of materiality rather than on ever-expanding checklists.</p>
<p>As we consider these topics together, I am grateful once again for the rigor and thoughtfulness that you bring to every Investor Advisory Committee meeting. Your collective expertise makes this Committee an indispensable partner in safeguarding investors and strengthening our markets. So, thank you all for your time and engagement today. I look forward to the discussions ahead.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The FINRA Investor Education Foundation (FINRA Foundation) released today new research<a>,&nbsp;</a><a href="https://www.finrafoundation.org/sites/finrafoundation/files/2025-11/NFCS_Investor_Survey_Report_White_Paper.pdf?utm_source=shared&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=nfcsinvestor24" target="_blank">Investors in the United States: Results from the FINRA Foundation&rsquo;s National Financial Capability Study</a>, which offers insights into the attitudes, behaviors, knowledge and experiences of retail investors in the U.S.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The latest FINRA Foundation research on investors provides rich insights into how market conditions, technology and generational shifts are changing the profile of investing and reshaping investor behaviors and attitudes,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/about/governance/executives#econ">Jonathan Sokobin, FINRA Foundation Chair and Chief Economist at FINRA</a>. &ldquo;This research can serve as a roadmap and essential resource for policymakers, researchers, educators, firms and financial professionals as they continue their efforts to help educate and protect investors.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.finra.org/about/executives/gerri-walsh">FINRA Foundation President Gerri Walsh</a>&nbsp;noted that the findings point to the needs of younger, less experienced investors. &ldquo;They still struggle with gaps in investing knowledge and risk assessment, which can leave them vulnerable to costly missteps,&rdquo; Walsh said. &ldquo;Investor education efforts remain critically important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The findings are drawn from the investor survey component of the FINRA Foundation&rsquo;s latest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/media-center/newsreleases/2025/finra-foundation-releases-sixth-wave-national-financial-capability">National Financial Capability Study</a>&nbsp;(NFCS), including a total of 2,861 respondents in the U.S. with non-retirement investment accounts. The report builds on previous NFCS Investor Survey reports (conducted in 2021, 2018 and 2015), and includes new or expanded topics, such as attitudes towards risk, reliance on finfluencers and awareness of investment fraud.</p>
<p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New investors.</strong>&nbsp;The pace at which new investors are entering the market has declined significantly. In the 2024 NFCS, 8% of investors reported beginning to invest within the last two years&mdash;a sharp drop from the 21% who began investing in the two years preceding the 2021 NFCS.</li>
<li><strong>Investor characteristics.</strong>&nbsp;While the overall proportion of U.S. adults with investments held outside of retirement accounts did not materially change from 2021, fewer young adults (21% vs. 26% in 2021), men (40% vs. 43% in 2021), and persons of color (29% vs. 36% in 2021) reported owning non-retirement investments in 2024, largely erasing the gains made in the prior wave.</li>
<li><strong>Risk attitudes.</strong>&nbsp;The proportion of those willing to take substantial risks in their investment portfolios declined to just 8% in 2024 from 12% in 2021. Among investors under 35, those willing to take substantial risk dropped to 15% from 24%. Despite this, over one-third of investors (34%) feel they need to take big risks to reach their financial goals, including 62% of investors under 35.</li>
<li><strong>Risk-taking.</strong>&nbsp;Compared to older investors, those under 35 are more likely to engage in investment behaviors that can carry greater risk, including trading options (43% vs. 10% of those 55 and older) and making purchases on margin (22% vs. 4% of those 55 and older).</li>
<li><strong>Social media.</strong>&nbsp;Twenty-nine percent of investors report relying on social media as an information source. When asked separately about the social channels they use for investing information, YouTube emerged as the most popular, used by 30% of respondents overall and 61% of those under 35.</li>
<li><strong>Finfluencers.</strong>&nbsp;Over a quarter of investors (26%) use recommendations from social media influencers when making investment decisions, including 61% of those under 35 and 57% of those with less than two years of investing experience.</li>
<li><strong>Meme stock popularity.</strong>&nbsp;Thirteen percent of investors report buying meme stocks or other viral investments, including nearly one-third (29%) of investors under 35.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto interest</strong>.&nbsp;While the percentage investing in cryptocurrency in 2024 did not change from 2021 (27%), fewer investors reported considering cryptocurrency investments (either purchasing more or for the first time), dropping to 26% in 2024 from 33% in 2021.</li>
<li><strong>Investment information sources.</strong>&nbsp;The most commonly used sources of investment information are research and tools provided by brokerage firms (75%), recommendations from financial professionals (69%), business and finance articles (67%), and word of mouth from friends/family/colleagues (65%).</li>
<li><strong>Investment fraud.</strong>&nbsp;Concern over investment fraud has increased somewhat. Thirty-seven percent of investors are worried about losing money due to investment fraud, up from 31% in 2021. Still, the vast majority (89%) do not believe they have been targeted in an investment scam.</li>
<li><strong>Low investing knowledge.</strong>&nbsp;On average, respondents answered slightly less than half of the investing quiz questions correctly (5.3 out of 11 questions). Questions about margin and short selling had the most incorrect answers, with over half of respondents answering each incorrectly (55% and 54%, respectively). Notably, 75% of those who actually make purchases on margin incorrectly answered the margin question.</li>
</ul>

<title>Acting CFTC Chairman Pham Announces First-Ever Listed Spot Crypto Trading On U.S. Regulated Exchanges - Federally Regulated Spot Crypto Markets Open A New Golden Age For Innovation In America</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Commodity Futures Trading Commission Acting Chairman Caroline D. Pham today announced that listed spot cryptocurrency products will begin trading for the first time in U.S. federally regulated markets on CFTC registered futures exchanges. The announcement marks a significant step forward in the Trump Administration&rsquo;s pledge to usher in a Golden Age of Innovation and make America the &ldquo;crypto capital of the world.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;The CFTC has a rich history of welcoming responsible innovation on futures exchanges by balancing regulatory flexibility with core principles that safeguard both institutional and retail traders. Thanks to President Trump&rsquo;s leadership, this Administration has developed a comprehensive all-of-government plan for America to reclaim its place as the world leader in digital asset markets, and the CFTC has a central role to play,&rdquo; Acting Chairman Pham said. &ldquo;Recent events on offshore exchanges have shown us how essential it is for Americans to have more choice and access to safe, regulated U.S. markets. Now, for the first time ever, spot crypto can trade on CFTC-registered exchanges that have been the gold standard for nearly a hundred years, with the customer protections and market integrity that Americans deserve.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Fifteen years ago, Congress passed important reforms to strengthen U.S. markets after the great financial crisis, including the requirement that leveraged retail commodity trading can only occur on futures exchanges. But the CFTC never implemented this critical customer protection reform by providing regulatory clarity on how to list these retail exchange traded products despite years of market demand. Instead, the CFTC chose regulation by enforcement rather than making clear rules of the road, resulting in huge fines that targeted the crypto industry but did not protect the retail public by giving them a safe place to trade.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Under my leadership this year, the CFTC is finally using our decades-long existing authority to work smarter and faster to protect Americans who deserve safe U.S. markets now, not offshore exchanges that lack basic safeguards against uncontrolled customer losses. This historic milestone implements recommendations from the President&rsquo;s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets with months of public engagement and the expert input of stakeholders, CFTC staff and other regulators.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Today&rsquo;s announcement follows&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/crypto/">recommendations</a><span>&nbsp;by the President&rsquo;s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/9105-25">stakeholder insights</a><span>&nbsp;from the CFTC&rsquo;s&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/9104-25">Crypto Sprint</a><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/cftcsecjointcryptostatement090225">cooperative engagement</a><span>&nbsp;with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Crypto Sprint also&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/9109-25">launched public consultations</a><span>&nbsp;on all other recommendations from the President&rsquo;s Working Group report relevant to the CFTC. Other components to the Crypto Sprint include&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/9130-25">enabling tokenized collateral</a><span>, including stablecoins, in derivatives markets and a rulemaking to make technical amendments to the CFTC&rsquo;s regulations for collateral, margin, clearing, settlement, reporting, and recordkeeping to enable the use of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opapham19">blockchain technology</a><span>&nbsp;and market infrastructure including tokenization in our markets.</span></p>

<title>ESMA Welcomes Commission’s Ambitious Proposal On Market Integration</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/esma-welcomes-commissions-ambitious-proposal-on-market-integration-2025124/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/esma-welcomes-commissions-ambitious-proposal-on-market-integration-2025124/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, welcomes the&nbsp;<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_2893">European Commission&rsquo;s legislative proposal on market integration and supervision</a>&nbsp;published today. The package represents a major step towards deeper and more efficient EU capital markets and reflects many of the recommendations set out in ESMA&rsquo;s 2024 Position Paper on building more effective and attractive capital markets in the EU.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The proposal directly addresses fragmentation stemming from divergent national rules and supervisory practices. By removing barriers in trading, post-trading and asset management, and by enabling more harmonised supervision, the package will help market participants operate more seamlessly across the Single Market and support scale, efficiency and better outcomes for investors and businesses. We also welcome the strong focus on streamlining regulatory requirements, reducing administrative burden, and facilitating innovation.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>All of this will enhance the competitiveness and agility of EU capital markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A key element of the package is the proposed transfer of direct supervision of certain significant cross-border infrastructures and crypto-asset service providers to the EU level. ESMA stands ready to take on these specific responsibilities, drawing on almost 15 years of growing experience supervising diverse and selective parts of our capital markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This proposal represents a shift in supervision for a limited subset of our capital markets, in which ESMA would work hand in hand with the National Competent Authorities (NCAs) to develop the capacity and expertise to take on such new responsibilities. At the same time, for the broader market that remains under national supervision, coordinating supervisory standards and achieving aligned outcomes across the EU remains a key priority. This would be reinforced for example by giving ESMA an enhanced convergence role for large cross-border asset management groups.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s proposal forms a central pillar of the Commission&rsquo;s Savings and Investments Union (SIU) strategy. ESMA looks forward to working with the co-legislators as they advance this important initiative to build deeper and more integrated EU capital markets.</p>

<p>Eurex&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Europe&rsquo;s leading derivatives exchange and, together with Eurex Clearing, one of the world&rsquo;s&nbsp;leading&nbsp;central counterparties&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;reported lower trading volumes in November amid a general slowdown in market activity. The exchange handled 146.1 million contracts during the&nbsp;month,&nbsp;an 18 percent drop from the 177.6 million contracts&nbsp;traded&nbsp;a year earlier. Interest rate derivatives were down 16 percent year-on-year to 70.5 million contracts. Equity derivatives declined 11 percent to 28.3 million contracts, while index derivatives decreased 21 percent to 47.0 million contracts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>OTC Clearing&nbsp;recorded robust growth in&nbsp;November,&nbsp;with notional outstanding volumes rising 33 percent year-on-year to EUR 46,573 billion, up from EUR 34,922 billion in November 2024. The increase was led by overnight index swaps, which surged 57 percent to EUR 6,611 billion. Interest rate swaps also contributed significantly, climbing 29 percent to EUR 20,197 billion.</p>
<p>Eurex Repo, Eurex&rsquo;s leading electronic market for secured funding and financing,&nbsp;delivered another strong result in November 2025. Average term-adjusted volumes increased by 51 percent&nbsp;year-on-year, reaching EUR 525.4&nbsp;billion. Growth was driven primarily by the GC Pooling segment, which rose 49 percent, while the Repo Market segment also saw a solid expansion of 54 percent. The month&rsquo;s standout achievement was a new record in daily trading volume on 28 November 2025, coming in&nbsp;roughly 66 percent above the average daily level.</p>

<li><span>FTSE Russell publishes results of eighth annual sustainable investment (SI) asset owner survey&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Financial performance and risk management are cited as the key motivating factors for SI by the majority of asset owners<br /></span></li>
<li><span>Thematic investment and ESG integration remain the most popular SI approaches<br /></span></li>

<div class="VerticalSpacing VerticalSpacing--l">
<div class="RichText   ">
<p>FTSE Russell, the global index provider, today published the findings from its eighth annual asset owner&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lseg.com/en/ftse-russell/sustainable-investing-solutions/global-asset-owner-survey">survey</a>, analysing how sustainable investment (SI) is perceived, considered and used by asset owners across the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sustainability considerations remain firmly embedded in investment strategies, with 73% of asset owners implementing sustainable investment approaches to their portfolios, a figure that has remained largely unchanged since 2023. However, asset owners are increasingly concerned with the investment impact posed by climate risk, with 85% of respondents ranking this as a major concern, up from 76% last year. While climate remains the primary focus, other sustainability factors such as diversity and inclusion and human rights are also ranked highly.</p>
<p><span>Stephanie Maier, Global Head of Sustainable, FTSE Russell, said:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Global asset owners&rsquo; commitment to integrating sustainability considerations remains steady. Against a backdrop of geopolitical headwinds, investor concerns regarding climate and broader sustainability risks continue to intensify and the focus on financial performance remains a central priority. This shift signals that sustainable investment is becoming a core component of fiduciary responsibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The survey, which gathered insights from 415 asset owners across 24 countries, also shows that financial performance (56%) and risk management (54%) have become the leading motivations for sustainable investment. More than half of respondents believe these strategies help mitigate long-term risk and deliver better risk-adjusted returns, while fiduciary duty (42% in 2025 compared to 14% in 2024) is increasingly cited as a driver. In contrast, societal good is now a secondary consideration for many asset owners (37%).</p>
<p>Implementation approaches remain diverse. Thematic investing (60%) and ESG integration (61%) continue to be the most popular strategies, while engagement is gaining traction as investors seek to support transition towards low-carbon business models rather than divest from carbon-intensive assets.</p>
<p>While one in four (23%) asset owners are still evaluating whether to implement sustainable investment strategies, barriers such as greenwashing concerns and the availability and accuracy of ESG data were listed as issues to adoption. In addition, 60% of respondents cited different disclosure requirements and taxonomies as challenges to meeting regulatory requirements, and 61% cited an inability to align portfolios or indices with the sustainable investment or climate requirements set out by regulators.<br /><br />Download the full report here:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lseg.com/en/ftse-russell/sustainable-investing-solutions/global-asset-owner-survey">FTSE Russell - Sustainable Investment Asset Owner Survey 2025</a></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Digital Asset, the creator of the Canton Network and a leader in privacy-enabled blockchain technology for global financial markets, today announced a new strategic investment from&nbsp;<b>BNY</b>,&nbsp;<b>iCapital</b>,&nbsp;<b>Nasdaq</b>, and&nbsp;<b>S&amp;P Global</b>. Their participation reflects the accelerating convergence of traditional finance (TradFi) and&nbsp;<span>decentralized</span>&nbsp;finance (<span>DeFi</span>) towards an "AllFi" future on the Canton Network.</p>
<p>These investments build on Digital Asset's strong momentum following recent funding milestones and underscore the growing institutional alignment behind the Canton Network&ndash; the only public, permissionless Layer-1 blockchain designed with configurable privacy, institutional-grade compliance, and the ability to support hundreds of billions of dollars in onchain real-world assets.</p>
<p>The new strategic partners represent leading global institutions in asset servicing, wealth management, market infrastructure, financial data, financial technology, and&nbsp;<span>digital asset</span>&nbsp;trading. Their investment reinforces the critical role Canton is playing in the next phase of financial market infrastructure, bringing together decentralization with the privacy, legal certainty, and regulatory compliance required by global markets.</p>
<p>Today, the Canton Network underpins a diverse and rapidly expanding set of use cases, including bonds, equities, money market funds, alternative investment funds, commodities, repos, mortgages, life insurance, and annuities. With more than $6 trillion of assets onchain, over 600 institutions now participate across the Canton ecosystem, including global leaders in both traditional and&nbsp;<span>decentralized</span>&nbsp;finance.</p>
<p><b>Yuval Rooz, CEO of Digital Asset:</b><br class="dnr" />"Institutions across the financial ecosystem recognize the necessity of blockchain infrastructure purpose-built for regulated markets. The addition of BNY, iCapital, S&amp;P Global, and Nasdaq marks another milestone in the evolution of both Digital Asset and Canton. Their participation reinforces the inevitability of interoperable, privacy-enabled markets operating at global scale. We look forward to deepening our collaboration as we continue to transform how onchain real-world assets move, settle, and interconnect."</p>
<p><b>Brian Ruane, Head of Global Clearing, Credit Services &amp; Corporate Trust, BNY:<br class="dnr" /></b>"As capital markets move faster towards a real-time, always-on operating model, the development of financial infrastructure that seamlessly connects digital and traditional markets has never been more important. We're excited to work with Digital Asset and Canton to continue advancing privacy-enabled and interoperable settlement solutions at institutional scale. This investment reflects our commitment to reimagining a faster and more efficient future for financial market infrastructure."</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Calcano, Chairman and CEO, iCapital:</b><br class="dnr" />"By investing in Digital Assets, the leader in blockchain innovation, iCapital is reinforcing its commitment to building next-generation financial infrastructure. By combining our expertise in private markets and proven technology with Canton's blockchain platform, we are establishing the foundation for&nbsp;<span>tokenization</span>&nbsp;of alternatives&mdash;driving efficiency, transparency, and broader access across the investment ecosystem."</p>
<p><b>Tal Cohen, President of Nasdaq:<a class="ticket-symbol" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/digital-asset-announces-strategic-investments-from-bny-icapital-nasdaq-and-sp-global-302632617.html#financial-modal"></a></b><br class="dnr" />"We're excited to deepen our relationship with Digital Asset and the Canton Network as we continue building the next generation of institutional market infrastructure. This investment builds on the work we've already done together to modernize post-trade and collateral workflows, and positions us to accelerate adoption of interoperable, tokenized solutions across the global capital markets. By combining Nasdaq's markets and infrastructure expertise with Digital Asset's technology, we can help our clients unlock new efficiencies, better manage risk, and confidently participate in the evolving digital asset ecosystem."</p>
<p><b>Swati Sawjiany, Global Head of Enterprise Strategy, M&amp;A and Investments, S&amp;P Global:<br class="dnr" /></b>"The accelerated convergence of off-chain and on-chain financial markets underscores the importance of trusted market data, industry-leading benchmarks, and risk assessments as critical enablers in the transformation of market infrastructure. Digital Asset Holdings has played a central role in building a public blockchain capable of supporting the privacy and compliance demands of financial institutions. We are excited to join this round and see opportunity to collaborate with Canton and network participants to enhance transparency, integrity, and insight to digital markets."</p>

<title>DTCC And EY Share Insights On 24x5 Equity Trading, Revealing Up To 10% Of Total Equity Volume Projected To Be Traded During Overnight Sessions By 2028</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/dtcc-and-ey-share-insights-on-24x5-equity-trading-revealing-up-to-10-of-total-2025124/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/dtcc-and-ey-share-insights-on-24x5-equity-trading-revealing-up-to-10-of-total-2025124/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>DTCC, the premier market infrastructure for the global financial services industry, and Ernst &amp; Young LLP (EY US) today announced the publication of their research findings on 24x5 trading, titled &ldquo;<a href="https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/Transformation/theshiftto24x5trading.pdf" target="_blank">The Shift to 24x5 Trading: What It Means for U.S. Equity Markets.</a>&rdquo; The report details the industry&rsquo;s transition toward near-continuous trading, operational and risk implications, and strategic considerations for market participants in preparation for the change.</p>
<p>Key findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Impact to volumes:</span>&nbsp;Most surveyed firms expect overnight trading volumes to gradually rise. By 2028, 1%&ndash;10% of total equity volume is projected to be traded during the overnight sessions, boosting global market access.</li>
<li><span>Retail and institutional participation:</span>&nbsp;Retail investors are expected to initially drive overnight trading, with institutional participation assumed to rise during market stress and as infrastructure develops. Over half of survey respondents foresee greater institutional activity in volatile periods.</li>
<li><span>Market harmonization and safeguards:</span>&nbsp;Extending trading hours requires aligning market safeguards, such as circuit breakers and surveillance, and updating SIP data feeds to a 24x5 model for real-time accuracy and market stability.</li>
<li><span>Risk, margin, and liquidity:</span>&nbsp;Extended hours add complexity to risk, margin, and liquidity management. Almost 60% of firms plan technology and risk upgrades.</li>
</ul>
<p>Global demand, especially from APAC investors, and regulatory permissibility are key drivers for the move to 24x5 equity trading. The convergence of securities and crypto brokerages is also influencing expectations for near continuous access. Firms are encouraged to assess their readiness, participate in industry forums, enhance risk management and operational capabilities, and critically evaluate their global footprint and vendor dependencies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As interest in near round-the-clock trading of U.S. equities grows, we are meeting this demand by extending our clearing hours to support our clients and further strengthen the safety and soundness of the markets,&rdquo; said Val Wotton, DTCC&rsquo;s Managing Director and Global Head of Equities Solutions. &ldquo;DTCC is committed to leading large-scale, industry-wide initiatives that deliver positive change for the industry and the investing public. We look forward to continuing to work collaboratively across the industry towards a successful implementation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Extending trading hours represents a significant step for U.S. equity markets, aligning market structure with the expectations of an increasingly global, always-on investor base,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ey.com/en_us/people/mark-nichols">Mark Nichols, Principal and Capital Markets Strategy &amp; Market Structure Leader, EY US</a>. &ldquo;Through this collaboration with DTCC, we aim to equip market participants with clear, actionable insights on navigating the complex firmwide implications and operating model considerations of a 24x5 trading environment &mdash; helping the industry collectively build a more accessible and resilient marketplace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In March 2025,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dtcc.com/news/2025/march/18/dtccs-nscc-to-increase-clearing-hours-to-support-extended-trading" target="_blank">DTCC announced NSCC&rsquo;s plans</a>&nbsp;to extend clearing hours to support 24x5 trading, from Sunday at 8:00 PM ET to Friday at 8:00 PM ET, targeted for implementation in Q2 2026.</p>
<p><span>The full white paper is available for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/Transformation/theshiftto24x5trading.pdf" target="_blank">download</a>&nbsp;at DTCC&rsquo;s website.</span></p>
<p><span>Research Methodology</span><br /><span>In support of this paper, DTCC surveyed 95 participants from 84 firms, including 72 NSCC members.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Tradeweb Markets Inc. (Nasdaq: TW), a leading, global operator of electronic marketplaces for rates, credit, equities and money markets, today reported total trading volume for the month of November 2025 of $56.8 trillion (tn). Average daily volume (ADV) for the month was $2.9tn, an increase of 22.3 percent (%) year-over-year (YoY).</p>
<h4><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Record Highlights:</span></strong></h4>
<p>For<strong>&nbsp;</strong>November of 2025, Tradeweb records included:</p>
<ul>
<li>ADV in European government bonds</li>
<li>ADV in rates futures</li>
<li>ADV in repurchase agreements (repo)</li>
<li>ADV in other money markets</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">November 2025 Highlights</span></strong></h4>
<h5><span><span>Rates</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h5>
<ul>
<li>U.S. government bond ADV was up 2.7% YoY at $252.7 billion (bn). European government bond ADV was up 33.1% YoY to $70.7bn.  
<ul>
<li>U.S. government bond ADV was led by strong growth in the institutional client channel, which achieved a record. Record European government bond ADV was driven by strong volumes across our institutional and wholesale client channels. Strong activity in the U.S. and Europe was supported by an increased number of clients trading across a diverse set of trading protocols.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mortgage ADV was up 2% YoY to $277.2bn.  
<ul>
<li>The increase in To-Be-Announced (TBA) activity was primarily driven by heightened trading from real-money accounts and increased participation from mortgage originators. Tradeweb&rsquo;s specified pool platform reported strong volumes driven by expanding client and dealer adoption, setting another monthly record for the total number of accounts on the platform.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Swaps/swaptions &ge; 1-year ADV was up 4% YoY to $495.7bn and total rates derivatives ADV was up 41.5% YoY to $1.1tn.  
<ul>
<li>Swaps/swaptions &ge; 1-year saw a strong increase in risk trading activity YoY driven by continued uncertainty around central bank policy and pending rate cuts, as well as a 10% YoY increase in compression activity, which carries a relatively lower fee per million (FPM). 4Q25 to-date compression activity as a percentage of swaps/swaptions &ge; 1-year is trending higher than 3Q25.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5><span><span>Credit</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h5>
<ul>
<li>Fully electronic U.S. credit ADV was up 9% YoY to $8.5bn and European credit ADV was up 16.5% YoY to $2.9bn.  
<ul>
<li>U.S. credit volumes were driven by increased client adoption of Tradeweb protocols, most notably in request-for-quote (RFQ), Portfolio Trading (PT), and Tradeweb AllTrade&reg;. Tradeweb captured 17.1% and 8.4% share of fully electronic U.S. high grade and U.S. high yield TRACE, respectively, as measured by Tradeweb. We also reported 24.5% total share of U.S. high grade TRACE and 10.2% total share of U.S. high yield TRACE. European credit volumes were driven by continued adoption of Tradeweb&rsquo;s Automated Intelligent Execution (AiEX) tool, which saw record activity in November. Cash credit PT ADV increased by 5% YoY, with non-comp PT ADV down 10% YoY. PT carries a relatively lower FPM as compared to the broader cash credit average, with non-comp PT carrying a lower FPM than PT overall.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Municipal bonds ADV was up 17.4% YoY to $480 million (mm).</li>
<li>Municipal bonds reported strong growth across the retail and institutional platforms, outpacing the broader market, which remained flat<sup>1</sup></li>
<li>Credit derivatives ADV was up 46.5% YoY to&nbsp;$19.8bn.  
<ul>
<li>Increased hedge fund and systematic account activity YoY, along with heightened credit volatility, led to increased swap execution facility (SEF) and multilateral trading facility (MTF) credit default swaps activity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5><span><span>Equities</span></span><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>U.S. ETF ADV was up 32.2% YoY to $11.3bn and International ETF ADV was down 0.2% YoY to $3.3bn.  
<ul>
<li>U.S. ETFs reported strong growth YoY on the institutional and wholesale platforms. On the institutional platform, adoption of our automated rules-based RFQ protocol continued to grow, accompanied by an expanding client base. On the wholesale side, our client base also expanded and we saw higher market volatility YoY.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong><span>Money Markets&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Repo ADV was up 17.9% YoY to $828.4bn.  
<ul>
<li>Record global repo trading activity was supported by increased client participation across the platform. In the U.S., strong growth was driven by the effects of the Fed&rsquo;s balance sheet unwind. Additionally, balances in the Fed&rsquo;s reverse repo facility (RRP) remained close to zero for a majority of the month. In Europe, strong activity continued despite ongoing central bank balance sheet reduction putting some mild upward pressure on European funding levels.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Money Markets ADV was up 0.7% YoY to $304.4bn.  
<ul>
<li>Record other money markets activity was driven by record ICD money market fund balances, aided by recent debt issuance from several large clients that replenished liquidity after periods of elevated capex, share buybacks, and dividend activity had reduced cash earlier in the year, alongside addition from new clients.</li>
</ul>

<div class="text-highlight">
<ul class="rte--list">
<li>Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group and Kraken (Payward Inc.) are joining forces combining regulated infrastructure with crypto-native expertise to deliver frictionless institutional access.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The partnership encompasses regulated crypto, tokenized markets and derivatives, as well as enhanced liquidity for institutional clients across geographies.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row-with-picture">
<div class="detailText">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Kraken, one of the world&rsquo;s longest-standing, most liquid and secure cryptocurrency platforms, and Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group, one of the world&rsquo;s leading financial market infrastructures, today announced a strategic partnership to create unified access across traditional and digital asset markets.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Effective immediately, the two firms will leverage their complementary capabilities to bridge traditional financial markets and the digital asset economy. Spanning trading, custody, settlement, collateral management, and tokenized assets, the partnership will unlock a new range of enhanced products and services that deliver frictionless access to both ecosystems, creating a holistic experience for institutional clients.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the first phase of the partnership, Kraken will integrate directly with 360T, a Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group subsidiary and one of the world&rsquo;s largest foreign-exchange trading venues. The integration will give Kraken clients access to competitive, bank-grade FX liquidity through one of the deepest global liquidity pools available, significantly improving fiat on- and off-ramp efficiency while ensuring institutional-grade execution and reliability.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The partnership will also leverage Kraken Embed to expand institutional crypto access across Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group&rsquo;s network. Together, the companies will develop advanced white-label solutions enabling banks, fintechs, and other financial institutions to offer secure, compliant crypto trading and custody services to clients across Europe and the U.S.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Subject to regulatory approvals, the two companies plan to make Eurex-listed derivatives available to trade on Kraken, broadening access to Europe&rsquo;s largest regulated futures and options marketplace. The collaboration will also allow Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group clients to trade cryptocurrencies and derivatives via Crypto Finance, as well as through Kraken&rsquo;s exchange, to service enhanced end-client models, while leveraging Clearstream and Crypto Finance, both Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group subsidiaries, for custody.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Kraken and Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group will also work together to integrate xStocks within 360X&rsquo;s ecosystem, significantly expanding the reach of one of the most widely adopted tokenized equity standards globally. In addition, Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group and Kraken will work to enable the distribution of securities held in custody at Clearstream in a tokenized form to Kraken&rsquo;s client base.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The partnership also establishes a framework for geographical access: Kraken will offer its U.S. capabilities to Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group&rsquo;s institutional clients seeking exposure to crypto and tokenized assets, while Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group will provide its European infrastructure and services to Kraken&rsquo;s global client base. This two-way integration underscores the shared vision to connect traditional and digital markets seamlessly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>&ldquo;Our partnership with Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group demonstrates what happens when two infrastructures designed for scale and trust intersect,&rdquo; said Arjun Sethi, Co-CEO of Kraken. &ldquo;By linking traditional and digital markets across a wide range of asset classes, we&rsquo;re building a holistic foundation for the next generation of financial innovation: defined by efficiency, openness, and client access.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Stephan Leithner, CEO of Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group emphasized: &ldquo;This collaboration with Kraken is a great strategic fit for Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group. It underscores our ongoing commitment to shaping the future of financial markets by combining the trust and resilience of our regulated infrastructure with the innovation of the digital asset ecosystem. Across our entire value chain this partnership will further enhance our support for institutional clients in the digital asset era and pave the way for digital capital markets.&rdquo;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, and home to the world&rsquo;s most liquid energy and environmental markets, today announced that the UK Department for Energy Security &amp; Net Zero (DESNZ) has re-appointed ICE to host UK Allowance (UKA) auctions for the UK's Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) through 2028.</p>
<p>In addition, ICE has published the 2026 UKA auction calendar here:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ice.com/emissions/auctions/uk-emission-allowances" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">www.ice.com/emissions/auctions/uk-emission-allowances</a>.</p>
<p>ICE has hosted carbon auctions on behalf of the UK Government since 2012. ICE conducted Phase III EUA auctions on behalf of the UK Government from 2012 to 2021 and has conducted UKA auctions on behalf of the UK Government since the UK emissions trading scheme began in 2021.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Market-based mechanisms like carbon cap and trade programs are critical in allowing policy makers to control the quantity of carbon to align with their environmental commitments, price emissions and decarbonise in the most cost-effective way,&rdquo; said Gordon Bennett, Managing Director of Utility Markets at ICE. &ldquo;The UK ETS is a successful, market driven program and we are pleased to continue to host carbon auctions on behalf of the UK Government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>UKAs are one part of ICE&rsquo;s global environmental markets where ICE has been a leader for over two decades, offering the most liquid futures markets to trade emission allowances under the EU Emissions Trading System, California Cap and Trade Program, Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and the Washington Cap and Invest Program.</p>
<p>To take part in UKA auctions, please contact:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:sales-environmental@ice.com" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">sales-environmental@ice.com</a>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>MarketAxess Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: MKTX), the operator of a leading electronic trading platform for fixed-income securities, today announced trading volume and preliminary variable transaction fees per million (&ldquo;FPM&rdquo;) for November 2025.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><b>Select November 2025 Highlights* (See tables 1-1C and table 2)</b></p>
<p>Our new initiatives continued to show solid year-over-year progress across the&nbsp;<b>client-initiated, portfolio trading and dealer-initiated channels</b>. We also unveiled our new Closing Auctions protocol during the month, the first standardized market-wide auction protocol in fixed-income.</p>
<p><b>Client-Initiated Channel</b></p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li><b>46%</b>&nbsp;growth in block trading average daily volume (&ldquo;ADV&rdquo;), with strong growth across U.S. credit&nbsp;<b>(+34%)</b>, emerging markets&nbsp;<b>(+61%)</b>&nbsp;and eurobonds&nbsp;<b>(+83%)</b>.<br />&mdash; Cumulative trading volume from our&nbsp;<b>targeted block trading solution</b>&nbsp;is now approximately&nbsp;<b>$12 billion</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Portfolio Trading Channel</b></p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li><b>47%</b>&nbsp;increase in total portfolio trading ADV to&nbsp;<b>$1.4 billion</b>,<b>&nbsp;</b>including a&nbsp;<b>55%</b>&nbsp;increase in U.S. credit portfolio trading ADV.</li>
<li>Our estimated market share of U.S. credit portfolio trading was&nbsp;<b>17.6%</b>, compared to&nbsp;<b>13.5%</b>&nbsp;in the prior year.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Dealer-Initiated Channel</b></p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li><b>32%</b>&nbsp;increase in dealer-initiated ADV to&nbsp;<b>$1.9 billion</b>, consisting of a&nbsp;<b>21%</b>&nbsp;increase in DRFQ ADV and a&nbsp;<b>153%</b>&nbsp;increase in Mid-X ADV.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>November 2025 Variable Transaction Fees Per Million<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>(See table 1D)</b></p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li>The decline in total credit FPM compared to the prior year was driven principally by&nbsp;<b>protocol mix,</b>&nbsp;partially offset by the&nbsp;<b>higher duration of bonds traded in U.S. high-grade</b>. The slight decline in total credit FPM compared to October 2025 was driven&nbsp;<b>principally by protocol mix</b>, partially offset by the<b>&nbsp;higher duration of bonds traded in U.S. high-grade</b>.</li>
<li>The increase in total rates FPM year-over-year and month-over-month was driven by the impact of product mix.</li>
</ul>
<p>*All comparisons versus November 2024 unless noted.</p>

<title>Smart Centres Index 12: Zurich Leads The Pack In Smart Development With London And Singapore Strong Contenders</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Smart Centres Index explores the ability of global commercial centres to create, develop, and deploy technology. Leading centres in the SCI are based in places which combine an innovative, cultural centre with a high-performing university sector across STEM subjects, supported by a well-developed regulatory, commercial, and financial services.</p>
<h4>CI 12 Results</h4>
<ul>
<li>Zurich took first place in the index, with London and Singapore overtaking San Francisco to take second and third positions.</li>
<li>Five Western European centres feature in the top 10, alongside two US centres Busan and Tel Aviv also feature in the top 10.</li>
<li>Six centres rose 10 or more places in the ranking in SCI 12, while five centres fell 10 or more places. </li>
<li>The average rating in SCI 12 rose by 3.33%, building on a rise of 0.63% in SCI 11. </li>
<li>The biggest increase in average ratings of 4.01% was in Eastern Europe &amp; Central Asia, while the lowest increase in the average rating was for North America where ratings rose 2.46%. </li>
<li>Assessments in the SCI survey appear to favour centres with strong people skills. This assists leading centres such as Zurich, Singapore, San Francisco, and London. </li>
</ul>
<p>We asked respondents to the SCI survey to identify the areas of technology which are likely to have the most impact on industry over the next five years. Almost a quarter of respondents identified &lsquo;Artificial Intelligence, Digital And Computing&rsquo; as likely to have the greatest impact, with &lsquo;Energy And Environmental Technology&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Robotics&rsquo; mentioned by 17% and 14% of respondents respectively.</p>
<p><img alt="Smart_Centres_Index_One_04Dec25" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/Smart_Centres_Index_One_04D.jpg" title="Smart_Centres_Index_One_04Dec25" /></p>
<p>The top 20 ranked centres in SCI 12 are shown in the table below:</p>
<p><img alt="Smart_Centres_Index_Two_04Dec25.jpg" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/Smart_Centres_Index_Two_04D.jpg" title="Smart_Centres_Index_Two_04Dec25.jpg" /></p>
<p>Full details of SCI 12 can be found at <a href="http://www.smartcentresindex.net" title="www.smartcentresindex.net">www.smartcentresindex.net</a></p>
<p>Professor Michael Mainelli, Chairman of Z/Yen said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;AI continues to be a technology exciting business interest and investment froth. However, centres with the skills, know how, and research depth in AI are not just the ones with the investment bubbles. Centres appear to be emerging that focus on &lsquo;boring&rsquo; AI work and research into statistical probity, IP rights, information chain-of-custody, regulation, standards, data provenance, and ethics. AI is a rapidly emerging field moving into deployment, so it&rsquo;s not surprising to see significant shifts in emphasis, shifts that may align with future investments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We invite all those with an interest in the development of innovation and technology centres to take part in SCI 13 by rating the financial and commercial centres you know on our continuously running survey &ndash; <a href="https://mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/rss/smartcentresindex.net/survey/" title="smartcentresindex.net/survey/">smartcentresindex.net/survey/</a>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The World Federation of Exchanges (&ldquo;WFE&rdquo;), the global industry group for exchanges and CCPs, has published new research which provides the first transaction-level evidence of how prices form in the voluntary carbon market (VCM). It reveals significant disparities between advanced and developing economies and offers insights for improving transparency and fairness in carbon trading.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>The WFE Research Paper,&nbsp;</span><em>Carbon Inequality: Price Discovery and Market Dynamics in the Voluntary Carbon Market</em><span>, authored by Dr Ying Liu, Financial Economist at the WFE, analyses more than 250,000 carbon credit transactions across 2,200 projects worldwide between 2017 and 2024, using econometric and machine learning methods.</span><br /><br /><strong>Key Findings:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Credits from nature-based solutions such as forestry and land use projects are priced 67% higher than those from technology-based projects like renewable energy.</li>
<li>Older credits trade at 9&ndash;23% discounts, reflecting buyer preference for newer vintages, presumably perceived as more credible.</li>
<li>Projects with larger available inventories experience lower future returns, confirming that excess supply depresses prices.</li>
<li>Past returns and prior inventory levels are the strongest predictors of near-term price movements.</li>
<li>Credits from advanced economies are priced 28% higher on average than those from emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs), even after adjusting for project characteristics. The premium is closely linked to stronger rule of law and governance quality of the jurisdiction where the carbon project is located, not to investor home bias.</li>
<li>Retirements of credits peak in December, aligning with corporate sustainability reporting cycles and offset deadlines.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><span>The analysis shows that governance quality and institutional strength of the project&rsquo;s host jurisdiction play a central role in determining carbon credit value. This is why price discrepancies occur between carbon credits in advanced economies compared to EMDEs.</span><br /><br /><strong>Dr Pedro Gurrola Perez, Head of Research at the WFE</strong><span>, said, &ldquo;Climate finance is critical for sustainable development in Emerging Markets and Developing Economies. While this is where most carbon offset projects are located, these credits are priced lower than those located in advanced economies. Without closing this pricing gap, the VCM won&rsquo;t reach its true potential.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><strong>Nandini Sukumar, CEO of the WFE</strong><span>, said, &ldquo;To make the VCM a truly global climate finance mechanism, we must ensure pricing reflects project quality - not jurisdictional biases. This underscores the urgent need to enhance transparency and address institutional disparities in the VCM. Strengthening governance and pricing mechanisms in emerging economies could expand access to climate finance for high-quality projects in these regions.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>Read the full paper&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://world-exchanges.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=48ddcbc11eb58f141a51219ea&amp;id=8712c94213&amp;e=979576350c" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a><span>.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Offa, the UK&rsquo;s leading Islamic property finance fintech, has grown its headcount yet again with the appointment of a new Senior Underwriting Manager.</p>
<p>Trevor Melly brings 25 years&rsquo; experience in financial services, most recently at Signature Finance where he spent a decade as Credit and Risk Director. He previously managed a &pound;200 million funding line, held a credit mandate of &pound;2 million and completed more than 1,800 deals in the alternative finance space.</p>
<p>Speaking about his new role, Trevor said: &ldquo;I chose to join Offa because I&rsquo;m impressed by their ambition and growing presence in the specialist property finance market. Offa&rsquo;s commitment to ethical, customer-focused lending demonstrates a responsible approach to finance, I&rsquo;m excited to contribute to a business that is shaping a modern way in the industry. I hope to bring strong technical expertise across the full finance lifecycle as Offa continues to grow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trevor will be reporting to Naseer Ahmed, Managing Director of Bridging and Development Finance. He said: &ldquo;I am delighted to welcome Trevor to Offa at such a critical stage of our rapid growth. His depth of experience within the alternative finance space will undoubtedly add significant value and further enhance the service we provide to both our broker partners and our customers. This is a major appointment for the business, and we&rsquo;re incredibly excited to have someone of Trevor&rsquo;s calibre join the Bridging team.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Offa already had already more than doubled its headcount to 45 in the past year as the business continues to expand its service offering and plans to continue hiring.</p>
<p>Offa, the first company to launch Sharia-compliant bridge finance in the UK, recently launched an innovative bridge-to-let finance service combining its ultra-fast bridge product with its modern, paperless Buy-to-Let. The company also recently purchased Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s Alburaq Sharia-compliant home finance portfolio in a landmark deal and announced it had received Financial Conduct Authority authorisation to provide upcoming Islamic home purchase plans.</p>
<p>The company received &pound;230 million of sharia-compliant funding for its BTL product, offering significant capacity for the business to expand and diversify its financial propositions in the UK property market.</p>

<title>ACER: Regulators Request More Time To Decide On The Minimum Activation Period Of Frequency Containment Reserves Providers</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On 3 December 2025, the national regulatory authorities of the Continental Europe Synchronous Area submitted to ACER a joint request for a six-month extension to decide on the transmission system operators&rsquo; proposal. This concerns the minimum activation period that frequency containment reserve providers with limited energy reservoirs must ensure in order to remain available during the alert state.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is it about?</span></p>
<p>EU&rsquo;s electric power systems operate at the frequency of 50 Hz. Any imbalance between electricity supply and demand causes the frequency to deviate. If not corrected quickly, this can lead to blackouts.</p>
<p>Frequency containment reserve is the first line of automatic response to such deviations. It is activated within seconds to stabilise the frequency and is provided continuously by power-generating or consuming assets (like batteries, hydro plants&nbsp;or demand response systems).</p>
<p>Some of these providers, especially batteries or demand-side resources, have limited energy reservoirs and can only respond for a short duration. The&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtVAFQDVVZcBUwLVVFUHVYPBAYdCwxQVBpUBgsBBFVRAAAJAFAdAgZWBQ4GVwAdVg8CVR0GDQkEGldWAw8ZBwYBUglSCAdYUlNTRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">System Operation Regulation</a>&nbsp;therefore requires a minimum activation time to ensure these resources remain available during the alert state.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the next steps?</span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>ACER will review the regulators&rsquo; joint request and issue its decision by the end of January 2026.</p>

<title>The Association Of National Numbering Agencies (ANNA) And Digital Token Identifier Foundation (DTIF) Win ‘Best Data Solution For Digital Assets' At The Data Management Insight Awards Europe 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>We are pleased to announce that&nbsp;the Association of National Numbering Agencies (ANNA) and the Digital Token Identifier Foundation (DTIF) have won &lsquo;<span>Best Data Solution for Digital Assets</span>' at the Data Management Insight Awards Europe 2025.&nbsp;These annual awards recognise leading providers of data management solutions, services and consultancy to capital markets participants within Europe and&nbsp;are voted for by clients and financial users in the data management space.</span></p>
<p><span>This award acknowledges the&nbsp;<span>groundbreaking identifier alignment solution developed through the partnership between ANNA and the DTIF,&nbsp; including the issuance of the first set of International Securities Identification Numbers (ISINs) for crypto assets.</span><span></span></span></p>
<p><span>ANNA is the central membership organisation for global Numbering Agencies, serving as the identification and Registration Authority for the&nbsp;International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) and Financial Instrument Short Name (FISN) standards, under appointment by the&nbsp;International Organization for Standardization (ISO).</span></p>
<p><span>The DTIF issues and maintains DTIs (ISO 24165) as open, reference data to uniquely identify crypto assets and enhance transparency in digital markets.<br /><br /></span><span>This initiative meets the urgent need for standardised identification in digital assets by uniting emerging digital asset standards with those long established in traditional finance. Through the alignment of two complementary and interoperable identifiers-the International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) and the Digital Token Identifier (DTI) - it delivers greater transparency and creates a foundational reference data set built on open data principles.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span><strong>Stephan Dreyer, Managing Director of ANNA, said: &ldquo;</strong>Voted for by industry users, we are delighted to receive this award that acknowledges our collaboration with the DTI Foundation. Together, we&rsquo;ve helped bridge traditional and digital asset markets with interoperable, ISO-based identifiers, and built a partnership that marks a major step forward in building critical investor confidence across the evolving digital asset ecosystem.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>The connection of reliable standards from authoritative sources represents a major advance in enabling product validation for both digital asset market participants and its regulators.</span></p>

<title>SIX To Integrate SIX x-clear And BME Clearing Into One International And Multi-Asset CCP</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>SIX announces its plan to integrate SIX x-clear and BME Clearing into one multi-asset CCP with international presence and interoperable links in the cash equity segment. Subject to required regulatory approvals, SIX will create a single multi-asset clearing house.</span></p>
<p>SIX operates two CCPs, SIX x-clear in Switzerland and BME Clearing in Spain. Currently, the two clearing houses collaborate but maintain separate local entities and systems. As a unified clearing house, SIX Clearing, as it will be named, will gain scale, optimize processes and create a foundation for growth in all segments.</p>
<p>The acquisition of BME by SIX laid the foundation for a pan-European growth platform and strengthened SIX&rsquo;s position in EU capital markets. This latest strategic project merges SIX x-clear and BME Clearing into one single, multi-asset CCP headquartered in Madrid with presences in Zurich and Oslo. The unified CCP is designed to enhance resilience, efficiency and competition across European financial markets.</p>
<p>The interoperability links and functions of SIX x-clear will be transferred to the consolidated CCP, making the new CCP a true pan-European interoperable cash equity CCP. SIX Clearing will continue to champion and promote the adoption of interoperability across Europe to enhance efficiency in European financial markets. The existing EU license under BME Clearing will give SIX Clearing access to European Central Bank (ECB) EUR liquidity, T2 and T2S and other EU relevant regulated markets and MTFs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The combined CCP will bring together SIX x-clear&rsquo;s interoperable pan-European cash equity model with BME Clearing&rsquo;s multi-asset strengths, creating a scaled, open and competitive alternative for clearing across asset classes in Europe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are very pleased to announce this project, that will create a more comprehensive clearing service. As a consolidated CCP, SIX will be able to diversify into other asset classes and expand the reach of our offering. With the EU license, we are in a position to become the leading provider of integrated and digital post-trade solutions for the European market and compete internationally with a unique value proposition&rdquo;, said<span>&nbsp;Rafael Moral Santiago,&nbsp;Head Securities Services &amp; Executive Board Member, SIX</span>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Disclaimer - Important Legal Notice:</span>&nbsp;The above mentioned information is subject to the required regulatory approvals. The timeline as well as the currently planned form of execution of this integration are depended on these approvals.</p>

<title>SET Market Report For November 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/set-market-report-for-november-2025-2025124/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Although the US government shutdown has ended, certain months of economic data remain unavailable. Markets are currently pricing in high odds that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will resume interest rate cuts at its final meeting of this year, scheduled for December 9-10, 2025. Some Federal Reserve (Fed) officials have voiced opposition to rate cuts, citing concerns about elevated valuations of U.S. technology stocks. However, current NASDAQ index levels remain below the 2000 Dot-com peak, while forward 12-month earnings per share forecasts for most U.S. listed companies continue to demonstrate sustained growth. Against this backdrop, numerous analysts recommend portfolio diversification away from U.S. technology stocks towards other bourses, including emerging markets.</p>
<p>Regarding the Thai stock market, the SET Index at the end of November 2025 fell 4.0% from the previous month, closing at 1,256.69 points, aligning with global stock market trends. Thailand's economic slowdown in the third quarter of 2025 and flooding in Southern Thailand added downward pressure.</p>
<p><b>SET Senior Executive Vice President Soraphol Tulayasathien</b> stated that Thailand's third-quarter 2025 economic growth decelerated to 1.2% from 2.8% in the second quarter, attributed to slower exports and tourism, reduced government consumption and investment spending, and baht strengthening. This trend dealt a blow to sales revenues of listed companies across nearly all business sectors. Additionally, the unexpected flooding in Southern Thailand further weighed on the investment sentiment. However, on a positive note, Thai ESG funds (ThaiESG) continue to attract inflows as investors pursue tax benefits. Historically, net outflows from Long-Term Equity Funds (LTF) moderate in the year's final two months.</p>
<p><b>Key highlights for November 2025</b></p>
<ul>
<li>At end-November 2025, the SET Index closed at 1,256.69 points, or a 4.0 percent decrease from the previous month and a 10.2 percent drop since the beginning of the year. Compared to the end of 2024, the industry groups that outperformed the SET Index were Technology and Financials.</li>
<li>SET&rsquo;s and Market for Alternative Investment (mai)&rsquo;s average daily trading value dropped 22.4 percent YoY to THB 34.32 billion (approx. USD 1.07 billion), with a YTD average daily trading value of THB 41.91 billion.</li>
<li>Foreign investors sold a net THB 12.56 billion, with THB 113.30 billion in net selling for the January-November period of 2025.</li>
<li>Foreign investors continued to dominate trading activity, representing 54.20 percent of total trading value, followed by local retail investors at 29.06 percent, local institutional investors at 10.88 percent, and securities companies at 5.85 percent.</li>
<li>There were two newly listed companies on SET: Smothong Group pcl (SMO) and MR. D.I.Y. Holding (Thailand) pcl (MRDIYT); and another two on mai: MMM Capital pcl (MMM) and Laundry You pcl (WASH).</li>
<li>SET&rsquo;s forward P/E ratio at end-November 2025 stood at 11.7 times, lower than the Asian stock market average of 14.6 times. The historical P/E ratio was at 11.6 times, well below the Asian stock market average of 16.4 times.</li>
<li>SET&rsquo;s dividend yield at end-November 2025 was 4.01 percent, notably higher than the Asian stock market average of 2.93 percent.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Derivatives Market</b></p>
<ul>
<li>At the end of November 2025, Thailand Futures Exchange (TFEX)&rsquo;s daily trading volume was recorded at 329,001 contracts, down 19.10 percent from the previous month, mainly due to the decline in Single Stock Futures, SET50 Index Futures, and Gold Online Futures. The YTD average daily trading volume in 2025 totaled 413,695 contracts, down 14.5 percent from the same period last year, mainly due to the decline in Single Stock Futures and SET50 Index Futures. </li>

<title>Simplification Update - ASIC Expands Email Lodgements</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/simplification-update-asic-expands-email-lodgements-2025124/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/simplification-update-asic-expands-email-lodgements-2025124/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC has introduced email lodgement for 35 paper forms to help streamline interactions and reduce administrative burden for those needing to comply with their obligations.</p>
<p>This initiative is part of ASIC&rsquo;s simplification work outlined in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/regulatory-simplification/" title="Regulatory simplification">Regulatory Simplification</a>&nbsp;report to transition more &lsquo;paper-only&rsquo; documents to email lodgement and enable electronic signatures on all forms.</p>
<p>Selected based on stakeholder feedback, the forms relate to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share capital notifications</li>
<li>Changes to responsible entities</li>
<li>Managed investment schemes</li>
<li>Auditor changes</li>
<li>Company structure updates, and</li>
<li>Other regulatory lodgements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recently added forms are shown below. Our website has a complete&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/for-business-and-companies/forms-and-fees/how-to-lodge-forms-online-email-mail/" title="How to lodge forms: online, email, mail">list of forms that can be lodged by email</a>.</p>
<p>Email lodgement provides a faster, more convenient submission option while paper lodgement remains available for those who prefer the existing postal option.</p>
<p>While most forms submitted to ASIC can already be completed online, some still require submission by post. Over time, ASIC will continue to expand the option to lodge these forms via email to support a more convenient and streamlined user experience.</p>
<p>To support the transition, ASIC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/for-business-and-companies/forms-and-fees/how-to-lodge-forms-online-email-mail/#email" title="How to lodge forms: online, email, mail">document lodgement requirements</a>&nbsp;have been consolidated into a single resource. This includes lodgement guidance on forms, manner of lodging documents and signing documents.</p>
<h2>Electronic signatures</h2>
<p>ASIC also now accepts&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/for-business-and-companies/forms-and-fees/how-to-lodge-forms-online-email-mail/#electronicsignatures" title="How to lodge forms: online, email, mail">electronic signatures</a>&nbsp;on approved PDF forms available on our website, including those enabled for email lodgement.</p>

<title>ASIC Proposes To Remake Relief Instruments For AFS Licensees And Overseas Banks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC is seeking feedback on a proposal to remake relief instruments for Australian financial services (AFS) licensees and foreign authorised deposit-taking institutions (ADIs).<br /><br /><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2016L00451/latest/text"><em>ASIC Corporations (Foreign Licensees and ADIs) Instrument 2016/186</em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2021L00500/latest/text"><em>ASIC Corporations (Licence Conditions&mdash;Treatment of Lease Assets) Instrument 2021/229</em></a>&nbsp;(the Instruments) are due to sunset on 1 April 2026 and automatically repeal on 1 May 2026 respectively.<br /><br />We have assessed that the instruments are operating effectively and continue to form a necessary part of the legislative framework.<br /><br />The relief provided under the Instruments will remain largely unchanged other than an amendment to a relief condition, and clarification of a note under Section 5(2) of ASIC Instrument 2016/186. Other minor changes have been made to ensure the relief is up-to-date and current.</p>
<h2>Providing feedback&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Please send your submissions to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:rri.consultation@asic.gov.au">rri.consultation@asic.gov.au</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<strong>5pm AEDT on Friday 23 January 2026</strong>.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Under the&nbsp;<em>Legislation Act 2003</em>, all legislative instruments are automatically repealed, or &lsquo;sunset&rsquo;, after 10 years, unless ASIC takes action to preserve them.</p>
<h3>Financial reporting and record keeping relief</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2016L00451/latest/text">ASIC Instrument 2016/186</a>&nbsp;exempts:</p>
<ul>
<li>foreign licensees from certain record keeping obligations, as well as the requirement to lodge financial statements and have them audited under Div 6 of Pt 7.8 of the Corporations Act, and</li>
<li>foreign ADIs from the requirement to hold an AFS licence when dealing in derivatives and foreign exchange contracts on their own behalf.</li>

<h3>Financial requirements &ndash; treatment of lease assets relief</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2021L00500/latest/text">ASIC Instrument 2021/229</a>&nbsp;specifies that a right-of-use asset under a lease is not an excluded asset for the purposes of an AFS licensee&rsquo;s general duty to comply with its licence conditions. This allows certain AFS licensees when calculating their financial resource requirements to include a right-of-use asset under a lease in the calculation of their net tangible assets and, where applicable, adjusted surplus liquid funds and surplus liquid funds.</p>

<title>ASIC Calls On Australian Companies To Adopt Better Practices To Protect Whistleblowers</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A first-of-its-kind ASIC questionnaire has shown significant differences in the whistleblower policies and practices adopted across corporate Australia, and highlighted opportunities for companies to better support and protect those who speak up.</p>
<p>Report 827&nbsp;<em>Insights from the ASIC Whistleblower Questionnaire: July 2024 to June 2025</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-827-insights-from-the-asic-whistleblower-questionnaire-july-2024-to-june-2025/" title="REP 827 Insights from the ASIC Whistleblower Questionnaire: July 2024 to June 2025">REP 827</a>) benchmarks whistleblower policies and practices across 134 entities in 18 industries, examining how far companies have adopted better practices outlined in previous ASIC publications.</p>
<p>ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland said: &lsquo;Whistleblowers play a crucial role in identifying and exposing misconduct that can harm customers, shareholders, companies and the broader community.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Without effective policies and programs to encourage whistleblowers to come forward, misconduct may otherwise go unreported and undetected,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s questionnaire found significant variation in the maturity of whistleblower practices.</p>
<p>There are opportunities for companies to adopt better practices for whistleblower disclosures. ASIC&rsquo;s review found:</p>
<ul>
<li>over one third of participating entities did not provide a dedicated whistleblower web page for raising concerns</li>
<li>a quarter failed to provide regular staff training on their whistleblower program, and</li>
<li>more than half had not sought employee feedback on their whistleblower program in the past year.</li>
</ul>
<p>ASIC observed larger companies and companies within the mining sector were most likely to have mature whistleblower practices and higher disclosure rates. Some smaller companies also demonstrated better practices, suggesting firm size was not an impediment to strong whistleblower programs.</p>
<p>Commissioner Kirkland said ASIC's review highlighted actions Australian companies could adopt to improve their whistleblower programs and practices.</p>
<p>&lsquo;While whistleblower processes need to be tailored to the circumstances of each company, providing dedicated web pages for whistleblower reporting, enabling communication with anonymous disclosers, and fostering a stronger speak-up culture are all steps companies can take to support whistleblowers and encourage disclosures,' said Mr Kirkland.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Strong, appropriate and effective whistleblower practices go to the core of good corporate governance. These programs provide important information for directors to oversee their company&rsquo;s operations and compliance with the law.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We encourage companies to benchmark themselves against the findings of the report and consider how they can improve their own whistleblower policies and practices,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>ASIC will continue to monitor whistleblower practices across corporate Australia and engage with companies identified as having non-compliant or significantly less mature practices.</p>
<p>Companies are reminded that they are required to provide specific protections for whistleblowers and to manage whistleblower disclosures confidentially. Proper whistleblower policies should reflect these protections and outline how they will support and protect whistleblowers, taking into account the specific circumstances and characteristics of the company.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Good afternoon and thank you Amy [Lally]<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn1">[1]</a>, for the kind words. I appreciate the opportunity to address the 2025 Institute for Corporate Counsel.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Its focus on the intersection of law, business, and politics is particularly timely. As our Chairman Paul Atkins has proclaimed earlier this year, it is a new day at the SEC and there have been changes in perspective on these three factors.</p>
<p>What has not changed, however, is the recognition that law, business, and politics impact our shared efforts to build and maintain strong capital markets. Economic growth, jobs creation, and innovation are powered by free enterprise and opportunity, which are not possible without investors being willing to supply risk capital.</p>
<p>Law underpins the Commission&rsquo;s authority to protect investors, to maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and to facilitate capital formation. Business operates within this legal framework to provide goods and services demanded, and desired, by the public. Lastly, politics responds to the voting electorate and their general views on policies are reflected in the election of the President and members of Congress.</p>
<p>During the next several years, the Commission is expected to focus on crypto, encouraging more companies to go public, and facilitating more opportunities to invest in private markets. Today, I will focus on the second part of that agenda &mdash; encouraging more businesses to go, and stay, public by making it less onerous to be a public company.</p>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span>Periodic Reporting Should be Reconsidered to Promote Effectiveness and Decrease Costs</span></em></p>
<p>Earlier this year, President Donald J. Trump, in a Truth Social post, expressed his view that public companies should have the option to move from reporting quarterly to semiannually.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn3">[3]</a>&nbsp;President Trump observed that this would &ldquo;save money, and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we seek to incentivize businesses to have IPOs, and increase the number of public companies, we should consider whether the current SEC reporting regime remains optimal. This exercise is not particularly novel. Other major capital markets have shifted their reporting periods specifically in order to minimize burdens and promote longer term thinking.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn4">[4]</a>&nbsp;Even in the United States, foreign private issuers are not required to file quarterly reports, in contrast to the quarterly filing requirement that applies to domestic issuers.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn5">[5]</a>&nbsp;The capital markets depend on the quality and integrity of the information provided by companies to investors. However, the channels for providing material information to market participants have grown significantly due to advances in technology and communications. The investing world simply does not wait with bated breadth for the filing of the next Form 10-Q with the SEC. Nearly twenty years ago, then-Chairman Chris Cox recognized the possibility that websites, including blogs, might be an appropriate method for distributing material corporate information without running afoul of Regulation FD.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn6">[6]</a>&nbsp;Today, important information can be flashed instantaneously across the globe with little cost.</p>
<p>With respect to reporting frequency, this is an issue that we have struggled with over time. Currently, regulations require dissemination of financial and other information through quarterly filings made with the SEC. This was not always the case, however. For decades prior, the SEC did not mandate quarterly disclosures.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn7">[7]</a></p>
<p>There has been a longstanding debate over whether a short-term outlook harms long-term investment in companies.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn8">[8]</a>&nbsp;Chairman Arthur Levitt referenced this debate in 1998, noting that &ldquo;&hellip; we have got to break this pattern where short-term estimates rather than long-term results drive a company&rsquo;s stock. Wall Street needs to focus less on quarterly earnings and more on the long-term health and viability of a company. Don&rsquo;t settle for anything less &hellip; If we satisfy short-term needs at the expense of long-term values, we defy the very principle companies and our markets operate on &ndash; the efficient allocation of capital.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn9">[9]</a></p>
<p>In 2018, the SEC requested public comment on the disclosures that reporting companies must provide in their quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn10">[10]</a>&nbsp;The Commission was interested in exploring ways to promote efficiency in periodic reporting by reducing unnecessary duplication in disclosure and how such changes could affect capital formation, while maintaining appropriate investor protection.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn11">[11]</a></p>
<p>Given the efforts to make public capital markets great again, it is appropriate to revisit this question. As some commentators have noted &ldquo;frequent reporting can distort managerial incentives, leading to a prioritization of short-term accounting performance over long-term value creation.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn12">[12]</a></p>
<p>In this regard, the current Form 10-Q framework potentially captures two negative regulatory outcomes: first, the sheer cost to prepare a Form 10-Q every quarter; and, second, whether the disclosures contained in that filing substantially benefit price discovery for shareholders. It takes a significant amount of time and effort to prepare a Form 10-Q, particularly when there is personal civil and criminal liability under Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Thus, when preparing a Form 10-Q, do not forget that every company must have disclosure controls and procedures (DCPs) on mine safety, even if the company has never had any involvement in such activities. After all, DCPs are needed to confirm that the company did not have any reportable mine safety incidents during that quarter. Exactly how does that benefit investors?</p>
<p>The SEC estimates that Form 10-Qs average reporting burden per response to be a modest 135.13 hours.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn13">[13]</a>&nbsp;It would not be surprising, however, if this figure vastly understates the actual burden.</p>
<p>Given the diversity of business models, it would be presumptuous to think that a single prescriptive regime perfectly fits each company. Shifting from quarterly to semiannually would provide more flexibility for companies to align the reporting period with the potential needs of their shareholder base, business cycle, and securities analyst coverage.</p>
<p>For companies with a multi-year development cycle, such as those who have a single product in the pipeline and no current revenue, shareholders may find quarterly financial information less relevant than disclosure on the progress towards development milestones. Even if no longer required to file on Form 10-Q, such companies would remain subject to current report filing obligations on Form 8-K for certain material events.</p>
<p>The experience of other jurisdictions can provide useful case studies as to whether shifting to semiannual reporting would have a negative impact on our capital markets. As one study noted, &ldquo;[w]hen quarterly reporting was no longer required of U.K. companies in 2014, less than 10% stopped issuing quarterly reports (as of the end of 2015) &hellip; [t]here was no statistically significant difference between the levels of corporate investment of the UK companies that stopped quarterly reporting and those that continued quarterly reporting.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn14">[14]</a></p>
<p>In 2013, the European Union abolished the requirement to publish the quarterly report, known as the interim management statement (IMS). The E.U., noted that the IMSs were a burden for small and medium-sized issuers without being necessary for investor protection.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn15">[15]</a>&nbsp;Furthermore, &ldquo;the IMSs were thought to encourage a focus on short-term performance and discourage long-term investment.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn16">[16]</a></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not confuse omitting the Form 10-Q for the first and third quarters with the absence of any information to the market. Even if a company adopted a semi-annual reporting schedule, they could still report earnings and other information on a quarterly basis on Form 8-K.</p>
<p>The financial markets tend to react to quarterly earnings information distributed in earnings releases and analyst calls, all of which are subject to the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. There tends to be far less reaction to the Form 10-Q disclosures, which often come several weeks later. This raises questions about the marginal informational value provided by the Form 10-Q. Some of the information, like material changes to risk factors, unregistered sales of equity securities, and defaults upon senior securities &ndash; and the aforementioned mine safety disclosures &mdash; may be better suited to disclosure elsewhere.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn17">[17]</a></p>
<p>The fundamental question is whether the costs and burdens associated with the preparation of quarterly Form 10-Q filings provide corresponding levels of benefits to shareholders and the financial markets. Regulators should be open to change rather than have a reflexive instinct to maintain existing frameworks.</p>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span>Our Rulebook Should Promote Transparent Clarity, Not Complex Secrecy</span></em></p>
<p>Additionally, where the Commission can promote transparency behind its thinking, then it should do so. There are many aspects to its regulatory framework where such transparency is not forthcoming. One example is shareholder proposals under Rule 14a-8,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn18">[18]</a>&nbsp;where most of the analysis is documented in internal memoranda that only Commission staff and former staff have seen.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn19">[19]</a>&nbsp;Our rulebook should not be based on secret internal writings or codes; while such secrecy might have entertainment value such as when watching Nicholas Cage in&nbsp;<em>National Treasure</em>,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn20">[20]</a>&nbsp;it is inconsistent with a transparent regulatory framework. Deciphering our rules should not be akin to solving complex cryptographic puzzles. Instead, our rules and policies should be stated clearly and openly. (That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed having possession of the mythical SEC Chairmen&rsquo;s Book of Secrets during the three months that I served as acting chairman.)<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn21">[21]</a></p>
<p>The need for transparency is also reflected in the Commission&rsquo;s recent decision to articulate its policies regarding the acceleration of effectiveness of registration statements with mandatory arbitration provisions (the &ldquo;Policy Statement&rdquo;).<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn22">[22]</a>&nbsp;For years, many operated under the assumption that mandatory arbitration provisions were not permissible in registration statements. However, such a regulation or formal policy has never been adopted by the Commission.</p>
<p>Describing the Policy Statement as a reversal of the Commission&rsquo;s previous position is inaccurate and misleading as the Commission has never adopted a policy in this regard. For that reason, critics of the Policy Statement cannot point to any prior Commission or staff policy statements. Rather, prior practice was for Commission staff to inform registrants that without Commission guidance, which could take weeks, if not months, to obtain, the staff would not use its delegated authority to accelerate the effectiveness of registration statements if there was a mandatory arbitration provision. One should not be surprised that registrants have opted to remove those provisions rather than undergo the potentially time consuming process of obtaining a Commission policy position. From a practical standpoint, this approach operated as a de facto ban on mandatory arbitration provisions. I think this is wrong: policies should be stated clearly and not be cloaked. The Policy Statement now achieves that objective.</p>
<p>Critics point to the public interest standard contained in the federal securities laws as a reason to prohibit the inclusion of mandatory arbitration provisions. However, the case law cited in the Policy Statement fully supports the Commission&rsquo;s approach. As the Policy Statement observes, &ldquo;nothing in the text of the anti-waiver provisions or any other provisions of the Federal securities statutes could be construed as a clearly expressed congressional intention that the Arbitration Act would not apply to Federal securities laws claims.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn23">[23]</a></p>
<p>The public interest and investor protection requirements of Section 8(a) of the Securities Act cannot form the basis for a backdoor merit review standard. As the Policy Statement notes: &ldquo;Courts have considered the scope of the public interest and investor protection standard in the context of the Federal securities laws and determined that, when applying this standard, it is only permissible to consider those matters over which the Commission has authority under the Federal securities laws.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn24">[24]</a>&nbsp;The Policy Statement concludes that &ldquo;[b]ecause the Federal securities statutes do not override the Arbitration Act when applied to arbitration provisions, the existence of such a provision is not within the ambit of appropriate considerations under Section 8(a)&rsquo;s public interest and investor protection standard&hellip;&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn25">[25]</a></p>
<p>Taking a contrary position would run afoul of the overwhelming weight of judicial precedent, run counter to a common sense interpretation, and would open the registration statement review process to a subjective merit review standard. Should the public interest standard be used to deny acceleration to companies involved in mining, fossil fuels, artificial intelligence, or fast-fashion? Should acceleration of registration statements be denied because a company takes stances on controversial political issues deemed counter to the &ldquo;public interest&rdquo; by the powers that be? Should excessive performance-based compensation for corporate executives be viewed as against the public interest because some say it increases wealth disparity? Who would define what is the &ldquo;public interest&rdquo;? Would there be any limiting principle? The list of potentially subjective &ldquo;public interest&rdquo; criteria for denying acceleration would be never ending and in perpetual flux. Congress could have adopted a merit review standard during the passage of the Securities Act, but it did not and, instead, adopted a framework based on disclosure of material information.</p>
<p>In short, the Policy Statement addresses a specific issue that has been left unaddressed for decades and articulates clear views on how the Commission and its staff will administer this particular statutory provision.</p>
<p class="text-align-center"><span>Unaccountable and Concentrated Proxy Voting Power</span></p>
<p>Lastly, we should ensure that market participants comply with statutory and SEC requirements to disseminate information when they are acting in a coordinated manner. This activity includes coordinated proxy voting, which can occur through the efforts of proxy voting advisory businesses (PVAB) to recommend particular policy choices to funds and asset managers. In 2021, Commissioner Elad Roisman noted that &ldquo;they can influence the outcome of a variety of matters that companies submit to a shareholder vote.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn26">[26]</a></p>
<p>With regard to proxy voting, practices that directly or indirectly result in coordinated voting should be evaluated with respect to compliance with reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act. Shareholders form a group if they act together for the purpose of voting the equity securities of an issuer. Depending on the facts and circumstances, funds and asset managers using PVABs for voting decisions may have formed a group for purposes of Section 13(d)(3) or Section 13(g)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn27">[27]</a>&nbsp;Indeed, the Commission itself raised this issue in 2020 when it stated that &ldquo;[u]se of a proxy voting advice business by investors as a vehicle for the purpose of coordinating their voting decisions regarding an issuers&rsquo; securities&rdquo; would raise issues under the SEC&rsquo;s beneficial ownership rules.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn28">[28]</a>&nbsp;Of course, a group is not formed simply because a shareholder independently determined how it wants to vote on an issue, announced its voting decision, or advised others on how it intended to vote.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn29">[29]</a>&nbsp;The key is that the vote is based on an independent decision by the shareholder itself. If, in lieu of such independent decision-making, funds and asset managers automatically vote shares solely based on PVAB recommendation regarding shareholder proposals that have the purpose or effect of influencing control over the company and the aggregated voting power of such persons exceeds 5% beneficial ownership, such persons may have formed a group and need to file a Schedule 13D even if they beneficially own less than 5% on an individual basis.</p>
<p>To the extent that funds and asset managers are engaging in &ldquo;robo-voting&rdquo; based on PVAB recommendations, such practices should be reviewed to determine whether they comply with the Exchange Act and SEC rules. The evaluation of whether a group has been formed should take into account the business realities of the arrangements, particularly if robo-voting results in coordination of voting practices where owners of the same securities vote in tandem with each other with the effect of influencing control of an issuer. The substance of such arrangements has implications under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and we should not shy away from scrutinizing such consequences.</p>
<p>Thank you for your attention today and future engagement on these important topics. I welcome questions.</p>

<title>Statement On Extension Of Compliance Dates For Securities Lending Reporting And Short Position And Short Activity Reporting, SEC Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw, Dec. 3, 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Recently I expressed my concern about &ldquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-091725-repeal-extension-statement-yet-another-extension-form-pf-compliance-date">Repeal by Extension</a>&rdquo;&mdash;the concept of using compliance date extensions that are long in duration to indefinitely delay the compliance dates of final rules.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-extension-compliance-dates-120325#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;I am disappointed that this pattern continues today with the issuance of an exemptive order<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-extension-compliance-dates-120325#_ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;that provides a two-year compliance date extension for two rules aimed at increasing transparency in the securities lending and short sale markets: Rule 10c-1a (Securities Lending Reporting)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-extension-compliance-dates-120325#_ftn3">[3]</a>&nbsp;and Rule 13f-2 (Short Position and Short Activity Reporting) (collectively, the &ldquo;Rules&rdquo;).<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-extension-compliance-dates-120325#_ftn4">[4]</a>&nbsp;The Commission adopted both of these Rules in 2023 under rulemaking authority granted by Congress through the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (&ldquo;Dodd-Frank&rdquo;),<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-extension-compliance-dates-120325#_ftn5">[5]</a>&nbsp;the well-known legislative response to the wreckage generated by the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
<p>Let me briefly explain how we got here. Trade groups challenged the Rules on various grounds, and, on August 25, 2025, the Fifth Circuit largely rejected the arguments they raised.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-extension-compliance-dates-120325#_ftn6">[6]</a>&nbsp;It did, however, agree with one argument and remanded the Rules to the Commission, without vacating them, to allow the Commission &ldquo;to analyze [the Rules&rsquo;] cumulative economic impact and respond[] to further comments in view of that analysis.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-extension-compliance-dates-120325#_ftn7">[7]</a>&nbsp;The Court determined that &ldquo;there is at least a serious possibility that the agency will be able to substantiate its decision given an opportunity to do so.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-extension-compliance-dates-120325#_ftn8">[8]</a></p>
<p>It should not take two years to complete a narrow revision of the Rules&rsquo; economic analyses consistent with the Court&rsquo;s request. This could be done expeditiously and concisely. However, rather than following the Court&rsquo;s narrow directive, the Commission not so subtly signals that no one should even bother with implementation; the Rules will be changing.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-extension-compliance-dates-120325#_ftn9">[9]</a></p>
<p>The right (and legal) thing to do would be to implement the Rules, which are already effective since the Fifth Circuit declined to vacate them. If extra time is truly necessary to allow registrants more runway to prepare for the Rules in light of the Court&rsquo;s decision, this could be accomplished by a short compliance date extension.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-extension-compliance-dates-120325#_ftn10">[10]</a>&nbsp;Any future modifications should be addressed separately, as required by statute, through notice-and-comment rulemaking.</p>
<p>Under the guise of compliance date extensions, we are attempting to camouflage a new willingness to repeatedly bend the rules until they break&mdash;eroding the rule of law.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-extension-compliance-dates-120325#_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;This is evident in the Order&rsquo;s statement that, in addition to allowing time to respond to the Court&rsquo;s opinion, the exemption is necessary to allow the Commission time to &ldquo;take any further appropriate actions, which may include amendments to the Rules.&rdquo;&nbsp;<em>See</em>&nbsp;Order at 4.</p>
</div>
<div id="ftn10">
<p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-extension-compliance-dates-120325#_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;Unlike the prior &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; compliance date extensions issued for these Rules, which acknowledged that the exemptions would delay the benefits of the Rules, today&rsquo;s second round of extensions make no mention of the benefits that will be forgone while the Rules are stalled. For example, with respect to Rule 10c-1a, the prior exemption stated that the public availability of accurate securities loan data will result in (1) protections against potentially unfair pricing of securities loans by broker-dealers and protect broker-dealers&rsquo; customers against potential instabilities, (2) better decision-making by investors, beneficial owners and other market participants, (3) reduced costs of business for broker-dealers, (4) improved performance and reduced costs for lending programs, and (5) improved market stability and price discovery both in the securities lending market and the market for the underlying security.&nbsp;<em>See</em>&nbsp;Prior Securities Lending Exemptive Order at 5-6. Nevertheless, today we are delaying the realization of the Rules&rsquo; benefits yet again, and we are possibly embarking down a path to further diminish those benefits by amending the Rules before their anticipated benefits are ever realized.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Good afternoon, everyone.</p>
<p>Marc, thank you so much for that kind introduction. It&rsquo;s wonderful to be back at an ABA event and I am excited to be doing so in my new role as SEC IM Division Director. I am eager to engage with you today and am glad to see so many familiar faces.</p>
<p>Before we get started, I must start with our standard disclaimer.&nbsp;Thanks to the lapse in appropriations, this is only my second time making this statement, so forgive me for reading off a card.</p>
<p><em>These remarks are provided in my official capacity as the Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s Director of the Division of Investment Management, but do not necessarily reflect the views of the Commission, the Commissioners, or other members of the staff.</em></p>
<p>With that said: I have been with the Commission now for five months, one and half of which coincided with the longest government shutdown on record. As I roamed the 8th Floor for 45 days &ndash; only able to work on a very short list of &ldquo;excepted&rdquo; activities &ndash; I couldn&rsquo;t help but ponder the Division&rsquo;s path forward. With your indulgence, I thought that this would be a good forum to share some of our priorities.</p>
<h3>Listening</h3>
<p>Now, when it comes to our priorities, I want to be clear about something: I serve at the pleasure of the Commission. The Chairman sets the overall direction, and the Commissioners&mdash;nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate&mdash;vote to implement that agenda.&nbsp;So, my personal priorities for the division are always shaped by and aligned with the broader goals of the Commission. If those priorities shift, we shift with them.</p>
<p>That said, my top priority for the Division is simple: to be good listeners.</p>
<p>My mother used to say, &ldquo;The minute you start talking is the minute you stop learning.&rdquo; And she was correct. Listening&mdash;really listening&mdash;is one of the most effective tools we have as regulators.</p>
<p>Some of you can see that I am wearing cufflinks shaped like tiny hippopotamuses.&nbsp;Why? Because hippos have two tiny ears and one huge, massive mouth.&nbsp;These are to remind me not to be a hippo.</p>
<p>We are deeply interested in what the industry has to say, how investors feel, and how the public perceives our proposals.&nbsp;While my track record is short, our public outreach to date has been fruitful, sometimes in unexpected ways.&nbsp;In some cases, after engaging with stakeholders, it became clear that some of my brilliant ideas were off-base.&nbsp;Some were solutions to problems that didn&rsquo;t exist, and others addressed issues that the market had already evolved past.</p>
<p>But by asking questions and listening carefully, we&rsquo;ve been able to redirect our resources toward initiatives that do make sense&mdash;initiatives that are grounded in reality and responsive to the needs of investors and the industry alike.&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll get a feel for those in the next publication of the RegFlex agenda&hellip;</p>
<p>And by listening, we became smarter&mdash;often about parts of your businesses that we weren&rsquo;t even asking about. It&rsquo;s funny how, when you give experts the space to tell you what they think is important, you might be surprised by what you hear.</p>
<p>So yes, we have policy goals. Yes, we have regulatory responsibilities. But above all, we have a duty to listen, to learn, and to lead with humility and purpose.</p>
<h3>Agenda</h3>
<p>But let&rsquo;s shift to more concrete points.&nbsp;While it is impossible to completely reduce a four-year workplan to a short list of bullets, hope springs eternal.</p>
<p>When you look at our various efforts, I think that you will see each step the Division takes falls into one (or more) of the following themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>An overall&nbsp;<em><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">deregulatory</span></span></em>&nbsp;effort;</li>
<li><em><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Modernization</span></span></em>&nbsp;initiatives;</li>
<li><em><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Democratization</span></span></em>&nbsp;of alternative asset investments; and</li>
<li>Promotion of&nbsp;<em><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">artificial intelligence</span></span></em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Deregulation</h3>
<p>The American capital markets are the envy of the world.&nbsp;In my opinion, the reason for American dominance in finance is simple, we allow more innovation than our competitors.</p>
<p>Thoughtful and measured deregulation can unlock value.&nbsp;In 2019, the Commission streamlined the ETF approval process, and in six short years, the exchange traded fund has literally changed the face of retail investing.&nbsp;Retail investors have more investment options, at lower cost, than ever before.&nbsp;ETFs deliver true beta, cheaply, and provide active management in a wide variety of forms.</p>
<p>And with our new ETF Share class orders, we are allowing industry the option to link ETFs and mutual fund structures to deliver even more choices, at reduced expenses, for retail investors.</p>
<p>Commission actions and restraint also allowed the private fund market to flourish.&nbsp;America invented the hedge fund, the private equity fund, and the private credit fund, and these structures transformed institutional investing, with compensation structures that aligned mangers and investors in innovative ways.&nbsp;And why here?&nbsp;Again, because we allowed a lighter-touch regime to develop for sophisticated investors capable of managing their own risks.</p>
<p>In our rulemaking, oversight, and exemptive efforts over the next few years, you can expect that the Division will be receptive to suggestions on how thoughtful changes to existing rules can facilitate innovation. We are asking &ldquo;Why is this still on the books?&rdquo; in a number of contexts, and you should too.</p>
<p>To be clear, we are still the Investor&rsquo;s Advocate (a motto you will see framed throughout the building, including in the Chairman&rsquo;s office).&nbsp;And you can expect us to remain laser focused on retail protection and market stability.&nbsp;But where we can remove restrictions that do not serve the common good, we are interested in doing so.</p>
<h3>Modernization</h3>
<p>We need to modernize our rulebook. Is that news to anyone here?</p>
<p>Many of our rules were well-intentioned when adopted, with underlying policy goals that often remain valid&mdash;but the requirements themselves have become outdated.</p>
<p>The Custody Rule &ndash; for example &ndash; clearly did not contemplate digital assets. While more thinking on this is needed, we were able to issue a no action letter hours before the shutdown related to advisers&rsquo; ability to custody client crypto assets with state-chartered trusts. We have more catch-up work to do here, but that is a good first step.</p>
<p>Our recordkeeping rule is an even better example. This rule was written in a time when communications were physical and manual. Think about a letter that might begin, &ldquo;Dear Mr. Smith, a company called Micro Software is coming to market soon. We believe we can secure an allocation of IPO shares for this newfangled computer company. If you&rsquo;re interested, please write back to us at the following address&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The world the recordkeeping rule was built for no longer exists.&nbsp;Today, we live in a digital, cloud-based, multi-platform environment. Yet the language of the rule still reflects a paper-based mindset. We&rsquo;ve even seen past regulatory missteps&mdash;ours and others&rsquo;&mdash;where we mandated specific technologies, like WORM (Write Once, Read Many) storage on CD-ROMs, only to watch the industry move on to more effective and flexible solutions.</p>
<p>So, across the advisory rulebook, if and when we recommend changes to the Commission, our goal will be to do so in a way that is platform-independent, technology-neutral, and future-ready. I would be very sad if someone is giving this same speech in 40 years because our recommendations to accommodate a digital world were not compatible with the quantum one that future Director is living in.</p>
<h3>Democratization</h3>
<p>As you all know, the arc of the trend toward the retailization of private markets has been observable for some time, but it became even more pronounced with the issuance of President Trump&rsquo;s Executive Order directing the Department of Labor to take steps to expand access to alternative investments within 401(k) retirement accounts. We are working closely with our colleagues at the Department of Labor to support their efforts in the context of ERISA plan options.</p>
<p>However, democratization options for retail investors using post-tax, pre-retirement dollars fall squarely in our purview.</p>
<p>But what does this look like? It does not necessarily mean a &ldquo;big bang&rdquo; &ldquo;Retailization Rule&rdquo; that suddenly transforms everything about how private funds are structured, marketed, and operated. Instead, the markets and investors may be better served by a thoughtful and incremental reconsideration of our existing regulatory framework across different access points, investment structures, and disclosure requirements.</p>
<p>Let me give you a concrete example: You may recall that the Chairman directed us to reconsider our practice of asking closed-end funds that invest in private funds to either ensure that their investors were &ldquo;accredited investors&rdquo; or to limit their exposure to private funds to a relatively small percentage of their net asset value.&nbsp;We did that and followed it with the publication of an Accounting and Disclosure Information bulletin (an &ldquo;ADI&rdquo;) intended to provide our high-level views to managers of closed-end and private funds navigating this less constrained retail environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But look at what we did&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;do. We did not respond with another prescriptive regulatory regime.&nbsp;We did&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;trade one set of restrictions for another based on an unproven worst-case scenario.&nbsp;We did not orchestrate a bunch of examinations and enforcement actions to establish&nbsp;<em>de facto</em>&nbsp;substantive limits that made sense to us.</p>
<p>We are not withdrawing from the field, but we are allowing you enough space to innovate.&nbsp;When the time is right for us to get involved on this topic, we will do so, but that time is not today.</p>
<p>I predict that you will see a lot of this from us: targeted actions, followed by additional staff engagement and observations.&nbsp;And I hope that when we look back three or four years from now, you will see a broader shift that was effected through a number of carefully considered, linked steps that collectively reflect the evolving nature of our markets and the needs of today&rsquo;s investors.</p>
<h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
<p>Another area of growing importance for our division&mdash;and for the broader financial ecosystem&mdash;is artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>We see AI as a transformative force in the investment management industry&mdash;one that we want to enable, support, and regulate thoughtfully. In this we are aligned with all three pillars of the Administration&rsquo;s AI Action Plan: Accelerating AI Innovation, Building American AI Infrastructure; and Leading in International AI Diplomacy and Security.</p>
<p>We are constantly thinking about how AI can transform disclosure and the investor experience.&nbsp;Some of your clients have received unsolicited calls from me personally, following up on some kind of article or announcement about a novel AI application and asking if your clients would be willing to share their experiences with our team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally, I think that AI can be a boon to effective disclosure.&nbsp;Imagine taking the traditional stack of mutual fund offering documents&mdash;hundreds of pages long, written in dense legal language&mdash;and pairing it with an investment adviser&rsquo;s proprietary AI Agent. Suddenly, you&rsquo;ve moved from a linear, text-heavy disclosure model to an interactive, personalized experience&mdash;one that reflects how people actually consume information today, in the age of iPhones, TikTok, and YouTube.</p>
<p>This shift&mdash;from 20th-century PDFs to 21st- and even 22nd-century AI interfaces&mdash;has the potential to revolutionize investor engagement. But it also raises important questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the AI Agent&rsquo;s output considered marketing material?</li>
<li>Is it investment advice?</li>
<li>When will the AI Agent itself need to be registered?</li>
<li>Who bears liability for bad advice &mdash; the adviser, the developer, or a third-party platform?</li>
</ul>
<p>We know that these are not hypothetical concerns. They are real regulatory questions that we want to actively explore with you.</p>
<p>The Chairman sometimes refers to the SEC as &ldquo;The Innovation Commission. &rdquo;That&rsquo;s real and we want to hear from you. Let&rsquo;s discuss what relief or guidance is needed to support your efforts.</p>
<p>If you want to innovate, this is the Commission that you have been waiting for.&nbsp;</p>

<title>FINRA Orders Securities America To Pay $2 Million In Restitution To Customers, Fines Firm $1 Million For Mutual Fund Supervision Failures - Firm Failed To Reasonably Supervise Recommendations That Customers Switch Between Mutual Fund Families Or Sell Class A Mutual Funds Shortly After Purchasing Them</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/finra-orders-securities-america-to-pay-2-million-in-restitution-to-customers-f-2025123/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/finra-orders-securities-america-to-pay-2-million-in-restitution-to-customers-f-2025123/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>FINRA&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/2025-12/securities-america-awc-2021069337301-20251203.pdf">has ordered Securities America, Inc. to pay $2 million in restitution to its customers and has fined the firm $1 million</a><a>&nbsp;</a>for failing to reasonably supervise Class A mutual fund recommendations, resulting in customers paying unnecessary fees through recommendations that were potentially unsuitable or not in customers&rsquo; best interest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Firms have a fundamental obligation to supervise their representatives&rsquo; recommendations and ensure they serve their customers&rsquo; best interests,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/about/bill-st-louis">Bill St. Louis, Executive Vice President and Head of Enforcement at FINRA</a>. &ldquo;When firms fail to supervise mutual fund recommendations, investors pay the price through unnecessary fees and charges. This $2 million in restitution will make affected customers whole, but prevention should always be the priority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Between January 2018 and June 2024, when it became part of Osaic Wealth, Inc., Securities America effected the purchase of approximately $3.8 billion in Class A mutual fund shares, which generated a substantial portion of the firm&rsquo;s revenue. Nonetheless, the firm failed to implement a system, including written policies and procedures, reasonably designed to supervise recommendations of Class A shares for compliance with FINRA&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/2111">Rule 2111</a>&nbsp;(Suitability) and Regulation Best Interest&rsquo;s Care Obligation. The Care Obligation requires broker-dealers and associated persons to exercise reasonable diligence, care and skill when making recommendations to retail customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Securities America&rsquo;s supervisory system was not reasonably designed to detect switches and short-term sales. Even when the firm identified such trades, the firm failed to reasonably review them to ensure that representatives had reasonably considered fees and commissions. As a result, the firm failed to reasonably supervise recommendations of more than 1,000 Class A mutual fund switches and more than 2,000 short-term sales that were potentially unsuitable or not in the customer&rsquo;s best interest. Collectively, these trades caused customers to pay $2,019,040 in commissions and fees, which will now be returned to them. This matter originated from a FINRA cycle examination.</p>
<p>Mutual funds offer different share classes, each with its own fee structure. Class A mutual fund shares typically collect a front-end sales charge when purchasing the fund, but this fee is typically waived when a customer exchanges a mutual fund for a new fund within the same fund family. Class C shares, by contrast, charge higher ongoing annual fees than Class A shares but typically have no upfront load.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a representative recommends switching from one fund family to another, the customer pays a new front-end sales charge on Class A shares&mdash;a cost that could be avoided by staying within the original fund family. Similarly, selling a Class A mutual fund shortly after buying it creates a risk that a customer has paid an upfront fee without holding the investment long enough to benefit from it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In settling this matter, Securities America consented to the entry of FINRA&rsquo;s findings, without admitting or denying the charges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FINRA makes available disciplinary actions and other information on its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/oversight-enforcement/finra-disciplinary-actions-online">Disciplinary Actions Online</a>&nbsp;database. In addition, FINRA publishes on its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/oversight-enforcement/disciplinary-actions">Monthly Disciplinary Actions</a>&nbsp;page a summary of disciplinary actions against firms and individuals for violations of FINRA rules; federal securities laws, rules and regulations; and the rules of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. FINRA&rsquo;s use of fine monies is limited to specific purposes set forth in its public&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/finra_financial_guiding_principles_0.pdf">Financial Guiding Principles</a>, which are approved by its Board of Governors. FINRA publicly&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/about/annual-reports">itemizes and discloses</a>&nbsp;how it uses fine monies each year.</p>

<li> The most common way of listing is through an IPO, followed by direct listings and private placements.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Delistings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li> In contrast, delistings increased on both RMs and MTF for SMEs in 2024 compared to the previous year. </li>
<li> In 2023 and 2024, going private remained the most common reason for delisting, followed by company wind-up.</li>

<title>ISDA derivatiViews: Addressing Termination Troubles</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-derivativiews-addressing-termination-troubles-2025123/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-derivativiews-addressing-termination-troubles-2025123/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When Enron announced a shock $618 million loss on October 16, 2001, it took a further 47 days until it filed for bankruptcy. For Bear Stearns, it took 266 days between its bailout of a structured credit fund run by Bear Stearns Asset Management and an eventual bridging loan from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on March 14, 2008, and its sale to JP Morgan two days later. Compare that to Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), which collapsed on March 10, 2023, just two days after announcing a loss on the sale of securities and a plan to raise capital that prompted a devastatingly fast outflow of deposits. The SVB episode suggests that financial institution failures seem to be happening in an accelerated time frame, fueled by online banking and social media rumor &ndash; meaning counterparties need to be ready to move very quickly to terminate their derivatives trades if a counterparty gets into trouble.</p>
<p>Derivatives close outs have never been straightforward, but they&rsquo;ve become even more complicated in recent years with the introduction of bank resolution legislation that applies a temporary stay on terminations and the implementation of margin requirements for non-cleared derivatives, which set strict rules on the segregation of collateral. It means firms must understand what they need to do when, and who to involve from the legal, operations and trading teams. Given the accelerated timeline of recent failures, this is not something that can be navigated in real time &ndash; institutions need to have an established and well understood playbook they can draw on.</p>
<p>To help with this, ISDA published a&nbsp;<a href="https://close-out.isda.org/#/">close-out framework</a>&nbsp;last year that sets out key steps in the process, and outlines what actions counterparties need to take at what point. We&rsquo;ve also run a series of close-out seminars over the course of the year in London, New York, Singapore and Sydney, enabling small groups of people from different parts of a financial institution, as well as resolution authorities and other public sector representatives, to come together in a classroom environment and better understand the decisions that need to be made. Overall, 257 people have attended these seminars so far, hopefully enabling those firms to act quickly and decisively in the event the worst happens and a counterparty is heading for failure.</p>
<p>An early but vital part of the close-out process is the delivery of a termination notice &ndash; this sets the clock ticking on when an ISDA Master Agreement can be terminated and the underlying transactions valued. But this theoretically straightforward process has been hampered by the fact that firms can move offices without updating the contact details in their documentation, which must be used as the address for delivery. A further problem occurred during the pandemic, when offices were closed during lockdown, and again in Russia following its invasion of Ukraine, when it became difficult to deliver notices in a hostile environment. The reality is that even short delays in delivery can lead to ballooning risk exposures and costs running into the tens, if not the hundreds, of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>A solution to those particular problems now exists, thanks to the launch of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2025/07/16/isda-launches-notices-hub-and-protocol-to-streamline-delivery-and-receipt-of-critical-notices/">ISDA Notices Hub</a>&nbsp;earlier this year. The Notices Hub is an online platform that enables the rapid delivery and receipt of notices from anywhere in the world, with automatic alerts sent to the receiving entity, reducing the risk of unhedged exposures and potential losses from delivery delays. The Notices Hub also requires users to maintain current physical address details across all their agreements, which can be done via a single entry, creating an up-to-date golden source.</p>
<p>More than 145 buy- and sell-side entities, including 65% of global primary dealers and array of asset managers, pension and insurance companies and hedge funds, have now adhered to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/protocol/isda-2025-notices-hub-protocol/">ISDA 2025 Notices Hub Protocol</a>, which provides the legal framework to allow delivery of notices via the platform, demonstrating strong industry support for the service. If you&rsquo;re interested in adopting, you can contact the team here:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:NoticesHub@isda.org">NoticesHub@isda.org</a>.</p>
<p>Dealing with a termination has never been easy, but the speed with which a failure can occur today means firms need to act quickly, and that means preparation is critical.&nbsp;<a href="https://close-out.isda.org/#/">ISDA&rsquo;s close-out framework</a>, the close-out seminars and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/isda-solutions-infohub/isda-notices-hub/">ISDA Notices Hub</a>&nbsp;are intended to make that process a little easier.</p>
<p>ISDA will run a virtual series of close-out seminars in 2026. Watch out for further details here:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/events">https://www.isda.org/events</a></p>

<title>The EBA Consults On Amendments To Technical Standards On Prudential Requirements For Central Securities Depositories</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today launched a public consultation on draft amendments to the Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on certain prudential requirements for central securities depositories (CSDs) and designated credit institutions offering &lsquo;banking-type ancillary services&rsquo;.</span>&nbsp;<span>The proposed amendments reflect changes introduced by the Central Securities Depositories Regulation (CSDR) Refit, notably allowing&nbsp; banking CSDs to provide banking-type ancillary services to other CSDs. This consultation runs until 3 March 2026.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The proposed updates to the RTS address cases where banking CSDs offer cash accounts directly to participants of other CSDs ( &ldquo;designating CSDs&rdquo;) for settling cash payments in currencies other than the one of where the designating CSD is established. The amendments focus on the limited impact of this arrangement on the risk profile of the banking CSD. The EBA is also updating the RTS to reflect recent changes in the Capital Requirements Regulation and to align references with the amended CSDR text where relevant.</p>
<h4>Consultation process</h4>
<p>Responses to the consultation can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the "send your comments" button on the consultation page. &nbsp;</p>
<p>All contributions will be published after the consultation closes, unless confidentiality is requested. The deadline for the submission of comments is 3 March 2026.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/public-hearing-draft-amending-rts-prudential-requirements-central-securities-depositories" title="Public hearing on draft amending RTS on prudential requirements for central securities depositories">public hearing</a>&nbsp;on this consultation will take place on 12 January 2026 from 14:00 to 15:00 CET. Deadline for registration is 9 January 2026 at 16:00 CET.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<p>The EBA has developed these draft RTS under Article 59(5) of CSDR, which mandates the Authority to further specify details of the frameworks and tools for the monitoring, measuring, management, reporting and public disclosure of the credit and liquidity risks, including those which occur intra-day.</p>
<p>CSDs need to be authorised to provide banking-type ancillary services, which include activities such as offering cash accounts to, and accepting deposits from, participants in a securities settlement system, and providing payment services involving cash and foreign exchange transactions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Speech</h2>
<p>It is such a pleasure to be with you today here in Newcastle. Big thanks to the North East Chamber of Commerce for hosting me.</p>
<p>I will talk about the critical link between financial stability and economic growth. And the important role the financial system plays in supporting innovation and productive finance. I&rsquo;ll be sharing the Financial Policy Committee&rsquo;s (FPC) latest recommendations &ndash; which we published just yesterday &ndash; on how the UK&rsquo;s financial sector can better support sustainable economic growth.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/december/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-womble-bond-dickinson#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>I lead the financial stability directorate at the Bank of England and serve as a member of the FPC. You might be wondering why someone from the Bank of England, whose primary objectives are monetary and financial stability, is speaking to you about growth &ndash; so let me explain.</p>
<h3>The role of financial stability in growth</h3>
<p>Financial stability is a means to an end, not an end in itself. The reason we care about it is that it is indispensable for economic welfare, of which long-term growth is an important aspect. And supporting economic welfare is the ultimate timeless mission of the Bank of England, as set out in our founding charter of 1694 and still in force to this day, which is to &ldquo;promote the good of the people of the United Kingdom&rdquo; by maintaining monetary and financial stability. Put simply, there cannot be sustainable growth over the medium-to-long term without financial stability.</p>
<p>Financial stability makes the UK an attractive place to do business for international investors. And it supports UK firms&rsquo; ability to compete abroad. Higher investment by businesses and saving by households increase the capital available for projects that improve productivity growth. Also a stable financial system supports lower risk and term premia. In turn that lowers the cost of borrowing and improves incentives to fund long-term productive investment.</p>
<p>All this contributes to a reliable and predictable economic environment, which provides companies, customers, and counterparties with reassurance that they can do business here safely and with confidence. These factors all facilitate the investment that drives long-term growth. And the benefits of a strong domestic financial system are even more pronounced when global risks and uncertainty are elevated. You can find more detail on the FPC&rsquo;s assessment of global risks in the Financial Stability Report (FSR) we published yesterday.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/december/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-womble-bond-dickinson#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[2]</a></sup>&nbsp;Against a backdrop of heightened global risks and fiscal pressures, a strong financial system becomes even more important since it can help the economy through turbulent times.</p>
<p>So those are the benefits of financial stability. The thing is when you have it you don&rsquo;t realise, people just take it for granted. But when you don&rsquo;t have it, everybody notices. And then as time goes by, memories fade and people tend to forget the costs of instability. The Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008 is a stark example of these costs. Financial crises don&rsquo;t just make us worse off in the moment. They leave deep scars on the growth potential of an economy. They tighten credit conditions, suppress investment, and distort capital allocation. The cost of the GFC was staggering, and there was a very persistent slowdown. It took 5 years for GDP to recover to its pre-crisis level. Crises disrupt essential financial services, reduce fiscal space, increase pressure on public finances, and cause significant economic hardship to many households &ndash; in ways that cast a very long shadow still lingering to this day. While pre-crisis growth may not have been fully sustainable, the scarring from the crisis played a major role in the weak growth that followed.</p>
<h3>The role of growth in financial stability</h3>
<p>We can all agree that financial instability is best avoided!</p>
<p>But conversely, equally important is the role that growth plays in supporting financial stability. Strong economic performance supports corporate earnings, employment and investment, and government finances. All of this makes actors in the real economy more resilient. And in turn low loss rates on banks&rsquo; books support their capacity to lend further to households and businesses. Conversely, evidence suggests that persistently weak economic demand may create an environment that pressures financial firms to take more risks than they would otherwise deem reasonable or sustainable, as they seek to increase returns on investment. Sometimes responding to short-term investor pressure by &ldquo;picking up pennies in front of a steamroller&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Productivity is a crucial driver of economic growth. But over the past 15 years, productivity growth in the UK had been low by historical standards and relative to some other advanced economies. Between 1997 and 2002 UK growth in GDP per hour worked averaged 3%. Between 2003 and 2007 it was 1.6%. Between 2010 and 2019 it dropped to 0.6%. And between 2020 and 2023 it hovered around 0.9%.</p>
<p>Not great.</p>
<p>The benefits of higher productivity are wide-ranging. As firms become more productive, they can expand operations, enlarge their revenue base, undertake more investment, innovate, and employ people. Improvements in overall productivity growth can also ease fiscal pressures and in turn support the resilience of government bond markets. For example, participants in these markets, many of which are increasingly prepared to dip in and out of positions, watch economic growth projections closely to judge how much they (as investors) are willing to charge governments to borrow. In turn, the cost of government borrowing affects the costs and availability of borrowing for households and businesses, and their ability to access financial services.</p>
<p>So improving productivity in the UK is essential to support economic growth, and in turn financial stability. Because it ultimately supports the resilience of systemic markets, of households, and of businesses.</p>
<h3>The financial sector&rsquo;s role</h3>
<p>Productivity growth is determined by a very broad range of factors beyond finance, such as trade conditions, scientific and technological innovation, and human capital. But the financial sector also has an important role to play. It provides services to UK households and businesses &ndash; such as lending, saving, insurance, and payments &ndash; that enable transactions, risk management, and investment. In particular, the sector provides financing solutions for investment in capital and technology that underpin innovation, technological progress, and in turn productivity improvements.</p>
<p>When these services are disrupted, for example due to frictions in the system &ndash; &lsquo;sand in the gears&rsquo; &ndash; the financial system will not be fulfilling its role of serving households and businesses as efficiently as it should. This will get in the way of productivity improvements, hold back economic growth, and ultimately be unhelpful for financial stability.</p>
<h3>The role of the FPC</h3>
<p>Given the importance of the financial system for both stability and growth, what is the FPC&rsquo;s role?</p>
<p>Our goal is to ensure that the financial system provides vital services to households and businesses in all circumstances, both good times and bad. The most important thing we can do to support growth is to ensure financial stability.</p>
<p>One way we do this is by identifying, monitoring, and addressing systemic risks. By that we mean the risks that affect the functioning of the financial system as a whole, not just individual institutions. Just as you would purchase insurance to protect your home or business from unexpected shocks, the FPC works to ensure the system as a whole has the resilience needed to withstand stress and help the economy through it.</p>
<p>For example, we run stress tests and exploratory scenario exercises to ensure banks, insurers, and key markets can withstand shocks and self-stabilise without cutting lending or amplifying stress. Our latest bank capital stress test results show that banks continue to be strong enough to do that.</p>
<p>Actions taken since the Global Financial Crisis have significantly strengthened system-wide resilience. Despite multiple shocks in recent years, UK households and corporates have been resilient so far, and the financial system has been able to continue to lend and support them during these shocks. Let me bring this to life with a couple of examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>About half of owner-occupied mortgages currently in arrears were originated before the 2008 crisis, when today&rsquo;s regulations and standards were not in place. And the yearly average number of repossessions &ndash; so people losing their homes &ndash; between 2014, when measures to control the sustainability of lending in the housing market were implemented, and 2019 were 76% lower than over the preceding 26 years.</li>
<li>During the Covid-19 pandemic, lenders offered mortgage payment holidays for up to six months. Take up of that offer peaked at nearly 1.9 million households. It&rsquo;s only because banks had become strong enough that they could afford to do that.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also review our measures and policies to build resilience to ensure they remain effective and proportionate as the financial system evolves. So that we achieve the optimal amount of resilience at minimum cost. Recent steps include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reducing the frequency of our main bank capital stress tests to every other year, thereby reducing the burden on banks considerably.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/december/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-womble-bond-dickinson#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[3]</a></sup></li>
<li>Recommending amendments to the implementation of the FPC&rsquo;s loan-to-income (LTI) flow limit to allow flexibility for individual mortgage lenders to increase their share of lending at high LTIs while ensuring the aggregate flow remains consistent with the limit of 15%.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/december/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-womble-bond-dickinson#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[4]</a></sup></li>
<li>Updating our assessment of optimal bank capital requirements. We have just cut our key benchmark for the appropriate overall level of bank Tier 1 capital requirements from 14% to 13% of risk-weighted assets. Because some banks are now less systemically important, balance sheets have changed, and risk measurement has improved (including as we implement the international bank capital standard, Basel 3.1). And we&rsquo;ll be actively considering feedback we&rsquo;ve received on interactions, proportionality, and complexity in several areas of the capital framework, including on buffer usability, the implementation of the leverage ratio, and considering how capital requirements&nbsp;related to domestic exposures interact.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/december/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-womble-bond-dickinson#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[5]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond building resilience in times of stress, the FPC is also concerned with frictions in normal times. The sand in the gears that gets in the way of the efficient flow of financial services. Frictions can be regulatory or structural factors that make it harder than it should be for firms to provide or receive credit or services. Our goal is not only to prevent disruption during shocks but also to ensure the system can allocate resources and share risks efficiently in good times.</p>
<h3>The Chancellor&rsquo;s remit letter</h3>
<p>A year ago, with the FPC&rsquo;s objectives in mind, the Chancellor of the Exchequer asked the FPC to evaluate in 2025 where the financial sector could better contribute to sustainable economic growth, without undermining financial stability.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/december/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-womble-bond-dickinson#footnote-7" id="footnote-ref-7"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>The FPC agreed that its work on growth in 2025 would focus on identifying barriers to the provision of credit and financial services to households and businesses. In particular, to companies with the greatest potential to contribute to improvements in the country&rsquo;s productivity growth. And we considered solutions to these challenges &ndash; what can be done to grease the wheels.</p>
<p>To identify these barriers and solutions, we engaged &ndash; in collaboration with the government &ndash; with over 50 financial sector, government, and academic groups to further understand the challenges that high-growth<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/december/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-womble-bond-dickinson#footnote-8" id="footnote-ref-8"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[7]</a></sup>&nbsp;firms may face in contributing to sustainable growth. We also conducted a deep dive into the existing literature to understand the financing barriers that these firms face.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/december/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-womble-bond-dickinson#footnote-9" id="footnote-ref-9"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[8]</a></sup>&nbsp;Personally, I have found my regional visits to businesses across the country, including via the local contacts of our agency networks, particularly insightful in really getting to the bottom of those challenges, and to generate ideas to address them. The engagement from businesses has been terrific, and we&rsquo;re very grateful for it.</p>
<p>Through this work, we agreed on three priority areas. We selected these as they are directly related to the FPC's remit: as we went through the range of frictions and barriers in the provision of vital services and credit to the real economy, we judged these three to be particularly material:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Barriers faced by pension funds and insurers in supporting long-term capital investment</span>&nbsp;in the UK economy. We chose this because investment by insurers and pension funds can provide stable sources of capital that are needed to improve the infrastructure that supports wider economic activity, the development of new technologies, and the expansion of the most productive firms.</li>
<li><span>Challenges for high-growth firms</span>&nbsp;in accessing finance as funding rounds scale up. That is because these firms make an outsize contribution to employment and growth, to innovation, and to the deployment of new technologies and business models.</li>
<li><span>The responsible adoption of innovative technology across the financial sector</span>. We have focused on this because responsible adoption of innovative technology &ndash; such as artificial intelligence (AI) and distributed ledger technologies (DLT) &ndash; has the potential to reshape productivity growth by bringing significantly greater efficiencies and harnessing new technological developments.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let me now outline some of the frictions or barriers in these areas, and our recommendations going forward.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/december/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-womble-bond-dickinson#footnote-10" id="footnote-ref-10"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[9]</a></sup></p>
<h3>Recommendations</h3>
<p>So, what do we recommend - and why?</p>
<p><span>Investment of long-term capital into assets which increase the productive capacity of the economy, including to high-growth firms.</span></p>
<h4>Challenge</h4>
<p>There is growing need in the UK for more long-term investment capital to tackle challenges like climate change, infrastructure improvement, the development of innovation, and the deployment of new technology. More investment from insurers and pension funds &ndash; who are natural long-term investors &ndash; would give businesses stable funding while offering better asset returns.</p>
<p>Yet, compared to their international peers, UK insurers and pension funds invest relatively little in UK productive assets such as infrastructure, property, and private equity &ndash; who themselves are key investors in larger high-growth firms. Let&rsquo;s take investment in private equity firms as an example. They are key providers of &lsquo;patient&rsquo; long term investment capital that has the potential to benefit long-run economic growth.&nbsp;Indeed, there&rsquo;s much international evidence that suggests businesses financed via private markets, including private equity, demonstrate higher levels of productivity, with investment increasing after private market involvement. But analysis by New Financial and the Purposeful Company shows that pension funds in Canada, Finland, the US, Taiwan, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Denmark, South Korea, and Australia allocate a greater proportion of assets to private equity than UK pension funds. UK funds allocate 6% to private equity, for Canada it is over 20%. The synergy between pension funds or insurers and private equity makes sense intuitively, although it needs to be exploited safely, as discussed in our FSRs. And finally in terms of international comparison, research shows that just 22% of UK workplace DC pension assets are invested domestically, compared to 44% in New Zealand and 55% in Australia.</p>
<p>A key barrier to additional investment into assets that support productivity is that UK defined contribution pension funds are often small and lack scale, limiting their ability to invest in riskier, higher-return assets. This preference for safer assets limits their ability to make long-term investments in the UK economy. Insurers also report that there are few domestic opportunities that align with their expertise and meet their risk and return requirements.</p>
<h4>Solutions</h4>
<p>One way to address these challenges is to make defined contribution (DC) pension funds larger and more sophisticated, which would help reduce costs. The Government&rsquo;s Pension Schemes Bill supports this by encouraging consolidation, merging smaller DC schemes into larger, better-managed funds. DC pension products could also be redesigned to reduce the need for daily liquidity requirements and enable greater pooling of risk through fund-of-funds or securitisation. All this enhances pension funds&rsquo; investment firepower by removing the cost inefficiencies that come with fragmentation.</p>
<p>Raising awareness among pension funds and insurers about the opportunities in venture and growth finance &ndash; including the role of public-private partnerships &ndash; could also unlock new investment. Finally, further research to understand behavioural and regulatory barriers that prevent domestic capital from flowing into high-growth firms can help ensure obstacles are addressed effectively.</p>
<p>Regulatory changes are supporting UK insurers to innovate in their investments. In the view of the insurance industry, Solvency UK reforms should support delivery of the UK insurance industry&rsquo;s commitment to invest&nbsp;at least &pound;100 billion in UK productive assets over the next decade.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/december/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-womble-bond-dickinson#footnote-11" id="footnote-ref-11"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[10]</a></sup>&nbsp;It is important that this happens. Success depends on the decisions of pension funds and insurers themselves, their investment management policies, and the availability of appropriate investment opportunities.</p>
<p>Further work is likely required to encourage the allocation of pension and insurer assets to high-growth firms. Collaboration between public and private sectors will be needed to identify barriers to that, and to develop solutions that channel investments from defined contributions pension schemes or insurers to funding vehicles for high-growth firms.</p>
<p>And we should ask ourselves the same questions about other investment opportunities which also appear to be natural matches between long-term economic priorities and the long-term focus of insurance and pension funds. For example, in the housing market, housing associations play an important role in unlocking the building of new homes &ndash; which itself has a bearing on house prices and therefore first-time buyers&rsquo; ability to access the mortgage market. A common theme we hear through our regional visits is that delays in building new homes have often been caused by lack of demand from housing associations in funding the social housing part of new buildings. Is this due to a lack of available funding, and is there a natural match between the long-term focus of insurance and pensions funds and the significant long-term investment need (followed by steady income stream) that characterises housing associations? Could any frictions or inefficiencies here be removed?</p>
<h4>The supply of debt or equity finance to high-growth firms including start-ups and scale-ups.</h4>
<h4>Challenge</h4>
<p>Let me now turn to the second area where we are highlighting frictions, which is financing for high-growth firms. When we speak with them, we hear a number of issues.</p>
<p>First, they face growing challenges in accessing domestic finance as funding rounds get larger, especially from domestic sources. While the UK has the third-largest venture capital (VC) market in the world and a growing venture debt market, the level of venture investment per capital lags behind peers. Research by the British Business Bank (BBB) finds that UK VC investment is around 0.7% of GDP, around 10% less than in the US over 2022-24 on a relative basis.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/december/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-womble-bond-dickinson#footnote-12" id="footnote-ref-12"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>These challenges are compounded by the fragmentation of the UK&rsquo;s funding ecosystem. There are multiple agencies and schemes, creating a complex, inefficient landscape that SMEs and high-growth firms struggle to navigate.</p>
<p>And whilst a number of banks have their start-up units, in practice locally SMEs often tell us that there simply isn&rsquo;t a banker for them to talk to. With the closures of bank branches, financing has moved more online and away from traditional relationship methods of local businesses having a local banker whom they view as a long-term partner who knows their business really well. In addition, traditional bank lending can also be less well suited to high-growth firms because, although these firms are either growing rapidly or have the potential to grow rapidly, they have a limited trading history, they are not yet consistently profitable, and they have low levels of the type of collateral that banks would traditionally require as security against the loans.</p>
<p>Many high-growth firms face difficulties in finding assets that lenders want as collateral on which to secure lending.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/december/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-womble-bond-dickinson#footnote-13" id="footnote-ref-13"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[12]</a></sup>&nbsp;The assets that they often do have, for example intellectual property, are not commonly accepted as collateral due to valuation difficulties, the lack of standardised frameworks for assessing IP risk, and recovery constraints that banks face in case of default.</p>
<p>Likewise, at the other end, financing firms find it hard to identify the right businesses to invest in. When we speak with private equity firms, we hear a clear appetite to invest in the UK &ndash; there is obviously capital ready to be deployed. However, many private equity firms struggle to identify effective ways to ensure funds are directed to the right opportunities.</p>
<h4>Solutions</h4>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t a single solution to these challenges. But we highlight several things that could help the financial sector provide the breadth and depth of services that high-growth firms require.</p>
<p>One solution may be greater use of public-private partnership funding initiatives to channel financing to SMEs in support of productivity improvements. We can learn from international experience here: Germany&rsquo;s KfW, provides long-term financing and co-investment to support SMEs and innovation, while U.S. programs, run by the Small Business Administration and the State Small Business Credit Initiative, offer loan guarantees and channel private capital into venture and growth funds. The British Business Bank could build on these international experiences and play an important role in this context, as could the private equity industry. Public-private partnerships are powerful because they share the load and give private investors the confidence to take on bold, long-term projects that they might otherwise shy away from in the absence of the public sector&rsquo;s involvement and endorsement.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you can detect a theme here, as solutions to support financing for high-growth firms also bear similarities with those required to support pension funds and insurers in channelling domestic capital towards long-term domestic investment &ndash; which I mentioned previously.</p>
<p>There is also space for additional research and policy work on barriers facing high-growth firms in accessing finance. This includes work to better understand impediments to lending backed by intellectual property (IP), such as a lack of information to value and assess an IP&rsquo;s value as collateral that will be increasingly needed as the intangible knowledge economy becomes an even more important part of UK growth. An important government initiative in this space is a working group exploring how best to support lending to IP-rich sectors.</p>
<p>The Bank is also working with the Treasury to explore how the ring-fencing regime could be further reformed to allow ring-fenced banks to provide more products and services to UK businesses.</p>
<p>I would also note the relevance here of the announcement in the Autumn 2025 Budget published last week of a new objective for the British Business Bank to mobilise institutional capital at scale, and of a package of measures to support entrepreneurship.</p>
<h4>Supporting the responsible adoption of innovative technology by the financial sector.</h4>
<h4>Challenge</h4>
<p>Finally, the responsible adoption of innovative technology in the financial sector is the third area where we are highlighting frictions. In particular two key challenges:</p>
<p>First, the high cost of cyber-resilience. Tech-heavy firms, especially fintechs, face significant costs in protecting themselves against cyber threats. Rising geopolitical tensions and rapid technological advances increase the risk of operational disruptions. Many cyber-attacks have targeted third-party suppliers of larger corporates as a way of penetrating their clients&rsquo; systems. As such a potential point of entry for these attacks, it is therefore important that suppliers themselves &ndash; a number of which can be fintechs &ndash; have robust cyber-defences in place. The costs and risks from cyber-attacks are particularly high for firms that rely on technology as their core business. But the costs and resources required for cyber-defence can prove a real financial and operational headwind for the profitability of small fintechs looking to grow.</p>
<p>The second key friction we highlight in relation to the adoption of innovative technology in the UK&rsquo;s economy is the need for a modernised UK payment infrastructure. Expensive payment systems are a significant barrier. The UK needs faster, seamless, frictionless, and secure payments to support economic activity. This requires coordinated action and investment to build next-generation infrastructure that drives innovation, competition, and security.</p>
<h4>Solutions</h4>
<p>Because cyber and innovation risks are complex and evolving, solutions require joint efforts between the financial sector and public authorities. Possible actions include publishing and signposting further information on cyber threats, issuing guidance targeting fintechs looking to build cyber resilience, helping them navigate through what they&rsquo;ve got to do, pointing them to the right resources, and creating innovation sandboxes to test new digital business models.</p>
<p>Important initiatives in this respect include the National Cyber Security Centre&rsquo;s work to provide advice and guidance on cyber security for SMEs, and the work of the Cross-Market Operational Resilience Group (CMORG) to develop solutions and share knowledge within the financial sector. Targeted and signposted advice and guidance for fintechs on cyber-defence would be a valuable next step for public and industry bodies.</p>
<p>The Bank is also working with UK authorities and industry to deliver innovation in money and payments through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supporting the government&rsquo;s National Payments Vision, chairing the newly established Retail Payments Infrastructure Board and expanding Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS).</li>
<li>Delivering practical advancements in the UK&rsquo;s payments infrastructure by launching the Digital Pound Lab and DLT innovation challenge.</li>
<li>Facilitating the development and adoption of new forms of digital money. This includes the development with the FCA of a regulatory regime for stablecoins. And working closely with the industry as banks develop proposals for the tokenisation of deposits. Because it offers the advantages of distributed ledger technology as well as the benefits of traditional forms of money such as the deposit insurance provided by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. Tokenised deposits offer programmability, instant settlement, and customer familiarity.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>So let me wrap up here. Growth and financial stability go hand in hand. The most important contribution the FPC can make to growth is to ensure a stable financial system. In addition, we work to implement efficiently the measures that build resilience to shocks as the financial system evolves, by reducing unnecessary regulatory burdens. And on top of that, the FPC also targets frictions that limit the efficient flow of financial services in normal times.</p>
<p>It is our job to worry. But we worry not only about risks and the impact of shocks in bad times but also about not enough risk being taken in good times.</p>
<p>This year, drawing on external engagement and research, the FPC has focused on understanding impediments and identifying opportunities for the UK financial services sector to further support sustainable economic growth.</p>
<p>Given the importance of productivity improvements for growth and in turn financial stability, we focused specifically on frictions in the system that hinder the provision of financial services to areas of the economy that are key to productivity growth: investment in long-term capital from pension funds and insurers; the financing of high-growth firms; and the responsible adoption of innovative technology.</p>
<p>The Bank of England will continue to build on this work, including by monitoring the progress against the issues identified, considering further actions that could support the supply of long-term productive finance, and delivering research on growth as part of its future research agenda.</p>
<p>The public and private sectors, as well as the academic world, all have an important role to play in working with businesses to bring to life solutions to these barriers. These solutions are within reach, and in aggregate they would help the financial sector contribute to unlock a meaningful share of the untapped potential in the UK&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Christopher Goodspeed, Niamh Reynolds, Katie Fortune, Colm Manning, Richard Button, Rashmi Harimohan, Sudipto Karmakar, Isabelle Roland, David Bailey, Isaac Orszag-Land and Sarah Ashley for their assistance in preparing these remarks.</p>

<title>Vienna Stock Exchange - Stock Market Taboo 2025: The "Tariff Hammer" Has Struck</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/vienna-stock-exchange-stock-market-taboo-2025-the-tariff-hammer-has-struck-2025123/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/vienna-stock-exchange-stock-market-taboo-2025-the-tariff-hammer-has-struck-2025123/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The stock market taboo word of 2025 has been crowned: the "tariff hammer" has hit the mood of the financial community. Threats or the actual implementation of import duties, counter-tariffs and protectionist measures have caused great volatility on markets worldwide this year. The ongoing uncertainty and heavy media coverage of the issue may have been too much for domestic investors. At the same time, trade barriers run counter to the basic understanding of many stock market participants, who favour open markets and free trade.</p>
<p>"Despite the supposed tariff hammer, many international indices are at record levels, including the ATX. I consider it positive that many investors are not letting themselves be unsettled and have confidence in long-term global economic growth. Equities enable anyone to participate", says Christoph Boschan, CEO of Wiener B&ouml;rse AG.</p>
<h2>About the stock market taboo word</h2>
<p>Since 2017, the Vienna Stock Exchange has asked the domestic financial community to nominate the stock market taboo word of the year. The jury's decision is based primarily on topicality, relevance and linguistics. The "tariff hammer" is the first stock market taboo word to win the title for the second time from a thematic perspective: In 2018, during Donald Trump's first term as US president, "punitive tariffs" secured the title of stock market taboo word of the year. "Tariff hammer" follows on from last year's winner, "AI bubble". Other stock market taboos to date:</p>
<ul class="list-normal">
<li>2023: "Stagflation"</li>
<li>2022: "Excess profits tax"</li>
<li>2021: "Specter of inflation"</li>
<li>2020: "Corona-related"</li>
<li>2019: "Brexit"</li>
<li>2018: "Punitive tariffs"</li>
<li>2017: "Negative interest rates"</li>
</ul>

<p>Today the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published assessment reports on the implementation of the Net Stable Funding Ratio and the large exposures framework in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The UK's implementation of the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) standard and large exposures framework (LEX) was assessed as largely compliant with the global standards set by the Basel Committee, which is one notch below the highest overall grade (<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d602.htm"><span class="firstword">NSFR</span></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d603.htm"><span class="firstword">LEX</span></a>).</p>
<p>The Basel Committee's assessment reports form part of its Regulatory Consistency Assessment Programme (RCAP), a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/implementation/rcap_jurisdictional.htm"><span class="firstword">series</span>&nbsp;of reports</a>&nbsp;on the implementation of Basel standards by member jurisdictions of the Basel Committee. With publication of these assessment reports today, the Basel Committee concluded the jurisdictional assessment of the net stable funding ratio and the large exposures framework in all member jurisdictions. In line with its work programme, the Committee initiated jurisdictional assessments of Basel III revisions to risk weighted assets and the leverage ratio in Q4 of 2025.</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Fiserv Small Business Index at 142</i></li>
<li><i style="font-family: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">Year-over-year sales grew +0.8%</i></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.fiserv.com/" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Fiserv, Inc.</a>&nbsp;(NASDAQ: FISV), a leading global provider of payments and financial services technology, has published the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fiserv.com/en/fiserv-small-business-index.html" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Fiserv Small Business Index</a>&nbsp;for November 2025, with the seasonally adjusted Index dropping a point to 142.</p>
<p>Year-over-year sales in November (+0.8%) grew slightly despite transactions (-0.7%) declining compared to 2024. Month-over-month sales (-0.6%) and transactions (-0.7%) both declined. Average ticket sizes rose (+1.5%) compared to November 2024.</p>
<p>In an otherwise slow month for growth, a strong Black Friday helped buoy small business sales &ndash; with both restaurants and retailers benefitting during the popular shopping holiday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the holiday shopping season in full swing, consumers continue to be pragmatic in their spending &ndash; opting for lower-cost options, and prioritizing the essentials over discretionary items,&rdquo; said Prasanna Dhore, Chief Data Officer, Fiserv.</p>
<p><span>Key Takeaways</span></p>
<p><span>Thanksgiving and Black Friday Boost Holiday Sales</span></p>
<p>Small business holiday sales showed solid early gains during the long Thanksgiving weekend, but lost momentum following a strong Black Friday. Thanksgiving Day saw Core Retail (which excludes volatile categories like Gasoline) sales increase (+3.9%), which helped lift overall Retail (+1.9%). Black Friday maintained strong growth across Core Retail (+3.1%) and Restaurants (+2.9%). However, Retail momentum slowed over the weekend, with small business sales falling (-2.1%) on Saturday.</p>
<p><span>Increased Foot Traffic Offsets Lower Average Tickets at Retail</span></p>
<p>Seasonally adjusted Retail sales were down (-1.1%) year over year in November, despite a +1.1% jump in foot traffic. The decline in growth was driven by a significant decrease in average ticket size (-2.3%). Compared to October, sales were down -1.4%, a result of lower foot traffic (-0.8%) and lower average ticket sizes (-0.7%). The only retail categories showing annual sales growth were General Merchandise and Sporting Goods (+2.3% and +3.3%, respectively).</p>
<p><span>Diners Continue to Seek Low-cost Options</span></p>
<p>Small business restaurant sales in November were nearly flat (-0.1%) year over year and compared to October (-0.1%). Year-over-year foot traffic fell (-1.7%) while average tickets grew (+1.6%). Compared to October, foot traffic declined (-0.7%) as average tickets nudged higher (+0.6%). Limited-Service restaurants (+0.4%) continued to outperform Full-Service establishments (-0.7%) on an annual basis.</p>
<p><span>Spending on Essentials Continues to Outperform Discretionary</span></p>
<p>Discretionary sales growth was muted (-0.1%) while spending on Essentials grew (+2.1%) year over year. Total Goods sales declined (-0.5%) year over year while Services grew (+1.4%).</p>

<p>The Fiserv Small Business Index is published during the first week of every month and differentiated by its direct aggregation of consumer spending activity within the U.S. small business ecosystem.

<p>Benchmarked to 2019, the Fiserv Small Business Index provides a numeric value measuring consumer spending, with an accompanying transaction index measuring customer traffic. Through a simple interface, users can access data by region, state, and/or across business types categorized by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Level-6 Classification System. The Fiserv Small Business Index provides visibility into more than 70 industries, allowing users to track sales trends with precision and understand the diverse dynamics shaping the U.S. small business economy.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) has introduced Commercial Paper (CP) listings, following approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission, marking another significant expansion of its product suite in a year defined by accelerated innovation. This development deepens Nigeria&rsquo;s short-term debt market and reinforces NGX&rsquo;s role as a versatile hub for capital formation.<br />&nbsp;<br />The new listing window enables corporates and issuers to list and trade both conventional and non-interest commercial papers directly on the Exchange, providing investors with enhanced visibility, increased transparency and improved liquidity. It also advances NGX&rsquo;s broader strategy of diversifying its offerings and strengthening the architecture of the domestic capital market.</p>
<p>Commenting on the launch, Temi Popoola, Group Managing Director and CEO of NGX Group, commended the Securities and Exchange Commission for its commitment to enabling market advancement and fostering healthy competition across the ecosystem. He stated: &ldquo;The introduction of Commercial Paper listings is a pivotal step in our strategy to position NGX as a comprehensive capital-markets infrastructure that accelerates capital formation across Africa. As we continue strengthening the foundations of a transparent, technology-driven and inclusive marketplace, our focus remains on building a system that supports sustainable growth, enhances market resilience and unlocks new opportunities for the broader economy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Commercial Papers (CPs) are short-term, unsecured debt instruments issued by corporates to finance working capital needs and other short-term obligations. Typically maturing within 270 days, CPs are issued at a discount and redeemed at face value upon maturity offering corporates a cost-effective alternative to bank loans and providing investors with attractive short-term investment opportunities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also speaking on the development, Jude Chiemeka, CEO, Nigerian Exchange Limited, stated: &ldquo;The introduction of Commercial Paper listings represents a major advancement in our mission to provide a full spectrum of capital-raising solutions for businesses. This platform enhances transparency in the debt market and supports corporates seeking efficient access to funding outside traditional banking channels, while offering investors credible short-term investment options. NGX will continue to engage with corporates, intermediaries, and investors to deepen liquidity and participation in Nigeria&rsquo;s debt capital market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Olufemi Shobanjo, CEO of NGX Regulation Limited, added that strong oversight will remain central as the market evolves. &ldquo;Our priority is to maintain high standards of disclosure, promote accountability and safeguard investor confidence while contributing to market deepening,&rdquo; he emphasised.<br />&nbsp;<br />With the inclusion of commercial papers, NGX now offers an integrated environment spanning equities, fixed income, ETFs, derivatives and short-term debt advancing its ambition to be a one-stop marketplace for capital across asset classes.</p>

<h2>Speech</h2>
<p>Many thanks for having me along. It is great to be here at ISDA. I&rsquo;ll cover three broad things on Basel 3.1 today. First, where do we stand in our implementation in the UK. Second, a reminder of what we&rsquo;re trying to achieve with the new FRTB rules. And third, something on the areas in FRTB where we might need to look a little closer in due course. I&rsquo;ll finish by broadening a little and looking beyond FRTB, although many would say there is nothing else in life.</p>
<p>First, on where things stand. Basel 3.1 remains a key part of the post crisis reforms. Risk measurement, fundamentally, needs to be accurate. And we had lost confidence in this post GFC, including because of the variability across firms in risk weights that comes from using modelled approaches. That concern speaks to getting Basel 3.1 done as soon as possible.</p>
<p>But if Basel 3.1 feels to you like the project that comes quite close to never ending, believe me when I say that &lsquo;I sympathize&rsquo;. It is in everyone&rsquo;s interests now that its implementation is finished as soon as possible, so that we can all move on, with the benefits of the new regime safely tucked away. We have the vast majority of our rules in the UK entering force in January 2027, and for those there will not be any further substantive changes to what we have already published. For those, firms should be preparing now.</p>
<p>They will adopt legal force when the Treasury makes the SI that allows us to finalise those rules, and we will publish the final rules in Q1 next year. That will give firms a year to prepare before they need to report to us on the new regime, and allow us to undertake the necessary Pillar 2a reset that we promised, to make the Basel 3.1 approach complete and avoid any double counting with the more accurate risk weights generated by Pillar 1. As I&rsquo;ve said a few times now, this approach to avoiding double counting has been a fundamental principle for us since the start on Basel 3.1, with no need to hold capital twice against the same risk.</p>
<p>The only part of the regime in our proposals entering force after January 2027 is the modelled part of the market risk rules &ndash; the FRTB &ndash; which enters force in January 2028. That is to allow us to finalise those in light of any developments in other jurisdictions, including the US and the EU. The FRTB applies to truly global and cross border business, and so there is real value in having consistency across major jurisdictions. My sense is that both the US and EU are making good progress in their plans.</p>
<p>That brings me to my second topic of the FRTB and why we have it. The big point is FRTB was called fundamental for a reason. I would argue there were three main GFC related issues it was trying to fix:</p>
<ol>
<li>There was a trading book / banking book boundary which was too subjective, leaving the door open to an uneven treatment across firms and for risks to end up in a part of the capital framework that isn&rsquo;t designed to deal with them. That has been addressed in the FRTB with a much clearer boundary.</li>
<li>The existing internal model approach missed important risks, for example the different levels of liquidity of trading book positions, and was a bit of a smashing together of elements that have been added to the rulebook over time as and when we spotted gaps in the framework. This has been made more coherent now in the FRTB.</li>
<li>There was not a standardised approach that acts as a risk sensitive alternative to modelling, meaning big banks had little choice but to use models. And that means supervisors couldn&rsquo;t realistically challenge firms, and ultimately stop firms from using modelled approaches, even if the models weren&rsquo;t performing well. The FRTB greatly improves the standardised approach.</li>
</ol>
<p>So we wanted to fix those issues by having a better-defined boundary between the trading book and the banking book, have a new standardised approach that proves to be a credible alternative to modelling, and having built a credible SA, set a firmer and higher bar for modelling to improve standards. This includes recognising that some risks can&rsquo;t be modelled well and therefore need capital add-ons. That, of course, is an approach we have been taking with UK firms for some time now, and so is not a particularly new element for the UK, and less of a big change here.</p>
<p>All of this adds up to being an important shift. A key goal &ndash; implicit in the new framework &ndash; is that modelling should be perfectly achievable for good models, but banks should not just assume they can always use models regardless of whether those models are good, and up to scratch.</p>
<p>That brings me to my third topic of how well does the FRTB measure up to those aims?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a little difficult to fully explore this given it isn&rsquo;t in force yet. But firms do know the direction of travel, and have been working on preparing, which does give us some information.</p>
<p>But perhaps the place to start with this topic is a brief description of how we got to where we are today. Post GFC, we had identified a range of high-level issues, as I&rsquo;ve just described, that needed fixing. The Basel Committee set the appropriate working group, chaired by my excellent colleague Derek Nesbitt, to work in identifying fixes. Perhaps more so than in other parts of the rulebook, it appears quite possible in the market risk world to be able to identify changes and fixes that look good on paper and should work well, but generate a different outcome in practice. The early efforts of this Basel group were criticised for being misplaced in practice by industry, so Derek&rsquo;s group made very extensive use of industry expertise in designing the new rules. Meaning that the new FRTB had a very heavy dose of industry input in its design, and industry wisdom.</p>
<p>So it should work well. But as I said, what works on paper, even when designed with industry input, is not guaranteed to be perfect in practice, as annoying as that is.</p>
<p>What do early preparations of firms tell us how well the FRTB achieves the aims I outlined earlier. Well, I think the two of the aims are broadly in good shape. We do have a much better defined and clearer boundary established, and the new standardized approaches are more risk sensitive.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the other aim around modelling where some questions seem to be lingering.</p>
<p>To be clear, the aims for the modelling component &ndash; the new IMA &ndash; are good. And many of the most significant improvements, such as moving to a single, new type of model for the market risk component, and the improved way that liquidity is incorporated into it, seem to work well. But the question that is emerging for a small number of parts of the framework, such as the P&amp;L Attribution Test, is have we put the bar for modelling at the right level and is it too complex? As I&rsquo;ve already argued, despite much of the design of the IMA reflecting firms feedback as the standard was re-worked, that in and of itself is not a guarantee that it will work well in practice. In truth, as is often the case with changes that look good on paper, it needs some data and in practice experience to really assess that.</p>
<p>And there, the struggle has been to get good quality and convincing data. The good news is that is now starting to come through, as firms invest in getting models ready. This investment in getting ready is important, so that we can understand what can be fixed just by a bit of persistence, and what might need to be fixed through possible changes. Meaning it is looking easier to check whether the bar is where we had intended it to be.</p>
<p>And its for that reason that, in the early part of the Summer, we announced we would be implementing our entire Basel 3.1 package in January 2027, as previously announced, but we consulted on postponing the IMA modelled approach until January 2028. In the meantime, the idea is that firms can stay on their current market risk models. This would also allow time for greater clarity to emerge in other jurisdictions on their own implementation in this area as well, as consistency really matters. We will publish our final approach on that consultation with the rest of the final package in Q1 next year, meaning that we are on track for our January 2027 implementation date for the main package.</p>
<p>As with all of our Basel 3.1 package, we have tried to write the FRTB rules in as clear a way as we can. But there is no avoiding that they are quite involved. And no matter how clearly we try and write the rules, there will be aspects that firms want to clarify with us. By this, I don&rsquo;t mean re-opening. We need a strong focus on getting the package across the line now, rather than continually re-opening. But clarifying is a distinct and very legitimate need. To accommodate this, in the PRA we&rsquo;ve launched a new series of Banking Policy Roundtables. There are three per year, rotating the organization of them across UK finance, ISDA/AFME, and the building societies association. These particular roundtables have had the aim of grouping clarifying questions, and we&rsquo;ve just had a very successful one organized by ISDA and AFME covering market risk.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I have time to cover on market risk. Let me finish with the briefest of tours of the horizon.</p>
<p>The meta headline is that we remain very SCGO focused.</p>
<p>We have been doing a lot this year. Following through on Mansion House with PRA initiatives. For example, to assist firms, through the &lsquo;scale up&rsquo; unit in the PRA and the wider concierge service for firms new to the UK. We&rsquo;ve also made commitments, with KPIs, to make regulatory transactions like authorisations, SMCR applications and model approvals speedier and more agile.</p>
<p>Outside of Mansion House, we&rsquo;ve launched deeper review of SMCR and modernized a range of MREL related thresholds so the regime keeps pace with the times.</p>
<p>And all of that is on top of earlier initiatives covering Basel 3.1 where I think our implementation of the global standard is very proportionate, our strong and simple regime for small firms, securitization reform, remuneration reform, and many initiatives from my colleagues working on insurance reforms.</p>
<p>My purpose there is not to blind you with a long list. It is to get across a sense that it is a very big focus for us, that we have been and continue to take very seriously.</p>
<p>The big thing I didn&rsquo;t include in that list, but is very much a big focus right now, and so I&rsquo;ve pulled it out separately, is the capital refresh project being run by FPC and PRC. I don&rsquo;t have anything to say on that here given it is separate to our Basel 3.1 work. But we released our analysis and where we have got to in the December Financial Stability Report, today in fact. But I can say it has, and will continue given the next steps, to occupy a lot of bandwidth in the PRA as we look to do the best evidence-based job we can in order to do it justice.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for listening.</p>

<p><span>Researchers from The World Federation of Exchanges (&ldquo;WFE&rdquo;), the global industry group for exchange groups and CCPs, were awarded best paper for their new research,</span><em>&nbsp;&ldquo;Attracting New Listings: What Shapes IPO Activity Across Markets&rdquo;</em><span>, at the European Capital Markets Institute (ECMI) Annual Meeting.</span><br /><br /><span>The ECMI published a call for the submission of research papers related to capital markets and their functioning, and a committee of academics and international experts selected the WFE&rsquo;s Research Paper for the prize and the opportunity to present the findings at the 2025 ECMI Annual Conference on 4 November 2025. The three WFE Research economists who co-authored the paper jointly accepted the prize and presented the paper in Brussels.</span><br /><br /><span>The paper offers the most comprehensive analysis to date of how exchange-level, macroeconomic, and regulatory factors shape IPO activity across 79 global stock exchanges from 2002 to 2024. The research found that market liquidity and GDP growth are the most consistent and robust factors impacting the volume of IPOs, while the higher the degree of financial development in a jurisdiction is associated with larger IPOs, particularly in emerging and developing markets.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>The authors developed the new WFE Listing Stringency Index (LSI) to capture the breadth of listing requirements across exchanges and assess how regulatory frameworks shape IPO markets.</span><br /><br /><strong>Dr Ying Liu, Economist at the WFE and co-author of the paper</strong><span>, said, &ldquo;Our research found that market liquidity and economic growth are the factors most consistently associated with higher levels of IPO activity. While having a developed financial system influences the size rather than the frequency of IPOs in a jurisdiction. We also found clear differences between markets: advanced economies are more sensitive to volatility and macroeconomic conditions, whilst emerging markets gain the most from improvements in liquidity, financial development, and overall economic expansion.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><strong>Dr Ishak Demir, Economist at the WFE and co-author of the paper</strong><span>, said, &ldquo;We were delighted to receive this award and be invited to present our paper at this prestigious international conference, in front of policymakers, academics and industry representatives. One of the main objectives of this research was to provide an evidence-based view of the factors that shape IPO activity across different market environments. By analysing two decades of data across a large set of global exchanges, we aim to offer policymakers, academics, and market practitioners a clearer understanding of the factors that shape IPO activity globally. We thank the ECMI and their committee of esteemed academics for recognising our work.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><strong>Dr Erfan Ghofrani, Economist at The WFE and co-author of the paper</strong><span>, said, &ldquo;The Listing Stringency Index we developed as part of the research provides regulators with a useful tool, showing that easing overly strict listing requirements can increase market participation and capital raised, so long as transparency, market resilience, and governance standards remain intact.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><strong>Nandini Sukumar, Chief Executive Officer of the WFE</strong><span>, said, &ldquo;I am incredibly proud of the team, led by Dr Pedro Gurrola-Perez, for this achievement. At the WFE we have built an exceptional team of academics who are producing cutting-edge research on the issues shaping our industry.

<p>Gain Credit, Homeprotect, part of the Avantia Group, NatWest, Monzo, Santander, Scottish Widows, part of Lloyds Banking Group, and Snorkl are the first group to take part.</p>
<p>AI testing is helping firms to address key questions around evaluation frameworks, live monitoring governance and risk management to ensure that AI is deployed safely and responsibly for consumers and markets.</p>
<p>Many of the AI applications currently being tested as part of the project focus on retail financial services including use cases to harness AI to support debt resolution or provide financial advice. Applications are also exploring the potential for AI to help improve customer engagement, streamline complaints handling and help consumers to make smarter spending and saving decisions.</p>
<p>Jessica Rusu, chief data, information and intelligence officer at the FCA, said:&nbsp;</p>
<p>'Our new AI Live Testing service helps firms who are ready to use AI in live markets. By working closely with firms and our technical partner Advai, we&rsquo;re helping to make sure that AI is developed and deployed safely and responsibly in UK financial markets.'</p>
<p>The project will help the FCA better understand how AI could shape UK financial markets and inform its future approach to the technology.</p>
<p>AI Live Testing complements the FCA&rsquo;s Supercharged Sandbox which helps firms who are in the discovery and experiment phase with AI.</p>
<p>Applications for the second cohort for AI Live Testing will open in January 2026 and participating firms will be able to start testing in April.</p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US">GLEIF's Global vLEI Hackathon saw an impressive 110 submissions from teams around the world, collectively showcasing the innovative ideas shaping the future of Digital Organizational Identity.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US">MSC Trustgate's winning solution incorporates the verifiable LEI (vLEI) into its secure document signing portal, enabling signatories to digitally verify their identity and organizational authority, and bind this verification to the electronic signatures applied to their corporate PDFs. By seamlessly linking verifiable corporate identity with legally recognized digital signatures, MSC Trustgate's vLEI-powered signing process bypasses the need for repetitive, manual Know Your Customer and Know Your Business checks which create onboarding friction and remain vulnerable to identity fraud. The result is a faster and simpler signing process, and a signed file which is recognized globally by Adobe Acrobat and other standard PDF readers, without additional plug-ins. This is achieved by linking the verified vLEI identity directly to a certificate issued under the Adobe Approved Trust List (AATL).</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.gqh-2BaxUzlo7XKIuSly0rC3XV7H6MflIaD-2Fi0HbMqdEE-3DjyDU_pIbxPfpDI69aAybPrpOfg1n6CWmKMnb3conIyNKCYgopkqlx8cS0FFNxZUe51piZ6n6okyeDMJdkH51q5lbJ1CbKrK-2FN9A2-2FZ3E0Qhk1jsCvnSIougtAdmFq1VzyVxoyymInbZvHxE2wrJGoxRw3qW0iVcoTjsY2qLbSdf3ZRkTNFEMeRcT-2F88toe4arD-2FWVwmDruZlqFNFdYkP0z9TAxW-2FpbAwKX24i64BPSZ6m4eEXWwf-2FUpDkEQIyCmJOT0Mtzxa-2F0i-2BVSynbQEB8jQ4PhrCSp2ax0A490pVMVu56WMX9WOkoUfqJHSobEjZUIlsSeZHK9kZ4IoesLHlq-2FpN-2F6A-3D-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">YourData</a><span lang="EN-US">, was named as the runner up. Its solution, Agent-Anchor, assigns vLEI identities to a company's AI agents, providing new safeguards against the growing threat of AI generated impersonation, voice spoofing, and fraudulent messaging. By introducing the vLEI's new layer of digital trust, customers interacting with a company's AI agent can verify its true origin 'live' during calls and other interactions. The solution can also integrate with international digital identity wallets, like the eIDAS 2.0 EUDI Wallet, enabling deployment in existing user environments without requiring additional applications.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US">Hazhar Ismail, Executive Director, MSC Trustgate, said: "The vLEI has enabled us to bridge the long-standing gap between emerging trust ecosystems and established global standards. We have delivered a prototype that is secure, scalable, and globally trusted - one that judges, businesses, and regulators will recognize as both practical and transformative. The signing service will be particularly valuable for high-value corporate, banking, and cross-border commerce use cases, where only the highest levels of digital trust are permissible."</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US">Jaegyeong Yeom, Co-founder, YourData, said: "As companies increasingly interact with customers via callbots, chatbots, and automated messaging systems, Agent-Anchor demonstrates how both sides can interact with AI safely and reliably. Without a verifiable trust layer, malicious actors can easily leverage AI-spoofing to impersonate these tools and conduct large-scale fraud. Synthetic voices, fake chatbots, and phishing messages highlight the urgency of solving this verification gap."</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US">Alexandre Kech, CEO of GLEIF, said: "With Industry 4.0 in full flight, companies everywhere are in dire need of global digital identity solutions, to realize operational gains, safeguard against the tidal wave of new threats, and ease the process of complying with new regulations. By embracing the vLEI as a digital trust layer, our hackathon winners have shown how quickly and effectively this can be achieved when the right solution is in place.&rdquo;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US">Ivan Mortimer-Schutts, Global Head of vLEI of GLEIF, said: &ldquo;The vLEI hackathon has been very impressive and in a constructive spirit of collaboration. We thank each and every one for their ambition and innovative drive."</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US">The winners were named at an exclusive international forum on Digital Organizational Identity, hosted by the Frankfurt School of Finance &amp; Management, in Frankfurt.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US">All entries were rigorously evaluated by the international vLEI Hackathon jury, which comprises leading figures from global organizations, industry domains, and technical disciplines, ensuring a comprehensive and forward-looking assessment of every submission.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US">The vLEI is a digital, trustworthy attestation of the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) tied to the ISO 17442 Standard. This secure digital credential links an organization's identity with a natural person and their role within it. By enabling peer-to-peer verification, the vLEI allows data, credentials, and transactions to be verified and shared without intermediaries, laying the foundation for a trusted global digital economy.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US">Since its launch in July, the vLEI Hackathon has challenged developers, entrepreneurs, and innovators worldwide to shape the future of digital trust by developing real-world solutions powered by digital organizational identity.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US">The vLEI Hackathon has enjoyed the steadfast support of leading organizations, including Affinidi, Apix, APSCA, Cardano Foundation, Chainlink, eBRAM, Cardano, EPA Asia, Esatus, Finoverse, Finternet Lab, FIWARE, Frankfurt School of Finance &amp; Management, fts.money, GFTN, Giesecke+Devrient, Hong Kong PKI Consortium, Hong Kong Web3 Standardization Association, ICC Digital Standards Initiative, INNOPAY, Key State Capital, LF Decentralized Trust, Vayana, Swift, Asia PKI Consortium, Vayana, Veriable.Trade, and more. Additionally, a rapidly growing network of Qualified vLEI Issuers (QVIs), including Certizen Technology, China Financial Certification Authority (CFCA), Finema, Global vLEI, Provenant, Shanghai Electronic Certification Authority (SHECA), Toppan Edge Inc., and TradeGo, has played a central role in helping participants in developing their submissions.</span></span></span></p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority: Pause On Motor Finance Complaints Handling To Lift On 31 May 2026</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-pause-on-motor-finance-complaints-handling-to-li-2025123/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-pause-on-motor-finance-complaints-handling-to-li-2025123/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h4>UK Financial Conduct Authority Statement</h4>
<p>We are lifting the pause on the handling of motor finance complaints on 31 May 2026. This timeframe enables us to finalise and begin implementing any compensation scheme, while giving firms a reasonable period to prepare.</p>
<p>We paused the handling of some motor finance complaints in January 2024. This was to prevent disorderly, inconsistent and inefficient outcomes for consumers and knock-on effects on firms and the market while we assessed whether there had been adequate disclosure of commissions between motor finance lenders and brokers.</p>
<p>We now have legal clarity from the Supreme Court and High Court to proceed with setting out how firms should deal with very large numbers of complaints and are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/consultation-papers/cp25-27-motor-finance-consumer-redress-scheme" title="CP25/27: Motor finance consumer redress scheme">consulting on a compensation scheme</a>&nbsp;for customers who were treated unfairly. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It is important that complaints are now dealt with promptly, not least as some consumers have been waiting almost 2 years for an answer. We are clear that complaints cannot be paused indefinitely. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It is likely that we will go ahead with a scheme and complaints that fall within it will be dealt with under specific rules, which will include timeframes for them to be dealt with. We are consulting on these timeframes now and are receiving much useful feedback on what is needed to ensure a scheme runs smoothly.</p>
<p>We are consulting on a scheme with a broad scope, so the number of complaints falling out of the currently proposed scheme should be relatively low. Those who have submitted such complaints should not have to wait longer than necessary.</p>
<p>We have decided, therefore, to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/ps25-18-changes-handling-rules-motor-finance-complaints" title="PS25/18: Changes to handling rules for motor finance complaints&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">lift the pause on the handling of certain motor finance complaints</a>&nbsp;on 31 May 2026. Ending the pause on 31 May 2026, rather than 31 July 2026 as originally consulted on, reflects our commitment to ensuring consumers receive fair and timely outcomes.</p>
<p>It gives firms sufficient time to be ready to respond to complaints, whether inside or outside of a scheme, given they should already have been investigating them. It also takes account of the fact that firms will, in most cases, have up to 8 weeks after 31 May 2026 to send a response to complaints outside the scheme with the exact amount of time depending on when they received the complaint. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/dear-ceo-letters/motor-finance-commission-complaints-consultation-outcome.pdf" title="motor-finance-commission-complaints-consultation-outcome.pdf">a letter (PDF)</a>&nbsp;sent on 3 December, we have reminded firms again that they should be progressing complaints. This is to ensure firms are ready to start issuing final responses to complaints if they are not covered by any scheme. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We have said we will publish final scheme rules in February or March 2026. If we go ahead with a scheme, we will consider how the rules interact with the end of the complaint handling pause, to avoid firms having to send final responses that would otherwise be dealt with in the scheme.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our final rules, we intend to set out how firms should respond to complaints involving both scheme and non-scheme elements, recognising that it may be simpler and less confusing for consumers if firms send a final response to any scheme and non-scheme complaints at the same time.</p>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-leasing-complaints" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Leasing complaints</h2>
<p>As we proposed in our consultation, leasing complaints are excluded from this further extension as they are not in scope of the proposed compensation scheme. Firms need to start sending final responses to any motor leasing complaint from 5 December 2025 in line with normal complaint handling rules.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-record-retention" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Record retention</h2>
<p>Firms will also have to retain and preserve relevant records until 11 April 2031, supporting transparency and ongoing consumer protection in line with the proposed scheme.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-advice-for-consumers" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Advice for consumers</h2>
<p>People who have already complained don&rsquo;t need to do anything. However, consumers worried that they were not told about commission and who think they may have paid too much for their motor finance,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/car-finance-complaints" title="Car finance claims">should complain now</a>.</p>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/columbia-threadneedle-investments-joins-six-swiss-exchange-as-new-etf-issuer-2025123/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>SIX welcomes Columbia Threadneedle Investments as a new issuer of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). The global asset manager is expanding investors&rsquo; access to actively managed strategies at the Swiss Exchange with the listing of two active ETFs, each tradable in two currencies.</span></p>
<div class="textimage ">
<div>
<div>
<p>These two multicurrency and actively managed ETFs aim to provide investors with long-term exposure by investing primarily in listed equities and equity-related securities, offering targeted access to Europe and the U.S., respectively. Each Fund allocates at least 80% of its assets to its core universe &ndash; European and U.S. companies, respectively &ndash; listed or traded on regulated markets, and is managed with reference to an appropriate index: MSCI Europe for the Europe ETF and Russell 1000 for the U.S. ETF.</p>
<p>With this launch, SIX now hosts 35 ETF issuers offering a total of 2,100 ETFs &ndash; making it one of Europe&rsquo;s most dynamic and diverse ETF marketplaces. So far this year, 298 new ETFs have been listed at SIX Swiss Exchange, including 111 actively managed products &ndash; the highest number of new active ETF listings in eight years.</p>
<p>Eva Maria Hintner, Country Head Switzerland, Columbia Threadneedle Investments, explains: &ldquo;The current market environment requires investment solutions that deliver attractive returns after costs, cushion downside risk and avoid the concentration risks that have become so typical of major indices. With the listing on SIX, our clients in Switzerland gain access to a solution that is more than just an index overlay &ndash; it is genuine active management in an ETF wrapper. Our European and US active equity ETFs are the first in a series of core equity solutions designed to sit at the heart of investors&rsquo; portfolios, allowing them to benefit from our proprietary research and expertise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danielle Reischuk, Senior ETFs &amp; ETPs Sales Manager, SIX Swiss Exchange, adds: &ldquo;We are delighted to welcome Columbia Threadneedle Investments as a new ETF issuer at SIX Swiss Exchange. Their launch further broadens the range of actively managed ETF products available to Swiss and international investors. The continued growth in new listings underscores the strength and diversity of our ETF marketplace and our ongoing commitment to providing issuers and investors with a robust and efficient trading venue.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.columbiathreadneedleus.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Columbia Threadneedle Investments</a>&nbsp;is a global asset manager entrusted with over $675 billion by clients seeking to grow and manage their assets for the future. The firm operates with a globally connected team of approximately 2,300 people including approximately 550 investment professionals based in North America, Europe, and Asia. The firm offers diverse expertise across nearly all asset classes and markets. Its investment approach is grounded in original, independent research designed to inform smarter decision-making, alongside a responsible investment ethos that recognizes the long-term impact of today&rsquo;s choices. Columbia Threadneedle emphasizes continuous improvement, aiming to enhance both investment outcomes and client experience.</p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority: OCR Pass Through Transparency - Delivering Transparency On The Pace At Which Financial Institutions Respond To Changes In The Official Cash Rate</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-ocr-pass-through-transparency-deliver-2025123/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-ocr-pass-through-transparency-deliver-2025123/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) sets the official cash rate (OCR) to achieve and maintain price stability (inflation). Banks and other financial institutions like credit unions, building societies and some finance companies use the level of the OCR as one of the factors when they determine interest rates offered to their customers.</p>
<p>When the RBNZ changes the OCR the financial institutions may make changes to their interest rates, but that can take time depending on the institution. The table below shows the size of interest rate changes and the time taken for the change to take effect for new and existing customers of floating rate mortgages and on call savings accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA has requested information from eight financial institutions<span>1</span>&nbsp;that provide ~98% of housing loans in New Zealand<span>2</span>. These financial institutions already provide information about the interest rates applicable to their products, and when they are moved, through a variety of channels.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Cboe To Offer Nearly 24-Hour Trading For Russell 2000 Options, Expanding Global Access To U.S. Small-Cap Equities</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul type="disc">
<li>Russell 2000&reg; Index (RUT) options to trade nearly 24x5 during Cboe's Global Trading Hours</li>
<li>Expansion that may allow European and Asia-Pacific traders to more easily manage U.S. small-cap exposure</li>
<li>Initiative is part of Cboe's ongoing efforts to expand global access to its proprietary U.S. equity index options</li>
</ul>
<p>Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe: CBOE), the world's leading derivatives and securities exchange network, today announced plans to extend trading hours for its Russell 2000 Index (RUT) options suite to nearly 24 hours a day, five days a week, beginning February 9, 2026.</p>
<p>RUT options are currently available for trading during regular U.S. hours, from 9:30 a.m. ET to 4:15 p.m. ET, Monday through Friday. With the planned addition of an overnight session during Cboe's Global Trading Hours (GTH), RUT options (including the RUT Weeklys options) will also trade from 8:15 p.m. ET to 9:25 a.m. ET the following morning, Monday through Friday. As investors globally increasingly seek to access U.S. equity market exposure, the ability to trade RUT options nearly around the clock is expected to help them respond to market-moving events, adjust positioning, and manage risk with greater precision in real time.</p>
<p>Cboe currently offers several flagship index options including S&amp;P 500 Index (SPX), Mini-SPX (XSP) and Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) options during its GTH session. The addition of RUT options to GTH will expand this lineup, giving investors even more tools to access U.S. equity large cap, small cap and global equity market exposure &ndash; ultimately, potentially creating more trading, hedging, and liquidity opportunities during this overnight trading session.</p>
<p>Demand for overnight trading is evident in the growth of Cboe's GTH sessions, which have experienced record volumes in 2025, up 179% year-to-date compared to full year 2022 as global appetite for U.S. markets has grown and Cboe expands its product availability to meet this demand.</p>
<p>"Extending trading hours for Cboe's Russell 2000 Index product suite will be another significant milestone in our efforts to expand access to U.S. index options for investors worldwide," said Rob Hocking, Global Head of Derivatives at Cboe. "With nearly round-the-clock availability, Cboe will help empower market participants to further diversify, manage and hedge their U.S. equity and volatility exposures&ndash;covering both small caps and large caps&ndash;at their discretion. We look forward to continuing to collaborate with FTSE Russell to deliver meaningful solutions to our growing global customer base." &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Russell 2000 Index measures the performance of U.S. small-cap equities across sectors and has long served as a barometer of small-cap performance. As of the end of November, average daily volume in Cboe's RUT options has grown to nearly 75 thousand contracts, up 66% compared to full year 2022, as more traders look to manage risk and implement daily options strategies. The Russell 2000 Index has historically been more volatile than large-cap measures and more sensitive to interest rates &ndash; making RUT options a potentially effective tool to trade small-cap volatility and secular trends.</p>
<p>To track implied volatility for the Russell 2000, Cboe publishes the&nbsp;<a href="https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4571018-1&amp;h=1116380193&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cboe.com%2Fus%2Findices%2Fdashboard%2Frvx%2F&amp;a=Cboe+Russell+2000+Volatility+Index" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Cboe Russell 2000 Volatility Index</a>&nbsp;(RVX), a VIX-style measure of 30-day expected volatility. Similar to realized volatility measures, RVX has historically been higher than the VIX Index, reflecting the unique risk profile of small-cap stocks.</p>
<p>"Cboe's decision to offer nearly 24-hour trading for Russell 2000 options is an exciting development for global investors," said Shawn Creighton, Director of Index Derivatives Solutions at FTSE Russell. "The Russell 2000 Index is a recognized benchmark for U.S. small-cap equities, and expanded access will give market participants worldwide greater flexibility to manage risk and capture opportunities as markets move."</p>
<p>Exclusively listed on Cboe Options Exchange, Russell 2000 Index (RUT) options and Russell 2000 Index Weeklys (RUTW) options are cash-settled, European-style options, meaning there is no risk of early exercise and no need to deliver or receive unwanted shares. Cboe offers a range of expirations&mdash;including every weekday, end-of-month, and quarterly&mdash;allowing investors to implement a diverse range of trading strategies.</p>
<p>In addition to offering GTH hours for RUT options, Cboe proposes to add Curb Trading Hours &ndash; an additional trading session that will run from 4:15 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. ET, Monday through Friday.</p>

<title>EU Allows Continued Use Of New Zealand Regulated Financial Benchmarks</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/eu-allows-continued-use-of-new-zealand-regulated-financial-benchmarks-2025122/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) - Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; has welcomed the European Commission decision to recognise New Zealand&rsquo;s legal and supervisory framework for financial benchmarks as equivalent to the European Union&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Together with the FMA&rsquo;s decision to issue New Zealand Financial Benchmark Facility Limited (NZFBF) a benchmark administrator&rsquo;s licence this week, this means that the NZ Bank Bill Rate benchmark (BKBM) can continue to be used in the EU from 1 January 2026.</p>
<p>FMA General Counsel Liam Mason said: &ldquo;This is a significant outcome for New Zealand, and for all financial institutions and businesses that trade between New Zealand and the European Union that use the BKBM in their commercial transactions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means that the more than EUR 50 billion of financial instruments currently in use in the EU that reference the New Zealand Bank Bill Rate benchmark can continue to be used without disruption from 1 January 2026.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This benchmark is used as a base interest rate in financial contracts to calculate interest as part of commercial transactions &ndash; for example by holders of interest rate swaps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without this decision, these financial instruments cannot legally reference the BKBM. It means the businesses and organisations would need to find an alternative EU-based benchmark for their transactions, which is not feasible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This step marks the close of a multi-year effort to have New Zealand&rsquo;s benchmark recognised in the European Union, including introducing a bespoke licensing regime to comply with the updated EU benchmark regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this latest phase, the FMA and MBIE worked closely with NZFBF, the sole benchmark provider in New Zealand, to provide the Commission with critical advice on the size and significance of the benchmark,&rdquo; said Mr Mason.</p>
<p><a class="is-external" href="https://finance.ec.europa.eu/news/commission-adopts-equivalence-decision-new-zealands-financial-benchmarks-2025-10-30_en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Link to European Commission website">Commission adopts equivalence decision for New Zealand's financial benchmarks - Finance</a></p>

<title>Business Trades Support Bank Capital Rule Reform To Boost Economic Growth</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>&ldquo;Now is the time to modernize our capital framework to unleash economic growth for American businesses and consumers across the country.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>A coalition of leading business trade organizations urged prudential regulators to examine and modernize large bank capital requirements to ensure they support consumers, businesses, and the U.S. economy. The organizations, which represent a wide range of stakeholders, including small businesses, manufacturers, and farmers, highlighted the negative impact of inappropriately calibrated requirements on economic growth and American competitiveness, and applauded the ongoing efforts to improve the capital framework.</p>
<p>A review of 13 economic studies&nbsp;<a href="https://fsforum.com/opinion/fixing-what-aint-broken-the-real-and-hidden-costs-of-excessive-bank-capital-regulation/">found</a>&nbsp;that increased capital requirements can cost the economy $100 billion to $150 billion per year and result in $2.3 trillion in lost economic productivity over 30 years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We greatly appreciate the work being undertaken by bank regulators to modernize capital rules to unleash economic growth and support various industries and sectors across the country. Specifically, common sense adjustments to Basel III Endgame, the GSIB Surcharge, stress testing, and leverage requirements will improve access to credit and reduce the costs of goods and services for American businesses and consumers, ensuring the U.S. economy can continue to thrive and grow,&rdquo; the trade organizations said.</p>
<p>The statement for the record was signed by the Financial Services Forum, American Bankers Association, American Cotton Shippers Association, American Farm Bureau Federation, Bank Policy Institute, Business Roundtable, Commodity Markets Council, Consumer Bankers Association, Futures Industry Association, International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Mortgage Bankers Association, National Association of Manufacturers, National Association of REALTORS&reg;, The Real Estate Roundtable, Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, and U.S. Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good afternoon, and welcome to ISDA&rsquo;s annual Trading Book Capital event &ndash; thanks for joining us today, and thank you to Deloitte for sponsoring.</p>
<p>This event has become an annual fixture in the ISDA calendar, and you may have noticed that it nearly always takes place in early December. When the days are at their shortest, the cold is beginning to bite and the Christmas lights are turned on, thoughts are turning to 2026 &ndash; plans, hopes and dreams.</p>
<p>As I prepared these remarks, I was thinking about what we in ISDA&rsquo;s Risk and Capital team are dreaming of for next year. I&rsquo;m sure that if Mariah Carey were to remix her 1994 classic, she could think of no punchier lyrics than these: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want a lot for Christmas&hellip; I just want an appropriate, risk-sensitive capital framework&rdquo;.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m thankfully not planning a career move into festive musical remixes, I do want to talk briefly about why we&rsquo;re doubling down on our commitment to appropriate, risk-sensitive capital requirements as we move into 2026.</p>
<p>Healthy economies and successful companies rely on deep and liquid markets to access funding, hedge their risks and build resilience to withstand external shocks. If banks are hit with disproportionate capital requirements, their ability to provide liquidity will be impaired and economic growth will be constrained. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ll continue to advocate for an appropriate capital framework around the world.</p>
<p>For the major jurisdictions that have still to complete the implementation of Basel III, it&rsquo;s clear that 2026 is going to be a crunch year. In the US, regulators are revising the Basel III endgame proposal in response to industry feedback, and we expect to see a new proposal in the coming months.</p>
<p>In the EU, the European Commission launched a targeted consultation last month on changes to the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB) that would bring some short-term relief in key areas. These would include a set of temporary adjustments to the standardized and internal models approaches and the application of a multiplier, which negatively affected banks could use to limit the increase in their capital requirements for three years. As a general principle, we think long-term solutions are needed to ensure lasting risk sensitivity, rather than relying on temporary measures. The consultation closes on January 6 and we&rsquo;re working with our members to develop a response.</p>
<p>Here in the UK, the Basel 3.1 framework is due to be implemented at the start of 2027, although the Prudential Regulation Authority has proposed delaying the rollout of internal models until the following year.</p>
<p>This brings me to the reduced viability of internal models under the FRTB, which we think should be a major concern for policymakers. Last year, we undertook a survey that showed only 10 out of 26 banks plan to use internal models for a reduced scope of trading desks under the FRTB. That&rsquo;s a big change that we don&rsquo;t think is in line with what the Basel Committee originally intended. Such a big shift away from internal models could lead to herd behavior and drive concentrations in particular assets. It will mean less diversity in models and less alignment between risk and capital &ndash; a direct contradiction of Mariah&rsquo;s hopes for Christmas.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve recommended changes to improve the incentives to use internal models, which would require the recalibration of some parts of the FRTB, including the profit &amp; loss attribution test, the risk factor eligibility test and non-modellable risk factors. The good news is that we&rsquo;ve had positive engagement with policymakers on these issues, particularly in the US. There is still work to be done to ensure the viability of internal models, but we&rsquo;re hopeful that revisions to the Basel III endgame will include positive changes in this area.</p>
<p>Whether banks use standardized approaches or internal models, it is critical that those capital models are implemented accurately and consistently. That&rsquo;s why ISDA developed its Capital Models Benchmarking initiative, which has enabled firms around the world to implement and validate regulatory capital models with an unparalleled level of efficiency, accuracy and consistency. Originally designed for the standardized approach, this initiative has now been extended to support internal models and we&rsquo;ll hear more on that later this afternoon.</p>
<p>As market participants have navigated a series of unexpected shocks in recent years, they&rsquo;ve also recognized the need to prepare for future climate-related shocks. In particular, the possible impact of natural disasters or changes in climate policy on traded assets hasn&rsquo;t historically been an area where firms have been able to lean on established best practice.</p>
<p>That has now started to change, thanks to ISDA&rsquo;s conceptual framework for climate scenario analysis in the trading book and the follow-up work we&rsquo;ve done to design and model specific scenarios. This year, ISDA has produced market risk shocks associated with the short-term scenarios developed by the Network for Greening the Financial System and we&rsquo;ll publish a new paper on this early next year. Like ISDA&rsquo;s benchmarking initiative, our climate scenario analysis framework is a mutualized solution that responds to a shared industry challenge. We look forward to further advancing both services in the years ahead.</p>
<p>I hope these remarks have given a sense of why ISDA&rsquo;s hopes for next year are consistent with what we have always strived for. Risk-sensitive capital might not scan seamlessly into the lyrics of a classic festive tune, but it really is all we want for Christmas.</p>

<title>Revitalizing America’s Markets At 250, Paul S. Atkins, SEC Chairman - New York Stock Exchange, Dec. 2, 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Lynn, let me start by thanking you for your generous introduction and for hosting this event at the Exchange. My thanks as well to the market participants here today. And of course, I am grateful to see my counterparts from across the Administration. Thank you all for being here and for your understanding that the views I express today are in my capacity as Chairman and do not necessarily reflect those of the SEC as an institution or of my fellow Commissioners.</p>
<p>There are few places more fitting to consider the future of the American financial system than this one. The New York Stock Exchange is a cathedral of capital markets, replete with the rhythms and rituals that allocate resources toward socially valued uses. Listen closely, and you can hear the hum of human ingenuity that has long echoed within these walls. Echoes that ring loudly around us today.</p>
<p>Step outside these doors, meanwhile, and the neighborhood itself narrates the American story. A short walk in any direction brings you to landmarks like Federal Hall, where Washington took his oath and Congress established the Treasury; to the buttonwood tree under whose ancestor two dozen stockbrokers established the forerunner of this exchange; and to the cobblestone streets that were a cradle of commerce long before Manhattan&rsquo;s skyscrapers rose above them.</p>
<p>The square mile that surrounds us is less a place than a prologue&mdash;an opening chapter in a story that is now ours to continue.</p>
<p class="text-align-center">***</p>
<p>Of course, in seven months, that story will reach a rare milestone when our Republic marks its 250th year. A quarter millennium ago, a band of revolutionaries declared that rights are neither permissions to be earned nor privileges to be revoked. They claimed the right to govern themselves, yes, but also the right to&nbsp;<em>provide&nbsp;</em>for themselves. To work, to venture, and to prosper off of their own effort. To pursue happiness and property. Indeed, our founders sought agency as much in the halls of power as in the marketplace of ideas.</p>
<p>Anniversaries of this magnitude demand more than ceremony. They ask something of us. They invite us to reflect, of course but no less, to resolve. To ensure that the future that we shape will prove worthy of the legacy that we inherit.</p>
<p class="text-align-center">***</p>
<p>Allow me, then, to take a few moments to revisit how that legacy began.</p>
<p>Before the United States was a nation, it was an investment.</p>
<p>The first permanent English settlements in this hemisphere were financed through joint-stock enterprises that allowed people to pool together capital and share in the risk and reward of an uncertain venture. The Virginia Company, for example&mdash;the first major British securities offering aimed at the Americas&mdash;funded the Jamestown settlement through share subscriptions, investors of which anticipated returns through land, trade, and dividends.</p>
<p>Decades later, a similar structure funded the settlement that became this great city, foreshadowing New York&rsquo;s destiny as the global capital of securities markets. Indeed, what is now modern-day Manhattan originated as a corporate investment project. We have with us this morning a copy of the company&rsquo;s original stock offering&mdash;New Amsterdam&rsquo;s birth certificate&mdash;and a tangible reminder that Manhattan itself was built on the premise that prosperity flows from mobilizing capital toward its most productive uses.</p>
<p>That premise, of course&mdash;and the financial system that it engendered&mdash;is rooted in still older foundations dating back to the Glorious Revolution, when Parliament wrested arbitrary power from the Crown and established the principle that property rights would be protected, contracts enforced, and the state bound by predictable rules rather than royal whim. Britain became a financial powerhouse by creating the conditions in which markets could flourish. Our founders inherited that worldview and then forged a more perfect union&mdash;perhaps none more than Hamilton, across from whose burial site we assemble today.</p>
<p>Hamilton understood that markets, structured properly, can unleash the might of American dynamism as no monarch or government ministry possibly could. After all, a free market is a hallmark of a free people. And as Dr. Ludwig von Mises described so well, &ldquo;if history could teach us anything, it would be that private property is inextricably linked with civilization.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So in&nbsp;<em>Federalist&nbsp;</em>11, Hamilton praises the &ldquo;adventurous spirit&rdquo; which animates the &ldquo;commercial character of America&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;that unequalled spirit of enterprise, which signifies the genius of the American Merchants and Navigators, and which is in itself an inexhaustible mine of national wealth,&rdquo; and then he heralds its potential to make America the &ldquo;admiration and envy of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hamilton saw in that &ldquo;adventurous spirit&rdquo; a precocious young nation whose people could produce their own prosperity. To be sure, he believed that the government must create stable rules, maintain public credit, and reliably enforce contracts. But within that framework, the securities markets would emerge to unlock the most daring mobilization of capital in human history.</p>
<p>The canals that tied the interior to the coasts were financed by state bonds. The railroads that stitched together a continent required investment on a scale that the world had never seen, creating secondary markets, auditing standards, and the modern corporate governance structure in the process. The steel that built our cities, the oil that powered our factories, and the electricity that illuminated our homes were all made possible by domestic and foreign investors willing to stake their capital on an idea of America still in formation.</p>
<p>Of course, we must recognize with humility when we, as a country, failed to uphold some of our most basic founding principles. But by the turn of the twentieth century, millions of Americans owned securities and had a framework for the achievement of their ambitions. Indeed, the wealth accumulated through the financial markets became an accelerant of social mobility.</p>
<p>As the century unfolded, and competing ideologies sought to engineer economic strength from the top down, ours was a model that steadily proved its value on the global stage. The Soviet and communist system of central planning, coercion, mass murder, seizing private property, and suppressing private enterprise, for example, collapsed under the weight of its own contradictions, while the American approach empowered its citizens to innovate, to invest, and to build wealth within predictable and enforceable legal frameworks. To redraw boundaries of the possible by inventing the telephone and the phonograph. The assembly line and the airplane. The semiconductor that made computing ubiquitous. Internet protocols that connected the world and GPS technology that then plotted it. Social media platforms that carry information at the speed of thought. And now, the new frontier of AI that is transforming the way that we live and work.</p>
<p>Across this long sweep of innovation, a pattern emerges with clarity: the great leaps of American life were always produced by a willingness to tolerate and accept risks within a system that rewards those who take them. Our prosperity is no accident of history&mdash;nor is our primacy assured in the future. The twentieth century was a triumph of economic freedom over doctrines that sought to constrain it. But principles do not preserve themselves. Freedom is not a relic that we inherit so much as a responsibility that we assume. And in recent years, our regulatory frameworks have veered from the founding ideals that helped the United States to once stand without peer as the world&rsquo;s destination for public companies.</p>
<p class="text-align-center">***</p>
<p>For context, Congress, beginning in 1933 with the Securities Act, passed a series of legislation to address the fraudulent and manipulative activity that Wall Street engaged in prior to the crash. Congress&rsquo;s enactment of the securities laws at the federal level sought to provide more clarity in the markets in the name of rebuilding public confidence in them. After all, markets require trust, and trust requires transparency.</p>
<p>Shortly before the Securities Act became law, President Franklin Roosevelt explained his vision for this seminal statute in a message to Congress.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-120225-revitalizing-americas-markets-250?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;He rejected the idea that the federal government should be a merit regulator, which is the notion that the government approves an offering of securities as sound for public investment because it expects their value to increase. Instead, President Roosevelt sought to protect investors through a disclosure-based regulatory regime&mdash;the idea that companies offering securities to the public should provide all the important information about those securities.</p>
<p>In short, the Securities Act preserved the Hamiltonian model by incentivizing capital to flow to opportunity based on the judgment of investors. In the same message to Congress, President Roosevelt explained that &ldquo;[t]he purpose of the [Securities Act] is to protect the public with the least possible interference with honest business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as the generations passed, the federal government&rsquo;s natural tendency asserted itself. Rules have multiplied faster than the problems that they were intended to solve&mdash;and in its drift away from original congressional intent, the State has sought to substitute its discernment for that of market participants.</p>
<p class="text-align-center">***</p>
<p>Shortly after I left the SEC as a staff member in the mid-1990s, there were more than 7,000 companies listed on the U.S. exchanges, from small-cap innovators to giants of industry. Yet by the time that I returned as Chairman earlier this year, that number had fallen by roughly 40 percent.</p>
<p>What happened during those decades tells a cautionary tale of regulatory creep. A tale that tells us that the path to public ownership has become narrower, costlier, and overly burdened with rules that often create more friction than benefit.</p>
<p>These trends have eroded American competitiveness; locked average investors out of some of the most dynamic companies; and pushed entrepreneurs to seek capital elsewhere, either in the private markets or on foreign shores.</p>
<p>This decline was not inevitable&mdash;nor, is it now irreversible.&nbsp; While there are many SEC rules and practices that have amassed over the decades and are ripe for reform, perhaps none epitomize regulatory creep more so than the voluminous disclosure requirements contained in the Commission&rsquo;s rulebook today.</p>
<p class="text-align-center">***</p>
<p>Over the years, and particularly over the past two decades, special interest groups, politicians, and&mdash;at times&mdash;the SEC itself have weaponized the disclosure regime that Congress created for our marketplace, in an effort to advance social and political agendas that stray far from the SEC&rsquo;s mission of facilitating capital formation; protecting investors; and ensuring fair, orderly, and efficient markets.</p>
<p>These decades of accretive rulemakings have produced reams of paperwork that can do more to obscure than to illuminate. Today&rsquo;s lengthy annual reports and proxy statements impose substantial costs on companies because they consume significant time from boards and management, and require armies of specialized lawyers, accountants, and consultants to prepare. Despite these costs, investors sometimes do not benefit from the information because they struggle to parse and understand it&mdash;or find it so intimidating because of the volume and density that they ignore it</p>
<p>One of my priorities as Chairman is to reform the SEC&rsquo;s disclosure rules with two goals in mind. First, the SEC must root its disclosure requirements in the concept of financial materiality. Second, these requirements must scale with a company&rsquo;s size and maturity.</p>
<p>With respect to the first goal, the Supreme Court enunciated an objective standard for materiality and explained that information is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important in making an investment decision.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-120225-revitalizing-americas-markets-250?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Achieving this goal necessitates restraint and care from both the SEC when it promulgates a rule and from Congress when it directs the Commission to mandate disclosure on a particular subject. Our capital markets thrive not through the volume of disclosures, but the clarity and importance of them to investors. In writing for the Court, Justice Thurgood Marshall cautioned, &ldquo;[s]ome information is of such dubious significance that insistence on its disclosure may accomplish more harm than good...and&nbsp;if the standard of materiality is unnecessarily low&hellip;shareholders [may be buried] in an avalanche of trivial information&mdash;a result that is hardly conducive to informed decisionmaking.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-120225-revitalizing-americas-markets-250?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3">[3]</a></p>
<p>In heeding this warning to avoid information overload for investors, our disclosure regime is most effective when the SEC provides, as FDR advocated, the minimum effective dose of regulation needed to elicit the information that is material to investors, and we allow market forces to drive the disclosure of any additional aspects of their operations that may be beneficial to investors. In contrast, an ineffective disclosure regime would be one where the SEC requires that all companies provide the same information without the ability to tailor the disclosure to their specific circumstances, with the only view that such information should be &ldquo;consistent and comparable&rdquo; across companies.</p>
<p>Indeed, even with today&rsquo;s numerous disclosure requirements, companies still provide additional information, such as non-GAAP numbers or key performance metrics, that are tailored to a company&rsquo;s business or industry and are driven more by investor demand than the SEC&rsquo;s rulebook.</p>
<p>When the SEC&rsquo;s disclosure regime has been hijacked to require information unmoored from materiality, investors do not benefit. In his recent and final Thanksgiving letter to shareholders, Warren Buffett highlighted a prime example of this hazard.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-120225-revitalizing-americas-markets-250?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4">[4]</a>&nbsp;Any summary I give cannot do justice to Mr. Buffett&rsquo;s own words. So, I quote for you the following excerpt from his letter:</p>
<p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1"><em>During my lifetime, reformers sought to embarrass CEOs by requiring the disclosure of the compensation of the boss compared to what was being paid to the average employee. Proxy statements promptly ballooned to 100-plus pages compared to 20 or less earlier.</em></p>
<p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1"><em>But the good intentions didn&rsquo;t work; instead they backfired. Based on the majority of my observations &ndash; the CEO of company &ldquo;A&rdquo; looked at his competitor at company &ldquo;B&rdquo; and subtly conveyed to his board that he should be worth more. Of course, he also boosted the pay of directors and was careful who he placed on the compensation committee. The new rules produced envy, not moderation.</em></p>
<p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1"><em>The ratcheting took on a life of its own.</em></p>
<p>I share Mr. Buffett&rsquo;s observations and concerns, which is why earlier this year, the SEC held a roundtable that brought together companies, investors, law firms, and compensation consultants to discuss the current state of the agency&rsquo;s executive compensation disclosure rules and potential reforms. Somewhat to my surprise, there was universal agreement among the panelists that the length and complexity of executive compensation disclosure have limited its usefulness and insight to investors. We need a re-set of these and other SEC disclosure requirements, and this roundtable was one of the first steps to execute my goal of ensuring that materiality is the north star of the SEC&rsquo;s disclosure regime.</p>
<p>My other priority with respect to the SEC&rsquo;s disclosure rules is to scale the requirements with the company&rsquo;s size and maturity as a public company. Balancing disclosure obligations with a company&rsquo;s ability to bear the burdens of compliance is particularly important where Congress has directed the SEC to promulgate a disclosure rule whose costs may have a disproportionate impact on some companies. Of course, this approach is hardly a novel concept. The Commission first provided tailored disclosure requirements for smaller public companies in 1992, during my first tour of duty at the SEC as a staff member. Two decades later, Congress, through the bipartisan JOBS Act, gave certain newly public companies an &ldquo;IPO on-ramp&rdquo; and permitted them to comply with some of the SEC&rsquo;s disclosure requirements on a delayed basis.</p>
<p>It is time to revisit these concepts that have proven effective and merit expansion. As part of this effort, the SEC should give strong consideration to the thresholds that separate &ldquo;large&rdquo; companies, which are subject to all of the SEC disclosure rules, and &ldquo;small&rdquo; companies that are subject to only some of them. The last comprehensive reform to these thresholds took place in 2005. This dereliction of regulatory upkeep has resulted in a company with a public float of as low as $250 million being subject to the same disclosure requirements as a company that is one hundred times its size.</p>
<p>For newly public companies, the SEC should consider building upon the &ldquo;IPO on-ramp&rdquo; that Congress established in the JOBS Act. For example, allowing companies to remain on the &ldquo;on-ramp&rdquo; for a minimum number of years, rather than forcing them off as soon as the first year after the initial offering, could provide companies with greater certainty and incentivize more IPOs, especially among smaller companies.</p>
<p>American entrepreneurs built the most dynamic economy in history in part by taking their companies public&mdash;and sharing the rewards with workers, savers, and investors. That partnership is worth reviving. If we want the next generation of innovators to choose our public markets, we need disclosure that is calibrated for a company&rsquo;s size and maturity; that is driven by market demands; and to the extent mandated by the SEC, that is rooted in materiality and not whimsical social or political agendas.</p>
<p>Of course, disclosure reform is just one of three pillars of my plan to make IPOs great again. A second pillar involves de-politicizing shareholder meetings and returning their focus to voting on director elections and significant corporate matters. Finally, we must also reform the litigation landscape for securities lawsuits to eliminate frivolous complaints, while maintaining an avenue for shareholders to continue to bring forth meritorious claims. At the SEC, we have been hard at work on executing this plan, and we look forward to soon sharing the progress that is taking shape.</p>
<p>Raising capital through an IPO should not be a privilege reserved for those few &ldquo;unicorns.&rdquo; More and more, public investments are concentrated in a handful of companies that are generally in the same one or two industries. Our regulatory framework should provide companies in all stages of their growth and from all industries with the opportunity for an IPO, particularly an IPO that represents a capital raising mechanism for the company, instead of a liquidity event for insiders.</p>
<p class="text-align-center">***</p>
<p>Now, the reforms that I have just outlined are a worthwhile and necessary beginning. They will help capital flow faster and more freely to its highest and best use, which is to say toward human initiative and ingenuity. And they will help to guide the SEC back to the bedrock pecuniary fundamentals on which our mandate is based.</p>
<p>But these are only the first steps in a broader effort to realign our markets with their most fundamental purpose, which is to place the full measure of American might where it belongs: in the hands of our citizens instead of the regulatory state.</p>
<p>As we look forward to America&rsquo;s 250th year, let us remember that no nation has ever entrusted so much agency to the individual&mdash;and no nation has been so plentifully rewarded for it. And yet, even as the weight of history and evidence affirm this truth, some in our society have come to question whether the capital markets remain the most reliable engine for upward mobility. They presume that the politically prescribed allocation of capital is superior to that of free market forces. They call to &ldquo;seize the means of production.&rdquo; They contend, often through artful, alliterative slogans, that decisions made by the government are more efficient and more just than those made by the governed. They ask, &ldquo;Can capitalism propel people past the circumstances of their birth or background?&rdquo; Can it reflect our highest values?</p>
<p>I, for one, believe emphatically that it can&mdash;and history has proven it. For, at its best, capital is the instrument through which an individual can marshal the resources of a free society in pursuit of shared prosperity. It is the instrument through which we can create value in the lives of others by creating value in our own. Indeed, our markets are a deeply moral enterprise because they are a mutually beneficial one. Because every exchange holds the potential to lift both parties. Because our markets affirm the dignity of the human spirit and liberate its potential to invent, to build, to innovate, and to flourish as no other alternative can.</p>
<p>This is precisely why our work at the Securities and Exchange Commission matters. Because when our capital markets are strong, they amplify that sense of dignity on a global scale. Because no force has lifted more people from poverty, widened more paths to opportunity, or solved more of society&rsquo;s most intractable problems than capital investments through our capital markets.</p>
<p>In the coming months, we will pursue the reforms that I have discussed today, and several others, with the urgency and care that they command. We will work closely with Congress and the Administration. We will listen carefully to market participants and to investors. And we will proceed steadily with the confidence that comes from standing on sound principles and a clear mandate. But above all, we will proceed with the resolve worthy of a people ever agitating to be prosperous.</p>
<p class="text-align-center">***</p>
<p>In closing, I believe that our capital markets are more than the mechanisms of finance&mdash;they are, at their core, expressions of our national character. A character that has compelled generations of Americans to take risks and to reap the rewards. To innovate endlessly and restlessly. To believe that the future is ours to make.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So as America&rsquo;s 250th anniversary approaches, the question before us is not whether our entrepreneurs have the capacity to reinvigorate our capital markets, but whether we, as regulators, have the will.</p>
<p>In this new day at the SEC, and under President Trump&rsquo;s leadership, I am pleased to report that we do.</p>
<p>Indeed, I am confident that we will preserve the promise of our capital markets for the next quarter millennium and well beyond. I trust that we will summon anew the enterprising spirit that Hamilton divined would be the source of our strength. And I believe that we will ensure that the American story, which began in many ways just steps outside, is preserved not by memory or speeches alone, but by the courage of those who are determined to chart its next chapter.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your time today. You all have been a patient and indulgent audience. And I look forward to the work ahead of us. Thank you.</p>

<title>An Illusion Of Legality: Wildlife Laundering In Colombia And Mexico</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><b>&ldquo;Wildlife laundering poses a serious risk to national and international security, causing environmental and socioeconomic harms and creating opportunities for organised crime and conflict actors.&rdquo;</b></p>
<p>This is according to&nbsp;<b><i><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/research-papers/illusion-legality-wildlife-laundering-colombia-and-mexico" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">An Illusion of Legality: Wildlife Laundering in Colombia and Mexico</a></i>,&nbsp;</b>a new RUSI report by&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.rusi.org/people/scotland" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><b>Jennifer Scotland</b></a><b>&nbsp;</b>and&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.rusi.org/people/weeden" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><b>&nbsp;</b></a><b><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.rusi.org/people/weeden" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.rusi.org/people/weeden</a></b>&nbsp;which says rogue traders and criminal organisations &minus; including drug-trafficking cartels and armed groups &ndash; are exploiting supposedly legitimate wildlife industries to launder illicit profits and mask the illegal origins of high-value species, including big cats, caimans, sharks and poison frogs.</p>
<p>This groundbreaking analysis shows how, in Colombia and Mexico, breeding farms, wildlife sanctuaries, commercial traders and seafood companies are used to disguise the extraction, transport and export of illegally harvested species, as part of&nbsp;a global illegal wildlife market estimated to be worth US$20 billion annually.</p>
<p>The report says that big cats in Mexico &minus; including lions, tigers and jaguars &minus; face significant wildlife-laundering risks through poorly regulated wildlife sanctuaries, which can be used as fronts for illegal trade, under the guise of rescue or rehabilitation. Large shipments of big cats from Mexican sanctuaries to overseas facilities have raised international concern, underscoring vulnerabilities created by weak oversight, limited inspections, and potential collusion between operators and corrupt officials.</p>
<p>In Colombia, the report identifies how the large-scale trade in caiman skins for the fashion industry has been highly exposed to wildlife laundering, with roughly one-third of exports between 1990 and 2016 reportedly illegally wild-sourced. The report finds that strict controls on the breeding of other endangered species has driven the trade underground, causing them to be smuggled out of Colombia and integrated into &lsquo;legal&rsquo; breeding operations in other countries. Poison frogs &ndash; sourced by rural Colombian harvesters for as little as $0.50 &ndash; can fetch up to US$850 in international hobbyist markets, demonstrating how wildlife laundering benefits fraudulent breeders at the expense of vulnerable communities.</p>
<p>The report further describes how some armed groups have used illegal pirarucu fishing to launder drug-trafficking proceeds, moving fish across borders &ndash; sometimes alongside cocaine &ndash; to circumvent national controls. Similar criminal convergence is found in Mexico&rsquo;s shark fin and sea cucumber trades, where large-scale buyers and exporters with suspected cartel links have laundered illegally harvested products into legal supply chains in the US and Asia.</p>
<p>Jennifer Scotland, the lead author of the report, said: &ldquo;Our report shows how rogue actors and organised crime groups subvert the legal trade in endangered wildlife to further their own gains, harming biodiversity and undermining economic opportunities for local communities. To mitigate these harms, wildlife laundering needs to be taken much more seriously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth Helena Alves da Mota, Content Partnership Manager at LSEG Risk Intelligence, which supported RUSI&rsquo;s independent research, said:<b>&nbsp;</b>&ldquo;The findings underscore that combating wildlife laundering requires a collective effort &ndash; particularly intelligence sharing across borders, sectors, and disciplines are critical to dismantling transnational networks and ensuring that legal markets do not become safe havens for illegal trade.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Key Findings</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Organised crime groups&nbsp;</b>&ndash;&nbsp;<b>including cartel-linked actors&nbsp;</b>&ndash;&nbsp;<b>use legal businesses to launder wildlife.</b>&nbsp;The report says: &ldquo;Corporate entities&hellip; can be used by rogue traders and organised criminal groups&hellip; to exploit regulatory and enforcement gaps and launder illegally sourced species.&rdquo;</li>
<li><b>Wildlife laundering is under-detected and rarely treated as a serious crime.</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;Documented cases &ndash; let alone follow-up criminal investigations &ndash; remain few and far between.&rdquo;</li>
<li><b>Weak enforcement capacity enables criminal infiltration of supply chains.</b><br />&ldquo;Wildlife laundering&hellip; is predominantly enabled by weak enforcement capacity and limited resources.&rdquo;</li>
<li><b>Cartels exploit regulatory loopholes and cross-border asymmetries.</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;Opportunities for illicit actors to engage in wildlife laundering are facilitated by regulatory asymmetries, legal loopholes, informalities across the sector and limited enforcement of fishing regulations.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Key Recommendations</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Close loopholes used by criminal groups to disguise illegal activity.</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;Preventive reforms could target known loopholes, including those highlighted in this paper.&rdquo;</li>
<li><b>Classify wildlife trafficking as a predicate offence for money laundering.</b><br />&ldquo;By making wildlife trafficking a predicate offence for money laundering&hellip; authorities could disrupt the financial infrastructure that sustains trafficking networks.&rdquo;</li>
<li><b>Strengthen international cooperation and destination-country due diligence.</b><br />&ldquo;Greater accessibility of information around CITES permits would strengthen oversight&hellip; and make it easier&hellip; to detect fraudulent paperwork.&rdquo;</li>
<li><b>Expand the use of technological tools to expose criminal laundering methods.&nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Advances in technology offer the potential to address a number of traceability and species identification challenges that facilitate wildlife laundering.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>Wildlife laundering in Colombia and Mexico is not only a conservation issue but a security threat that enables organised crime and conflict actors to diversify their income streams, legitimise illicit proceeds and deepen their influence across rural communities and transnational markets. By revealing how legal businesses can be manipulated to conceal illegal wildlife flows, the report underscores the urgent need for a systemic shift in enforcement and regulatory strategies. Tackling wildlife laundering effectively requires authorities to target corporate structures, disrupt financial networks, strengthen international coordination and recognise wildlife laundering as a serious transnational crime.</p>
<p>Wildlife laundering cases remain rarely detected, let alone investigated as organised criminal activity. Irregularities in licensed wildlife businesses are typically handled as administrative breaches, obscuring the role of cartel financiers, corrupt officials and corporate intermediaries who profit from the trade. The authors argue that unless authorities adopt a more robust, cross-border and intelligence-led approach, wildlife laundering will continue to provide criminal groups with a lucrative, low-risk revenue stream that deepens insecurity, threatens biodiversity and undermines community livelihoods.</p>

<title>Purdue University/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer: Better Outlook For The Future Pushes Farmer Sentiment Higher In Europe</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>November brought the highest farmer sentiment reading since June, with the&nbsp;<a href="https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4570229-1&amp;h=2593938520&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fageconomybarometer%2F&amp;a=Purdue+University%2FCME+Group+Ag+Economy+Barometer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="xn-org">Purdue University</span>/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer</a>&nbsp;jumping 10 points from October to 139. The increase was driven primarily by producers' more optimistic outlook for the future, as the Future Expectations Index climbed 15 points to 144, while the Current Conditions Index dipped 2 points to 128. November's survey is the first conducted after the late-October announcement of a U.S.-<span class="xn-location">China</span>&nbsp;trade pact that includes provisions to expand U.S. agricultural exports and revealed a notable improvement in producers' confidence in future export opportunities. Sentiment also received support from a sharp rise in crop prices between mid-October and mid-November. The barometer survey took place&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">Nov. 10-14</span>.</p>
<p>Producers were more optimistic about their farms' financial performance in November, with the Farm Financial Performance Index increasing by 14 points to 92. The percentage of producers expecting better financial results this year grew to 24%, up from 16% in October. A sharp rise in crop prices from mid-October to mid-November was a key driver of the expectation for better financial performance. For example, eastern Corn Belt prices for fall delivery of corn and soybeans increased 10% and 15%, respectively, during that period. The stronger financial outlook in the crop sector compensated for a weaker outlook in the livestock sector, where declining cattle prices weighed on financial expectations. Despite the improved farm financial outlook, the Farm Capital Investment Index fell 6 points to 56, with only 16% of respondents indicating that now is a good time to make major investments in their operations.</p>
<p>"Producers became more optimistic about U.S. agricultural trade prospects in November. That coincided with a rise in crop prices, which led to farmers' improved expectations for their farms' financial performance and an improvement in farmer sentiment," said&nbsp;<a href="https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4570229-1&amp;h=300100255&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fhome%2Fteam%2Fmichael-langemeier%2F&amp;a=Michael+Langemeier" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="xn-person">Michael Langemeier</span></a>, the barometer's principal investigator and director of&nbsp;<span class="xn-org">Purdue's</span>&nbsp;<a href="https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4570229-1&amp;h=243308766&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fhome%2F&amp;a=Center+for+Commercial+Agriculture" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Center for Commercial Agriculture</a>.</p>
<p>Producers were more optimistic about future agricultural trade prospects in November. In response to a question included in every barometer survey since&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">January 2019</span>, just 7% of respondents said they expect U.S. agricultural exports to weaken over the next five years, down from 14% in October and 30% in March. In a related question, 47% of corn producers indicated they expect soybean exports to increase over the next five years, while 8% anticipate a decline. The stronger trade outlook likely contributed to the overall improvement in sentiment observed in November.</p>
<p>A majority of producers in November reported that they still expect to receive a supplementary support payment from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, similar to the 2019 Market Facilitation Program (MFP). However, confidence in receiving the payment fell sharply in November: Only 16% of respondents said an MFP payment was "very likely," down from 62% in September. Still, when combining the "likely" and "very likely" categories, just over three-fourths of producers (76%) said they expect an MFP payment, compared to 83% in September. Regarding how they plan to use an MFP payment, 58% of respondents said they would use it to "pay down debt," up from 52% in October.</p>
<p>For the second month in a row, the Short-Term Farmland Value Expectations Index increased, reaching 116 in November, which is 3 points higher than October and 10 points above September. Farmers' long-term outlook on farmland values also improved, with the Long-Term Farmland Value Expectations Index increasing by 4 points to a record high of 165. The November survey also asked corn producers about their expectations for 2026 cash rental rates. Nearly three-fourths of respondents (74%) said they expect rental rates to remain roughly the same as this year, consistent with responses from the July and August surveys. The relatively strong outlook for cash rent further supports farmland values.</p>
<p>"The record-high reading of the Long-Term Farmland Value Expectations Index indicates that farmers retain an optimistic long-run outlook for agriculture," Langemeier said. "Although rising crop prices and improved trade prospects have bolstered optimism, producers remain cautious in their investment and production decisions, reflecting the short-term uncertainty they face."</p>
<p>The November survey asked corn producers about possible changes to their production practices in 2026 due to expected weak operating margins. Among those producers planning to make adjustments, two practices were highlighted most often: switching to lower-cost seed traits or varieties and reducing phosphorus applications. Producers followed up by pointing to reductions in corn seeding rates and nitrogen application rates as potential changes. Still, a substantial portion of producers (40%) said they do not plan to make any changes to their corn production practices in 2026.</p>
<p>Recent barometer surveys have included questions on farmers' attitudes toward 2025 policy shifts. A majority of respondents in November (59%) and October (58%) said they expect U.S. tariffs to ultimately strengthen the agricultural economy. This is lower than last spring, when 70% of respondents anticipated that tariffs would have a long-term positive effect. The percentage of producers expressing uncertainty about the long-term impact of U.S. tariff policy has risen in recent months. In October, 16% of respondents said they were uncertain, rising slightly to 17% in November, roughly double the 8% reported in April and May. Meanwhile, two-thirds of farmers (67%) in the November survey said the U.S. is headed in the "right direction," down from 72% in October.</p>

<title>Euronext Signs The Armed Forces Covenant In The United Kingdom</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/euronext-signs-the-armed-forces-covenant-in-the-united-kingdom-2025122/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/euronext-signs-the-armed-forces-covenant-in-the-united-kingdom-2025122/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Euronext, the leading European capital market infrastructure, today signed the Armed Forces Covenant with the United Kingdom&rsquo;s Ministry of Defence. This is the fifth partnership signed by Euronext with local military reserves in Europe. With these partnerships, Euronext reaffirms its commitment to European resilience and strategic autonomy.</p>
<p>These partnerships extend the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.euronext.com/en/about/media/euronext-press-releases/euronext-strengthens-its-support-for-european-strategic">initiatives related to Energy, Security and Geostrategy, the &ldquo;New ESG&rdquo;</a>, launched by Euronext on 6 May 2025 to strengthen European strategic autonomy. This set of initiatives led by Euronext enhances the visibility of European companies operating in strategic sectors and provides them with unprecedented tools to meet their financing needs through improved access to capital. These solutions also address the growing demand from asset managers, institutional investors and retail investors for better exposure to high-growth segments through thematic indices.</p>
<p>As European strategic autonomy and independence rely on the ability of European citizens to take part in their country&rsquo;s own defence ecosystem, Euronext has created a support framework for its employees who are already engaged in a reservist commitment, or who wish to take up this opportunity. As of 6 May 2025, Euronext guarantees the continuation of salary and social benefits for preliminary training periods of up to 15 days for all new reservists, and up to 10 days per year for all Euronext employees engaged in a reservist commitment across all the group&rsquo;s European locations. In countries where a more beneficial local reservist support system exists, the existing framework prevails.</p>
<p>To formalise this engagement, Euronext has signed partnerships with five national military reserves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In London, Euronext signed a partnership with the UK military reserve, the UK Reserve Forces, in the form of the Armed Forces Covenant, on 2 December 2025. The Covenant was cosigned by Brigadier Sam Cates, Deputy Commander HQ London District, in a ceremony that took place in the historic Wellington Room, Horse Guards. The event reflected the deep military ties and security interests that bind the United Kingdom and the countries in which Euronext operates regulated markets.</p>
<p>In Amsterdam, Euronext signed a partnership with the Dutch military reserve, the Korps Nationale Reserve, on 12 November 2025. To mark this occasion, Gijs Tuinman, Dutch State Secretary for Defence, sounded the gong at the stock exchange, in the presence of Colonel Ruben Koopman, Head of the Department of Reservists and Society, and Lieutenant Colonel dr. Roland Slegers-Leijsten, Commander of the Korps National Reserve.</p>
<p>In Oslo, Euronext signed a partnership with the Norwegian military reserve, the Norwegian Home Guard, on 3 November 2025. The partnership was signed during the annual keynote addresses from the Norwegian Army and the Norwegian Home Guard, in the presence of his Majesty Harald V, King of Norway, Major General Lars Lervik, Chief of the Norwegian Army and Major General Frode Ommundsen, Chief of the Norwegian Home Guard.</p>
<p>In Paris, Euronext signed a partnership with the French military reserve, the Garde nationale, on 1 October 2025. General Fran&ccedil;ois-Xavier<span>&nbsp;</span>Poisbeau, General Secretary of the French National Guard, presented the main aspects of the partnership, while Baptiste Mercier, Head of Operational Performance at Allianz France, and Coralie Lecouffe, Senior Consultant at Capgemini Invent, shared personal experiences from their engagement as reservists.</p>
<p>In Copenhagen, Euronext signed a partnership with the Danish military reserve, InterForce Danmark, on 19 September 2025. Local employees had the opportunity to meet with members of the reservist forces, who shared insights about their experience and highlighted how military reservists support Denmark&rsquo;s resilience.</p>
<p><span>St&eacute;phane Boujnah, CEO and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext, said:</span>&nbsp;<em>"Since September 2025, Euronext has signed partnerships with local military reserves in Denmark, France, Norway, the Netherlands, and now the United Kingdom. Through these five local partnerships in Europe, Euronext reinforces its commitment to strengthen European resilience and strategic autonomy, at a time of rising geopolitical tensions. I am deeply proud of this citizen engagement that enables our colleagues to put their skills and abilities to the service of their countries. These initiatives demonstrate the power of cross-border collaboration and highlight Euronext&rsquo;s role as a unifying force in Europe&rsquo;s capital markets.&rdquo;</em></p>

<div class="section-heading">
<h2 id="chapter-0">Record of the Financial Policy Committee meetings on 25 November 2025 and 1 December</h2>
<div class="box-highlight">
<h3><a id="_Hlk193965425"></a>Headline judgements and policy actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><span>Risks to financial stability have increased during 2025.&nbsp;</span>Global risks remain elevated and material uncertainty in the global macroeconomic outlook persists. Key sources of risk include geopolitical tensions, fragmentation of trade and financial markets, and pressures on sovereign debt markets.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>In the FPC&rsquo;s judgement, many risky asset valuations remain materially stretched, particularly for technology companies focused on Artificial Intelligence (AI).&nbsp;</span>The role of debt financing in this sector is increasing quickly as AI-focused firms seek large scale infrastructure investment. Deeper links between AI firms and credit markets, and increasing interconnections between those firms, mean that, should an asset price correction occur, losses on lending could increase financial stability risks.</li>
<li><span>Credit spreads remain compressed by historical standards.&nbsp;</span>Two recent high-profile corporate defaults in the US have intensified focus on potential weaknesses in risky credit markets previously flagged by the FPC. These include high leverage, weak underwriting standards, opacity, complex structures and the degree of reliance on rating agencies. While the impact of these specific defaults has been limited, a diverse range of financial market participants were exposed. It is important that market participants have a clear understanding of their exposures, including in stress scenarios where correlations and losses can shift outside historical norms, that underwriting standards are robust, and that they do not over-rely on credit ratings as a substitute for carrying out due diligence.</li>
<li><span>Public debt-to-GDP ratios in many advanced economies have continued to rise this year.&nbsp;</span>Governments globally face spending pressures, given the context of changing demographics and geopolitical risk, potentially constraining their capacity to respond to future shocks. Significant shocks to the global economic or fiscal outlook, should they materialise, could be amplified by vulnerabilities in market-based finance (MBF), such as leveraged positions in sovereign debt markets.</li>
<li><span>As an open economy with a large financial centre, the UK is exposed to global shocks, that could transmit through multiple, interconnected channels.&nbsp;</span>Stress in one market, such as a sharp asset price correction or correlation shift, could spillover into other markets. Simultaneous&nbsp;de-risking by banks and non-banks can&nbsp;lead to fire sales, widening spreads and&nbsp;tightening financing conditions for UK households and corporates. Market participants&nbsp;should ensure their&nbsp;risk management incorporates such scenarios.</li>
<li><span>UK household and corporate aggregate indebtedness remains low. The UK banking system is well capitalised, maintains robust liquidity and funding positions, and asset quality remains strong.&nbsp;</span>The results of the 2025 Bank Capital Stress Test demonstrate that the UK banking system is able to continue to support growth even if economic and financial conditions turned out to be materially worse than expected.</li>
<li><span>As part of ensuring the UK banking sector is both resilient and able to support growth, the FPC has reviewed its assessment of the appropriate level of capital requirements for the UK banking system.&nbsp;</span>The Committee judges that the appropriate benchmark for the system-wide level of Tier 1 capital requirements is now around 13% of risk-weighted assets (RWAs) (equivalent to a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of around 11%), 1 percentage point lower than its previous benchmark of around 14%. That judgement is consistent with the evolution in the financial system since the FPC&rsquo;s first assessment in 2015, including a fall in banks&rsquo; average risk weights, a reduction in the systemic importance of some banks, and improvements in risk measurement. The Committee has also identified areas for further work, including on buffer usability, the implementation of the leverage ratio in the UK, and initiatives by the Bank to respond to feedback on interactions, proportionality, and complexity.</li>
<li><span>In response to the Chancellor&rsquo;s request on the FPC&rsquo;s November 2024 remit letter, the FPC has assessed and identified areas where the financial sector could contribute further to supporting sustainable growth.&nbsp;</span>This work has focused on: facilitating long-term investment in productive assets; fostering technological innovation; and the supply of debt or equity finance to high-growth firms (HGFs), which make an outsized contribution to economic growth and employment growth.</li>
<li><span>The FPC supports</span>:&nbsp;the changes made by the PRA to Solvency II to encourage investment in productive assets by UK insurers (noting the industry&rsquo;s commitment to invest &pound;100 billion in UK productive assets over 10 years); work to ease impediments to HGFs accessing funding; and efforts by authorities and industry to deliver practical advancements in the UK financial system&rsquo;s adoption of innovative technology.</li>
<li><span>The FPC has maintained the UK countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) rate at 2%.&nbsp;</span>Although the global risk environment remains elevated, UK household and corporate aggregate indebtedness remains low. The easing of credit conditions since the FPC's Q3 meeting has been in line with the macroeconomic outlook, with some additional easing in the mortgage market related to policy developments.</li>
<li><span>The Committee supports the Bank&rsquo;s plans for a private markets system-wide exploratory scenario (SWES).&nbsp;</span>This would deepen understanding of the private markets ecosystem, including how firms' behaviours in stress might interact and whether these interactions could amplify stress across the financial system and pose risks to UK financial stability and the provision of finance to the UK real economy.</li>
<li><span>Heightened geopolitical tensions and continued advances in technology have underlined the critical importance of operational resilience to the provision of vital services to households and businesses.&nbsp;</span>The Committee supports further actions to be taken by firms and financial market infrastructures (FMIs) to build resilience to operational disruption.</li>
<li><span>The Committee welcomes the Bank's recent consultation paper setting out its proposed regulatory regime for sterling-denominated systemic stablecoins.&nbsp;</span>The regime should aim to support responsible innovation in payments and money and avoid a disorderly transition as this new form of money is adopted.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>1: The Financial Policy Committee (FPC) seeks to ensure the UK financial system is prepared for, and resilient to, the wide range of risks it could face, so that it is able to absorb rather than amplify shocks, and serve UK households and businesses, thus supporting stability and long-term growth in the UK economy.</p>
<p>2: The Committee met on 25 November 2025 to agree its view on the outlook for UK financial stability. The FPC discussed the risks faced by the UK financial system and assessed the resilience of the system to those risks. On that basis, the Committee agreed its intended policy actions.</p>
<p>3: The Committee met subsequently on 1 December 2025, with the Prudential Regulation Committee (PRC), to confirm its response to the final results of the 2025 Bank Capital Stress Test.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-0">The overall risk environment</h3>
<p>4: The FPC discussed recent developments in financial markets; global vulnerabilities; UK household and corporate debt vulnerabilities; and the resilience of the UK banking sector and market-based finance. The FPC&rsquo;s judgements for these areas would be set out in the December 2025&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-stability-report/2025/december-2025">Financial Stability Report</a>&nbsp;(FSR).</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-1">Contributing to sustainable growth</h3>
<p>5: The Committee agreed that maintaining financial stability was a necessary foundation for sustainable economic growth. Periods of financial instability &ndash; such as the global financial crisis (GFC) &ndash; had negatively impacted the provision of vital services to households and businesses in the UK and weighed on output and productivity growth. In contrast, a stable financial system supports lower risk and term premia, lowering the cost of borrowing and improving incentives to invest in long-term productive investment.</p>
<p>6: The FPC primarily contributes to sustainable economic growth by maintaining financial stability through identifying, monitoring and addressing systemic risks to the UK financial sector, as required under its statutory objective. The Committee also has a secondary objective of supporting the Government&rsquo;s economic policy, including in relation to growth and employment. The FPC judged that these objectives were complementary over the medium to long-term: financial stability was necessary for sustainable growth, and sustainable growth supported financial stability.</p>
<p>7: The Committee noted that over the past 15 years, UK labour productivity growth had been low by historical standards and relative to some other advanced economies. The financial sector plays a role in contributing to productivity growth by providing vital services to UK households and businesses, including the provision of financing for investment in capital and technology. But there are a broader range of factors across the economy at play, such as trade conditions, scientific and technological innovation and human capital.</p>
<p>8: The Committee agreed that factors other than financial regulation had been the primary driver of low investment and so low productivity. The volume of lending to the UK real economy had not decreased as a share of GDP in the long run, and the increased diversification of the UK financial system had enhanced the supply of productive finance to the real economy.</p>
<p>9: The Committee observed that lending to UK households and corporates had in the past fluctuated due to changes in financial and macroeconomic conditions. Incentives in the financial system in the past had led to unsustainable lending growth in boom times followed by periods of deleveraging during the resulting downturn. However, post-GFC regulation had increased bank resilience. Combined with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2023/useful-usable-and-used-buffer-usability-during-the-covid-19-crisis.pdf" target="_blank">FPC&rsquo;s use of the countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) in stress<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external"></span></a><span>,</span>&nbsp;this had enabled the banking sector to continue to support households and businesses through recent shocks to the economy.</p>
<p>10: In working to advance its primary objective, the FPC would continue to take steps to ensure that its resilience-building policies were implemented efficiently in a way that supported sustainable growth as the financial system evolved.</p>
<h4>How the UK financial sector can better contribute to sustainable economic growth</h4>
<p>11: In November 2024, via the Committee&rsquo;s annual&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/remit-and-recommendations-for-the-financial-policy-committee-november-2024" target="_blank">remit letter<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external"></span></a>, the Chancellor asked the FPC to undertake work to assess and identify areas where there is potential to increase the ability of the financial system to contribute to sustainable economic growth and potential solutions to the impediments the sector might face in doing so. The Committee discussed the conclusions of this work.</p>
<p>12: The Committee had agreed in its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-policy-committee-record/2025/april-2025">April 2025 Record</a>&nbsp;that its work in response to the Chancellor&rsquo;s commission would focus on improving the long-term productive growth capacity of the economy by identifying barriers to the provision of credit and vital services to the real economy by the financial services sector. The FPC had focused on the provision of finance to high growth firms (HGFs) because they made an outsized contribution to economic and employment growth in the UK and globally.</p>
<p>13: The FPC agreed that HGFs faced growing challenges in accessing domestic finance. The FPC identified three impediments to the supply of debt or equity finance to HGFs. First, HGFs found it progressively more difficult to raise funds as funding rounds got larger, due to an underdeveloped domestic funding landscape. Second, HGF finance could be an extremely complex funding ecosystem for funders and founders to navigate. And third, many HGFs had little tangible collateral, and HGFs struggled to secure lending using intellectual property (IP) as collateral due to valuation and recovery constraints.</p>
<p>14: In addition, the FPC noted that UK pension funds and insurers faced barriers in supporting&nbsp;long-term capital investment in the UK economy.&nbsp;The Committee&nbsp;identified&nbsp;the impediments to the investment of long-term capital by pension funds and insurers. First, UK&nbsp;Defined Contribution (DC) pension schemes&nbsp;were smaller in scale and&nbsp;allocated&nbsp;less to riskier assets than international peers. Second, UK insurers reported a lack of&nbsp;opportunities to invest domestically&nbsp;that&nbsp;align with their expertise and risk and reward targets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>15: The FPC noted the package of measures announced by HM Treasury in the Budget. The Committee also underscored the importance of considering greater use of public-private partnership funding initiatives to channel financing to HGFs and the broader population of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to support productivity improvements. The FPC noted the key role the British Business Bank could play in this context, building on the experience of a number of other countries with similar organisations.</p>
<p>16: The FPC also identified&nbsp;issues in the financial sector&rsquo;s responsible adoption of innovative technology.&nbsp;First, the technology cost of building and&nbsp;maintaining&nbsp;resilience against cyber threats was&nbsp;challenging&nbsp;for&nbsp;new and&nbsp;small&nbsp;FinTechs. Many cyberattacks target third-party suppliers &ndash; which FinTechs often aspire to become &ndash; as a point of entry into larger corporates. The costs of cyberattacks could be large, and elevated geopolitical tensions and continued advances in technology had increased the potential for operational incidents to disrupt the provision of vital services (see below). Second, the UK&rsquo;s payments infrastructure needed to keep pace with innovation to support economic activity. Seamless and frictionless payments are critical to economic activity. Coordinated action and investment was needed to create the next generation of payment infrastructure that drives innovation, supports competition, and ensures security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>17: Having considered the above, the Committee concluded that it would:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support&nbsp;the changes made by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) to Solvency II to encourage investment in productive assets by UK insurers. This included reforms to the Matching Adjustment (MA)&nbsp;regime &ndash; and the investment in UK productive assets the UK insurance industry had indicated those reforms would enable &ndash; and its introduction of a Matching Adjustment Investment Accelerator (MAIA).&nbsp; As part of this, the FPC noted the UK insurance industry&rsquo;s commitment to invest &pound;100 billion in UK productive assets over 10 years.</li>
<li>Support work led by other authorities to ease impediments to HGFs accessing funding. This included the use of public-private partnership funding initiatives to channel financing to HGFs and the broader populations of SMEs, and engaging with the working group established as part of HMG's Industrial Strategy with the aim of removing barriers to IP-backed lending.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Support efforts by authorities and industry to deliver practical advancements in the UK financial system&rsquo;s adoption of innovative technology, including through the National Payments Vision, the Bank&rsquo;s AI Consortium and the Financial Conduct Authority&rsquo;s (FCA) AI Lab&rsquo;s Live Testing service.</li>
</ul>
<p>18: Given the importance of sustainable economic growth to the FPC&rsquo;s objectives, the FPC would closely monitor progress on these issues and remained committed to identifying further ways in which it could deliver on its objective to support economic growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>19: Further details on the FPC&rsquo;s findings in relation to sustainable growth would be published in the December 2025&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-stability-report/2025/december-2025">FSR</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-2">The FPC&rsquo;s assessment of bank capital requirements</h3>
<p>20: The FPC revisited its assessment of the appropriate benchmark level of capital requirements for the banking system. Details of the assessment would be published in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-stability-in-focus/2025/fsif-the-fpcs-assessment-of-bank-capital-requirements">Financial Stability in Focus</a>&nbsp;(FSIF), published alongside the December FSR. The FPC welcomed feedback and evidence from a broad range of stakeholders on it and on the issues identified for further assessment.</p>
<p>21: The Committee judged that the updated appropriate benchmark for the system-wide level of Tier 1 capital requirements was now around 13% of RWAs (equivalent to a CET1 ratio of around 11%), 1 percentage point lower than its previous benchmark of around 14%. That judgement was consistent with the evolution in the financial system since the FPC&rsquo;s first assessment in 2015, including a fall in banks&rsquo; average risk weights, a reduction in the systemic importance of some banks, and improvements in risk measurement.&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk215496340"></a>Given the reduction in the FPC&rsquo;s benchmark, banks should have greater certainty and confidence in using their capital resources to lend to UK households and businesses.</p>
<p>22: The FPC's system-wide Tier 1 benchmark excluded firm-specific PRA buffers, and requirements set by overseas authorities such as the international component of the CCyB. Within the banking system there would be a distribution of capital requirements in practice reflecting individual banks&rsquo; business models, their level of systemic importance, the degree of gaps and mismeasurement in their risk weighted assets, and the PRA&rsquo;s view of firm-specific risks.</p>
<p>23: In undertaking its review, the FPC had considered how capital requirements had evolved since previous assessments, and feedback it had received from industry and other stakeholders. The FPC noted that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Average risk-weights had fallen as banks had changed the composition and riskiness of their balance sheets.</li>
<li>Systemic buffers were lower than envisaged in 2015 as some banks had decreased in systemic importance.</li>
<li>The implementation of Basel 3.1 on 1 January 2027 would improve risk measurement, allowing the PRA to reduce Pillar 2A minimum requirements by around &frac12; percentage point.</li>
</ul>
<p>24: The FPC considered that the inbuilt responsiveness of nominal capital requirements in the UK banking system &ndash; to falls in average risks weights, decreases in UK banks&rsquo; systemic importance, and improvements in the measurement of risk weights &ndash; reflected desirable flexibility in the capital framework. Flexibility in the framework meant that capital requirements could continue to respond to developments in underlying structural and cyclical factors in future, including if risk levels were to change.</p>
<p>25: UK banks had tended to have capital headroom over regulatory minimum and buffer requirements. Such headroom varied considerably across banks and over time. Currently, banks in aggregate had CET1 capital resources of about 2% of RWAs over their requirements. While the PRA and FPC had no requirements &ndash; formal or informal &ndash; for capital headroom, banks maintain this additional capital for a number of reasons, including a perceived lack of buffer usability.</p>
<p>26: The FPC also considered how the level of capital requirements in the UK compared to international peers. Comparing capital requirements across jurisdictions was challenging given differences in how risks were captured in different regulatory frameworks &ndash; for example, the UK and EU regulatory frameworks captured some risks through Pillar 2 capital add-ons, while the US framework under law instead tended to apply higher risk weights.</p>
<p>27: The level of risk-based capital requirements for large banks in the UK was broadly similar to that in the euro area. And analysis that attempted to adjust for some key differences in the way risks were captured between the UK and US suggested that the level in the UK was lower than that in the US. That said, UK requirements appeared to be higher than in other jurisdictions for some more specific aspects and cohorts, particularly leverage ratio requirements for large domestically focused banks.</p>
<p>28: The Committee considered that the change in its benchmark was consistent with its view that the banking sector could support long-term growth in the real economy in both<span>&nbsp;</span>current and adverse economic environments. This was supported by the results of the 2025 Bank Capital Stress Test, which demonstrated that the UK banking system could continue to support the economy even if economic and financial conditions turned out materially worse than expected.</p>
<p>29: The FPC had considered updated evidence related to its previous judgements on the economic costs and benefits of capital and reviewed external academic studies that provided independent estimates of appropriate capital levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>The FPC reaffirmed that its previous judgements related to the positive impact of post-crisis reforms remained appropriate. Those judgements were related to credible and effective resolution arrangements, effective supervision, structural reform such as the implementation of ring-fencing, and the Committee&rsquo;s active use of the time-varying countercyclical capital buffer. Together, these judgements materially reduced the FPC&rsquo;s assessment of the appropriate level of capital in 2015.</li>
<li>Updated analysis suggested that the macroeconomic costs of bank capital may have declined as the spread between banks&rsquo; cost of equity and the average cost of their debt had fallen. At the same time, various developments may have impacted the macroeconomic benefits of bank capital. Global vulnerabilities, including risks associated with sovereign indebtedness, had increased. But conversely, the indebtedness of UK households and businesses had fallen, and banks&rsquo; underwriting standards had improved.</li>
<li>Analysis of the net macroeconomic impact of capital requirements suggested that the Committee&rsquo;s updated 13% benchmark was within, albeit towards the lower end of, the range of capital requirements that were likely to maximise the benefits to long-term growth. The FPC&rsquo;s updated benchmark was also at the lower end of the range of optimal capital levels estimated in the external academic literature.</li>
<li>Analysis also suggested that reducing structural capital requirements materially below the FPC&rsquo;s updated benchmark of 13% (unless due to further improvements in risk measurement that allow overlaps to be removed from Pillar 2A requirements) could be associated with significant reductions in long-run expected GDP through the costs of greater instability, especially if those reductions in capital were to undermine the credibility of the resolution regime as a result of lower overall loss-absorbing capacity. Materially lower capital levels could also lead to higher risk premia on bank funding costs, which would in turn feed through to higher borrowing costs and lower investment by businesses.</li>
</ul>
<p>30: The FPC had also considered whether the capital framework might warrant adjustment to make it more effective, efficient and proportionate in the future, and to address any unintended consequences.</p>
<p>31: Significant steps were already being taken to address feedback and improve the efficiency and proportionality of the framework.<a id="_Hlk214369419"></a>&nbsp;The FPC had approached the assessment of capital requirements proactively and had identified further broad, material categories of issues in which it supported further work to assess whether changes could make the capital framework more effective, efficient and proportionate. The FPC would expect banks to use any such changes as a means to increase their support of households and businesses in the real economy.</p>
<p>32: Working with the PRA and international authorities, the FPC would work to enhance further the usability of regulatory buffers and so reduce banks&rsquo; incentives to have capital in excess of regulatory requirements and buffers. Regulatory capital buffers made up just under half of risk-weighted capital requirements. These buffers were explicitly intended to be usable to help banks absorb losses in stress while maintaining the provision of services to the real economy in a downturn &ndash; by reducing incentives for banks to deleverage in order to defend their capital position. Experience and a range of research suggested, however, that banks were reluctant in practice to use their buffers, which might have contributed to the size of banks&rsquo; management buffers above leverage ratio requirements.</p>
<p>33: The FPC would review the implementation of the leverage ratio in the UK, to ensure that it functioned as intended. When the FPC introduced the leverage ratio as a complement to the risk-weighted framework in 2015, it was envisaged that risk-weighted requirements would form the binding constraint for a majority of UK banks most of the time. Over time however, the falls in average risk weights had meant that the leverage ratio was becoming binding &ndash; or close to binding &ndash; for a greater number of lenders.</p>
<p>34: While there were reasons for the differences in application of the leverage ratio in the UK and some other countries, including previous macroprudential decisions by the FPC to apply buffers alongside Basel minimum standards, international comparisons also pointed to some potentially important areas to consider for reform. As a result, the FPC would review how the leverage ratio had been implemented in the UK, how it was operating in practice, how it was interacting with other policies such as ring-fencing, and whether this matched the original intention of the framework. For example, the FPC would explore the extent to which the leverage ratio had become more binding as a result of underlying reductions in the riskiness of banks&rsquo; exposures. The Committee intended to prioritise reviewing the UK&rsquo;s approach to regulatory buffers in leverage ratio requirements.</p>
<p>35: The FPC supported initiatives by the Bank to respond to feedback on interactions, proportionality, and complexity in the capital framework. This included further work to consider how the capital requirements that are related to domestic exposures interact. Capital requirements that were related to domestic exposures included the UK CCyB, O-SII buffers, and Pillar 2A requirements for geographic credit concentration risk, which each served different purposes in the capital framework, but were all calibrated based on measures of domestic lending. The FPC and the PRA intended to draw on several sources of information when conducting this work including on the impact of systemic failures and credit concentration, and banks&rsquo; stress test results. Other initiatives included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Further work to develop a systematic approach for updating regulatory thresholds that define which different parts of the regulatory framework apply to firms.</li>
<li>The PRA&rsquo;s contribution to the government&rsquo;s review of ring-fencing. The government had made clear its intention to maintain the ring-fencing regime to protect financial stability and safeguard depositors, while at the same time driving meaningful reform of the regime as part of plans to focus on growth and the release capital for productive investment in the UK. The PRA would also review the application of the Basel 3.1 output floor at the ring-fenced sub-group level, based on evidence and experience of its implementation. It would do so after Basel 3.1 is implemented but before full weighting of the output floor in 2030.</li>
<li>Reviewing feedback on the capital requirements for mortgages under internal ratings-based models, to ensure the framework enables an optimal channelling of finance to creditworthy households. Industry had previously raised concerns that Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) requirements were particularly difficult to meet for smaller and newer lenders. While aimed at exploring ways to address challenges faced by medium-sized firms, some policy changes would also affect larger lenders.</li>
</ul>
<p><a id="_Hlk215499855"></a>36: The FPC had previously judged that the introduction of International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 9 should not lead to an unwarranted increase in capital requirements. In response, and following engagement with industry, the Bank had made changes to the stress test relative to previous concurrent stress tests that were appropriate to make alongside the earlier provisioning under the IFRS 9 accounting standard. The FPC judged these changes had been effective in avoiding an unwarranted increase in capital arising from the interaction of IFRS 9 and the stress test, and made the test simpler and aligned with the accounting standard that would apply in an actual stress. The Bank therefore intended to maintain these changes for future tests (see below).</p>
<p>37: The FPC, along with the PRA, was interested in the views of a broad range of stakeholders &ndash; including UK lenders, think-tanks, industry groups, investors and academics &ndash; on the material covered in the accompanying FSIF on the FPC&rsquo;s assessment of bank capital requirements, and welcomed feedback and evidence on the issues identified for further assessment. The Bank would engage in structured evidence gathering sessions in early 2026.</p>
<p>38: Further details of the FPC&rsquo;s assessment would be published in an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-stability-in-focus/2025/fsif-the-fpcs-assessment-of-bank-capital-requirements">FSIF</a>, alongside the December 2025&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-stability-report/2025/december-2025">FSR</a>.</p>

<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-3">Results of the 2025 Bank Capital Stress Test</h3>
<p>39: The Committee discussed the results of the 2025 Bank Capital Stress Test, which indicated that the major UK banks had the capacity to continue to support the economy through a stress scenario that incorporated a severe global aggregate supply shock, high advanced-economy inflation, higher global interest rates, deep and simultaneous recessions in the UK and global economies, with materially higher unemployment, and sharp falls in asset prices.</p>
<p>40: The stress test was not a forecast of macroeconomic and financial conditions in the UK or abroad. Rather, it was intended to be a coherent &lsquo;tail risk&rsquo; scenario designed to be severe and broad enough to allow the FPC and PRC to assess the resilience of UK banks to a range of adverse shocks. The results of the stress test are used to form a view of the resilience of the banking sector and individual banks in it as part of the FPC and PRC&rsquo;s broader framework for financial stability and safety and soundness.</p>
<p>41: The stress test results showed that the aggregate CET1 ratio reduced by 3.5 percentage points to the low point of the test. That left aggregate headroom to regulatory minima and systemic buffers at the low point of the stress of 3.2 percentage points CET1 (the equivalent of around &pound;60 billion). Most of this headroom arose from banks beginning the test with capital in excess of regulatory minima and buffer requirements.</p>
<p>42: However, the FPC had noted as part of its capital review that there were impediments to banks using their buffers in practice, which could have been contributing to bank&rsquo; incentives to maintain capital in excess of regulatory requirements. The FPC and PRC did not oblige firms to maintain buffers in excess of regulatory requirements. All elements of capital buffers that had been built up by banks existed to be used to support households and businesses during stress. The existence of usable buffers allowed banks to absorb losses without breaching minimum requirements, enabling them to meet the demand for credit from creditworthy households and businesses in the face of severe adverse shocks. As part of the next phase of its capital review (see above) the FPC would explore further steps that could be taken to enhance the usability of buffers.</p>
<p>43: At the individual firm level, all participating banks and building societies remained above their CET1 risk-weighted and Tier 1 leverage minimum regulatory requirements, and no bank was required to strengthen its capital position as a result of the test.</p>
<p>44: The results of the test supported the FPC&rsquo;s judgement that banks&rsquo; current levels of capital were sufficient to support the real economy. They showed that the UK banking system had the capacity to support UK households and businesses, even if economic, financial and business conditions became substantially worse than expected.</p>
<p>45: As in previous stress tests, banks&rsquo; resilience relied in part on their ability in stress to cut dividend payments, employee variable remuneration, and coupon payments on additional Tier 1 instruments, as well as other management actions taken in response to the stress. The FPC judged it important for investors to be aware that banks would take such actions as necessary if such a stress were to materialise.</p>
<p>46: The 2025 Bank Capital Stress Test was the first stress test since the end of transitional arrangements for the IFRS 9 accounting standard, introduced in 2018. In 2018, the FPC had stated that it would seek an enduring treatment for IFRS 9 in the stress test that avoided an unwarranted increase in capital requirements. Reflecting the increased resilience for a given level of capital provided by the earlier recognition of losses under IFRS 9, and following a review of the calibration of the stress tests, the Bank had implemented a number of changes relative to previous stress tests. These changes were designed to be consistent with an unchanged FPC and PRC risk tolerance for the resilience of the UK banking system.</p>
<p>47: In March, the Bank committed to using this year&rsquo;s test to assess the impact of these changes. The FPC judged that the changes had avoided an unwarranted increase in capital requirements and made the test simpler and more aligned with historical advanced economy stresses in terms of the size and timing of the shocks. It intended to maintain these changes for future stress tests and expected to return to assessing resilience against the benchmark of minimum capital requirements and systemic risk buffers.&nbsp; Further details would be set out in Box E of the FSR.</p>
<p>48: Further details of the 2025 Bank Capital Stress Test and the approach to IFRS 9 would be published in the December 2025&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-stability-report/2025/december-2025">FSR</a>.</p>
<p>49: Alongside the results of the Bank Capital Stress Test the FPC also welcomed the results of the Life Insurance Stress Test, published on 17 and 24 November.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-policy-committee-record/2025/december-2025#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;The results of the test indicated that the sector was resilient to a severe financial market stress scenario that incorporated a decline in risk-free interest rates, falls in equity and property prices, along with widening spreads and subsequent defaults and downgrades.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-4">The UK countercyclical capital buffer rate</h3>
<p>50: The FPC discussed its setting of the UK CCyB rate. The Committee&rsquo;s principal aim in setting the UK CCyB rate was to help ensure that the UK banking system was able to absorb severe but plausible shocks without an unwarranted restriction in essential services, such as the supply of credit, to the UK real economy. Setting the UK CCyB rate enabled the FPC to adjust the capital requirements of the UK banking system to the changing scale of risk of losses on banks&rsquo; UK exposures over the course of the financial cycle. The approach therefore included an assessment of financial vulnerabilities and banks&rsquo; capacity to absorb such losses, including the potential impact of shocks.</p>
<p>51: In considering the appropriate setting of the UK CCyB rate, the FPC discussed its judgements around underlying vulnerabilities that could amplify economic shocks. While the global risk environment remained elevated,<span>&nbsp;</span>UK household and corporate aggregate indebtedness remains low. The easing of credit conditions since the FPC's October meeting had been in line with the macroeconomic outlook, with some additional easing in the mortgage market related to policy developments.</p>
<p>52: The FPC observed that UK banks&rsquo; resilience to these risks continued to be supported by strong asset quality and strong capital positions. There was no evidence that banks were restricting lending to protect their capital positions.&nbsp;As noted above, the results of the 2025 Bank Capital Stress Test suggested that the major UK banks could continue to support UK households and businesses even if economic, financial and business conditions became substantially worse than expected.</p>
<p>53. In view of these considerations, the FPC decided to maintain the UK CCyB rate at 2%. Maintaining a neutral setting of the UK CCyB rate in the region of 2% would help to ensure that banks continued to have capacity to absorb unexpected future shocks without an unwarranted restriction in essential services, such as the supply of credit, to the UK real economy. In considering the appropriate setting of the UK CCyB rate the Committee had taken account of its latest assessment of bank capital requirements (see above).</p>
<p>54: The Committee would continue to monitor the evolution of financial conditions closely to ensure the setting of the CCyB remained appropriate.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-5">Private markets</h3>
<p>55: The Committee discussed how the role and size of private markets had grown significantly over the past decade, including in the UK, and continued to evolve. The FPC noted the benefits of growth in private markets for the UK real economy, including via diversifying sources of funding for UK businesses and supporting their growth. While resilient to date, the private market ecosystem had not been tested through a broad-based macroeconomic stress at its current size. As previously set out by the FPC, key vulnerabilities associated with private markets could arise from the widespread use of leverage (both by private market funds and their portfolio companies), opacity in valuations, complexity of structures, the extent of reliance on rating agencies, and the interconnection with other risky credit markets. The rapid growth of private markets, increasing interconnections with banks and insurers, and significant data gaps made it difficult to assess fully the potential for systemic risks.</p>
<p>56: The FPC supported the Bank&rsquo;s plans for a system-wide exploratory scenario (SWES) exercise focused on the private markets ecosystem that would be run in collaboration with a group of banks and non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) active in these markets. The exercise would explore potential risks and dynamics associated with private markets and related risky public credit markets through understanding the actions taken by banks and NBFIs active in private markets in response to a shock, and how these actions might interact at a system level. It would also aim to understand better whether these interactions could amplify stress across the financial system and pose risks to UK financial stability and the provision of finance to the UK real economy.</p>
<p>57: The Committee noted that the exercise was not a test of the resilience of the individual firms that would participate in the exercise. Its focus would be system-wide, exploring the resilience of the provision of private market and related public market finance to the UK corporate sector. Enhancing the transparency of any system-wide dynamics in a stress should help private market participants to better manage the risks they face and allow the Bank, FCA, The Pensions Regulator (TPR) and international authorities to make better-informed judgements about the risks in that ecosystem.</p>
<p>58: The Bank would conduct this exploratory exercise under the guidance of the FPC and the PRC, working closely with, and with the full support of, the PRA, the FCA and TPR.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-6">Operational resilience</h3>
<p>59: The FPC had previously discussed how heightened geopolitical tensions and continued advances in technology had underlined the critical importance of operational resilience to the provision of vital services to households and businesses. This supported the need for firms and financial market infrastructures (FMIs) to&nbsp;continue to&nbsp;build resilience to operational disruption.&nbsp;The FPC met jointly with the PRC, the Financial Markets Infrastructure Committee and the FCA to discuss the UK&rsquo;s approach to enhancing the operational resilience of the UK financial system given the heightened threat landscape, and the increasing pace of technological change. They agreed the importance of continued co-ordination on these issues.</p>
<p>60: The FPC judged that geopolitical and technological developments further increased the likelihood that operational incidents could affect the provision of vital services such as wholesale and retail payments, clearing and settlement, and other activity such as custody services. Not only could disruption to vital service provision affect the ability of financial sector participants,&nbsp;households&nbsp;and businesses to manage risk, transact or access financing, it could also undermine confidence in the financial system, and therefore negatively affect saving, investment, and economic growth.&nbsp;Cyberattacks and severe operational disruption also had the potential to impact firms&rsquo; own revenues and valuations.</p>
<p>61: Therefore, the FPC supported further actions to be taken by firms and FMIs to build resilience to operational disruption, including to emerging&nbsp;risks from AI, quantum computing,&nbsp;and more broadly as the risk environment continued to evolve.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>62: The Committee agreed that the&nbsp;appropriate management&nbsp;of high-impact operational risks by critical firms and FMIs was essential for system-wide operational resilience. Therefore, the FPC welcomed work by&nbsp;microprudential&nbsp;regulators to continue to strengthen the regulatory framework for operational resilience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>63: In taking steps to build resilience, firms and FMIs should recognise the role they play in supporting confidence in the financial system, and how disruption to vital services could negatively affect saving, investment and economic growth. For example, FMIs and the largest firms were required to take account of risks to UK financial stability when identifying their important business services. To support this, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation/letter/2024/thematic-findings-2024-cyber-stress-test" target="_blank">Thematic findings from the 2024 Cyber Stress Test<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external"></span></a>&nbsp;provided tools to&nbsp;facilitate&nbsp;discussion of financial stability between subject matter experts from a range of disciplines, as well as illustrative examples of mitigation actions firms and FMIs could take.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>64: Boards of firms and FMIs should work with authorities to use the findings of sector-wide exercises and stress tests such as SIMEX and the Cyber and Operational Resilience Stress Test to improve their understanding of actions they can take to mitigate impacts on financial stability. Given the interconnected nature of the global financial system, the FPC supported further international engagement on operational resilience.</p>
<p>65. As part of its broader framework on operational resilience, the Committee would also continue to monitor the implementation and outcomes of the critical third parties (CTPs) regime and looked forward to further progress in this area.</p>
<p>66: Further details of the Bank&rsquo;s approach to operational resilience would be set out in the structural changes in the UK financial system chapter of the December 2025&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-stability-report/2025/december-2025">FSR</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-7">Stablecoins</h3>
<p>67: The FPC welcomed the publication of the Bank&rsquo;s recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/paper/2025/cp/proposed-regulatory-regime-for-sterling-denominated-systemic-stablecoins">consultation paper</a>&nbsp;setting out its proposed regulatory regime for sterling-denominated systemic stablecoins. In its 2025 Q2 Record the FPC had noted the financial stability benefits of having a regulatory framework that was proportionate to risks, allowed for some degree of alignment with other jurisdictions and supported firms setting up in the UK.</p>
<p>68: The Committee noted that the proposals were built on feedback received to the November 2023 Discussion Paper and reflected the Bank&rsquo;s role in maintaining public trust in money as innovation in payments accelerated. The FPC supported the outcomes the Bank wanted to achieve in this space: avoiding a disorderly transition to widespread adoption of systemic stablecoins that undermined financial and monetary stability as well as access to credit, while at the same time, promoting innovation in payments and money.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p dir="ltr"><span>JP Jenkins, the UK&rsquo;s largest liquidity venue for unlisted assets, has today announced a groundbreaking partnership with the award-winning investment management firm, Sapphire Capital Partners. By leveraging JP Jenkins&rsquo; recently awarded PISCES operator license, Sapphire Capital&rsquo;s portfolio companies can now opt to access a fully regulated secondary market structure.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Boyd Carson, founder and chairman of Sapphire Capital Partners, commented:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;We have been successfully supporting the financing of growth businesses for many years. We realised that the launch of the new PISCES operator licenses would present us with a unique opportunity, so we have partnered with JP Jenkins to provide new liquidity options and exit opportunities for investors in private companies. We are confident that this partnership presents a winning combination when it comes to providing greater flexibility for our clients.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Under the partnership, JP Jenkins and Sapphire Capital will create a first-of-its-kind private-markets solution in the UK to help high-quality growth companies broaden their investor base, support orderly secondary trading, and offer shareholders more frequent and transparent opportunities to realise value.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Andrew Foster of JP Jenkins, added:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;This partnership with Sapphire Capital underlines the flexibility of the JP Jenkins offering, the relevance of the PISCES operator licenses to today&rsquo;s market need and the power of the technology that sits behind it all. Sapphire&rsquo;s portfolio companies can now benefit from improved liquidity options with equity ownership transfers being processed using a regulated trading model that best suits their own needs and those of investors.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>JP Jenkins was the second operator to be awarded a PISCES license and is the first to announce a wholesale collaboration to address the real-world challenge faced by thousands of investors, including those backing EIS and SEIS companies. The streamlined access to a controlled environment for intermittent trading of shares provides a unique solution for asset valuation, exiting investments and recycling capital.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>To ensure access to the widest possible pool of investors, JP Jenkins has integrated its technology directly with the existing electronic financial ecosystem, enabling any approved broker or institution to connect directly to its order books.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>FNZ, the global wealth management platform, today announced the launch of a landmark global study, <i>The AI-Powered Investment Firm</i>, revealing the scale and speed at which artificial intelligence is transforming the global wealth and asset management industry.</p>
<p>Developed in partnership with leading research firm ThoughtLab, the study draws on insights from over 500 financial institutions representing US$74.2 trillion in assets under management (AuM) across 16 international markets, equivalent to 44% of total AuM held among financial institutions worldwide. This breadth makes it one of the most comprehensive AI analyses in the sector to date.</p>
<p><b>Key highlights</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>AI      now mission-critical:</b> 73% of financial executives say AI      is critical to the future of their business, with 63% agreeing it will      revolutionize the wealth and asset management sector.</li>
<li><b>Vast      majority of firms seeing positive returns on investment:</b> 88%      of executives report positive returns on their AI investments, with almost      one in five (19%) recording large positive returns of over 7%, through      growth, efficiency and risk reduction. Most companies (62%) say they recouped      the value of their investment within two years. </li>
<li><b>Platform      and governance as core differentiators:</b> 87% of AI leaders      have made moderate or significant progress on integrated, cloud-enabled IT      platforms, while 81% have implemented AI governance frameworks and      policies and 62% say clearer risk guidelines will further accelerate      adoption.</li>
<li><b>Advisers      augmented, not replaced:</b> 73% of firms believe AI      will drive a step-change in human productivity, freeing advisers to focus      on relationships, strategy and complex judgment while AI handles routine      and administrative tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>A practical AI playbook, not just another report</b></p>
<p>The study goes beyond high-level commentary to offer an actionable roadmap for firms that want to lead in the next age of AI. It identifies a group of &ldquo;AI leaders&rdquo; already realizing outsized returns from their investments and distils the practices that set them apart.</p>
<p>The analysis highlights four critical strategies for firms looking to excel in the agentic AI era:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li><b>Adopt      AI early to unlock ROI: </b>Early adopters are      already seeing measurable performance benefits. Firms moving decisively on      AI achieve stronger outcomes in revenue growth, operational efficiency and      risk reduction than slower-moving peers. Committing early, investing at      scale and embedding AI into business strategy and culture are central to      success.</li>
<li><b>Build      an AI-ready IT and data foundation: </b>The research      underscores that &ldquo;no platform, no payoff&rdquo;. Without the right      infrastructure, AI initiatives struggle to scale beyond pilots. Among AI      leaders, 87% have made moderate or significant progress in building      integrated, cloud-enabled IT platforms that connect data, strengthen      governance and provide the flexibility needed to automate workflows, power      real-time insights and deliver better outcomes for clients.</li>
<li><b>Embrace      governance to shape the future of AI: </b>Firms recognize      that effective governance is essential to unlocking AI at scale. 62%      believe clearer risk-management guidelines will enable greater use of AI      over the next three years. The study finds that 81% of AI leaders have      already implemented formal AI governance frameworks and policies, turning      compliance into a source of competitive advantage by demonstrating      fairness, reliability and regulatory alignment.</li>
<li><b>Enhance,      not replace, the adviser: </b>The findings confirm that      AI is fundamentally about augmenting, not replacing, human expertise. As      AI capabilities mature, firms expect advisers to spend more time on      high-value client engagement and complex decision-making, while AI      increasingly takes the lead in operational areas such as trade and      transaction execution (40%), client onboarding (36%) and performance      monitoring (35%).</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Extending FNZ&rsquo;s AI leadership journey</b></p>
<p>The global study is the latest milestone in FNZ&rsquo;s broader AI journey and its mission to open up wealth through technology.</p>
<p>The study complements FNZ&rsquo;s strategic partnership with Microsoft and the launch of FNZ Advisor AI, a next-generation artificial intelligence solution that enables advisers to work more efficiently, engage clients more effectively and rapidly scale the delivery of personalized advice.</p>
<p>By combining its end-to-end platform with Microsoft&rsquo;s cloud and AI capabilities, and deploying solutions such as FNZ Advisor AI, FNZ is helping financial institutions move from experimentation to industrial-scale AI adoption across the entire value chain.</p>
<p><b>Roman Regelman, Group President at FNZ,</b> said: &ldquo;AI is no longer a side project for the wealth and asset management industry, it is rapidly redefining the economics of advice. What this study shows, with real data, is just how far the leaders have already moved. They are building modern platforms, industrializing data and governance, and using AI to free advisers to do what only humans can do: understand goals, build trust and provide holistic guidance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At FNZ, we see this as a once-in-a-generation opportunity to open up wealth. Our partnership with Microsoft and the launch of FNZ Advisor AI are about turning this roadmap into reality for our clients, helping them move from experimentation to scaled, responsible deployment of AI across the entire value chain. The firms that act now will set the standard for the next decade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This year&rsquo;s edition shows progress in electrolysers build-out and in advancing the EU&rsquo;s regulatory framework. Yet, renewable hydrogen costs in 2024 remained four times higher than those of conventional hydrogen. This cost gap, together with incomplete national transposition of EU rules, is hindering market development. To overcome this, lower regulatory risks and more targeted funding are needed.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the key findings?</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Market growth remains insufficient to meet EU and national targets.</strong>&nbsp;Despite a 51% increase in electrolyser capacity to 308 MW in 2024, deployment remains way behind the 6 GW target for 2024 and 40 GW for 2030.</li>
<li><strong>Renewable hydrogen remains costly</strong>&nbsp;(four times higher than hydrogen from fossil fuels), with uncertain near&nbsp;to mid term cost reduction prospects.</li>
<li><strong>Delays in transposing EU rules at national level persist.&nbsp;</strong>Only 2 Member States have transposed the amended&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsDV1NQB1JVVEwOBQICHVZdAgMdUApTBBoGV1EEAlAFAQMAAwgdBFxXUwhVBlodBlwGUh0GAQNXGg1UVVMZAABTUggHVFFUU1BWRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Renewable Energy Directive</a>.</li>
<li><strong>A decarbonised electricity sector is key to renewable hydrogen.</strong>&nbsp;Electricity supply costs (excluding grid tariffs) may account for up to 50% of renewable hydrogen&rsquo;s production costs.</li>
<li><strong>Rising electricity network tariffs may add pressure on costs.</strong>&nbsp;ACER&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsPCVIEBAJRVUwNA1YBHVYJDQYdCgFUAhoBUVUHUQNRUwcIBwIdBFxXUwhVBlodBlwGUh0GAQNXGg1UVVMZAABTUggHVFFUU1BWRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2024 Monitoring Report on electricity infrastructure development</a>&nbsp;shows that electricity network costs could rise by 50-100% by 2050, also depending on how investments will align with evolving electricity grid demand. As electricity tariffs represent a significant share of renewable hydrogen&rsquo;s production costs, this trend poses a substantial risk.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Network development should align with</strong><strong>&nbsp;evolving demand to reduce forecasted risks.</strong>&nbsp;Hydrogen networks are key to expanding the market, but infrastructure should be built gradually to match actual demand development.</li>
<li><strong>Low-carbon hydrogen could support market development</strong>, yet cost and technical uncertainties should be carefully assessed.</li>
<li><strong>The European Commission has already allocated over &euro;20 billion to hydrogen</strong>&nbsp;through various programmes, and Member States have announced numerous additional support schemes. Accelerating the allocation of funding to advanced projects is key to increasing scale-up.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are ACER&rsquo;s recommendations?</span></p>

<li>Prioritise and target funding towards projects in hard-to-abate sectors that are ready to transition to renewable and low-carbon hydrogen.</li>
<li>Facilitate renewable hydrogen production through faster permitting and grid connection for both electrolysers and renewable electricity projects.</li>
<li>Speed up decarbonisation of the power sector to lower electricity costs and enhance electrolyser utilisation.</li>
<li>Enable flexibility in the electricity market, rethink electricity grid tariffs and grid incentives, as they can optimise electrolyser location and performance.</li>

<p>Framery enables people to focus on what truly matters and to get things done. With its soundproof smart pods and smart office solution, Framery turns ordinary offices into places people love.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>CLS, a financial market infrastructure group delivering settlement, processing and data solutions across the global FX ecosystem, announced today that Standard Chartered, a leading international cross-border bank, has gone live on CLSNet, its automated bilateral payment netting calculation service for over 120 currencies.</p>
<p>CLSNet standardizes and automates post-trade matching and netting processes, delivering risk mitigation, liquidity optimization and operational efficiencies for currency flows outside of CLSSettlement, including emerging market and developing economy (EMDE) currencies and same-day trades.</p>
<p>Adoption of CLSNet has continued to grow significantly, with the service recording an average daily netted value<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;of USD169 billion in the first half of 2025, up 18% compared to the same period in 2024. The CLSNet community now includes the top 12 global banks, alongside a growing roster of regional banks, funds, corporates and non-bank financial institutions.</p>
<p>As settlement risk in the FX market remains a focus, particularly in EMDE currencies and other growing segments, market participants are looking for ways to mitigate risk effectively via automated post-trade services such as CLSNet. The service reduces payments exposed to settlement risk by centralizing, standardizing and automating the netting calculation process. Demand for CLSNet continues to grow, particularly among financial institutions seeking to align with the best practices outlined in Principle 35 of the FX Global Code.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Alongside Standard Chartered, several Asian banks are joining the service. CTBC, the Hong Kong branch of a Taiwanese commercial bank, has gone live on CLSNet, meanwhile Maybank, a Malaysian bank, and Taishin, one of the largest commercial banks in Taiwan, have also committed to joining the CLSNet network to mitigate settlement risk within Asian currencies, particularly USD/CNH.</p>
<p><b>Lisa Dani</b><b>no-Lewis, Chief Growth Officer, CLS commented:</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;We are delighted to welcome Standard Chartered, CTBC, Maybank and Taishin to the CLSNet community. We are seeing increased demand for proven solutions to address the challenges facing the FX market. As more participants join CLSNet, the resulting network effect will deliver even greater risk reduction and efficiency benefits for all users.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Tony Hall, Global Head, Markets Trading and XVA, Standard Chartered commented:</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;Standard Chartered is proud to join CLSNet, reaffirming our commitment to strong risk management, liquidity efficiency and operational excellence in FX. This step aligns with our role as a signatory to the Global FX Code and our ambition to be the leading Emerging Markets FX house. By leveraging CLSNet capabilities, we&rsquo;ll deliver safer, faster and more efficient post-trade processing&mdash;freeing up intraday liquidity and reducing settlement risk for our clients. Another stride towards world-class infrastructure, smarter execution, and market leadership.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;<span>Netted value refers to bilateral net payment amounts calculated by CLSNet.</span></li>
<li>Principle 35 states,&nbsp;<i style="font-family: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">inter alia</i><span>:</span>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;<span>Where practicable, Market Participants should eliminate Settlement Risk, for example by using settlement services that provide PvP settlement.</span></li>
<li>Where Settlement Risk cannot be eliminated, Market Participants should reduce the size and duration of their Settlement Risk as much as practicable. The netting of FX settlement obligations (in&nbsp;particular the use of automated netting systems) is encouraged.</li>

<title>Minimising The Risk Of Investor Harm Is A Shared Responsibility - Keynote Address By ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland At The Professional Planner Researcher Forum In The Blue Mountains On 2 December 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul>
<li>Australian investors rely on the expertise and integrity of everyone in the investment chain to secure their financial future.</li>
<li>ASIC&rsquo;s primary concern is minimising the risk of harm for Australian investors and consumers.</li>
<li>To ensure better outcomes for investors, ASIC has prioritised tackling poor practices in private credit and holding those responsible for Shield and First Guardian to account.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good afternoon.</p>
<p>I'd like to acknowledge the Traditional Owners of the land on which we meet today, the Dharug and Gundungurra people and pay my respects to Elders past and present.</p>
<p>I extend that respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people here today.</p>
<p>Thank you to Conexus for the invitation to speak today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great to be back at the Researcher Forum and to have the opportunity to update you on ASIC&rsquo;s priorities.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I spoke to a room of financial literacy educators about the importance of equipping Australians with the knowledge they need to confidently navigate the financial system.</p>
<p>I made the point that when it comes to financial decisions, people can sometimes be vulnerable to exploitation, because for many of the decisions they make, they have less financial knowledge or experience than the person or firm on the other side of the transaction.</p>
<p>And when it comes to investment decisions, that knowledge imbalance is even greater, with bigger consequences if something goes wrong.</p>
<p>Even the most sophisticated investors are reliant on the expertise &ndash; and the integrity - of others when making major investment decisions.</p>
<p>Financial advisers, fund managers, research houses &ndash; all of you here today &ndash; all play a role, either directly or indirectly, in influencing how investors choose to invest their money.</p>
<p>And so, it&rsquo;s important, as the theme of today&rsquo;s forum suggests, that we have &lsquo;<strong>world-class</strong>&nbsp;investment governance and research&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what Australian investors want and deserve, and it&rsquo;s what ASIC expects.</p>
<p>In pursuing this expectation, our primary concern is to minimise the risk of harm to consumers and investors.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see this reflected across our regulatory and enforcement priorities.</p>
<p>There are two enforcement priorities I want to talk about today, both of which relate directly to the work many of you do.</p>
<p>The first is holding those responsible for the Shield and First Guardian collapses to account.</p>
<p>And the second &ndash; to crack down on poor practice in private credit.</p>
<h2>Pursuing accountability for Shield and First Guardian</h2>
<p>Let me start with Shield and First Guardian &ndash; partly because those matters combined represent one of our biggest priorities at the moment &ndash; and partly because they have implications for everybody working in the advice and investment ecosystem.</p>
<p>If you wonder why this is relevant to you, the numbers should make it clear.</p>
<p>With more than 11,000 investors impacted and close to $1 billion of retirement savings put at risk, this is the most egregious example of consumer harm that I have seen in my time at ASIC.</p>
<p>And the people affected are Australians who were trying to do the right thing to boost their retirement savings and were instead lured into switching their super into high-risk investments.</p>
<p>These weren&rsquo;t people rolling the dice in some get-rich-quick gamble. These were people making considered decisions which they believed to be in their financial interests.</p>
<p>People like Gary, in his early 60s and looking forward to retirement<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/minimising-the-risk-of-investor-harm-is-a-shared-responsibility/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Gary was aware that his existing super fund wasn&rsquo;t performing as well as it had been.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He was contacted by a comparison site, which put him on to financial advisers who set him up with a self-managed super fund and invested all his funds into First Guardian.</p>
<p>He stands to lose almost $700,000.</p>
<p>Or Juan<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/minimising-the-risk-of-investor-harm-is-a-shared-responsibility/#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>, a 41-year old at risk of losing his entire super, after being convinced to roll all his savings into First Guardian.</p>
<p>These are shocking stories, and there are&nbsp;<strong>thousands</strong>&nbsp;like them.</p>
<p>Each of them involving financial losses with a very human cost.</p>
<p>And there is a long chain of participants involved.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lead generators, including data brokers and telemarketers</li>
<li>Financial advisers, and financial advice firms</li>
<li>Superannuation trustees, like Macquarie, Equity Trustees, Diversa and Netwealth</li>
<li>Research houses</li>
<li>Auditors</li>
<li>And of course, the fund operators themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p>We believe all hold some degree of culpability.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s first priority in both the Shield and First Guardian matters has been to preserve assets so that they can be recovered for investors while our investigations are continuing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve:</p>
<ul>
<li>issued stop orders to prevent ongoing harm</li>
<li>obtained asset-freezing orders</li>
<li>sought the appointment of receivers and liquidators</li>
<li>obtained travel restraints</li>
<li>cancelled financial services licenses; and</li>
<li>banned financial advisers.</li>
</ul>
<p>We&rsquo;ve instituted proceedings against&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-215mr-macquarie-admits-to-shield-contraventions-and-commits-to-pay-affected-members/" title="25-215MR Macquarie admits to Shield contraventions and commits to pay affected members">Macquarie</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-176mr-asic-sues-equity-trustees-alleging-due-diligence-failures-relating-to-shield/" title="25-176MR ASIC sues Equity Trustees alleging due diligence failures relating to Shield">Equity Trustees</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-274mr-asic-sues-interprac-over-alleged-shield-and-first-guardian-licensee-failures/" title="25-274MR ASIC sues Interprac over alleged Shield and First Guardian licensee failures">Interprac&nbsp;</a><a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-274mr-asic-sues-interprac-over-alleged-shield-and-first-guardian-licensee-failures/">Financial Planning</a><a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-274mr-asic-sues-interprac-over-alleged-shield-and-first-guardian-licensee-failures/" title="25-274MR ASIC sues Interprac over alleged Shield and First Guardian licensee failures"></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-275mr-asic-sues-sqm-research-alleging-misleading-reports-related-to-shield/" title="25-275MR ASIC sues SQM Research alleging misleading reports related to Shield">SQM Research</a>.</p>
<p>In a significant win for some investors,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-215mr-macquarie-admits-to-shield-contraventions-and-commits-to-pay-affected-members/" title="25-215MR Macquarie admits to Shield contraventions and commits to pay affected members">Macquarie has committed to repaying investors</a>&nbsp;100% of the net cash they invested in Shield through Macquarie&rsquo;s wrap platform.</p>
<p>Importantly for those in the room today, our action against SQM Research is the first we have taken against a research house.</p>
<p>It is our view that SQM Research prepared reports containing misleading representations and its processes fell short of expected standards when it published &ldquo;Favourable&rdquo; ratings for Shield.</p>
<p>More generally, it is our view that research houses should serve as gatekeepers against poor quality investments or unsuitable products.</p>
<p>They need to do all things necessary to ensure that they go about their work efficiently, honestly and fairly. And they need to avoid issuing ratings or commentary that can&rsquo;t be justified by evidence.</p>
<p>In addition to the proceedings I have already mentioned, we are also seeking leave to commence proceedings against&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-276mr-asic-takes-action-against-mwl-financial-services-former-director-nicholas-maikousis-and-imperial-capital-group-australia-over-alleged-shield-advice-failures/" title="25-276MR ASIC takes action against MWL Financial Services, former director Nicholas Maikousis, and Imperial Capital Group Australia over alleged Shield advice failures">MWL Financial Services</a>, a former MWL director and Imperial Capital Group &ndash; a lead generator &ndash; for allegedly operating a scheme resulting in hundreds of clients investing superannuation into Shield.</p>
<p>At this point in time, we have 10 separate Federal Court proceedings against 18 defendants, and there is more to come.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, holding those responsible for the collapse of the Shield and First Guardian Master Funds to account is one of our enforcement priorities - and our investigations are ongoing.</p>
<p>While this has some time to play out, there are lessons to be learned now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I mentioned at the outset, Australian investors are reliant on the chain of financial experts behind their investments - financial advisers, research houses, investment platforms, superannuation trustees, advice licensees.</p>
<p>When every part of that chain fulfils its role &ndash; with its multiple layers of knowledge, expertise, duties and obligations &ndash; the system works as it should.</p>
<p>Investors can be confident that they will be offered products that are safe, and appropriate for them and their financial goals.</p>
<p>But when there are failures in that chain &ndash; far too often it is investors who pay the price.</p>
<p>The failures involved in Shield and First Guardian have highlighted some potential regulatory gaps.</p>
<p>These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the regulation of lead generators, whose activities may not be adequately captured by the anti-hawking provisions</li>
<li>the super switching process</li>
<li>the obligations of super trustees who provide platform products; and</li>
<li>the regulation of managed investment schemes, which ASIC has previously identified as a priority for reform.</li>
</ul>
<p>We welcome the Government&rsquo;s commitment to exploring sensible reforms that can better protect consumers in the future, and we are committed to working with the Government to identify what would be most effective, based on what we have uncovered through our investigations.</p>
<h2>Improving practices in private credit</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;d now like to turn to private credit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>ASIC recognises that private credit &ndash; done well &ndash; plays an important role in Australia&rsquo;s financial system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an important source of funding for sectors that are under-served by the traditional banking sector, and it provides diversification and choice for borrowers and investors alike.</p>
<p>According to one estimate, private credit in Australia is now valued at more than $200 billion<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/minimising-the-risk-of-investor-harm-is-a-shared-responsibility/#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>While this amount is not systemically important, the same source estimates that private credit has grown&nbsp;<strong>500 per cent</strong><a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/minimising-the-risk-of-investor-harm-is-a-shared-responsibility/#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><span>[4]</span></a>&nbsp;over the past 10 years. And with increasing investment in private credit via superannuation, that growth seems likely to continue.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important that we are alert to the potential risks.</p>
<p>Here in Australia, we have a higher concentration of private credit lending to the property sector, including loans to higher risk development and construction.</p>
<p>Over time, this could amplify the system-wide vulnerability related to residential property identified by APRA in last month&rsquo;s system-wide stress test.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private credit at current volumes is untested in a stress scenario and we are already seeing a wide variance in practices across the sector.</p>
<p>A lack of transparency across the sector is a particular concern.</p>
<p>Australia lags behind our international peers in terms of the data that we as a regulator have access to.</p>
<p>We have neither the breadth, depth, or frequency of data needed to monitor and supervise retail and wholesale funds confidently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Countries like Singapore, Canada, and the UK with similar regulatory frameworks have greater access to more reliable and recurrent data on private markets.</p>
<p>Given that our domestic private credit growth outstrips that seen in many of these countries, we would like to see this data gap addressed to enable ASIC to more confidently supervise funds.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, we undertook a surveillance of 28 retail and wholesale private credit funds to assess how fund managers are managing the risks that underpin investor confidence and market operation.</p>
<p>We released the findings of that surveillance a few weeks ago in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-820-private-credit-surveillance-report-retail-and-wholesale-surveillance/" title="REP 820 Private credit surveillance report: Retail and wholesale surveillance">Report 820</a>.</p>
<p>We observed some better practices, but we also identified areas that fell short of expectations, including practices that are potentially in breach of the law.</p>
<p>Areas for improvement include governance and transparency; fees and interest rates; valuation methodologies; liquidity; and credit management.</p>
<p>Today, I&rsquo;ll focus on three areas that will be relevant to many in the room because they are key to how researchers understand and evaluate private credit funds:</p>
<ul>
<li>The use of terminology</li>
<li>Fee and interest disclosure; and</li>
<li>Valuations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Terminology</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start with the use of terminology.</p>
<p>In our review, we found market-wide inconsistencies in terminology that make it difficult for investors to compare the nature and risks of private credit funds.</p>
<p>Fund operators and investment managers defined and applied terms such as &lsquo;default&rsquo; and &lsquo;investment grade&rsquo; differently.</p>
<p>Such inconsistent use of terms makes it difficult for investors to meaningfully compare loan default or arrears levels across funds.</p>
<p>There were also variabilities in how funds described their underlying assets.</p>
<p>Some funds primarily categorised their assets using terms that describe the&nbsp;<strong>ranking&nbsp;</strong>or&nbsp;<strong>seniority</strong>&nbsp;of the security &ndash; for example &lsquo;first mortgage&rsquo; and &lsquo;mezzanine&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Other funds categorised their&nbsp;<strong>assets</strong>&nbsp;with reference to direct lending, securitised loans or the use of funding &ndash; for example &lsquo;commercial real estate development&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Concerningly, we found that asset descriptions sometimes failed to include clear information that would help investors understand the risks of the assets held by a fund.</p>
<p>For example, a failure to disclose that loans will fund higher-risk real estate construction and development. Or that the fund primarily invests in unsecured loans.</p>
<p>Again, this inconsistency makes it difficult for investors and advisers to accurately compare funds and make informed choices about what products they are investing in and the risks associated with them.</p>
<p>The adoption of consistent industry terminology &ndash; or at least a clear explanation of key terms &ndash; would be an important step towards greater transparency for investors.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Fee and interest disclosure</h2>
<p>Transparency was also an issue when it came to fee and interest disclosure.</p>
<p>Of the 28 funds we reviewed,&nbsp;<strong>only four</strong>&nbsp;published information about the interest rates or range of interest rates charged to borrowers.</p>
<p>If these rates are accurately disclosed, investors are better able to judge the riskiness of the investment.</p>
<p>Conversely, where borrowers pay fees on top of interest that are not disclosed, this masks a clear signal about the level of risk involved in the lending.</p>
<p><strong>Only two</strong>&nbsp;retail funds quantified the interest earned from their assets and borrower fees and disclosed the retained amounts as part of their wider management fee in the product disclosure statement.</p>
<p><strong>Only one</strong>&nbsp;<strong>wholesale fund</strong>&nbsp;passed on to investors the full economic benefits of interest earned from its assets and income earned from borrower fees.</p>
<p>To enable investors to better assess the true cost of investing in a fund, fund managers and trustees should disclose&nbsp;<strong>ALL</strong>&nbsp;revenue they earn in connection with their funds.</p>
<p>Clear and accurate disclosure enables investors to understand what they are paying for, directly and indirectly, and to better judge whether they are being appropriately compensated for the associated risk.</p>
<h2>Valuations</h2>
<p>The final area that I wanted to touch on is valuations.</p>
<p>Investors rely on fair valuations to assess performance and make informed investment decisions.</p>
<p>Private assets in particular are subject to heightened valuation risks, due to infrequent trading and limited price discovery.</p>
<p>Many of the private credit funds we reviewed were open-ended funds, with regular monthly or quarterly redemption periods.</p>
<p>For open-ended funds in times of stress, failure to adjust valuations in a timely manner could allow some fund members to exit at a higher price, at the expense of the remaining investors.</p>
<p>Some of the poorer valuation practices we observed involved infrequent valuations, incomplete or absent valuation policies, insufficient independence and inconsistent approaches to valuing collateral.</p>
<p>Where valuations are not accurate, reliable, timely or comparable, this raises serious questions about the ability of investors &ndash; and indeed researchers &ndash; to assess the performance of a fund.</p>
<p>To guide fund managers in uplifting their practices, our report outlines ten guiding principles for private credit &lsquo;done well&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The principles provide guidance on the three areas that I&rsquo;ve mentioned - terminology, fee disclosure and valuations - as well as other areas like design and distribution, organisational capability, liquidity and governance.</p>
<p>Each of these principles is grounded in the law. And we will be monitoring how well private credit funds adhere to them.</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier that poor private credit practices are an enforcement priority for ASIC in 2026.</p>
<p>We have already issued stop orders on several target market determinations and one PDS due to poor disclosure and distribution.</p>
<p>And in instances of more egregious conduct, we have commenced enforcement investigations.</p>
<p>We have also announced the&nbsp;<strong>second phase of our private credit surveillance</strong>.</p>
<p>On the&nbsp;<strong>retail</strong>&nbsp;side, this surveillance will look at disclosures of fees and margins, and the distribution practices of private credit funds to retail investors, with a specific focus on the adviser channel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to understand how retail private credit funds are distributed and, when distributed through advisers, test the quality of their advice.</p>
<p>On the&nbsp;<strong>wholesale</strong>&nbsp;side, there are plans to look at fees, margin structures and conflicts of interest in the management of wholesale private credit funds, with a particular focus on real estate lending.</p>
<p>Through this ongoing program of work, which will hopefully be complemented by industry efforts to lift standards, we hope that private credit will increasingly be done well in Australia, with benefits to individual investors and the broader economy.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I mentioned at the start that ASIC is focussed on minimising harm to consumers and investors. That&rsquo;s a responsibility we all share.</p>
<p>Whatever role you play in the investment ecosystem, you can help to ensure that consumers who engage in investing, within or outside superannuation, are presented with products that are safe, appropriate, and aligned with their best interests.</p>
<p>When that occurs, it not only means better outcomes for individuals, it is also fundamental to building and maintaining trust in the system.</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today. I&rsquo;m now happy to take some questions.</p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority Cancels HGL’s Financial Advice Provider Licence</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-cancels-hgls-financial-advice-provider-2025122/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) - Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; has cancelled the Financial Advice Provider licence of Christchurch-based Hope Group Limited (HGL).</p>
<p>HGL has held a full financial advice provider licence and provided personal risk insurance advice (life and health insurance, income protection insurance, trauma and disability insurance) to retail clients.   &nbsp;</p>
<p>Louise Unger, FMA Executive Director, Response and Enforcement, said HGL&rsquo;s cancellation followed the termination of its distribution agreement with the impacted insurer, and the FMA&rsquo;s subsequent inquiry into its affairs.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the notification from the impacted insurer, the FMA reviewed 14 insurance policy applications submitted by HGL&rsquo;s sole director and financial adviser, Mr Junpu Wang, on behalf of 13 customers. The inquiries identified serious conduct issues resulting in material breaches of obligations. Specifically, the conduct included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Submitting second policy applications for existing clients using incorrect or false customer information to conceal that the policies were duplicates&nbsp;</li>
<li>Completing an authority to accept a direct debit form on behalf of a client without obtaining the client&rsquo;s authentic signature&nbsp;</li>
<li>Failing to obtain client consent for both first and second policies (with the same or similar cover) to remain active during a significant period, causing clients to pay two premiums. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Misleading clients by recommending second policies to benefit from lower premiums under a promotional offer, despite clients being ineligible (e.g., already existing policyholders) </li>
<li>Failing to ensure clients understood the advice provided. In some cases, clients were incorrectly advised that a new policy was needed because their existing policy would become more expensive after 24 months; in two cases, clients were told to take out a new policy to obtain a second luxury item &ndash; despite being ineligible for that benefit.  &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Mr Wang deliberately misled impacted clients to take out second policies after the 24-month clawback period for the sole purpose to obtain commission payments from the insurer,&rdquo; said Ms Unger.</p>
<p>In doing so, HGL and Mr Wang obtained $37,374 in upfront commissions. In addition, clients paid two premiums for the same or similar cover while both policies remained active for up to 27 weeks, resulting in overpayments totalling $5,342.34.</p>
<p>&ldquo;HGL and Mr Wang&rsquo;s actions represent a serious and deliberate departure from the standards expected of a licensed financial advice provider.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr Wang has not accepted his conduct, all allegations have been denied and attempts made to blame another financial adviser who was never engaged by HGL at the time the applications were submitted,&rdquo; said Ms Unger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cancellation of HGL&rsquo;s licence is critical to ensuring we protect consumers and the integrity of the market. A key function of the FMA is to ensure the quality of financial advice and financial advice services &ndash; which is clearly missing here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A public notification helps the FMA to raise awareness about standards we expect, deter future contraventions by other market participants, and publicly express disapproval for contraventions under the FMC Act and the relevant regulations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The insurer has contacted all impacted clients and made arrangements to ensure they are supported. In addition, HGL and Mr. Wang have been deregistered from the Financial Service Providers Register (FSPR), and the matter had been reported to the Police.</p>

<title>ASIC Issues Updated Guidance For Industry Codes Of Conduct</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-issues-updated-guidance-for-industry-codes-of-conduct-2025122/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-issues-updated-guidance-for-industry-codes-of-conduct-2025122/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC has released updated regulatory guidance on industry codes of conduct in the financial services and credit sectors.<br /><br />The updates to Regulatory Guide 183&nbsp;<em>Codes of conduct for the financial services and credit sectors</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/regulatory-guides/rg-183-codes-of-conduct-for-the-financial-services-and-credit-sectors/" title="RG 183 Approval of financial services sector codes of conduct">RG 183</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>reflect legislative reform since the guidance was last updated in 2013,</li>
<li>clarify ASIC&rsquo;s role in relation to industry codes, and the criteria and process for code approval, and</li>
<li>simplify and streamline the guidance.</li>
</ul>
<p>These updates follow consultation with stakeholders through Consultation Statement 26&nbsp;<em>Proposed update to RG 183</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/consultations/cs-26-proposed-update-to-rg-183/" title="CS 26 Proposed update to RG 183">CS 26</a>). Stakeholders were broadly supportive of the proposed updates.<br /><br />A copy of the non-confidential submissions made to ASIC and an outline of our response is available below.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>It is not mandatory for any industry in the financial services or credit sectors to develop a code. Where a code exists, it does not require ASIC&rsquo;s approval. However, seeking and obtaining ASIC&rsquo;s approval is a signal that the code is one that consumers can have confidence in and rely on.</p>
<p>RG 183 provides guidance on ASIC&rsquo;s role in relation to codes, the criteria for code approval by ASIC, and the process for obtaining (and retaining) ASIC&rsquo;s approval for a code.</p>

<title>Universiti Utara Malaysia (UUM) Takes Top Three Spots At Bursa Inter-Varsity Stock Challenge 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Universiti Utara Malaysia (&ldquo;UUM&rdquo;) made a clean sweep of the top three spots at the recent Bursa Inter-Varsity Stock Challenge (&ldquo;BISC&rdquo;) 2025 Grand Finale.</p>
<p>After a tightly contested final round, Chong Jia Hong emerged as Champion while Ponny Ling Hsing Yu and Bryan Lim Wei Chin were named first and second runners-up, respectively.</p>
<p>The nationwide challenge, which ran from August to November 2025, attracted 850 teams and nearly 1,300 students from 10 universities<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;in an immersive stock trading competition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organised by Bursa Malaysia since 2022, the annual BISC aims to cultivate informed, confident and responsible future investors. By simulating real-world investing in a riskfree environment, participants gain early hands-on experience whilst sharpening their analytical skills.</p>
<p>Dato&rsquo; Fad&rsquo;l Mohamed, Chief Executive Officer of Bursa Malaysia, said: &ldquo;This year&rsquo;s strong participation reflects not only rising interest in the stock market among the youth, but also their determination to challenge themselves, master financial knowledge and apply investing concepts. Such enthusiasm reinforces the importance of BISC as part of Bursa Malaysia&rsquo;s ongoing efforts to educate and empower the next generation of informed investors in an engaging yet structured approach.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Three-phase Competition Structure and Mentorship</h4>
<p>To maximise learning outcomes, BISC 2025 featured three phases, with each phase building on the previous to simulate the full cycle of investing.</p>
<ol>
<li>evaluated based on analytical depth, originality, and accuracy, covering areas such as catalysts, sensitivity analysis, financial performance and valuation. </li>
<li>Phase 2 &ndash; Virtual Portfolio: Equipped with a virtual initial capital of RM100,000 per team, participants traded eligible listed securities in a simulated environment on MyBURSA, complete with transaction-related fees and stamp duty, to replicate real trading.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Phase 3 &ndash; Grand Finale: The top 20 teams presented their portfolio strategies and results to a panel of industry judges. This phase tested the participants&rsquo; real understanding, presentation skills and poise under pressure as they defended their investment decisions to seasoned market professionals.</li>
</ol>
<p>Throughout the three-month challenge period, participants received continuous guidance and mentorship from participating brokerage firms &mdash; Affin Hwang Investment Bank, AmInvestment Bank, CGS International Securities Malaysia, Maybank Investment Bank and RHB Investment Bank &mdash; who provided expert advice, professional resources and practical insights to deepen their understanding of market dynamics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Participating in BISC 2025 was a meaningful experience for me. The competition offered a chance to put a trading strategy to the test under conditions that felt close to the real market. Along the way, it became clear where the approach worked and where it needed refining, all without taking on any actual risk. The exposure and hands-on learning have been invaluable in building confidence to continue growing as an investor,&rdquo; said Chong Jia Hong from Universiti Utara Malaysia (UUM), the Champion of BISC Grand Finale 2025.</p>
<p>As part of Bursa Malaysia's commitment to promoting inclusive capital market and investor empowerment, initiatives such as BISC play an essential role in expanding the nation's retail investor base and nurturing a more knowledgeable and financially savvy investment community. Encouraged by the success of BISC 2025, Bursa Malaysia will continue positioning this annual competition as a cornerstone initiative for strengthening financial literacy among youth.&nbsp; The Exchange invites interested universities and students to participate in the next edition of BISC 2026.

<title>Opening Remarks, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell, At The George P. Shultz Memorial Lecture Series: Shultz And Economic Policy, Hoover Institution, Stanford University, Stanford, California</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/opening-remarks-federal-reserve-chair-jerome-h-powell-at-the-george-p-shultz-2025122/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I am deeply honored to have been asked to speak here today about the remarkable legacy of George Shultz. Just to be clear, I will not address current economic conditions or monetary policy.</p>
<p>I have been an admirer of George Shultz since my college years. I saw him then and now as a great role model, as I mentioned a few months ago when delivering the Baccalaureate address to Princeton's class of 2025, 50 years after my own graduation.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20251201a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>As I told the graduates, when I faced the world after college, I had no real plan, but knew that I wanted to combine a private-sector career with public service. I had in mind a few well-known public figures of the era, especially George Shultz, whose picture was on the wall of the Princeton eating club of which both of us were members. George may also have caught my attention because my dad was a labor lawyer who represented one of the major steel companies in collective bargaining. Like George, my father had both a belief in the collective bargaining process and a deep respect for workers.</p>
<p>I followed George's career with interest through the years. It didn't occur to me that I would ever have the honor of meeting him. But I did meet him after I joined the Fed in 2012, as I visited Stanford from time to time. I remember energetic economic discussions at group lunches in his conference room at Hoover. George was also kind enough to host John Taylor, Michael, and me for a chilly round of golf on a rainy March day.</p>
<p>Today, our focus is on George's extraordinarily broad economic accomplishments. I also want to celebrate the remarkable man and policymaker that he was. Several things stand out for me.</p>
<p>He was a man who combined strong principles and unshakeable integrity with common sense and a practical, problem-solving approach to policy. He had a deep belief in the wisdom of markets and a desire to let them work whenever possible without government direction. That theme runs through many issues we will discuss, including collective bargaining, wage and price controls, and exchange rates.</p>
<p>But he was not an absolutist and saw that there are sometimes market failures that should be addressed by public policy. As one of the most successful policymakers of his era, George brought the intellectual rigor of an academic to the practical, constrained, messy work of policymaking. Through four cabinet appointments, he dealt with many of the great issues of his day, with remarkable success. And he kept at it long after leaving public office, making important contributions on health care reform, climate change and nuclear disarmament.</p>
<p>He may be less well known for this, but George Shultz was deeply concerned about racial discrimination in the workplace and our society more broadly. He consistently and effectively used his positions of authority to increase opportunities for minorities. He later noted that there was both a moral and an economic basis for this.</p>
<p>He stuck to his principles while also treating people with honesty and respect, including those with whom he had policy disagreements.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20251201a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;Labor leaders welcomed his appointment as Secretary of Labor. As many of his contemporaries remarked, faced with divergent views and difficult issues, he was extraordinarily good at steering people toward agreement. A key part of that strategy was to let the parties reach the final agreement themselves. That way, they owned the agreement and were more likely to honor it. His friendships and collaborations were beyond number, and knew no partisan bounds.</p>
<p>He often said that trust is the coin of the realm, and that good things were only possible where there was mutual trust.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20251201a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;His integrity provided the basis for that trust. All of those who aspire to serve the public can learn from his example.</p>
<hr align="left" size="1" width="33%" />
<p><a name="fn1"></a>1. See Jerome H. Powell (2025),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/powell20250525a.pdf">"Baccalaureate Remarks," (PDF)</a>&nbsp;speech delivered at Princeton University, Princeton, N.J., May 25.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn2"></a>2. See Charles Moritz, ed. (1970),&nbsp;<em>Current Biography Yearbook 1969</em>&nbsp;(New York: The H.W. Wilson Company). Shultz's background as a mediator served him well in economic policymaking, and Paul Volcker would later say of Shultz, "Time and again he would work with almost inhuman patience to bring a group to agreement upon a decision all could support, at times submerging his own preferences"; see Philip Taubman (2023),&nbsp;<em>In the Nation's Service: The Life and Times of George P. Shultz</em>&nbsp;(Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press), p. 23.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn3"></a>3. Shultz summed up his views in this area in the mottoes "Trust is the coin of the realm" and "Respect your adversaries"; see George P. Shultz (2016),&nbsp;<em>Learning from Experience</em>&nbsp;(Stanford, Calif.: Hoover Institution Press).&nbsp;</p>
