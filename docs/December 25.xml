<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>Commodity Futures Trading Commission Acting Chairman Caroline D. Pham today announced the Commission has approved a proposed order to grant a limited exemption necessary for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (CME) and the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) to make their existing cross-margining arrangement available to certain customers with appropriate safeguards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The CFTC is committed to working with the SEC to implement Treasury market reforms,&rdquo; Acting Chairman Pham said. &ldquo;Expanding cross-margining to customers will provide capital efficiencies that can increase liquidity and resiliency in U.S. Treasuries, the most important market in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This proposed order implements a CFTC Global Markets Advisory Committee recommendation on Treasury market reform and the Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s U.S. Treasury clearing mandate [see CFTC press release No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8860-24">8860-24</a>]. Currently, only clearing members may cross-margin futures positions in U.S. Treasury securities cleared at CME with cash market positions in U.S. Treasury securities cleared at FICC.</p>
<p>Comments on the proposal are due 30 days following publication in the Federal Register.<span>&nbsp;</span>Comments may be submitted electronically through the CFTC&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LawRegulation/PublicComments/HowtoSubmit/index.htm" target="_blank">Comments online process</a>. All comments received will be posted on <a href="https://comments.cftc.gov/PublicComments/ReleasesWithComments.aspx">CFTC.gov</a>.</p>

<title>Office Of The Comptroller Of The US Currency Announces Conditional Approvals For Five National Trust Bank Charter Applications</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today announced its conditional approval of five national trust bank charter applications. Subject to meeting the OCC&rsquo;s conditions, these institutions will join approximately 60 other national trust banks currently supervised by the OCC.</p>
<p>In granting these conditional approvals, the OCC applied the same rigorous review and standards it applies to all charter applications. The OCC carefully reviewed each application, based on its individual merits, consistent with applicable statutory and regulatory factors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;New entrants into the federal banking sector are good for consumers, the banking industry and the economy,&rdquo; said Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan V. Gould. &ldquo;They provide access to new products, services and sources of credit to consumers, and ensure a dynamic, competitive and diverse banking system. The OCC will continue to provide a path for both traditional and innovative approaches to financial services to ensure the federal banking system keeps pace with the evolution of finance and supports a modern economy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The OCC conditionally approved applications for de novo national trust bank charters for First National Digital Currency Bank and Ripple National Trust Bank.</p>
<p>The OCC also conditionally approved applications to convert from a state trust company to a national trust bank for BitGo Bank &amp; Trust, National Association, Fidelity Digital Assets, National Association and Paxos Trust Company, National Association.</p>
<p>The federal banking system includes more than 1,000 national banks, federal savings associations, and federal branches of foreign banking organizations operating in the United States that range in size from 1,000 smaller community banks under $30 billion in assets focused on meeting local needs to the largest internationally active banks. These banking companies conduct a wide array of businesses that range from retail and wholesale banking activity to trust, credit card and other more narrowly focused services. The institutions that make up the federal banking system conduct approximately 67 percent of the banking activity in the United States, hold more than $17 trillion in assets combined and administer more than $85 trillion under their control.</p>

<p><span>United States</span><br />SIFMA recommends an early close at 2:00 p.m. EST on Wednesday, December 31, 2025, and a full market close on Thursday, January 1, 2026, for the trading of U.S. dollar-denominated fixed income securities in observance of the New Year&rsquo;s Day holiday.</p>
<p><span>United Kingdom</span><br />SIFMA has confirmed its previous recommendation for a full market close on Thursday, January 1, 2026, for the trading of U.S. dollar-denominated fixed income securities in observance of the New Year&rsquo;s Day holiday.</p>
<p><span>Japan</span><br />SIFMA recommends full market closes on Wednesday, December 31, 2025, and Thursday, January 1, 2026, for the trading of U.S. dollar-denominated fixed income securities in observance of the New Year&rsquo;s Day and Bank Holiday.</p>

<p>The early close will not affect the closing time for settlements.</p>
<p>SIFMA&rsquo;s recommended early and full market closes are recommendations only; each member firm should decide for itself whether its fixed income departments remain open for trading. All SIFMA recommendations are subject to change due to market conditions.</p>

<title>Vancouver Resident Didn’t Comply With Records Demand And Obstructed Justice, BC Securities Commission Panel Says</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>A panel of the BC Securities Commission (BCSC)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/-/media/PWS/New-Resources/Decision-and-Orders/Decisions/2025/2025-BCSECCOM-533.pdf" target="_blank">has found</a>&nbsp;that a Vancouver resident failed to comply with a demand to produce records during an investigation and obstructed justice.</p>
<p>In June 2024, BCSC staff demanded that Lucas Christopher Birdsall produce certain records, as required by B.C.&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Securities Act</em>. The BCSC served the demand by mail, email and by posting it on his front door after several unsuccessful attempts to serve him in person.</p>
<p>Despite being granted two extensions to the deadline by the BCSC, Birdsall has not provided any records.</p>
<p>The panel concluded that he failed or refused to comply with the demand and that he failed or refused to produce the records and things, or classes of records and things, in his custody, possession or control.</p>
<p>His refusal to give a record that was reasonably required for a BCSC investigation was an obstruction of justice under the Act, the panel said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;What is in the public interest here is for Birdsall to comply with the Demand so the investigation can continue,&rdquo; the panel said.</p>
<p>The Executive Director and the respondent have been directed to make submissions on sanctions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The panel also dismissed eight applications made on behalf of Birdsall during the course of the proceedings.</p>

<title>The EBA Issues Revised List Of ITS Validation Rules And Announces New Website Location</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Banking Authority (EBA) issued today a revised list of validation rules under its Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) on supervisory reporting. This update highlights rules that have been deactivated due to inaccuracies or IT-related issues. Competent Authorities across the EU are reminded that data submitted according to these ITS should not be formally validated against the deactivated rules.</p>
<p>Additionally, the EBA has released a small validation package, which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>a micro taxonomy package</li>
<li>Data Point Model validation rules (DPM VR) deactivation updates scripts</li>
</ul>
<p>These components are required from release 4.0 for each deactivation exercise to ensure consistent deactivation of rules in both the taxonomy and the DPM.</p>
<p>A hotfix for reporting framework 4.2 will be issued in January 2026. Any necessary review of the validation rules for this framework will be incorporated in that hotfix. Therefore, no changes affecting release 4.2 are part of the current publication.</p>
<h4>New website location for validation rules</h4>
<p>The EBA has consolidated the validation rules and related technical documents (including the micro taxonomy package and DPM VR deactivation scripts) into a single&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/risk-and-data-analysis/reporting/reporting-frameworks/validation-rules-packages" title="Validation rules packages">dedicated section on its website</a>. This change simplifies access and improves usability by bringing all relevant documents together.</p>
<p>All stakeholders are encouraged to update their bookmarks and refer to the new location for the latest information on validation rules.</p>

<title>ACER: First Step Towards Mandatory EU-Wide Cost Efficiency Comparison Of Gas Transmission Operators</title>

Some elements of the methodology have been adapted based on the input received from third parties.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why does the cost-efficiency of gas TSOs matter?</span></p>
<p>Ultimately, gas consumers pay the costs of natural gas transmission networks through their bill. The TSOs&rsquo; allowed revenue is set by the national regulatory authority (NRA) and is recovered from network users through network tariffs, in line with the&nbsp;EU-wide&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtSUgVTV1BUVkwPAlcGHVZYDQ4dUFsAXhpWAAoCVlJRAgcJUgYdUFQAUwoHAFAdUw9WVR0GDQVQGlcGVwAZBwVRVQIFCVMEBlUDRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Network Code on Harmonised Transmission Tariff structures</a>.</p>
<p>Benchmarking compares the costs of a TSO (a monopoly) to other operators in the EU. ACER&rsquo;s efficiency comparison, which is mandatory for all EU TSOs, will help ensure that TSOs&rsquo; costs and the resulting tariffs across Europe are efficient. &nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What&rsquo;s next?</span></p>
<ul>
<li>January 2026: The second phase of the ACER efficiency comparison will start. ACER will request TSOs to submit the data that will be used for modelling in the third phase, as well as carry out a validation process to remove any reporting errors and ensure a high data quality. As part of the validation, TSOs or NRAs are expected to audit the reported data. ACER will consult with TSOs on the data that will be requested and the overall process.</li>
<li>Between late Q4 2026 &ndash; early Q1/2027: The third phase will be launched to focus on the modelling of the ACER efficiency comparison. Stakeholders will be consulted on the model specifications and process in the course of 2027.</li>
<li>By 5 August 2027: Completion of the first ACER efficiency comparison. Following the first publication, ACER should repeat the calculation every four years.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further updates will be provided along these process steps.</p>

<title>265 Listed Firms Achieve SET ESG Ratings As Thai Bourse Prepares For FTSE Russell ESG Transition In 2026</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h4>KEY POINTS</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>265 listed companies qualified for SET ESG Ratings in 2025, up from 219 in 2024.</b><b></b></li>
<li><b>Average scores improved across all ESG dimensions, with Environmental (E) scores surpassing 80 points for the first time.</b></li>
<li><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">SET ESG Ratings will transition to FTSE Russell ESG Scores framework in 2026.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) announced the 2025 SET ESG Ratings results, with 265 listed companies qualifying for the rating&mdash;up from 219 companies last year. Listed companies achieved higher average scores across all ESG dimensions this year, indicating their readiness for the upcoming transition to the global FTSE Russell ESG Scores framework in 2026.</p>
<p>The ratings breakdown comprises 102 companies rated AAA, 80 companies rated AA, 67 companies rated A, and 16 companies rated BBB. These companies collectively account for 70 percent of the combined market capitalization of SET and Market for Alternative Investment (mai) as of December 11, 2025.</p>
<p><b>SET Senior Executive Vice President Soraphol&nbsp;Tulayasathien</b> stated that over the past 11 years, SET ESG Ratings has established itself as a crucial sustainability benchmark for Thailand's capital market, catalyzing the transformation of companies from conducting CSR activities to strategically embedding sustainability into their business operations. The widespread adoption of this assessment is reflected in the steady year-on-year growth in participation. Today, SET ESG Ratings serves multiple investment purposes: fund managers utilize the ratings to define the investment universe for Thailand ESG Funds (Thai ESG), which have reached THB 76 billion (approx. USD 2.38 billion) in assets under management (AUM); equity analysts incorporate the ratings into their research; and financial institutions reference them when offering sustainability-linked financial incentives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listed companies this year posted higher average scores across all ESG dimensions, with the Environmental score surpassing 80 points for the first time. This reflects the growing priority most companies are placing on establishing Net Zero greenhouse gas emission targets and mandating board and executive oversight of climate-related risks and performance tracking. However, certain challenges remain, especially for small and medium-sized listed companies, including the collection of GHG Emission Scope 3 data, linking sustainability performance to financial metrics, and demonstrating to investors the business opportunities arising from managing material sustainability issues," Soraphol added.</p>
<p>SET ESG Ratings members are selected from listed companies that voluntarily participate in the assessment and achieve scores of at least 50 percent in each of the E, S, and G dimensions, and meet SET's qualification requirements. These criteria include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Receiving a Corporate Governance Report (CGR) rating of at least 3 stars.</li>
<li>Having no company, directors, or executives accused of or convicted of ESG violations by authorities or relevant agencies.</li>
<li>Not being subject to caution or suspension symbols (CB (Business), CC (Non-Compliance), CF (Free Float), and CS (Financial statements).</li>
</ul>
<p>SET continuously monitors members' qualifications and may remove companies from SET ESG Ratings if they subsequently fail to meet the criteria. A notation system accompanies the ratings to alert investors to relevant ESG news or developments that merit additional consideration.</p>
<p>The 2025 SET ESG Ratings announcement marks the final year of this assessment framework. The 2025 ratings&rsquo; results will remain valid as eligibility criteria for the SET ESG Index during the December 2025 and June 2026 rebalancing periods and will continue to define the investment universe for Thai ESG through December 2026. Starting in 2026, SET will transition to announcing results under the FTSE Russell ESG Scores framework, representing a pivotal step towards aligning Thailand's capital market sustainability assessment with global standards.</p>

<li>The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO)&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iosco.org%2Flibrary%2Fpubdocs%2Fpdf%2FIOSCOPD812.pdf&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cmailing-lists%40iosco.org%7C08aed8b6202846b89e9408de3964d04b%7Cbcc6c66cdb3b48328af2cc363a097444%7C0%7C0%7C639011302301957677%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=cQIQgCByfifXsFRUaakeIv3tvBM9VJ9I7Objk32ro4M%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">today published a report</a>&nbsp;that reviews the&nbsp;<strong>implementation of margin requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives</strong>.</li>
<li>The report concludes that the framework has been effectively implemented and finds no evidence of material issues.&nbsp;<strong>No changes to the framework are proposed</strong>.</li>
<li>The BCBS-IOSCO Working Group on Margining Requirements (WGMR) recommends&nbsp;<strong>ongoing monitoring</strong>&nbsp;through supervisory information exchange and the sharing of experiences among member authorities.</li>
</ul>
<p>The BCBS and IOSCO today published a report that reviews the implementation of margin requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives. The assessment marks a milestone in the ongoing monitoring of the standard introduced in response to the 2011 G20 call to enhance the resilience of financial markets.</p>
<p>The standard, first published in September 2013, establishes a framework for margin requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives. The final phase of implementation occurred in September 2022, and implementation has now reached a steady state. The WGMR assessed the framework&rsquo;s implementation, drawing on a 2024 quantitative impact study, a survey of WGMR members and recent international margin-related work.</p>
<p>The assessment found&nbsp;<strong>no material issues with the framework</strong>. The amount of margin exchanged for non-centrally cleared derivatives has increased materially since 2012, contributing to greater financial system resilience. The framework has been&nbsp;<strong>effective in supporting the intended functioning of capital and centrally cleared margin frameworks</strong>, including during recent episodes of market stress.</p>
<p>The BCBS and IOSCO do not propose changes to the framework, but recommend&nbsp;<strong>continued monitoring</strong>&nbsp;in the form of supervisory information exchange and the sharing of experiences among their members to address evolving market practices.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Fines Nationwide £44m For Failings In Financial Crime Controls</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The FCA has fined Nationwide Building Society &pound;44m for inadequate anti-financial crime systems and controls between October 2016 to July 2021.</p>
<p>During this period, Nationwide had ineffective systems for keeping up-to-date due diligence and risk assessments for all its personal current account customers and for monitoring their transactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nationwide was also aware that some of those customers were using their personal accounts for business activity, in breach of its terms. Nationwide did not offer business current accounts at this point, so did not have the right processes in place to manage the financial crime risks from business activity. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This meant Nationwide was unable to effectively identify, assess, monitor or manage the money laundering risks among its personal current account customers. It also meant Nationwide did not have an accurate picture of its customers who presented a higher risk of financial crime.</p>
<p>In one serious case, Nationwide missed opportunities to identify a customer using personal current accounts to receive fraudulent Covid furlough payments. The customer received 24 payments totalling &pound;27.3m over 13 months, with &pound;26.01m of this deposited over 8 days. His Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) recovered &pound;26.5m, but approximately &pound;800,000 remains unrecovered.</p>
<p>Therese Chambers, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said:</p>
<p>'Nationwide failed to get a proper grip of the financial crime risks lurking within its customer base. It took too long to address its flawed systems and weak controls, meaning red flags were missed with serious consequences.</p>
<p>'Building societies and banks have a key role in the fight against financial crime. Firms must remain vigilant in this fight.'</p>
<p>Nationwide was aware of weaknesses in its systems and controls and undertook work to make improvements. However, it failed to adequately address those weaknesses in a timely manner. Nationwide subsequently commenced a large-scale financial crime transformation programme in July 2021.</p>

<li>Nationwide would have been fined &pound;62,969,297, but it agreed to resolve these matters and so qualified for a 30% discount under the FCA's processes. The total fine is &pound;44,078,500.</li>
<li>The FCA continues to supervise firms to improve standards and ensure that they have the right systems and controls to manage financial crime risks. Since 2021, the FCA has imposed 13 fines &ndash; totalling &pound;300,767,526 &ndash; on banks for anti-money laundering systems and controls failings.</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) today published a Discussion Paper seeking public feedback as part of its review of Malaysia&rsquo;s corporate governance framework.</p>
<p>Key areas under review include reinforcing the roles of boards and management in driving long-term value creation and strengthening overall board effectiveness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This encompasses driving necessary behavioural shifts, enhancing agility in managing emerging risks and adopting new technologies, continuous strengthening of board composition and independence, and building stakeholder trust through timely engagement and access to information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The review is in line with the upcoming Capital Market Master Plan 4 (CMP4), which positions corporate governance as a key enabler of a resilient, inclusive and sustainable capital market.</p>
<p>The feedback will guide the upcoming revision of the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance (MCCG), and relevant corporate governance framework, ensuring the framework remains forward-looking, relevant and aligned with global best practices.<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>This Discussion Paper is open for feedback from 12 December 2025 to 6 February 2026.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Relevant stakeholders including listed companies, investors and industry associations are encouraged to provide their views and suggestions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Discussion Paper is available at <a href="https://www.sc.com.my/regulation/consultation-papers">https://www.sc.com.my/regulation/consultation</a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/regulation/consultation-papers"></a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/regulation/consultation-papers">papers</a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/regulation/consultation-papers">.</a> Enquiries may be emailed to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">mccg@seccom.com.my</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="component-text">Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) is currently carrying out measures (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;Growth Market Reform&rdquo;) to establish the TSE Growth Market as a hub for companies aiming for high growth.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;In line with this, JPX Market Innovation &amp; Research, Inc. (JPXI) has been preparing to provide a new index focused on the growth of startups.<sup>2</sup><br /><br />We are pleased to announce that we have now finalized the outline of the new &ldquo;JPX Start-Up Acceleration 100 Index.&rdquo; This index will primarily target stocks listed on the TSE Growth Market and select constituents based on growth criteria.<br /><br />We will proceed with the detailed design and plan to commence distribution on Monday, March 9, 2026.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p class="component-text">The establishment of an environment that facilitates investment in high-growth companies serve as an important foundation for companies to actively raise capital and make growth investments. In discussions on the Growth Market Reform promoted by TSE, there have also been expectations for indices that include companies achieving high growth, from the perspective of making it easier for investors to invest in attractive companies.<br /><br />In light of these circumstances, JPXI has decided to develop a new stock price index, the "JPX Start-Up Acceleration 100 Index," composed of companies listed on the TSE Growth Market as well as those that have recently transferred from the TSE Growth Market to other markets. Companies selected for this index will be identified as "Japan&rsquo;s leading high-growth startups," based on two indicators that measure the growth of startups: (1) sales growth rate and (2) market capitalization growth rate.<br /><br />Through the "JPX Start-Up Acceleration 100 Index," we aim to create a virtuous cycle in which even more　growth-oriented management is encouraged among startups and investment in those achieving growth is further expanded by promoting the use of the index composed of high-growth startups and investment in linked products such as ETFs.</p>

<p>This is a requirement under s138 of the&nbsp;<em>Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act</em>&nbsp;<em>2001</em>.</p>
<p>ASIC has also published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/what-we-do/how-we-operate/asic-industry-funding/regulatory-costs-and-levies/#Annualdashboardreport" title="Regulatory costs and levies">the variances between its estimated and actual costs for subsectors</a>.</p>
<p>Estimated costs were published in our 2024-25&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/news-items/asic-releases-estimated-industry-funding-levies-for-2024-25/#:~:text=ASIC%20today%20issued%20its%202024,under%20the%20industry%20funding%20model." title="ASIC releases estimated industry funding levies for 2024-25">Cost Recovery Implementation Statement</a>&nbsp;(CRIS) on 3 July 2025.</p>

<title>Statement Regarding Potential Revisions To FSOC’s Non-Bank Designation Guidance, Paul S. Atkins, SEC Chairman, Dec. 11, 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-regarding-potential-revisions-to-fsocs-non-bank-designation-guidance-20251212/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-regarding-potential-revisions-to-fsocs-non-bank-designation-guidance-20251212/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) received a briefing from Treasury staff on potential revisions to the Council&rsquo;s interpretative guidance regarding nonbank financial company determinations. And I was especially encouraged to see revising the non-bank designation guidance on the agenda. Secretary Bessent&rsquo;s leadership on this issue is welcome, and I believe that this Council cannot begin to undo the damage of the last administration fast enough.</p>
<p>The idea of non-bank designation was misguided from the start. Designation, in the wrong hands, is poised to become a weapon for an activist Council to push an arbitrary agenda and punish companies that are not onboard. It is urgent that we fix this.</p>
<p>When companies are subject to the risk of arbitrary designation, they are unable to plan for growth and undertake strategic decisions, impairing their ability to deploy capital efficiently and meet the needs of customers. For example, in 2016, General Electric sold off its financial division specifically to avoid the burdens associated with being labeled a systemically important financial institution. As we learned from designations under the 2012 guidance, companies view designation as an existential threat.</p>
<p>This should not be surprising. For a nonbank institution, designation brings with it a new regulator that does not have the primary regulator&rsquo;s expertise in its business&mdash;and quite possibly with its industry overall. I do not mean that to disparage our colleagues at the Federal Reserve. I am quite sure that they would have very strong negative feelings about the SEC stepping in to regulate a bank holding company. I would share those feelings. Furthermore, the Fed&rsquo;s primary regulatory tool is capital standards. These are meaningless in the context of an asset manager, insurance company, or investment fund.</p>
<p>Instead, FSOC&rsquo;s activities since 2016 demonstrate that regulators can effectively address the risks of nonbank financial companies without resorting to arbitrary designation. I have no concerns with the SEC&rsquo;s ability to address the risks falling within its own jurisdiction and trust other regulators to do the same.</p>
<p>The advantage of undertaking this rulemaking is that we now have three examples to draw on. As with any regulation, the 2019 guidance was not perfect and there were opportunities to improve it. However, the 2023 guidance did not build on this foundation but instead threw out the approach in favor of moving back toward the approach in the 2012 guidance, which was successfully challenged in court.</p>
<p>I feel strongly that the Council should prioritize reintroducing the use of important safeguards against arbitrary and capricious designation, such as cost-benefit analysis and an assessment of the likelihood of material financial distress. Without these safeguards, the Council risks litigation in the response to designation. Its track record in this regard should raise serious concerns.</p>
<p>I encourage my fellow councilmembers to think creatively, and I look forward to working with all of them on this effort.</p>

<title>Remarks Before The US Financial Stability Oversight Council, Paul S. Atkins, SEC Chairman, Financial Stability Oversight Council, Washington D.C., Dec. 11, 2025</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/remarks-before-the-us-financial-stability-oversight-council-paul-s-atkins-sec-20251212/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Secretary Bessent. I am pleased to join you all at our final FSOC meeting of the year.</p>
<p>First, a word of gratitude. The annual report before us reflects a remarkable level of dedication, made all the more notable by shutdown-imposed limitations. I should like to extend special thanks to the drafting team assembled by FSOC&mdash;and to the SEC staff who worked cheek by jowl with them in preparing this report.</p>
<p>Of course, my thanks as always to Secretary Bessent, under whose leadership the Council is laying a strong foundation for the work ahead. I especially applaud the Council&rsquo;s emphasis on sustainable long-term economic growth. This focus will not displace our ongoing assessment of the U.S. financial system, nor will it diminish our monitoring of its stability. Rather, this new dimension recognizes that market resilience and growth are twin pillars, not competing imperatives, of our financial security.</p>
<p>The benefits of this framework abound in the 2025 annual report. By organizing our findings into key areas of focus, separating formal recommendations from significant market developments that warrant monitoring, we have produced a clearer, more coherent picture of the system that we are charged to safeguard.</p>
<p>So, as we wind down one historic year and prepare for another, I am eager to build on our momentum, including a thoughtful review of the non-bank designation guidance. When firms face the prospect of arbitrary and capricious designation, as we have seen too often in the past, they cannot plan for growth or undertake strategic decisions. This risk impairs their ability to deploy capital efficiently and serve their customers effectively&mdash;outcomes that run completely counter to our shared objectives.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Federal Reserve supervision, whose only tool is capital standards, would bring a meaningless regulatory framework to asset managers, insurance companies, investment funds, and so forth. And we have seen how that has wound up in the past.</p>
<p>The American economy remains the world&rsquo;s greatest engine of growth and innovation. Our work should support, not undermine, that fundamental strength.</p>
<p>Finally, let me close by thanking Secretary Bessent once more for his steady leadership. I am grateful for the collaborative spirit that he brings to this Council, and I look forward to continuing our work in the coming year.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="text-align-justify">The Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council) today unanimously approved its 2025 annual report. This report presents the Council&rsquo;s assessment of the most salient financial stability issues, provides the Council&rsquo;s recommendations to address those issues, and summarizes the activities of the Council and member agencies to address potential emerging threats to U.S. financial stability. The report was developed collaboratively by Council members and their agencies and staffs. Overall, the Council finds that U.S. financial markets and institutions functioned effectively in 2025, supporting the smooth provision of credit to businesses and households and facilitating asset price discovery.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">&ldquo;Since the first day of this Administration, we have focused on building Parallel Prosperity&mdash;an era of economic expansion where Wall Street and Main Street grow together,&rdquo; Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent said. &ldquo;To that end, we have tirelessly pursued pro-growth policies to help unlock the potential available to all Americans when they are free to save, invest, innovate, build businesses, and drive their own economic destinies. It is my firm belief that the Financial Stability Oversight Council plays an important role in ensuring that the financial system is contributing to this vision.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">Given the wide range of topics relevant to financial stability, this year&rsquo;s report has been restructured to highlight the Council&rsquo;s priority areas of focus, each of which is accompanied by actionable policy recommendations. These areas and associated recommendations include the following.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>Bolstering Treasury Market Resilience:&nbsp;</span>The U.S. Treasury market is the deepest and most liquid market in the world, with a unique role underpinning financial activity across the domestic and global economies, which underscores the importance of continuing to bolster its resilience. As such, the Council strongly supports the continued work of the Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG) and encourages member agencies to use the Council&rsquo;s new Market Resilience Working Group as an additional forum to monitor and analyze resilience-boosting initiatives in the Treasury market. Additionally, the Council supports the Securities and Exchange Commission in its efforts to implement a central clearing mandate for Treasuries and endorses banking agencies&rsquo; recent finalization of a rule amending the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio, which should help improve Treasury market intermediation capacity. Finally, the Council recommends close monitoring of market developments, such as the potential entry of new Treasury central counterparties and implementation of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, to better understand related impacts on Treasury market structure, functioning, and demand.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>Addressing Cyber Risk and Navigating an Evolving Threat Landscape</span>: The cyber threat landscape continues to evolve rapidly, with nation-state actors and sophisticated criminal groups continuing to target financial institutions and critical financial infrastructure. The Council recommends that member agencies continue to expand joint monitoring and information sharing efforts among regulators and industry stakeholders and endorses the increased use of scenario-driven tabletop exercises to help bolster preparedness for cyber incidents. To proactively expand cyber defense capabilities, the Council endorses increased public sector usage of artificial intelligence (AI) and engagement with regulated private sector entities to encourage development of similar capabilities. Further, the Council encourages federal banking regulators to continue coordination of third-party service provider examinations, expand collaborative outreach with state regulators, and identify additional ways to support information sharing among state and federal regulators. The Council recommends that Congress pass legislation to ensure that the Federal Housing Finance Agency has adequate examination and enforcement powers to manage the risks associated with services provided by third parties to its regulated entities. Finally, the Council encourages public and financial services sector partners to consider the cryptographic risks of quantum computers and their impact on the future cyber risk landscape, and to take appropriate steps to facilitate the migration to quantum-resistant encryption technologies.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>Enhancing Supervisory and Regulatory Frameworks for Depository Institutions:&nbsp;</span>An appropriately regulated and supervised banking system is critical to financial stability. Therefore, the Council endorses proposals and actions taken by banking agencies and the National Credit Union Administration in 2025 to enhance supervision and regulation of banks and credit unions and encourages consideration of new proposals and guidance to further modernize these frameworks, enhance transparency, reduce unnecessary regulatory burden, and better align regulatory treatment to avoid market distortions. Finally, the Council supports recent efforts by banking agencies to recalibrate regulatory and supervisory expectations, clearly define &ldquo;unsafe or unsound practice&rdquo; for supervisory and enforcement purposes, and reduce compliance costs for community banks.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>Harnessing Artificial Intelligence to Promote Financial Stability:&nbsp;</span>Recent technological advances have spurred a significant increase in AI adoption. Financial institutions are using AI for many purposes and, similarly, financial regulatory bodies are exploring AI&rsquo;s use in supervision and regulation. Going forward, the Council recommends that member agencies use its Artificial Intelligence Working Group to explore opportunities for AI to promote the resilience of the financial system, while also monitoring for potential risks to financial stability that might be posed by the adoption of AI both within and outside the financial services sector. The Council also endorses continued cooperation by the Treasury Department, the Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee, and the Financial Services Sector Coordinating Council on these issues. Finally, the Council supports continued engagement with international counterparts concerned with the use of AI in financial services.</p>

<title>You Cannot Regulate What You Cannot Define – Part 2: Tokenization, DeFi: By Kelvin To, Founder And President Of Data Boiler Technologies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><img alt="DataBoiler_11Dec25" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/DataBoiler_11Dec25.jpg" title="DataBoiler_11Dec25" /></p>
<h4>What &ldquo;tokenization&rdquo; or &ldquo;DeFi&rdquo; is truly about</h4>
<p>In a <a href="https://schoolofeconomy.com/stories/2024/10/03/rise-of-the-sharing-economy-redefining-ownership-and-consumption/">sharing economy</a>, crypto / Digital Ledger Technology (DLT) are like other shared services (e.g. Uber, Air B&amp;B) that unleash tremendous <i>"societal values by promoting access over ownership, which challenges traditional notions of property rights." </i>We think the Bank for International Settlements (<a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/arpdf/ar2025e3.pdf">BIS</a>) has an overly complicated definition or concept about <i>&ldquo;tokenization&rdquo;. </i>Tokenization to some extent may equate to Securitization, when it serves as an alternative or a poor person way for securities issuance and asset gathering processes. Putting it in layman terms, both <i>&ldquo;tokenization&rdquo;</i> and <i>&ldquo;securitization&rdquo;</i> aim to make assets tradable and liquid.</p>
<p>We have no objection with the <a href="https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD809.pdf">IOSCO</a>&rsquo;s statement, <i>&ldquo;Tokenization arrangements typically seek to achieve one or more of the following features: Fictionalization, Programmability, Composability, and Atomicity.&rdquo; </i>A <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/455/551/">nuance</a> &ndash; fractional participation in a tokenized product that is otherwise framed as a risk management or treasury tool with no general solicitation or advertising, no emphasis on profit potential, offered as part of a broader banking relationship and is a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/12/225.28">direct bank obligation</a> under <i>&ldquo;</i><a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-12/chapter-II/subchapter-A/part-225/subpart-I/section-225.86"><i>incidental banking service</i></a><i>&rdquo;</i>, may be considered as investment activities under the current law.</p>
<p>If the tokenized product meets the criteria of an <i>&ldquo;investment contract&rdquo;</i> under the Howey test or falls within the statutory definition of a security under the Securities Act of 1933, then one may use private placement (<a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-17/chapter-II/part-230#subpart-D">Reg D</a>) and restrict access only to accredited investors. If it is structured as a commodity option, it may be offered only to Eligible Contract Participants (ECPs) via registered Futures Commission Merchant (FCM) / Retail Foreign Exchange Dealer (RFED). The current narrowly defined banking exemptions that community banks and credit unions are forced to handover business to a third-party or their larger counterparts with a brokerage / securities service arm. Clients suffer from bureaucracy and higher fees.</p>
<p>When formal orders legitimize exploitations, informal sub-orders will emerge as a counter response. If policy-makers want tokenized activities in the above example to go away (without price control to curb the Elites, nor rule-by-enforcement that is a double-edged sword), we recommend granting a <i>&ldquo;break-bulk exemption&rdquo;</i> (e.g. shared representation of a claim &lt; 35, aggregate &lt; 110% cost if client was otherwise engaged in individual contract).</p>
<p>We recognize that, for example, credit card reward points, frequent flyer programs and the like, if tokenized to allow easier transfer of these <i>&ldquo;reward tokens&rdquo;</i> to freely trade and exchange with other third-parties beyond family members may serve good community values. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOTE:</span> <i>&ldquo;tokenized reward points&rdquo;</i> may have unlimited supply and program organizers may have &ldquo;small-print&rdquo; discretionary clauses to change or alter reward programs at any time (analogy to <i>&ldquo;hard fork&rdquo;</i> &ndash; a backward-incompatible upgrade to the blockchain).</p>
<p>There is no single authoritative FASB standard under the US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles for how a recipient of reward points or tokens should be accounted for. Commercial practices vary &ndash; some treat them as a <i>&ldquo;freebie&rdquo;</i> and not keep any record of it in an accounting book, others consider it as a <i>&ldquo;rebate / discount&rdquo;</i> deducting them directly from expenses, also certain firms may consider it materiality and treat them as a <i>&ldquo;prepayment asset&rdquo;</i> on their balance sheet.</p>
<p>Firms operating <i>&ldquo;reward programs&rdquo;</i> must choose between ASC 450-30 Gain Contingency Model and ASC 606 Vendor Rebate Model to develop a defensible and consistent policy. There are different valuation-of-rewards approaches &ndash; (i) direct cash-out value, (ii) estimated redemption value, or (iii) conservative average based on historical redemptions &ndash; timing of recognition varies depending on the policy &ndash; (a) at redemption, (b) when statement is issued, or (c) when qualify purchases are made. Additional nuances include but are not limited to: no purchase requirement, consolidation of reward programs, <a href="https://assets.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmg/pdf/2016/06/tnf-wnit3-june-6-2016.pdf">tax treatment</a>, interest or yield bearing on these <i>&ldquo;reward tokens&rdquo;</i>, etc.</p>
<p><i>Smart contracts</i> are an <i>oversimplified</i> mechanism for delineating complex real-world <a href="https://iea.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/THE%20MYTH%20OF%20SOCIAL%20COST.pdf">rights and obligations</a>. Challenges include: limited access to off-chain data; interoperability issues, where different chains operate in silos; immutability (which provides security but leads to inflexibility or difficulty capturing legal nuances when dealing with evolving circumstances, renegotiations, or unforeseen events). In turn, hybrid solutions are being created, resulting in DeFi <i>convergence</i> to TradFi with no necessary efficiency gain.</p>
<p>Are commercial disputes or consumer protection mechanisms being insufficient that it calls for involvement of securities laws? Are many existing commercial reward programs being unsustainable and they seek tokenization as an exit or chance of revitalization? Would <i>&ldquo;rewards&rdquo;</i> be used as alternate means to raise funds cheaper than bank loans, Private Equity or Venture Capital funding? There are more questions than answers. The US Congress should refrain from laying an invisible hand of Government to regulate these private <i>&ldquo;reward program&rdquo;</i> activities. Regulatory agencies, the SEC and FINRA in particular, do <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> have the necessary capacity to practically review hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of applications to register these <i>&ldquo;reward tokens&rdquo;</i> as &ldquo;securities&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Tokenized assets can be uncountable, i.e. unlimited supply. Uncapped supply creates inflationary pressure; hence value of such digital assets cannot be properly determined or quantified by the amount of outstanding inventory. The original Dodd-Frank Volcker rule&rsquo;s securities Inventory RENTD provision has it merits. Uncountable <i>"Funny money"</i> is more akin to <i>"non-cashable gambling chips"</i>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOTE:</span> there is no formal <i>&ldquo;certification body&rdquo;</i> for token classification in the US, but to rely on issuer&rsquo;s initial representation in simple agreement for future tokens (SAFT) to <i>&ldquo;self-certified&rdquo;</i>, p.s. $BTC has no centralized issuer, no initial sale or fund raising.</p>
<p>CFTC is in a better position than the SEC to regulate the <a href="https://www.databoiler.com/index_htm_files/DataBoiler%20CFTC%2020250818.pdf">trading of Spot Crypto Asset Contracts and Tokens sold via SAFT</a>. CFTC authority under &sect;2(c)(2)(D) of Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and COMEX Rule 7 help curb and mitigate situations such as the <a href="https://www.secactions.com/two-significant-losses-for-the-cftc/">Monex case</a>, <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/system/files/case_example/040.pdf">retail metal fraud cases</a>, and <a href="https://www.scottsdalemint.com/articles/2024/the-hunt-brothers-how-two-billionaires-broke-the-silver-market/">Silver Thursday event</a>. We recommend the CFTC to require Designated Contract Markets (DCMs) to set aside at least 1 to 2% of gross revenue allocated to risk education program for existing and prospective retail clients, on top of protection against abusive practices, and updating <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-17/chapter-I/part-38">Core Principle 12 outlined in </a> 5(d) of the CEA and Part 38 accordingly. We do <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> want the SEC to cross subsidize the cost to regulate crypto from equity trading.</p>
<p>The SEC Chair <a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-111225-securities-exchange-commissions-approach-digital-assets-inside-project-crypto">suggested</a> <i>&ldquo;digital commodities,&rdquo;</i> &ldquo;network tokens,&rdquo; &ldquo;digital collectibles,&rdquo; and <i>&ldquo;digital tools&rdquo;</i> are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> securities. We agree with and support the SEC oversight on <i>&ldquo;Governance token with rights&rdquo;</i> and <i>&ldquo;Covered Liquidity Staking Receipt Tokens&rdquo;</i> and that fits squarely with the definition of <i>&ldquo;securities&rdquo;</i> as well as those involves <i>&ldquo;bundled services&rdquo;</i> that resemble an investment contract. We have no objection to the SEC establishing a safe harbor for certain airdrops from characterization as <i>&ldquo;sales&rdquo;</i> under Section 2(a)(3) of the Securities Act or an exemption from the corresponding registration requirements under&nbsp;Section 5 of the Securities Act. The SEC should also consider an exemption for distributions of digital assets by decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN) providers in securities transactions for purposes of rewarding participation in <a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-092925-deep-statement-doublezero-no-action-letter">DePIN networks</a>, and distributions of certain NFT offerings. We are open minded about DePIN transformation to serve the US in the long-term.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We do appreciate the duo oversight setup under the <i>&ldquo;Responsible Financial Innovation Act proposal&rdquo;</i> (<a href="https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/senate_banking_committee_digital_asset_market_structure_legislation_discussion_draft.pdf">RFIA</a>) regarding <i>&ldquo;Ancillary Assets,&rdquo;</i> &ndash; the SEC gatekeeping the primary sales and the CFTC be the secondary trading regulator. The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, oversighted by the SEC, should determine the proper ways in measuring, recording, and disclosing of <i>&ldquo;Ancillary Assets&rdquo;.</i> We look forward to the RFIA final bill formally introduced in the Senate that will address the asset classification protocols issue prompted by the <a href="https://cases.justia.com/federal/district-courts/new-york/nysdce/1:2022cv03401/578896/84/0.pdf">CFTC v. Archegos Capital Management LP case</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Senate Agriculture Committee released a bipartisan <a href="https://www.dwt.com/-/media/files/blogs/financial-services-law-advisor/2025/c__users_rya_appdata_local_temp_rya25790.pdf">November 2025 draft</a>. It aims to merge with the earlier RFIA draft that expands the CFTC&rsquo;s authority over the spot market for digital commodities (e.g. requires digital commodity exchanges, brokers, and dealers to register with the CFTC), and overlines mechanisms (joint advisory committee, joint rulemaking, and innovation sandbox) for better coordination of the SEC and CFTC&rsquo;s roles.</p>

<p>The SEC should refrain from regulating any <i>&ldquo;uncountable&rdquo;</i> digital asset that is more akin to <i>&ldquo;non-cashable gambling chips.&rdquo;</i> It should not be subjected to investor protection over securities trading activities. Wrapping money-market fund protections around this <i>&ldquo;funny money&rdquo;</i> does <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> make it any safer (lipstick on a pig is still a pig). The SEC does <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> need to reconsider its withdrawn <a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules-regulations/2025/06/safeguarding-advisory-client-assets">Safeguarding rule proposal</a>, which &ndash; if revived and modified to accommodate digital asset nuances&mdash;could be a detriment to the time-tested Exchange Act framework.</p>
<p>A caveat &ndash; crypto Exchange Traded Products (ETPs), the underlying assets do <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> necessarily have to be <i>&ldquo;securities&rdquo;</i>. The SEC&rsquo;s recent approved $DOJE is a crypto Exchange Traded Fund with underlying <i>&ldquo;assets&rdquo;</i> being MEME Coin. Recalling a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/staff-statement-meme-coins">statement by the SEC Division of Corporate Finance on Feb 27, 2025</a>, it stated that <i>&ldquo;MEME Coins for entertainment and social cultural purposes are NOT securities.&rdquo;</i> Any <i>&ldquo;Digital Collectables&rdquo;</i> that do not involve CEA regulated commodity options, futures, or leveraged OTC transactions, it would be outside scope of CFTC&rsquo;s oversight. Reliance on the regulated structure of the product and the transparent disclosures for the valuations and the regulatory controls may be an insurmountable reality. That guardrail may <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ONLY</span> shuffle fraud and manipulation risk out the door of SEC regulated markets, but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> stopping the risk spreading elsewhere. Bad actors / foreign adversaries play across markets and payment systems simultaneously.</p>
<p>We have reservations with the SEC newly approved <a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2025-121-sec-approves-generic-listing-standards-commodity-based-trust-shares">generic listing standards</a>. Its first criteria &ndash; <i>&ldquo;The asset is listed on a market that is a member of the Intermarket Surveillance Group&rdquo;</i> (<a href="https://isgportal.org/public-members">ISG</a>), reminded me of AIG &ndash; notorious for engaging in credit&nbsp;enhancement and securitization that led to their financial distress during the 2008 financial crisis. Most members of ISG are stock exchanges. An ISG can be bought and sold easily (<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/ig-pockets-75m-after-disposal-of-future-exchange-platform-to-beef-up-crypto-capabilities/ar-AA1OzXxa">Kraken acquired Small Exchange</a>). <a href="https://www.regulatoryoversight.com/2025/08/kalshi-faces-regulatory-scrutiny-and-litigation-from-several-angles/">KalshiEX is facing regulatory scrutiny and litigation</a>. Some ISG members domicile outside of the US may have close ties with their respective governments (HKEX&rsquo;s subsidiary <a href="https://www.financialresearch.gov/working-papers/files/OFRwp-24-09_central-clearing-and-trade-cancellation.pdf">LME</a> involved in a notorious <a href="https://www.financialresearch.gov/working-papers/files/OFRwp-24-09_central-clearing-and-trade-cancellation.pdf">futures contracts cancellation case</a>). We certainly welcome our friendly foreign regulators (CIRO and ASIC) as members of the ISG. UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said <i>&ldquo;We have no lasting friends, no lasting enemies, only lasting interests.&rdquo; </i>Can the US rely on foreign organizations to act in America&rsquo;s best interest without being <a href="https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/2025-05/PA%20996.pdf">taken for granted</a>? Would the US retreat from global governance be <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/06/can-us-retreat-global-governance-be-exploited-other-powers">exploited by other powers</a>?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US cannot call for an outright ban of crypto like <a href="https://english.ckgsb.edu.cn/knowledge/article/china-and-crypto-a-ban-on-the-mainland-but-experimentation-in-hong-kong/">China</a>. Foreign nations promoting their own Central Bank Digital Currency (<a href="file://C:/Users/kel_t/Downloads/FTNEA2025005.pdf">CBDC</a>) while pushing other digital assets out their doors or allegedly <i>&ldquo;exporting&rdquo;</i> DeFi to the US is a de-dollarization attempt. Among the $4 trillion aggregated market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies, stablecoins are about 7.5% (~ $300 billion). <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOTE:</span> &nbsp;the 1:1 reserve requirement under the GENIUS Act is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> a daily mark-to-market, but rather requires permitted issuers to provide monthly public reporting on their reserve assets.</p>
<p>The dilemma is &ndash; the more we add new compliance requirements, the more accumulated bureaucracy in dragging the US productivity. Foreign adversaries want the Western civilizations to fall in their trap. The approach to <i>&ldquo;suck&rdquo;</i> new money from Digital Asset activities may be unconventional (like Mafia making other gangs abide by their rules), but becoming the biggest force behind DeFi is better. We recommend:</p>
<div>
<p><a href="https://www.esm.europa.eu/blog/euros-moment">Dollarize</a> everything to turn the table against de-dollarization threats, even if it means spreading the risk abroad. The <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/blog/date/2025/html/ecb.blog20250728~e6cb3cf8b5.en.html">EU</a> should <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> perceive the US as a hazard. Western Civilization should stand by the US against countries with human rights violations that hide under the guise of <i>&ldquo;safety monitoring and assessments&rdquo;</i>. The <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/exuberance-factors-boil-down-complexities-anticipate-future-kelvin-to-khfze">phenomena of currency and tariff wars</a> today are the result of breached contracts (some US allies included).</p>
<p>TradFi establishments infuse trust into crypto ecosystem while a toll gate to profit or rent seek from flows passing through their infrastructures is inevitable. To prevent these infrastructure providers from exploiting small investors, we recommend a 2-tier or a dual-track regulatory regime (see page 5 of our <a href="https://www.databoiler.com/index_htm_files/DataBoiler%20CFTC%2020250818.pdf">comment letter to the CFTC</a>). DCM&rsquo;s betting odds may be used as a reference if the operator of such platform may also apply for Securities Exchange or Alternative Trading System license(s) under the SEC oversight. In vice versa, the SEC should review the long-term betting odds of Stock Exchanges to consider license renewals or enforcement actions. This helps keep both the <i>DeFi</i> and <i>TradFi</i> intact, where healthy competition will be promoted, bureaucracy and barriers would be minimized and removed.</p>
</div>
<p>The ideal way to weed out Illicit activity involving Digital Assets is by reducing bureaucracy and removing barriers that widened the gap between the <i>&ldquo;haves&rdquo;</i> and <i>&ldquo;have nots.&rdquo;</i> When the World prospers more under the US leadership, there will be less bad actors and adversaries.</p>

<title>Remarks By US Secretary Of The Treasury Scott Bessent Before The US Financial Stability Oversight Council</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/remarks-by-us-secretary-of-the-treasury-scott-bessent-before-the-us-financial-st-20251211/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>Introductory remarks:</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify">Now, turning to our first agenda item, we will discuss the Council&rsquo;s annual report.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">Since the first day of this Administration, we have focused on building Parallel Prosperity&mdash;an era of economic expansion where Wall Street and Main Street grow together.&nbsp; To that end, we have tirelessly pursued pro-growth policies to help unlock the potential available to all Americans when they are free to save, invest, innovate, build businesses, and drive their own economic destinies.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">It is my firm belief that the Financial Stability Oversight Council plays an important role in ensuring that the financial system is contributing to this vision.&nbsp; Too often in the past, efforts to safeguard the financial system have resulted in burdensome and often duplicative regulations.&nbsp; Little thought was given to the harms of overregulation, the imbalance between costs imposed and benefits achieved, and the economic stagnation that can follow.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">Our Administration is changing that approach.&nbsp; We understand that sustainable long-term economic growth and economic security are both essential to financial stability.&nbsp; Today, I will explain how the Council is prioritizing these concepts in its work, and how they are reflected in this year&rsquo;s annual report.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">Economic growth underpins financial stability.&nbsp; Growth contributes to higher earnings and capital cushions for financial institutions that can serve as buffers against unexpected losses.&nbsp;Similarly, households and businesses with stronger balance sheets are more resilient to shocks, less likely to default on debts, and more likely to maintain consumption and investment.&nbsp; Yet policymakers have not routinely considered the cumulative burdens of regulatory and supervisory regimes, the interactions among individual rules, or how a failure to modernize regulations can hurt both resilience and growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">The work we are doing at FSOC will be amplified by the United States when we host the G20 in 2026. The main priority of our host year will be on promoting economic growth and deregulation, which will include focusing on policies that will increase global prosperity by removing harmful regulations and barriers to innovation.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">The Council has a statutory duty to monitor financial regulatory proposals and developments.&nbsp; It also has a duty to make recommendations to enhance the integrity, efficiency, competitiveness, and stability of U.S. financial markets.&nbsp; To fulfill that obligation, the Council is working with member agencies to consider where aspects of the U.S. financial regulatory framework impose undue burdens and where they harm economic growth, thereby undermining financial stability.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">Economic security is also a necessary condition for financial stability.&nbsp; In the national security context, &ldquo;economic security&rdquo; is defined as having a secure and resilient domestic production capacity, combined with reliable access to the global resources necessary to maintain an acceptable standard of living.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">This concept of economic security must be integrated into the financial stability analysis and the Council&rsquo;s framework for understanding risks.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because the fallout from decreasing living standards can contribute to financial instability.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">Economic security and financial stability are bolstered by technologies that keep our financial system secure and financial regulation that incentivizes the flow of credit to strategic sectors.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">The twin priorities of economic growth and economic security will guide the Council&rsquo;s future approach to identifying priorities, evaluating risks, and recommending regulatory or supervisory changes.&nbsp; The Council is operationalizing these priorities through interagency staff working groups, and we will share updates about their progress next year as the work takes shape.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">This year&rsquo;s annual report also reflects the reorientation of the Council&rsquo;s priorities.&nbsp;In this report, we are shifting away from the past approach &ndash; where nearly every sector of the economy, major market, and major financial institution was described as a financial stability vulnerability.&nbsp; By introducing a new structure centered on fostering economic growth and security, we are focusing on the issues that matter most for enduring U.S. financial stability.&nbsp;</p>

<title>DTCC Authorized To Offer New Tokenization Service, Paving The Way To Tokenized DTC-Custodied Assets - DTC Receives No-Action Letter From SEC To Offer New Service To Accelerate Adoption Of Digital Assets - Industry Partnership &amp; Collaboration Will Continue To Underpin DTCC’s Efforts To Help Lead Transition To Digital Markets</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/dtcc-authorized-to-offer-new-tokenization-service-paving-the-way-to-tokenized-d-20251211/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In a major milestone to drive digital asset adoption, The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the premier post-trade market infrastructure for the global financial services industry, today announced that its subsidiary, The Depository Trust Company (DTC), has received a No-Action Letter (NAL) from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer, under federal securities laws and regulations, a new service to tokenize real-world, DTC-custodied assets in a controlled production environment. DTC anticipates beginning to roll out the service in the second half of 2026.</p>
<p>The No-Action Letter authorizes DTC to offer a tokenization service for DTC Participants and their clients on pre-approved blockchains for three years. Under the NAL, DTC will have the ability to tokenize real-world assets, with the digital version having all the same entitlements, investor protections and ownership rights as the asset in its traditional form. In addition, DTC will provide the same high level of resiliency, safety and soundness as that of traditional markets.</p>
<p>The authorization applies to a defined set of highly liquid assets, including the Russell 1000, which represents the 1,000 largest publicly traded U.S. companies by market cap, as well as ETFs tracking major indices and U.S. Treasury bills, bonds and notes. The No-Action Letter is significant because it allows DTC to launch the service once finalized, under certain limitations and representations, more quickly than would have otherwise been possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to thank the SEC for its trust in us. Tokenizing the U.S. securities market has the potential to yield transformational benefits such as collateral mobility, new trading modalities, 24/7 access and programmable assets, but this will only be achievable if market infrastructure provides a robust foundation to usher in this new digital era,&rdquo; stated Frank La Salla, President &amp; CEO, DTCC. &ldquo;We welcome this opportunity to further enable and innovate for the industry, our participants and their clients. We look forward to partnering across the industry to tokenize real-world assets safely and securely while advancing the future of finance for generations to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s No-Action Letter is a critical enabler of the firm&rsquo;s broader strategy to advance a secure, transparent and interoperable digital asset ecosystem that leverages the full potential of blockchain technology.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the start, DTCC has been pioneering breakthrough technologies that redefine markets and safeguard their integrity. Our tokenization initiative will build upon that legacy and enable us to work collaboratively with industry participants to usher in the era of digital markets,&rdquo; stated Brian Steele, Managing Director, President of Clearing &amp; Securities Services at DTCC. &ldquo;In partnership with our clients and the broader market, we will tokenize securities with uncompromising security, sound legal footing and seamless interoperability, all backed by the resilience that has anchored traditional markets for decades.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In support of this strategy, DTCC&rsquo;s tokenization approach will enable DTC Participants and their clients to take advantage of a comprehensive tokenization service, underpinned by DTCC&rsquo;s ComposerX suite of platforms. This will enable DTC to create a single pool of liquidity across the TradFi and DeFi ecosystems and deliver a more resilient, inclusive, cost-effective and efficient financial system.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) has the power to reshape markets, and DTCC is championing this transformation through innovative actions and bold solutions,&rdquo; said Nadine Chakar, Managing Director and Head of Digital Assets at DTCC. &ldquo;Our suite of DLT offerings will underpin DTCC&rsquo;s tokenization service and, together with the industry, will drive development of a new digital asset ecosystem for all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DTC has, in coordination with Participants, peers, and technology providers, explored and facilitated the use of DLT for almost a decade to determine how it could be utilized to allow market participants to leverage the benefits of blockchain and tokenization technology, including mobility (the ability to transfer an asset across jurisdictions and time zones without regard to standard trading hours or holidays), decentralization (the ability for market participants to access their assets more directly), and programmability (the ability to use smart contracts to optimize transfers or allocations of assets), all with the same protections and accountability that DTC provides.</p>
<p>Under the No-Action Letter, DTC is authorized to offer a limited production environment tokenization service across L1 and L2 providers. DTCC will provide more details about on-boarding requirements, including registering wallets, as well as the approval process for L1 and L2 networks in the coming months.</p>
<p>A full copy of the SEC&rsquo;s No-Action Letter is available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/tm/no-action/dtc-nal-121125.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.sec.gov/files/tm/no-action/dtc-nal-121125.pdf</a>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission&rsquo;s Division of Market Oversight and the Division of Clearing and Risk today announced they have taken a no-action position regarding swap data reporting and recordkeeping regulations in response to requests from multiple registered entities.</span></p>
<p><span>The divisions will not recommend the CFTC initiate an enforcement action against certain registered entities or their participants for failure to comply with certain swap-related recordkeeping requirements and for failure to report to swap data repositories data associated with binary option transactions executed on or subject to the rules of the registered entities, subject to the terms of the no-action letters. The no-action letters apply only&nbsp;in narrow circumstances and are comparable to no-action letters issued for other similarly situated designated contract markets and derivatives clearing organizations.</span></p>

<title>Tokenization Trending: Statement On The Division Of Trading And Market’s No-Action Letter Related To DTC’s Development Of Securities Tokenization Services, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, Dec. 11, 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, the staff of the Division of Trading and Markets issued a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/tm/no-action/sifma-nal-120325.pdf" title="sifma-nal-120325">no-action letter to The Depository Trust Company</a>&nbsp;(&ldquo;DTC&rdquo;). The letter relates to DTC&rsquo;s development and launch of a preliminary version of its voluntary securities tokenization program on supported blockchains that meet DTC&rsquo;s technology standards. This program will enable the tokenization of security entitlements to certain eligible securities that DTC&rsquo;s participants hold through DTC (&ldquo;tokenized entitlements&rdquo;). Any DTC participant with a registered wallet will be able to transfer its tokenized entitlement directly to the registered wallet of another DTC participant. DTC&rsquo;s software system will track each transfer to record tokenization entitlements for DTC&rsquo;s official books and records.</p>
<p>Although this program is a pilot subject to various operational limitations, it marks a significant incremental step in moving markets onchain. DTC plays a central role in our securities markets. I am looking forward to seeing how DTC&rsquo;s participants benefit from this program and the extent to which DTC&rsquo;s tokenization model can enhance the functioning of our securities markets.</p>
<p>DTC&rsquo;s tokenized entitlement model is a promising step along the tokenization journey, but other market participants are exploring alternate experimental avenues. As I have said repeatedly, the Commission&rsquo;s crypto work is iterative. We welcome and expect other market participants&rsquo; continuing efforts to innovate and experiment. Their experiments may involve other securities tokenization models. Investor choice is critical, particularly at this early stage when the market is testing what works. For example, some issuers have begun tokenizing their own securities, which may make it easier for investors to hold and transact in securities directly, rather than through an intermediary. As I previously cautioned, market participants should be aware that different tokenization structures may raise distinct regulatory considerations.<a class="ck-anchor" href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-121125-tokenization-trending-statement-division-trading-markets-no-action-letter-related-dtcs-development?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>I want to thank Director Jamie Selway and his staff in the Division of Trading and Markets for their diligent work on issuing this important no-action letter.</p>

<title>The Rubble And The Rebuild: The Future Of Financial Regulation Series At The Brookings Institute, SEC Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw, Washington D.C., Dec. 11, 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good morning and thank you Aaron [Klein].&nbsp; It is a pleasure to be here this morning.&nbsp; While this isn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;farewell address,&rdquo; I hope you will indulge me if I take the opportunity to reflect a little bit on what I&rsquo;ve learned, what we accomplished prior to this year, and provide commentary on where I think the markets are today and where I think they&nbsp;<em><span>should</span></em>&nbsp;<em><span>be</span></em>&nbsp;headed.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-future-financial-regulation-series-brookings-institute-121125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a></p>
<p class="text-align-center">***</p>
<p>The securities laws, as drafted, were designed to provide legal structure around an intricate system of market participants with different interests and different incentives.&nbsp; It has evolved over time, including through the passage of new statutes and rules, into a unique ecosystem of checks and balances.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-future-financial-regulation-series-brookings-institute-121125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2">[2]</a></p>
<p>This structure, which has accommodated growth in volume, speed, and complexity over the last 90 years, is far from perfect.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-future-financial-regulation-series-brookings-institute-121125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3">[3]</a>&nbsp; But, more or less, it has worked.&nbsp; If those who can afford to invest buy and hold plain vanilla diversified products based on investment advice that is provided in their best interest, those investors should get, and generally have gotten, more money out than they put in.&nbsp;And American businesses have successfully raised capital year-in and year-out.</p>
<p>Our job, at the SEC, is to ensure fairness and order, improve efficiency and effectiveness, and require appropriate transparency in the markets.&nbsp; We must do that carefully and with adherence to certain foundational principles, including, ideally, the belief that this is a system for everyone, and not for any special interest or market participant.&nbsp; The job of the SEC is a critical one.&nbsp; The agency must understand the interactions between all of the participants, while recognizing the interests and incentives of each of them, and ensure that the overall structure remains balanced and works for everyone.</p>
<p>Nearly five and half years ago, I had the privilege of testifying before the Senate for a hearing on my nomination.&nbsp; At that hearing, I explained who I wanted to be as a Commissioner.&nbsp; I said:</p>
<p>"I [] carry with me [today] the Stories of Soldiers, family, and friends who give the SEC&rsquo;s mission real meaning.&nbsp; As a Captain in the United State Army Reserve, Judge Advocate General Corps, that mission means making sure my fellow Soldiers have a fighting chance to secure the financial futures they deserve.&nbsp; As a sister of an entrepreneur, it means making sure our markets unite job-creating capital with individuals like my brother who recently started a small business developing 3D printing technology for military uses.&nbsp; [A]s a new mother, it means promoting the level playing field that will allow my family and millions of other American families, to fund the rising costs of education by safely and confidently investing in our markets.&nbsp; [As a Commissioner, I promise to] provide tools that allow individuals&hellip;to fund their retirements in safe and sustainable ways."</p>
<p>Those were some lofty goals!&nbsp; Whether I have been successful in pursuit of those goals, history will judge.&nbsp; But I can say proudly, today, that I never lost sight of why I took this job.</p>
<p>Over my tenure, the Commission has brought meaningful enforcement actions to recompense victims of fraud and wrongdoing, including soldiers and their families;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-future-financial-regulation-series-brookings-institute-121125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4">[4]</a>&nbsp;simplified disclosures;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-future-financial-regulation-series-brookings-institute-121125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5">[5]</a>&nbsp;made it harder for corporate insiders to rig the system to their benefit;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-future-financial-regulation-series-brookings-institute-121125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6">[6]</a>&nbsp;required disclosure of material information on executive compensation,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-future-financial-regulation-series-brookings-institute-121125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7">[7]</a>&nbsp;climate risk,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-future-financial-regulation-series-brookings-institute-121125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8">[8]</a>&nbsp;and cybersecurity risk;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-future-financial-regulation-series-brookings-institute-121125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9">[9]</a>&nbsp;and put in place restrictions designed to enhance the protection of customer information.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-future-financial-regulation-series-brookings-institute-121125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10">[10]</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, recently, my voice has become one of ubiquitous dissent.&nbsp; It has been unsettling to see how precipitously one Commission is willing to undo the work of the Commission that came before it&mdash;all without a single notice-and-comment rulemaking to date.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m concerned that the fundamental precepts upon which our markets have been built&mdash;tenets that have, by and large, kept our markets safe for both issuers and investors alike&mdash;are being eroded.&nbsp; I fear that the very core of our intricate market structure is under attack.&nbsp; And instead of safeguarding our markets for investors to fund their retirements in safe and sustainable ways, we are moving in a direction where markets start to look like casinos.&nbsp; The problem with casinos, of course, is that in the long run the house always wins.&nbsp; This approach flies in the face of the work I set out to do.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s how.</p>
<p class="text-align-center"><span>I.</span></p>
<p class="text-align-center"><span>The Rubble</span></p>
<p><em><span>Trend 1: Devaluing the Investor</span></em></p>
<p>First and foremost, we see a trend towards devaluing investor rights.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s pervasive and already worn deep.</p>
<p>For example, the Commission has made it harder for investors to communicate their preferences to issuer management;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-future-financial-regulation-series-brookings-institute-121125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11">[11]</a>&nbsp;it has shown outright hostility to investor proxy proposals;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-future-financial-regulation-series-brookings-institute-121125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12">[12]</a>&nbsp;and, we are dismantling private rights of action by allowing public issuers to force their shareholders into arbitration.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-future-financial-regulation-series-brookings-institute-121125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13">[13]</a></p>
<p>These actions seem fueled by the fictitious notion that we need to punish investors in order to revitalize public markets &ndash; or purportedly to &ldquo;make IPOs great again.&rdquo;&nbsp; But&nbsp;<em>IPOs can only be revitalized with investor money.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Treating investors as a nuisance is shortsighted at best.</p>
<p><em><span>Trend 2: Moving Into the Shadows</span></em></p>
<p>While part and parcel of the devaluation of investors, a separate and pervasive trend of this Commission is moving markets out of the light and into darkness.&nbsp; Intent on reducing industry&rsquo;s perceived burdens, this Commission is reducing transparency.&nbsp; For example, it has stated plans to reduce the cadence of public-issuer filings.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-future-financial-regulation-series-brookings-institute-121125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14">[14]</a>&nbsp; This means investors will have less access to timely financial information, including audited financial statements, less analysis from management, fewer disclosures about evolving risks, less analyst coverage, and it will be easier to smooth earnings shortfalls, among many other potential effects.&nbsp; Investment decisions will inevitably be based on either: (i) stale data, (ii) data voluntarily released by companies that lack uniformity (at best) or are cherry-picked (at worst); or (iii) on information other than company metrics, such as social media posts, promotions, hype, or even just &ldquo;vibes.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Commission has also made clear that it intends to roll back the universe of people who must register and what information must be disclosed.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-future-financial-regulation-series-brookings-institute-121125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15">[15]</a></p>
<p>Transparency is also important for ensuring our equity markets work fairly and efficiently. One of the great strengths of U.S. equity markets is the use of displayed bid and offer prices by exchanges, which we call &ldquo;lit trading.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lit trading matters because it provides an important and central public source of price transparency that can directly benefit investors.&nbsp; Displayed quotes are used for many purposes such as informing trading decisions, establishing security valuations, and performing index calculations.&nbsp; In addition, exchange trading is important for maintaining high investor protection standards since exchanges are subject to comprehensive regulation.</p>
<p>However, in recent years, there has been a shift in market activity away from &ldquo;lit trading&rdquo; on exchanges to dark markets.&nbsp; There is increasing evidence that this shift is &ldquo;obscuring the true prices of stocks, raising the cost of trading, and, by extension, damaging investor confidence.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-future-financial-regulation-series-brookings-institute-121125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16">[16]</a>&nbsp; For this reason, it is fundamentally important to support displayed liquidity and carefully consider any interventions that might impact transparency in our equity market structure&mdash;such as limiting or rescinding the Order Protection Rule, which the Commission seems poised to do.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-future-financial-regulation-series-brookings-institute-121125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17">[17]</a></p>
<p>The Commission has also been shrouding its policymaking in darkness, shunning public comments and, instead, relying on hidden voices to drive its agenda.&nbsp; In a mad dash to implement its policy preferences, the Commission, again and again, has implemented a new vision through staff statements<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-future-financial-regulation-series-brookings-institute-121125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18">[18]</a>&nbsp;and extensions of the compliance dates of Commission rules<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-future-financial-regulation-series-brookings-institute-121125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19">[19]</a>&nbsp;without deigning to ask investors what they think and what they want.&nbsp;This approach flouts notice-and-comment rulemaking requirements under the Administrative Procedure Act.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-future-financial-regulation-series-brookings-institute-121125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20">[20]</a>&nbsp; Moreover, it is a different approach than my colleagues advocated for when policies they did not favor were on the table.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-future-financial-regulation-series-brookings-institute-121125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21">[21]</a></p>
<p>What is lost when the Commission does not solicit public comment?&nbsp; Well, obviously, the Commission loses out on the benefit of the public flagging blind spots the Commission did not see.&nbsp; The public also loses the opportunity to identify the industry voices driving the policy decisions and to evaluate their motives.&nbsp; The public deserves to know who is really behind the policy choices that will impact their financial futures.&nbsp; Perhaps most perniciously, this retreat from public comment denigrates investors, sending the clear message that the Commission does not value their perspectives and that it knows better than investors do what is best for them.&nbsp; The Commission&rsquo;s approach to nontransparent policymaking has treated investors like silly children to be ignored rather than fully formed persons with ideas and concerns worth hearing and considering.&nbsp;Investors deserve better.</p>
<p><em><span>Trend 3:&nbsp; Pushing Main Street Investors into Private Markets Without Protections.</span></em></p>
<p>This brings me to another trend.&nbsp; The Commission is opening the private markets to Main Street investors&rsquo; pockets, including their retirement assets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-future-financial-regulation-series-brookings-institute-121125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn22">[22]</a>&nbsp; This is a harmful policy choice&mdash;and not just because it undermines the safer, more transparent, and more efficient public markets.&nbsp; The private markets expose retail investors to more risky investments&mdash;ones that were specifically crafted for non-retail investors.&nbsp; To justify this irresponsible departure from foundational pillars of the securities laws, my colleagues use lots of buzz words&mdash;freedom, diversification,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-future-financial-regulation-series-brookings-institute-121125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn23">[23]</a>&nbsp;democratization.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-future-financial-regulation-series-brookings-institute-121125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn24">[24]</a>&nbsp; Call it what you will, at bottom it&rsquo;s risky and it&rsquo;s reckless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private markets do not offer the same guardrails that make our public markets a level playing field for retail investors.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-future-financial-regulation-series-brookings-institute-121125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn25">[25]</a>&nbsp; There&rsquo;s limited transparency.&nbsp; Investors don&rsquo;t get the same standardized disclosures as in the public markets; the Commission does not have the same tools to detect fraud or other wrongdoing before it happens; investors are kept in the dark about certain fees and expenses; and valuations are opaque and inconsistent.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-future-financial-regulation-series-brookings-institute-121125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn26">[26]</a>&nbsp; In the private markets, smaller investors almost certainly will be subject to higher fees (and, therefore, lower returns) than large investors with the power to negotiate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unleashing the private markets&rsquo; insatiable hunger for capital on retail investors&rsquo; wallets will come back to bite regulators&mdash;but not before Main Street Americans&rsquo; savings have been looted.</p>
<p><em><span>Trend 4: Deterrence?&nbsp;What is That?</span></em></p>
<p>As the Commission dismisses investors, reduces transparency, and sends retail into the private markets wilderness, it cedes important tools: Its enforcement tools.&nbsp; We see this in multiple ways:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The Commission has dismissed SEC enforcement actions left and right, undermining the credibility of our lawyers and the agency overall;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-future-financial-regulation-series-brookings-institute-121125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn27">[27]</a></li>

<li>As I mentioned earlier, the Commission has given permission to issuers to enforce mandatory arbitration provisions against their shareholders, meaning (i) less private enforcement of the law, and (ii) confidentiality provisions that will keep corporate wrongdoing out of the public eye.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-future-financial-regulation-series-brookings-institute-121125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn33">[33]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Deterring misconduct is a public good.&nbsp; Without deterrence, there is no accountability.&nbsp;Corporate actors comply with the rules because failing to do so, under normal circumstances, is costly.&nbsp; When we remove the tools that detect fraud and we make it less costly to commit fraud, people will commit more fraud.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s that simple.</p>
<p class="text-align-center"><span>***</span></p>
<p>Taken together, these trends embody a sort of chaos that I think has characterized the past year.&nbsp; The appetite to deregulate has been rapacious; the analysis of the costs and benefits of our policies has been non-existent; and, the repercussions, I would argue, could be dire.&nbsp; We live in an echo chamber where politicians and policymakers make their own truth through repetition.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-future-financial-regulation-series-brookings-institute-121125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn34">[34]</a>&nbsp; But, the markets have a way of correcting themselves&mdash;not always immediately, but over time.&nbsp; So, I think the true advisability of these policies will reveal themselves eventually.&nbsp;I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t be alone in analogizing the trend toward deregulation in the current environment to the period prior to the stock market crash in 1929.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-future-financial-regulation-series-brookings-institute-121125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn35">[35]</a></p>
<p>And our ability to understand and respond to market events of all kinds is only as good as our best resource: the staff.&nbsp; Staff numbers across the board are down by between 15-20 percent.&nbsp; I cannot overemphasize how harmful the overnight loss of decades of institutional knowledge and securities expertise has been to our agency generally, and how significantly it will impair our ability to respond nimbly in times of tumult.&nbsp; We have lost experts of all stripes who have weathered past market events; brought reform from calamity; guided recovery efforts; and have instituted protections that decrease the risk that similar disasters might happen again.</p>
<p>Of late, we have frequently been told that today is a &ldquo;new day&rdquo; at the Commission.&nbsp; But anyone aware of our place in the calendar knows that with each successive day the nights grow longer.&nbsp; I fear that the darkest depths of winter still lie ahead for America&rsquo;s capital markets.</p>
<p class="text-align-center"><span>II.</span></p>
<p class="text-align-center"><span>The Rebuild</span></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the doom and gloom part of the speech.&nbsp; But out of the rubble I believe we can find opportunity.&nbsp; Clarity.&nbsp;Purpose.&nbsp; I believe we will have the chance to rebuild and we will rebuild it better than before.&nbsp; And, of course, I&rsquo;m here at Brookings, so I need to bring some big ideas.&nbsp; I challenge each of you to envision, debate, and, importantly, build consensus around those ideas so the best of them can be implemented when the time comes.</p>
<p>I think the big question we will likely have to answer is: how do we make our markets work for the American people?&nbsp; The government is responding to&nbsp;<em><span>big industry&rsquo;s</span></em>&nbsp;wish list at the moment,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-future-financial-regulation-series-brookings-institute-121125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn36">[36]</a>&nbsp;but&nbsp;our focus should be on everyday Americans.</p>
<p><em><span>First</span></em>, let&rsquo;s return to market fundamentals.&nbsp; We need to promote policies that encourage trading based on actual fundamentals: issuer operations, cash flows and real financial metrics of companies, not on tweets.&nbsp; Policies should favor long-term buy-and-hold investing.&nbsp; People invest in crypto because they see (some) others get rich overnight.&nbsp; Less visible are the more common stories of people losing their shirts.</p>
<p>One thing that has consistently puzzled me about crypto is &ndash; what are cryptocurrency prices based on?&nbsp; Many (but not all) crypto purchasers are&nbsp;<em><span>not</span></em>&nbsp;trading based on economic fundamentals.&nbsp; I think it&rsquo;s safe to say they&rsquo;re speculating, reacting to hysteria from promoters, feeding a desire to gamble, wash trading to push up prices, or as one Nobel laureate has posited &ndash; betting on the popularity of the politicians who support, or stand to benefit personally from, the success of crypto.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-future-financial-regulation-series-brookings-institute-121125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn37">[37]</a>&nbsp; Regardless of asset class, our legal framework &ndash; including our tax framework (I&rsquo;m looking at you, Congress) &ndash; must promote long-term investing based on sound economic principles.</p>
<p><em><span>Second</span></em>, government should be more nimble and interdisciplinary.&nbsp; The world looks very different than it did when our financial agencies were created.&nbsp; We may have to reimagine financial regulatory agency structure or at least come up with a framework for real collaboration that looks different than today.&nbsp; Does it make sense that some lending is overseen by banking regulators and some lending is overseen by the SEC?&nbsp; And all the while neither regulator has real insight into how exposed our banks are to private credit?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-future-financial-regulation-series-brookings-institute-121125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn38">[38]</a>&nbsp; Does it make sense that commodity-based swaps are regulated by the CFTC and security-based swaps to be regulated by the SEC?&nbsp; Do these products look sufficiently different to require different regulatory regimes?</p>
<p>And, Congress may have to ask normative questions about the way the economy is structured.&nbsp; Private equity is buying up single family homes, healthcare, and even the very accounting firms that may be signing off on the financial health of their portfolio companies.&nbsp; We need to look carefully at whether more robust guardrails are needed around these practices.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span>Third</span></em>, we must confront the changing face of the American economy. Artificial Intelligence is here.&nbsp; It might well upend the labor force.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-future-financial-regulation-series-brookings-institute-121125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn39">[39]</a>&nbsp; We need to revisit our rulebook with AI in mind.&nbsp; For example, many of our securities laws require evidence of bad intent to prove a violation.&nbsp; But how will we prove intent if no human is involved?&nbsp; And, what are the real risks involving the use of AI by issuers and intermediaries that investors should know about?&nbsp; Is shifting compliance obligations to AI tools resulting in appropriate internal reviews?&nbsp; We will need to build a more rigorous scaffolding around the markets to address AI.</p>
<p><em><span>Fourth</span></em>, let&rsquo;s pursue policies that actually promote our small businesses.&nbsp; We should be a resource to them as they seek to raise capital, by helping them understand our disclosure regimes and helping them get information to investors about their businesses.&nbsp; And let us reimagine our exemptions from public company registration, including Regulation D, which has effectively become an economic subsidy for large private issuers, to the disadvantage of our small businesses.&nbsp; We should revisit this. Let&rsquo;s take a look at what small really means, not just reflexively provide loopholes and exemptions and rollbacks for larger and larger businesses.</p>
<p>And&nbsp;<em><span>finally</span></em>, let us govern with ethics and meaning.&nbsp; Let us respect and support our public servants, not punish them.&nbsp; Let us give regulators the tools they need to oversee markets in a meaningful way and to help prevent the all-to-predictable mistakes of the past from repeating themselves.</p>
<p>Let us rebuild with the purpose of ensuring that the American economy works for everybody, not just those able to buy political influence&mdash;so my fellow Soldiers have a fighting chance to secure the financial futures they deserve; so our markets unite job-creating capital with small business owners like my brother; so families can fund the rising costs of education; and, so Americans can fund their retirements in safe and sustainable ways.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Following a comprehensive review by the boards of directors of the regional Reserve Banks, and the unanimous concurrence of Federal Reserve Board members, the Federal Reserve on Thursday announced the reappointment of Federal Reserve Bank presidents and first vice presidents.</p>
<p>By law, all Reserve Bank presidents and first vice presidents serve five-year terms, with each of the current terms expiring on February 28, 2026. In December 2024, the board of directors of each Reserve Bank, representing a wide range of business and community leaders across each district, started a process to assess their president and first vice president across several performance dimensions. Those factors included:</p>
<ul>
<li>The president's active engagement with the local business, financial, and non-profit communities within the district;</li>
<li>Their effectiveness as the chief executive officer of the Reserve Bank, including developing and implementing the Bank's strategy and leading its staff; and</li>
<li>Their leadership contributions to the Federal Reserve System as a whole, notably in supporting coordinated System functions and activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>First vice presidents were largely evaluated in their role as the chief operating officer of each Reserve Bank, with a focus on their management of both local Reserve Bank operations and Federal Reserve System initiatives.</p>
<p>In preparing its overall assessment of each president and first vice president, each board of directors solicited input from a range of parties, including civic and industry leaders in each district. As a final step in the process, the Federal Reserve Board considered the evaluation by the board of directors.</p>

<title>SIFMA Applauds U.S. House Passage Of The INVEST Act</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sifma-applauds-us-house-passage-of-the-invest-act-20251211/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sifma-applauds-us-house-passage-of-the-invest-act-20251211/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>SIFMA today praised the U.S. House of Representatives for passing the bipartisan INVEST Act, comprehensive legislation that modernizes elements of U.S. securities laws.</p>
<p>&ldquo;SIFMA applauds the House for passing the INVEST Act and taking an important step to ensure that our securities laws evolve alongside today&rsquo;s dynamic markets,&rdquo; Kenneth E. Bentsen, Jr., SIFMA President and CEO.&nbsp; &ldquo;We appreciate the bipartisan leadership of the House Financial Services Committee and House leadership in advancing commonsense, market-enhancing reforms that promote access, growth, and innovation across the U.S. capital markets. We look forward to continuing to work with Congress and regulators to further strengthen our markets and protect investors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>SIFMA has long supported efforts to responsibly broaden opportunities for retail and sophisticated investors, strengthen entrepreneurial financing options, and sustain the competitiveness of U.S. markets.</p>
<p>The INVEST Act includes provisions that would:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modernize e-delivery rules while preserving paper delivery options</li>
<li>Provide retirement plan parity for 403(b) plans by permitting investment in CITs and insurance separate accounts</li>
<li>Expand pathways to qualify as accredited investors based on professional expertise or SEC-created examinations</li>
<li>Enhance investor protection through a Senior Investor Taskforce at the SEC</li>
<li>Support IPO activity and public-company entry through JOBS Act-style provisions</li>
<li>Expand eligibility for Well-Known Seasoned Issuers (WKSIs) to strengthen public capital markets</li>
</ul>
<p>These reforms further the objectives first advanced by the JOBS Act of 2012 and reflect a continued bipartisan commitment to efficient, competitive, and innovative U.S. capital markets.</p>
<p>SIFMA submitted a letter of support earlier this week that expands on these views and can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sifma.org/advocacy/letters/the-invest-act">here</a>.</p>

<title>Canadian Securities Administrators And Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization Provide Guidance For Finfluencers And Firms On How To Work With Them And Protect Investors</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/canadian-securities-administrators-and-canadian-investment-regulatory-organizati-20251211/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/canadian-securities-administrators-and-canadian-investment-regulatory-organizati-20251211/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) and Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) have released&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asc.ca/-/media/ASC-Documents-part-1/Regulatory-Instruments/2025/12/6258759-CSA-CIRO-Notice-31-369-Finfluencer.pdf">new guidance for financial content creators or influencers</a>, known as &ldquo;finfluencers.&rdquo; The guidance aims to help them and the firms they work with understand and follow securities laws when posting information about investing online.</p>
<p>Social media is increasingly a source of financial information for Canadians with finfluencers playing a role in shaping these conversations. Some finfluencers&rsquo; activities can introduce new risks to investors. The CSA and CIRO want to help those creating content and posting about investing to do so transparently, honestly and legally, including identifying conflicts of interest. The guidance in the staff notice offers concrete examples of how both registrants and finfluencers can understand and be compliant with the requirements set out by securities regulators.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finfluencers can have an impact on how people make investment decisions, and this comes with substantial responsibilities,&rdquo; said Stan Magidson, CSA Chair and Chair and CEO of the Alberta Securities Commission. &ldquo;This guidance helps content creators protect themselves and their followers by making sure their content complies with securities laws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Social media is changing how Canadians learn about investing, and that brings new risks,&rdquo; said Andrew Kriegler, CIRO President and CEO. &ldquo;We want finfluencers to understand that compliance isn&rsquo;t just about rules, it&rsquo;s about protecting your reputation and your audience. Requiring finfluencers to follow this guidance helps investors make better, safer financial decisions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The CSA and CIRO expect finfluencers, as well as registrants and issuers who work with finfluencers, to become familiar with and follow the rules set out in the guidance. Breaking securities laws can lead to serious penalties and other enforcement actions.</p>
<p>The CSA, the council of the securities regulators of Canada&rsquo;s provinces and territories, coordinates and harmonizes regulation for the Canadian capital markets.</p>
<p>The Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) is the pan-Canadian self-regulatory organization that oversees all investment dealers, mutual fund dealers and trading activity on Canada&rsquo;s debt and equity marketplaces. CIRO is committed to the protection of investors, providing efficient and consistent regulation, and building Canadians&rsquo; trust in financial regulation and the people managing their investments.

<title>Canadian Securities Regulators’ New Capability Disarms More Than 3,900 Fraudulent Investment Websites</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) in collaboration with the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) today announced initial results from its newly launched initiative to help combat the rising number of fraudulent websites that pose a threat to Canadian investors.</p>
<p>Between June 5, 2025, and November 23, 2025, regulators worked to successfully deactivate more than 3,900 fake investment platforms and cryptocurrency scam websites involving more than 6,900 individual URLs associated with those sites.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aided by advancements in technology, the number of scam investment websites has grown significantly in recent years and this initiative is part of the CSA&rsquo;s broader strategy to combat online financial fraud and enhance investor protection in the digital age,&rdquo; said Stan Magidson, CSA Chair and Chair and CEO of the Alberta Securities Commission. &ldquo;Proactive investor protection is a cornerstone of our mandate, and this innovative solution supports our efforts to better protect Canadians from investment fraud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The success of this initial phase shows that this technology can make a real difference, and the results show the impact it is already having,&rdquo; said Grant Vingoe, Chair of the CSA&rsquo;s Policy Coordination Committee and CEO of the Ontario Securities Commission, which led the procurement and testing of the capability on behalf of the CSA and CIRO. &ldquo;By identifying fraudulent websites quickly, we are taking meaningful steps to safeguard Canadians&rsquo; financial futures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the new initiative results in the rapid deactivation of many problematic websites, Canadians are encouraged to report any websites they have concerns about to their local securities regulator.</p>
<p>The CSA continues to urge investors to remain vigilant and to look out for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/investor-tools/avoiding-fraud/redflags/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">common red flags of investment fraud</a>, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The involvement of unregistered individuals or firms.</li>
<li>Promises of high or guaranteed returns on low-risk investments.</li>
<li>Unsolicited advice or requests to access your devices from strangers.</li>
<li>Feeling pressured into making a decision on the spot.</li>
<li>Fake endorsement involving a celebrity, athlete or politician on social media.</li>
<li>Requests for money when attempting to withdraw funds.</li>
<li>Fraud recovery companies that promise to get back lost funds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Investors are reminded that investment firms need to register with provincial or territorial securities regulators as dealers or advisers to open trading accounts or recommend investments. Investors should always check the registration of anyone who tries to sell them an investment or give them investment advice with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/investor-tools/are-they-registered/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CSA&rsquo;s National Registration Search</a>. Further resources on how to identify and avoid fraud can be found on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/investor-tools/avoiding-fraud/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CSA&rsquo;s website</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Suspect you or someone you know is a victim of an investment scam?</strong></p>
<p>If you feel like you or someone you know has been approached or is a victim of fraudulent investment,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/about/contact-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">contact your local securities regulator</a>.</p>

<title>Testimony Of FIA Board Chair Alicia Crighton - US House Committee On Agriculture - CFTC Reauthorization: Stakeholder Perspectives, 11 December 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Chairman Thompson, Ranking Member Craig, and Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify. I am the head of the global clearing business for Goldman Sachs and the co-head of its global futures business. I am testifying as Chair of the Futures Industry Association (FIA), the leading global trade organization for the futures, options and centrally cleared derivatives markets.</span><br /><br /><span>There is tremendous change facing the cleared derivatives markets today, especially when compared to 2008 when the CFTC was last reauthorized. FIA strongly supports the reauthorization of the CFTC, as it reinforces the agency&rsquo;s mission and central role in safeguarding markets critical to the global economy. I&rsquo;ve had the privilege of interacting extensively with the Commission over many years, through FIA, on behalf of Goldman Sachs and as Chair of the CFTC&rsquo;s Market Risk Advisory Committee and believe that with adequate resources it is well suited for the challenges ahead.</span><br /><br /><span>As the Committee undertakes this process, I appreciate the opportunity to highlight important recommendations that we hope the Committee and the Commission will consider.</span><br /><br /><strong>The Role of Futures Commission Merchants (FCMs)</strong><br /><br /><span>First, I will provide the Committee with an overview of the important role clearing members, or Futures Commission Merchants (FCMs), play in global derivatives markets. Through their connectivity to exchanges and clearinghouses around the world, clearing members provide customers, including agricultural and energy end users, with access to global markets to manage the risks of their operations. For example, many FIA members participate in clearinghouses across dozens of jurisdictions to ensure their clients can transact in any region in which they do business.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>Clearing members are intermediaries, which means they stand between an end user and the clearinghouse, and act as the first and the last line of defense in fostering stability in cleared derivatives markets. These intermediaries act as a first line of defense by underwriting the risk of a client&rsquo;s portfolio before it ever reaches the clearinghouse and monitoring that risk on an ongoing basis. This includes determining the appropriateness and suitability of leveraged products, monitoring clients for money laundering and other risks to market integrity, collecting and safeguarding customer margin, and guaranteeing the performance of clients to the clearinghouse.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>Perhaps less known is that clearing members are also the last line of defense, in the sense that they contribute substantially all the financial resources in the default funds that backstop the clearinghouses. These default funds are rarely used, but they are essential for absorbing losses in the event of a major market disruption or a default by a market participant and preventing those losses from cascading into a financial crisis.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>Looking at just the five derivatives clearinghouses that operate in the US, we can see that clearing members contributed $35.7 billion to their default funds as of June 2025, the most recent data available. That was equivalent to 98.5% of all the money in those default funds. If we include three other major international clearinghouses that are highly important to end users in the US, namely Eurex, ICE Clear Europe and LCH Ltd, we see the same picture. As of June 2025, clearing members contributed $61 billion in total to this group of eight clearinghouses, equivalent to 98.4% of the total amounts in those default funds.</span><br /><br /><span>Clearing members also hold a significant amount of regulatory capital, which serves as an additional layer of protection to the system that helps ensure clearing members themselves can withstand a severe market disruption. The total amount of capital held by the clearing members regulated by the CFTC was $169 billion as of September 2025. &nbsp;</span><br /><span>Together, these financial resources reduce the risk that a major market event or default creates wider market contagion, which can put financial markets and customer assets at risk.</span><br /><br /><em>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://email.fia.org/c/1aa7TNlOQJuEeqscWGQBRzWOvF3GOX" target="_blank">FIA CCP Tracker</a>. Data as of June 2025</em><br /><br /><span>We support innovation and believe there is tremendous potential in technology to benefit all market participants. &nbsp;We also believe there are valuable and time-tested risk management traits of our current market structure that can play an important role in the integration of traditional and novel products and platforms. &nbsp;Ensuring risk management goes hand in hand with innovation will ensure the broadest participation across both retail, end users and institutional investors, and the issues I&rsquo;d like to raise today are to that end.</span><br /><br /><strong>Regulated and well capitalized intermediaries play an essential role in protecting customers and the stability of the market ecosystem&nbsp;</strong><br /><br /><span>First, many of the safeguards that exist in the markets today are &ldquo;behind the scenes&rdquo; but critical to customer protections and market stability. Futures Commission Merchants (FCMs) are risk managers that play a central role in ensuring the resiliency of the clearing system and preventing losses from triggering a domino effect that can threaten the stability of the markets. Like regulated exchanges and clearinghouses, well capitalized FCMs are a key component of the regulatory architecture that have served the derivatives markets well. FCMs are CFTC regulated intermediaries that stand between end users and the clearinghouses by guaranteeing the performance of clients to the clearinghouse. &nbsp;In addition, FCMs safeguard customer assets, monitor for money laundering and other risks to market integrity and provide substantially all the financial resources in the default funds that backstop the clearinghouses.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>To the degree trading platforms offer direct access models where participants can access the exchange or clearinghouse directly, the CFTC should consider whether the regulatory environment may also need to evolve to sufficiently safeguard markets and market participants. This will be especially important as retail investors are provided direct clearing access on a leveraged basis.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><strong>Stable, robust margin levels and a well-calibrated capital regime will support access to global markets for end users and investors</strong><br /><br /><span>In 2023, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, I testified before this Committee regarding volatility in the commodity derivative markets and how end users can be better prepared to weather market turbulence. I also spoke to the fact that end users are finding it harder to secure and sustain capacity from their FCMs to clear the full extent of their trading volume. I suggested two solutions at that time that remain necessary today: adequate clearinghouse margin levels and a well-calibrated bank capital regime.</span><br /><br /><span>Clearinghouses collect &ldquo;margin&rdquo; for the futures contracts that energy and agricultural producers use to hedge against fluctuations in energy and food prices. Margin is the capital collected in conjunction with those contracts to protect against default. In 2023, I highlighted how important it is to ensure margin levels are robust and stable over time so that end users, such as ranchers and farmers, are not exposed to dramatic spikes in their margin payments during market volatility, which in turn helps ensure consumer prices remain stable. Additionally, inadequate margin level requirements present risks that are absorbed by FCMs &ndash; both because of the immense financial resources that FCMs bring to bear in supporting the resilience of the clearing system and because FCMs often cover margin shortfalls through margin add-ons that clearinghouses call from them. &nbsp;Margin adequacy is therefore closely tied to the amount of clearing capacity that clearing members can make available for end users. Despite the consensus that emerged in recommendations to address margin adequacy by the CFTC&rsquo;s Market Risk Advisory Committee in 2021, there has been little progress. We believe the CFTC can do more to ensure the adequacy of clearinghouse margin models to reduce the negative effects of market volatility on end users and increase their access to clearing.</span><br /><br /><span>Lastly, bank capital rules dictate the amount of capital clearing members must hold. Despite an intentional regulatory push towards clearing, the previously proposed Basel III Endgame capital rule took a punitive approach that would further limit clearing members&rsquo; ability to provide capacity to the markets. The proposed approach was also punitive relative to the international standards, placing US banks at a competitive disadvantage in providing clearing services. A re-proposal of Basel III Endgame is expected early next year and provides an opportunity to ensure that the bank capital regime is appropriately calibrated to help support the expansion of clearing, rather than to constrain capacity as we see today.</span><br /><br /><strong>As more retail leveraged transactions enter CFTC markets, Congress should consider safeguards for institutional investors and hedgers&nbsp;</strong><br /><br /><span>Perhaps one of the most notable changes in the CFTC&rsquo;s mission over the last 20 years is that it may now oversee significantly more leveraged retail investor trading volumes than ever before. FIA supports efforts underway by Congress to clarify and strengthen the CFTC&rsquo;s authority over digital commodities to help ensure retail investors are protected.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>A unique aspect of the derivatives ecosystem is that in the event a clearing member defaults, losses are mutually shared by the remaining clearing members in what is known as default fund loss mutualization. With the increase in leveraged retail transactions, clearing members representing institutional end users will now participate in the same default fund as retail investors. FIA recommends that Congress consider authorizing the CFTC to issue rules or guidance to require that financial resources that would be used to manage the default involving leveraged retail transactions be segregated from other default resources in the clearinghouse. Such separation could mitigate systemic risk concerns and prevent contagion from spreading between retail investors trading novel products and end users and other traditional market participants accessing the markets for hedging purposes.</span><br /><br /><strong>Portfolio margining incentivizes hedging, promotes market liquidity and fosters greater coordination between CFTC and SEC</strong><br /><br /><span>Next, FIA supports provisions in the CLARITY Act intended to ensure risk offsets are recognized across both traditional and digital asset products that span CFTC and SEC jurisdiction in both the margin and bank capital framework. Recognizing such offsets will incentivize hedging activity while promoting harmonization between the CFTC and SEC.</span><br /><br /><strong>Addressing conflicts of interest in vertically integrated models is important to uphold market integrity, protect market stability and instill confidence in US markets&nbsp;</strong><br /><br /><span>Similarly, FIA supports provisions in the CLARITY Act to authorize the CFTC to carry out a rulemaking to mitigate potential conflicts of interest for vertically integrated market participants and ensure retail investors remain protected. In recent years, there has been a distinct trend in derivatives and spot digital asset markets toward vertically integrated business models. For example, while the futures markets are accustomed to exchanges and clearinghouses under common ownership, many new models are structured to extend the &ldquo;vertical&rdquo; to include FCMs and other intermediaries. Further, as envisioned by the CLARITY Act, these verticals may grow with the addition of &ldquo;digital commodity&rdquo; exchanges and intermediaries that will be registered with the CFTC to provide services in spot cryptocurrency markets. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>These new models may increase the potential &ndash; both in practice and perception -- of substantial conflicts of interest across the mix of commercial objectives, regulatory responsibilities and risk management processes under one roof. Rulemaking should establish requirements for the identification, mitigation, and resolution of conflicts of interest as they may arise in the context of vertically integrated market structures.</span><br /><br /><strong>The &ldquo;Griffin Fix&rdquo; will strengthen customer protections in bankruptcy&nbsp;</strong><br /><br /><span>A key measure that has been consistently considered in previous reauthorization bills and passed out of both the House and Senate Agriculture Committees with bipartisan support is the "Griffin fix.&rdquo; FIA supports inclusion of the Griffin fix as it is designed to strengthen customer protections in bankruptcy proceedings involving FCMs by providing legislative certainty for the CFTC&rsquo;s rulemaking authority to ensure customers have priority if there is a shortfall in segregated funds. FIA believes there is broad stakeholder support for this provision, which benefits FCM customers including farmers, ranchers, energy producers, and other end users.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><strong>Conclusion</strong><br /><br /><span>FIA greatly appreciates the Committee&rsquo;s interest in these topics that affect global derivatives markets. It is an honor to be with you today and I look forward to answering your questions.&nbsp;</span></p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority: Millions Of People Set To Get Extra Help With Investments And Pensions Decisions</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-millions-of-people-set-to-get-extra-help-with-in-20251211/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-millions-of-people-set-to-get-extra-help-with-in-20251211/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Over the next decade at least 18 million people could be offered extra help with their investments and pensions with the introduction of targeted support by the FCA.</p>
<p>The ground-breaking new service will allow firms to make specific suggestions to consumers &ndash; so they can make better informed decisions about what to do with their money.</p>
<p>The need for greater support is stark. According to the latest FCA data, there were around 7 million adults in the UK with &pound;10,000 or more in cash savings who could be missing out on the benefits of investing throughout their lives. Fewer than 1 in 10 people obtain regulated financial advice. However, nearly 1 in 5 investors turn to social media for help making decisions.</p>
<p>Sarah Pritchard, deputy chief executive of the FCA, said:&nbsp;</p>
<p>'Targeted support will be gamechanging. It means millions of people can get extra help to make better financial decisions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>'We also hope it will build greater confidence to invest. While investing will not be right for everyone, we know people in the UK invest less compared to the EU or US. People in the UK could be missing out on the potential benefits of investing in the medium to long term.'</p>
<h2>What can people expect with targeted support?</h2>
<p>Targeted support is a flexible and futureproof framework underpinned by the Consumer Duty. It will enable firms to innovate and better support their customers.</p>
<p>Consumers will receive recommendations, but they will not be based on a full, in-depth individual assessment. Firms will need to make sure the recommendations are suitable and should only be offered when it puts consumers in a better position. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier this week we finalised changes to the way that firms disclose information to consumers through new rules for retail disclosures (CCIs) to further support people making better informed decisions.</p>
<p>The FCA is also consulting on ways to further modernise pension rules, including projections and non-advised defined contribution transfers to strengthen consumer protection as part of wider government and regulatory reforms.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>

<li>We plan to open the gateway for applications in March 2026, before the new rules come into effect. New legislation will have to be passed by the Government before targeted support goes live.</li>
<li>We are already helping firms to prepare for the gateway opening through our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/authorisation/pre-application-support-service" title="Pre-application support service">pre-application support service</a>.

These support firms in offering targeted support by clarifying the approach to consumer complaints and redress, and how to consider existing direct marketing rules such as Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR).</li>
<li>Over half (54%) of those who have &pound;10,000 in cash savings &ndash; but who are not advised &ndash; say they have not really thought about investing or had not thought about this at all. &nbsp;</li>
<li>We know that many consumers who could invest but don&rsquo;t, say that this is because they don&rsquo;t know enough, they feel overwhelmed or they need more support.</li>
<li>Consumers find decision-making on pensions difficult. Three out of 4 (75%) of defined-contribution (DC) pension-holders, aged 45 or over, do not have a clear plan for how to take their money. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Only 1 in 5 (22%) of DC pension holders aged 45 or over say they have a good understanding of their pension access options.</li>
<li>Web copy has been updated to clarify that nearly 1 in 5 investors used social for research or to keep up to date with investments.</li>

<title>Decision By The Nasdaq Stockholm Disciplinary Committee Regarding Acenta Group AB</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The Disciplinary Committee of Nasdaq Stockholm (the &ldquo;Exchange&rdquo;) has found that Acenta Group AB (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) has breached the rules of Nasdaq First North Growth Market (the &ldquo;Rulebook&rdquo;) and therefore ordered the Company to pay a fine of six annual fees, corresponding to an amount of SEK 750,000.</span></p>
<p>The Disciplinary Committee has determined that the Company, on two occasions, violated Article 17 of the EU Market Abuse Regulation (&ldquo;MAR&rdquo;) by failing to disclose inside information in the correct manner.</p>
<p>On April 8, 2025, the Company announced that it had entered into a loan agreement and stated that the loan was subject to market terms. Given the Company&rsquo;s financial position, the Committee considers that the interest rate was of such significance that information about the rate was necessary to enable a complete and accurate assessment of the information regarding the loan.</p>
<p>On July 25, 2025, the Company announced that it had entered into another loan agreement. The Committee finds that the press release did not allow for a complete and accurate assessment because it lacked information about the interest rate for the loan as well as details regarding share issues addressed in the loan agreement.</p>
<p>The Committee considers these breaches to be serious and therefore imposes a sanction. The penalty is set at six annual fees.</p>
<p>The Disciplinary Committee&rsquo;s decision is available at:</p>
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.nasdaq.com/market-regulation/nordic/stockholm/disciplinary/decisions-sanctions" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.nasdaq.com/market-regulation/nordic/stockholm/disciplinary/decisions-sanctions</a></p>
<p><strong>About the Disciplinary Committee</strong></p>
<p>The role of Nasdaq Stockholm&rsquo;s Disciplinary Committee is to consider suspicions regarding whether Exchange Members or listed companies have breached the rules and regulations applying on the Exchange. If the Exchange suspects that a member or company has acted in breach of the rules, the matter is referred to the Disciplinary Committee. Nasdaq Stockholm investigates the suspicions and pursues the matter and the Disciplinary Committee issues a ruling regarding possible sanctions. The sanctions possible for listed companies are a warning, a fine or delisting. The sanctions possible for Exchange Members are a warning, a fine or debarment. Fines paid are not included in the Exchange&rsquo;s business but are attributed to a foundation supporting research in the securities market. The Disciplinary Committee's Chairman and Deputy Chairman must be lawyers with experience of serving as judges. At least two of the other members of the Committee must have in-depth insight into the workings of the securities market.</p>
<p>Members: Former Supreme Court Justice Marianne Lundius (Chairman), Supreme Court Justice Petter&nbsp;<span>Asp (Deputy Chairman), Supreme Court Justice Johan Danelius (Deputy Chairman), Company Director Anders Oscarsson, Company Director Joakim Strid, Lawyer Wilhelm L&uuml;ning, Lawyer Patrik Marcelius, Lawyer Erik Sj&ouml;man, MBA Carl Johan H&ouml;gbom, Authorized Public Accountant Magnus Svensson Henryson, Former Authorized Public Accountant Svante Forsberg, Lawyer Magnus Lindstedt and director Kristina Schauman.</span></p>

<title>Decision By The Nasdaq Stockholm Disciplinary Committee Regarding Mashup Ireland AB</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Disciplinary Committee of Nasdaq Stockholm (the &ldquo;Exchange&rdquo;) has found that Mashup Ireland AB (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) has breached the rules of Nasdaq First North Growth Market (the &ldquo;Rulebook&rdquo;) and therefore ordered the Company to pay a fine of 15 annual fees, corresponding to an amount of SEK 1,875,000.</p>
<p>It was undisputed in the matter that the Company had violated the Rulebook in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Company did not publish its annual report for 2024 or convene the annual general meeting in time.</li>
<li>The Company published its interim report for the first half of 2025 too late.</li>
<li>The Company&rsquo;s website has not been accessible to investors in Sweden, despite repeated reminders from the Company&rsquo;s Certified Adviser.</li>
<li>The Company delayed six days in responding to questions from the Exchange&rsquo;s issuer surveillance regarding the Company&rsquo;s working capital situation.</li>
<li>By failing to respond to emails and calls from its Certified Adviser over a two-month period, the Company prevented its Certified Adviser from fulfilling its obligations under the Rulebook.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Disciplinary Committee considers these breaches to be very serious. Given that the Exchange has not requested the Company&rsquo;s delisting, the Committee finds that no sanction other than the maximum number of annual fees can be considered. The Committee sets the fine at fifteen annual fees.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul>
<li class="spanHeading"><span>Combined report reviewing issuers&rsquo; annual reports, as well as corporate governance and environmental, social and governance practices to facilitate issuers in discharging their reporting obligations and enhancing governance</span></li>
<li class="spanHeading"><span>Findings show high compliance rate and continuous improvement in reporting and governance practices &nbsp;</span></li>
<li class="spanHeading"><span>Newly launched AI-based platform, the Annual Report Explorer, to assist issuers in preparing annual reports</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="spanHeading">The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (Exchange), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX), is pleased to present today (Thursday) a report (Report) on the findings and recommendations of its annual review of issuers&rsquo; annual reports, as well as issuers&rsquo; corporate governance (CG), and environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices<span class="spanHeading">1</span>&nbsp;for the 2024 financial year.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">The reviews are published in a combined report with the aim of providing issuers with a single point of reference to facilitate them in discharging their reporting obligations and enhancing governance.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">In reviewing the annual reports, the Exchange assessed issuers&rsquo; compliance with the specific disclosure requirements under the Listing Rules (Rules) with the assistance of artificial intelligence (AI) technology. A thematic approach was used to review specific areas, including financial statements with auditors&rsquo; modified opinions, management discussion and analysis, and financial disclosure under prevailing requirements (including accounting standards). The review of issuers&rsquo; CG practices focused on board gender diversity, tenure of independent non-executive directors (INEDs) and overboarding of INEDs. The ESG report review analysed issuers&rsquo; readiness to adopt the new climate requirements that have come into effect in January 2025.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">The Exchange is pleased to note that issuers continued to achieve a high rate of compliance with the disclosure Rules and accounting standards. From its thematic review, the Exchange identified room for improvement in the quality of disclosure in certain areas, including management discussion and analysis and material securities investment activities, for which recommendations have been provided and updated on the Guide on Preparation of Annual Report (Annual Report Guide).</p>
<p class="spanHeading">Along with the publication of the Report and the updated Annual Report Guide, the Exchange today is also pleased to announce the launch of the Annual Report Explorer, which assists issuers in preparing annual reports and investors in accessing disclosure of their interests. Featuring an AI-powered search engine, the platform transforms the Annual Report Guide into a web-based guide with interactive features to enable issuers and advisers to easily access and navigate the Exchange&rsquo;s guidance. It is also built in with a disclosure repository to allow users to view disclosure made by different issuers (by industry and market capitalisation). Findings and recommendations from the Exchange&rsquo;s latest review are also accessible on the platform.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">The Exchange also observed continuous improvement on issuers&rsquo; CG and ESG practices and has provided recommended actions to help issuers prepare for new requirements under the CG Code and ESG Reporting Code.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">HKEX Head of Listing, Katherine Ng, said: &ldquo;This year, we are presenting results of our reviews together to facilitate issuers in identifying areas requiring attention and preparing for the next reporting season. As part of the ongoing journey toward better reporting practices and governance, we encourage issuers to take note of the latest guidance and go beyond minimum requirements.

<title>SEC Charges Canadian Citizen With Fraud Schemes That Targeted Retail Investors On Discord</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Canadian citizen Nathan Gauvin and three entities he controls&mdash;Blackridge, LLC, Gray Digital Capital Management USA, LLC, and Gray Digital Technologies, LLC&mdash;with orchestrating two fraudulent securities offerings that raised more than $18 million from investors across the United States and abroad. Gauvin allegedly misappropriated approximately $6.3 million of investor funds and used fabricated credentials, false performance metrics, and fictitious account statements to lure investors into his schemes.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Gauvin gained a following on Discord by falsely presenting himself as a successful investment professional managing over a billion dollars in assets through Blackridge, which in reality was a mere shell entity. From September 2022 to November 2024, Gauvin and his entities allegedly raised approximately $18.1 million from investors through an unregistered offering of interests in the &ldquo;Gray Fund,&rdquo; a purported diversified investment fund advised by Gray Digital and Gauvin. The complaint alleges that Gauvin and Gray Digital falsely claimed that the Gray Fund generated double-digit monthly returns and held over $78 million in assets, when, in fact, the fund actually had a monthly compounded return of approximately 1.4% and its assets were far lower than claimed. The complaint further alleges that Gauvin misappropriated investor funds to finance a lavish lifestyle, including using hundreds of thousands of dollars for purchases of custom jewelry, luxury concierge services, real estate, and art.</p>
<p>In a second scheme which began in May 2024, Gauvin allegedly offered &ldquo;seed stock&rdquo; in Gray Digital Technologies at $30,000 per share, falsely claiming the company had a $60 million valuation and more than $12 million in annual revenue. In reality, the complaint alleges that Gray Digital Technologies had no operations, assets, or revenue. According to the complaint, Gauvin raised at least $60,000 from two retail investors and then ceased communicating with them about this offering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gauvin exploited the trust of his online followers to perpetrate a brazen fraud,&rdquo; said Jaime Marinaro, Associate Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Fort Worth Regional Office. &ldquo;Investors should always verify the credentials of anyone offering investment opportunities, especially when those opportunities are promoted through social media or online communities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint charges Gauvin and his three entities with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and Gauvin, Gray Digital, and Gray Digital Technologies with registration violations. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and conduct-based injunctions against all defendants, along with a bar against Gauvin acting as an investment adviser.</p>
<p>In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Eastern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Gauvin.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-bulletins/updated-0">Investor Bulletin: How to Check Out Your Investment Professional</a>&nbsp;provides instructions for verifying an investment professional&rsquo;s registration status and background.</p>
<p>The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Eastern District of New York.</p>

<title>Canadian Securities Administrators And Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization Provide Findings And Guidance From Latest Phase Of Client Focused Reforms Reviews</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) and the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) have published their findings from a second phase of reviews of registrants&rsquo; compliance with the Client Focused Reforms (the&nbsp;<strong>CFRs Phase 2 Sweep</strong>).</p>
<p>In the Phase 2 Sweep, the CSA and CIRO reviewed 105 firms' compliance with the know your client (KYC), know your product (KYP) and suitability determination requirements implemented under the CFRs (the CFRs Phase 2 Sweep). The CFRs Phase 2 Sweep followed a previous set of reviews completed and guidance published on registrants&rsquo; compliance with the conflicts of interest requirements implemented under the CFRs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.asc.ca/-/media/ASC-Documents-part-1/Regulatory-Instruments/2025/12/6255537-CSA-CIRO-Notice-31-368-Client-Focused-Reforms.pdf" target="_blank">Joint CSA/CIRO Staff Notice 31-368</a>&nbsp;<em>Client Focused Reforms: Review of Registrants&rsquo; Know Your Client, Know Your Product and Suitability Determination Practices and Additional Guidance</em>&nbsp;outlines notable observations from the CFRs Phase 2 Sweep. The Notice also sets out guidance to help registrants implement efficient and customized processes, while further aligning their practices with the requirements under the CFRs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The CFRs are an integral part of the CSA&rsquo;s effort to protect retail investors across Canada,&rdquo; said Stan Magidson, CSA Chair and Chair and CEO of the Alberta Securities Commission. &ldquo;These findings and additional guidance are intended to help registrants implement more efficient processes that are tailored to their business, further enabling them to be compliant with regulations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The results of this latest review show that some registrants have made meaningful progress on implementing the CFRs.&rdquo; said Andrew J. Kriegler, President and CEO of CIRO. &ldquo;To help registrants apply the regulatory requirements across different business models, the CSA and CIRO have included comprehensive insights and actionable guidance to enhance regulatory compliance and investor protection where possible. These examples demonstrate some practical approaches to meeting expectations efficiently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The CSA and CIRO found through the CFRs Phase 2 Sweep that many firms made efforts, and some invested significant resources, to update their processes to address the enhanced KYC, KYP and suitability determination requirements under the CFRs. However, some firms did not update their processes to fully reflect these new requirements. Firms were required to take action to resolve compliance issues that were identified.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<ul>
<li>Today&rsquo;s announcement builds on previous guidance that we have provided to registrants in August 2023 through Joint CSA/CIRO Staff Notice 31-363&nbsp;<em>Client Focused Reforms: Review of Registrants&rsquo; Conflicts of Interest Practices and Additional Guidance</em>&nbsp;(<strong>CFRs Phase 1 Notice</strong>).</li>
<li>The CSA and CIRO conducted compliance reviews of 105 different firms. These included firms registered as investment fund managers, portfolio managers, restricted portfolio managers, exempt market dealers, investment dealers and mutual fund dealers with different business models.</li>
<li>The Notice includes examples of compliance issues that we identified through our review and guidance for firms to consider to improve their compliance with the CFRs.</li>

<title>US Office Of The Comptroller Of The Currency Releases Preliminary Findings From Its Review Of Large Banks’ Debanking Activities</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-office-of-the-comptroller-of-the-currency-releases-preliminary-findings-from-20251210/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-office-of-the-comptroller-of-the-currency-releases-preliminary-findings-from-20251210/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today released preliminary findings from its supervisory review of debanking activities at the nine largest national banks it supervises: JPMorgan Chase Bank, Bank of America, Citibank, Wells Fargo Bank, U.S. Bank, Capital One, PNC Bank, TD Bank, and BMO Bank.</p>
<p>The OCC conducted its supervisory review in accordance with the President&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/08/guaranteeing-fair-banking-for-all-americans/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Executive Order</a>&nbsp;&ldquo;Guaranteeing Fair Banking for All Americans&rdquo; to determine whether these institutions debanked or discriminated against any customers or potential customers on the basis of their political or religious beliefs or lawful business activities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The OCC is committed to ending efforts &ndash; whether instigated by regulators or banks &ndash; that would weaponize finance,&rdquo; said Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan V. Gould. &ldquo;Although our work continues, the OCC is today providing visibility into the debanking actions against customers and lawful businesses taken by the nation&rsquo;s largest banks to ensure public awareness, and to halt these harmful and unfair practices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The OCC&rsquo;s preliminary findings show that, between 2020 and 2023, these nine banks made inappropriate distinctions among customers in the provision of financial services on the basis of their lawful business activities by maintaining policies restricting access to banking services or requiring escalated reviews and approvals before providing certain customers access to financial services. For example, the OCC identified instances where at least one bank imposed restrictions on certain industry sectors because they engaged in &ldquo;activities that, while not illegal, are contrary to [the bank&rsquo;s] values.&rdquo; Sectors subjected to restricted access included oil and gas exploration, coal mining, firearms, private prisons, tobacco and e-cigarette manufacturers, adult entertainment, and digital assets.</p>
<p>The OCC&rsquo;s findings confirm that these or similar policies and practices were in place at each of the banks reviewed. In a reaction to the observations Comptroller Gould stated, &ldquo;It is unfortunate that the nation&rsquo;s largest banks thought these harmful debanking policies were an appropriate use of their government-granted charter and market power. While many of these policies were undertaken in plain sight and even announced publicly, certain banks have continued to insist that they did not engage in debanking. Going forward, the OCC will hold banks accountable for these actions and ensure unlawful debanking does not continue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This review was first announced by the OCC in September 2025. While the OCC is releasing preliminary findings, its work continues to better understand the full extent and effect of these actions and their impact on affected industries and the American economy. The OCC is also still reviewing thousands of complaints to identify instances of political and religious debanking, which it will report on in due course and as appropriate.</p>

<title>Ontario Securities Commission Investigation Leads To Fraud Charges For Smart Prime Group</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) is today announcing that Seyed Mohammad Ali Nojoumi (Nojoumi), Behnaz Samavat (Samavat), and Amir Mostoufi (Mostoufi) have been charged with fraud over $5,000 and possession of proceeds of crime, contrary to sections 380(1)(a) and 354(1) of the&nbsp;<em>Criminal Code</em>, respectively.</p>
<p>The group is believed to be the operating minds behind Smart Prime Group Inc. (Smart Prime), an Ontario sole proprietorship claiming to be in the asset management business. Neither Smart Prime nor its operators are registered to sell securities in Ontario.</p>
<p>The OSC alleges the group promised that the funds of 28 investors would be placed in individual trading accounts, but the funds were instead routed to personal and unrelated third-party accounts. The OSC further alleges the investor funds were used for personal expenditures and to pay other investors.</p>
<p>Mostoufi and Samavat were previously arrested and released. They are respectively scheduled to appear at the Ontario Court of Justice at 50 Eagle St. W. in Newmarket on January 8 and 22, 2026, at 10:30 a.m. in 201 ct.</p>
<p>Nojoumi was arrested and charged today. He is being held for bail and will be remanded to a date determined by the court.</p>
<p>This matter began as an OSC investigation into an affinity-related securities investment scheme in York Region. The matter was completed in cooperation with the York Regional Police. The OSC gratefully acknowledges the partnership of the York Regional Police in completing this investigation. This investigation was also assisted by the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC).</p>
<p>These charges arise from an investigation by the OSC&rsquo;s Criminal Investigations &amp; Prosecutions team, which is part of the Enforcement Division of the OSC. They investigate securities-related frauds, market manipulation, and related misconduct, including the investigation of repeat offenders and those who breach Capital Markets Tribunal or court orders and bans. Their primary objective is to protect investors and further enhance confidence in the Canadian capital markets through effective enforcement. Charges laid under the&nbsp;<em>Securities Act</em>&nbsp;are prosecuted by the OSC. Charges laid under the&nbsp;<em>Criminal Code</em>&nbsp;are prosecuted by the Ministry of the Attorney General.</p>
<p>The mandate of the OSC is to provide protection to investors from unfair, improper or fraudulent practices, to foster fair, efficient and competitive capital markets and confidence in the capital markets, to foster capital formation, and to contribute to the stability of the financial system and the reduction of systemic risk. Investors are urged to check the registration of any persons or company offering an investment opportunity and to review the OSC investor materials available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/homepage">https://www.osc.ca</a>.</p>

<title>Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/federal-reserve-issues-fomc-statement-20251210/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/federal-reserve-issues-fomc-statement-20251210/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Available indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace. Job gains have slowed this year, and the unemployment rate has edged up through September. More recent indicators are consistent with these developments. Inflation has moved up since earlier in the year and remains somewhat elevated.</p>
<p>The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that downside risks to employment rose in recent months.</p>
<p>In support of its goals and in light of the shift in the balance of risks, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 3-1/2 to 3‑3/4 percent. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.</p>
<p>In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.</p>
<p>The Committee judges that reserve balances have declined to ample levels and will initiate purchases of shorter-term Treasury securities as needed to maintain an ample supply of reserves on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Michael S. Barr; Michelle W. Bowman; Susan M. Collins; Lisa D. Cook; Philip N. Jefferson; Alberto G. Musalem; and Christopher J. Waller. Voting against this action were Stephen I. Miran, who preferred to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point at this meeting; and Austan D. Goolsbee and Jeffrey R. Schmid, who preferred no change to the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting.</p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority Censures Opes For Breaching Financial Advice Provider Licensee Obligations</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-censures-opes-for-breaching-financial-ad-20251210/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tatai Hokohoko &ndash; has censured Christchurch-based financial services firm Opes Group Holding Company Limited (Opes) for failing to comply with a number of obligations under its Financial Advice Provider (FAP) licence.</p>
<p>FMA Executive Director for Response and Enforcement Louise Unger said: &ldquo;We made the decision to censure Opes because there were shortcomings in its record keeping, how it ensures client understanding of the advice, its management of conflicts of interest and oversight of its advisers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The way Opes&rsquo; client documents are completed, how they are stored, and the level of detail recorded is not consistent, and records weren&rsquo;t efficiently accessible, to the extent that Opes was in breach of the requirements of Standard Condition 1 of its FAP licence. In addition, this breach made it difficult for FMA to verify whether other regulatory obligations were being met.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were additional reasonable steps that Opes could have taken to ensure its clients who did not progress to purchase a property with Opes understood the risks and limitations of the advice provided. Clients who did not proceed through the full advice process with Opes, where they would have received further risk disclosures, may not have been made fully aware of the potential downsides or the implications of acting on limited advice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The firm is vertically integrated &mdash; combining property sales, investment planning, mortgage advice, and accounting and property management. While this offers integrated services, the business model creates a risk of conflict of interest between the financial advice provider and the client, making adequate policies and procedures in this area, and the implementation of them, critical to appropriately managing this risk. The FMA found that Opes did not have adequate policies or processes in place and could not be confident that all conflicts had been identified, disclosed, and managed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Opes acknowledged that its regulatory compliance, policies, procedures and staff adherence to policies had not kept pace with its rapid growth and were not fit-for-purpose for the business. It has acknowledged the FMA&rsquo;s view that there has been a gap between Opes&rsquo; compliance with its FAP obligations and where it actually needs to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While no actual client harm was identified by the FMA&rsquo;s review, we consider that these contraventions have the potential to increase the risk of detriment to customer outcomes. Censuring and naming Opes is important to ensure the transparency of FMA decision making; it informs the public and previous clients, prevents and reduces the opportunity for consumer detriment, and helps to maximise the deterrent effect on the industry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Opes has cooperated fully with the FMA, has already taken significant steps to address concerns raised by the FMA and has provided a voluntary remediation plan for further improvements it intends to make. If fully implemented, FMA considers these proposed actions will go towards ensuring Opes complies with its obligations going forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The FMA noted Opes&rsquo; cooperation, significant efforts to remedy the contraventions, and ongoing commitment to improving policies and practices.</p>

<p>The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation<b>&nbsp;</b>(DTCC), the premier post-trade market infrastructure for the global financial services industry,&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/Risk-Management/Systemic-risk-barometer-2025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">today&nbsp;announced the results of its annual survey</a>&nbsp;on the top risks facing financial markets. Conducted every year since 2013, DTCC&rsquo;s Systemic Risk Barometer offers important insights into the evolving risks that are top of mind for financial services professionals around the globe.</p>
<p>Key highlights on the top risks entering 2026 include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Geopolitical Risks and Trade Tensions</b>&nbsp;ranked as the top overall risk to global finance for the fourth straight year (78% of respondents called it a top five risk).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Cyber Risk</b>&nbsp;was the second overall top risk, with 63% of respondents ranking it as a top five risk.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>U.S. Economic Slowdown&nbsp;</b>(41%),&nbsp;<b>Market Volatility / Sudden Dislocation in Financial Markets&nbsp;</b>(38%), and&nbsp;<b>U.S. Monetary / Fiscal Policy Uncertainty&nbsp;</b>(38%)<b>&nbsp;</b>rounded out the remainder of the top 5 overall risks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Amid the financial services industry&rsquo;s growing reliance on AI solutions,&nbsp;<b>FinTech&nbsp;</b>was ranked a top 5 risk by 33% of respondents, following&nbsp;<b>Excessive Global Public/Corporate Debt&nbsp;</b>(34%) and&nbsp;<b>Inflation&nbsp;</b>(34%).</p>
<p>Respondents named&nbsp;<b>cybersecurity and data protection vulnerabilities</b>&nbsp;the top risk associated with adoption of artificial intelligence (41% of respondents).&nbsp;<b>AI-generated misinformation</b>, such as false outputs or hallucinations, was cited next by 38% of respondents. Respondents also said that&nbsp;<b>insufficient governance, controls and oversight&nbsp;</b>was a concern (37% of respondents), followed by&nbsp;<b>overreliance on AI solutions</b>&nbsp;(34%).</p>
<p>&ldquo;A common theme across the survey responses was concern over uncertainty&mdash;whether economic, geopolitical, or tied to emerging technologies like AI,&rdquo; said Tim Cuddihy, DTCC Group Chief Risk Officer. &ldquo;Respondents also flagged concentration risks, such as heavy reliance on a few technology providers or platforms, warning that new technologies like AI and quantum computing could introduce fresh pathways for contagion and systemic events.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cuddihy continued, &ldquo;The most effective tool to navigate uncertainty is industry-wide communication and collaboration. DTCC remains committed to fostering open dialogue and engagement to strengthen resilience and mitigate systemic risks.&rdquo;<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>New to the survey this year was a question on quantum computing. Only 29% of respondents confirmed that their firm was currently actively planning for the cybersecurity risks associated with the technology. 25% said their firm acknowledges quantum computing as a risk but did not have any current plans to address it.</p>

<title>SGX Group’s Stock Market Activity Stays Robust In November; Commodities Volume Up On Risk Management, Institutional Flows</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>SGX Group (Singapore Exchange) reported robust trading in the Singapore stock market in November with the key Straits Times Index achieving a new high.

<title>ESMA Announces Supervisory Expectations For The Management Body In The Form Of 12 High Level Principles</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA)</span>, the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor,<span>&nbsp;has published its Final Report on the Supervisory Expectations for the Management Body, outlining ESMA&rsquo;s expectations for the management bodies of the entities under its supervision.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<h4><span><span>12 high-level principles to guide supervised entities</span></span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>The 12 high-level principles are directed at entities supervised by ESMA and those looking to obtain an ESMA license. They are designed to set out ESMA&rsquo;s core expectations in the form of outcomes. This is in line with ESMA&rsquo;s goal to be a principle-based and outcome-focused supervisor. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>The principles aim to foster the ongoing supervisory dialogue between ESMA and supervised entities in the context of the effectiveness of their governance and oversight. Each serving as an overarching framework, the principles allow entities to design individual approaches tailored to their circumstances driven by their nature, scale and complexity.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>A management body plays a key role in the oversight of a financial services firm as it monitors its business strategy and the management of corresponding risks. ESMA&rsquo;s supervisory expectations are intended to support firms and their directors by setting out the outcomes we are looking to achieve whilst allowing for flexibility in the ways they are reached.</span></p>
<h4><span><span>Next steps</span></span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>While primarily directed at entities currently supervised by ESMA, the report is also relevant to entities considering applying for ESMA registration and authorisation.</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>As the next step, ESMA&rsquo;s supervisory teams will be integrating the 12 high-level principles into supervisory priorities over the course of 2026. We will look to engage with supervised entities on implementing the principles in a practical way. This should contribute to a strengthened oversight by the management bodies.</span></p>

<title>Stablecoin Payments A Priority For 2026 As UK Financial Conduct Authority Outlines Growth Achievements</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/stablecoin-payments-a-priority-for-2026-as-uk-financial-conduct-authority-outlin-20251210/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/stablecoin-payments-a-priority-for-2026-as-uk-financial-conduct-authority-outlin-20251210/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The FCA has set out ambitious new growth measures for 2026 including supporting UK-issued stablecoins to provide faster and more convenient payments.</p>
<p>To enable firms to experiment with the issuance of stablecoins, the FCA will open its regulatory sandbox for safe testing and to support innovative policy development.</p>
<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/correspondence/growth-approach-pm-letter-december-2025.pdf" title="letter to the Prime Minister">letter to the Prime Minister</a>, the FCA also said that, following nearly 50 growth commitments laid out at the start of the year, the vast majority have been met, and more initiatives to support growth have also been delivered.</p>
<p>The package of growth reforms enables firms to scale, supports home ownership, bolsters capital markets, and gives consumers more options to invest.</p>
<p>Next year, the FCA will deliver a new wave of growth initiatives to focus on more efficient supervision, the digitalisation of financial services, increasing SME lending, and boosting trade and international competitiveness.</p>
<p>Plans include deepening US-UK market integration through the Transatlantic Taskforce for Markets of the Future; and preparing to enable some early-stage firms to conduct regulated business before full authorisation, for when legislation is passed.</p>
<p>Nikhil Rathi, chief executive of the FCA, said: 'Supporting growth helps consumers, improving their financial resilience and providing more choice. Our reforms help the UK maintain its global competitive edge in our world-leading wholesale markets, attract international investment, and lead on innovation in financial services. We will continue to embrace a bolder risk appetite to support growth, while maintaining our commitment to protect consumers and ensure market integrity.'</p>
<p>Flagship growth reforms that have been delivered this year include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Unlocking capital investment and liquidity:&nbsp;</span>To support wholesale markets, a groundbreaking new private stock market, PISCES, makes it easier and swifter to trade in private shares; and final rules for a new prospectus regime make it easier to raise capital and encourage investment.</li>
<li><span>Accelerating digital innovation:&nbsp;</span>The world&rsquo;s first Supercharged Sandbox in partnership with Nvidia helps firms safely test AI; and the introduction of a Scale-up Unit with the PRA will support fast-growing, innovative firms navigate the regulatory landscape.</li>
<li><span>Reducing regulatory burden:&nbsp;</span>Saving time for 36,000 firms by reducing the number of data requests, only asking for the data needed; and proposed measures to simplify the Senior Managers and Certification Regime will drive UK competitiveness.</li>
<li><span>Making it easier for firms to start up and grow:</span>&nbsp;Extended pre-application support with 158 wholesale, payments and crypto firms applying since April; more support offered to early and high growth firms with 50% more dedicated supervisors; and authorisations have continued to improve, with 99.5% of cases processed on time and faster targets set to be introduced next year.</li>
<li><span>Improving exports and inward investment:&nbsp;</span>A presence has been established in the US and Asia-Pacific as part of plans to have a network of financial services attach&eacute;s around the world; and the FCA is partnering with Government to support international firms to expand into the UK through the Office for Investment: Financial Services.</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of the FCA&rsquo;s work to rebalance how it approaches risk, its mortgage market reforms have been taken up by 85% of the market, with lenders being able to offer home buyers around &pound;30,000 more, on average. Proposals to introduce targeted support will also encourage a greater culture of retail investment to help people make informed financial decisions.</p>
<p>In this year&rsquo;s Global Financial Centres Index, London maintained its position as the second highest ranked financial hub, closing the gap on New York. Edinburgh and Glasgow also performed strongly, placed in 32nd and 34th position respectively.</p>

<title>Nasdaq Dubai Welcomes The Launch Of New Development Bank’s USD 50 Billion Euro Medium Term Note Programme</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li>The Programme will support New Development Bank&rsquo;s (NDB) mandate to finance infrastructure and sustainable development projects across BRICS nations and emerging economies.</li>
<li>The UAE, a member of the NDB since 2021, strengthens its partnership with the Bank through the establishment of this programme on Nasdaq Dubai. </li>
</ul>
<p>Nasdaq Dubai welcomed New Development Bank&rsquo;s (NDB) USD 50 billion Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN) Programme to its exchange. This marks a significant milestone in strengthening NDB&rsquo;s access to global capital markets and reinforces Dubai&rsquo;s role as a leading international hub for sustainable finance and cross-border capital flows.</p>
<p>The EMTN Programme provides NDB with a flexible and efficient framework to issue debt instruments to finance infrastructure and sustainable development projects across its member countries as well as other emerging markets and developing economies.</p>
<p>The NDB currently has a USD 50 billion EMTN Programme listed on the official register of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and on the London Stock Exchange. The Programme is rated &ldquo;AA&rdquo; by Fitch and &ldquo;AA+&rdquo; by S&amp;P. The multi-listing of the EMTN Programme, including Nasdaq Dubai, is a strategic initiative aimed at strengthening NDB&rsquo;s presence in its member countries and supporting their financial platforms.</p>
<p>Established by the BRICS nations in 2015, NDB is a multilateral institution dedicated to mobilizing resources for projects that support economic growth, social inclusion, and environmental sustainability. Its mandate spans clean energy, transport networks, water and sanitation, digital infrastructure, and other long-term development priorities. The UAE became a member of NDB in October 2021, subscribing capital of USD 556 million and enhancing the Bank&rsquo;s financial strength, global reach, and commitment to innovation in sustainable development.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Monale Ratsoma, Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer of the NDB </b>commented that &ldquo;Listing in Nasdaq Dubai is a milestone for the New Development Bank. Listing on the Nasdaq Dubai Exchange provides NDB with access to a deep and diverse investor base, enabling the Bank to mobilize long-term capital for infrastructure and sustainable development projects in our member countries. Furthermore, it aligns with the Bank's strategy to diversify funding sources across different markets and investor bases&rdquo;.<b> </b><b></b></p>
<p><b>Hamed Ali, CEO of Nasdaq Dubai and Dubai Financial Market (DFM),</b>&nbsp;said: &ldquo;We are pleased to welcome the NDB&rsquo;s USD 50 billion EMTN Programme to Nasdaq Dubai, an institution that plays a central role in advancing sustainable infrastructure across BRICS and emerging economies. This milestone reinforces Dubai&rsquo;s position as a leading platform for global development finance and highlights our commitment to enabling capital flows that drive economic progress, environmental resilience, and long-term value creation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The UAE&rsquo;s membership in NDB reflects its strategic commitment to expanding cooperation with emerging economies and deepening partnerships that support global sustainable development. For NDB, the UAE&rsquo;s fiscal strength, robust credit profile, and leadership in world-class infrastructure and green projects have further enhanced the Bank&rsquo;s capital base and operational capabilities.</p>
<p>The establishment of NDB&rsquo;s Programme on Nasdaq Dubai builds on this partnership, providing the Bank with access to a sophisticated ecosystem of regional and international institutional investors, including sovereign wealth funds, central banks, official institutions, and global asset managers. It further reinforces Dubai&rsquo;s role in multilateral finance by showcasing Nasdaq Dubai&rsquo;s ability to host complex, large-scale programmes through a transparent, well-regulated, and globally recognised platform.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Launches Firm Checker To Fight Financial Crime</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-launches-firm-checker-to-fight-financial-crime-20251210/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-launches-firm-checker-to-fight-financial-crime-20251210/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Around 800,000 people reported losing money to investments or pensions‑related scams in the 12 months to May 2024, according to FCA research.</p>
<p>To help fight this financial crime, the FCA has launched&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/fca-firm-checker">Firm Checker</a>, a tool to help consumers avoid scams. By using the tool and checking if a firm is authorised and has the correct permissions to provide services, people can significantly reduce their chances of falling victim to fraud.</p>
<p>Those who had experienced any Authorised Push Payment (APP) fraud or unauthorised consumer investments or pensions-related fraud, were most likely to have heard about it by seeing it promoted on social media &ndash; around 1 in 6 (17%) - or via a telephone call (17%).</p>
<p>Sixteen per cent were initially approached via text message, WhatsApp or another messaging service.</p>
<p>Scammers can make it difficult for consumers to know if they are dealing with the real firm. In addition to checking if a financial services firm is authorised by the FCA for the services being offered, people should also confirm that the contact details match those listed on the FCA Firm Checker.</p>
<p><span>Sheree Howard, executive director of authorisations at the FCA, said:</span></p>
<p>'Ruthless fraudsters are constantly evolving their tactics so they can steal money from innocent victims. Whether you&rsquo;re considering an investment, pension opportunity, loan or other financial service, use Firm Checker to confirm the firm is authorised and help fight financial crime.'</p>
<p>The research also found consumers are taking some precautions to protect against fraud, but there is room for improvement. Around 3 in 4 (72%) adults said they always or usually reject or ignore unsolicited calls, emails or text messages about investment or pension opportunities.</p>
<p>Six in 10 (60%) consumers reported that they always or usually verify the authenticity of emails, messages or calls before providing personal or financial information.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ul>
<li>Visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/fca-firm-checker">FCA Firm Checker</a>.</li>
<li>The latest FCA Financial Lives 2024 report was published in May 2025: &nbsp;  
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/financial-lives/financial-lives-survey-2024-key-findings.pdf" title="financial-lives-survey-2024-key-findings.pdf">Key findings from the survey (PDF)</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/financial-lives/fls-2024-fraud-scams-financial-promotions.pdf" title="fls-2024-fraud-scams-financial-promotions.pdf">Fraud and scams, and financial promotions &ndash; selected findings (PDF)</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the survey of 17,950 people, representative of all UK adults, 1.5% reported experiencing a pensions-related and/ or an investments-related (including cryptocurrency) fraud or scam in the 12 months to May 2024. Extended to the general population, this works out at around 800,000 people.</li>
<li>The investments or pensions‑related fraud or scams figures are not comparable to previous years due to changes in how the FCA asked about fraud in the 2024 survey.</li>
<li>Firm Checker has been specially designed for, and tested with, consumers to make sure it is effective and easy to use. The&nbsp;<a href="https://register.fca.org.uk/s/">Financial Services Register</a>&nbsp;remains in place as the full regulatory record of the authorised financial services population.</li>
<li>The FCA continues to explore where further clarity can be added and is making improvements where necessary to ensure the best possible user experience.</li>
<li>Firm Checker is one of a number of ways people can seek to protect themselves from scams.</li>
<li>Using an authorised firm can also bring other benefits as authorised firms must meet FCA standards and follow the FCA's rules. Consumers can also take a complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service and are more likely to benefit from protection from the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. &nbsp;</li>
<li>The FCA enables a fair and thriving financial services market for the good of consumers and the economy.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/about/what-we-do/the-fca" title="About the FCA">Find out more about the FCA</a>.&nbsp;</li>

<title>CLS Welcomes RCBC, A Philippine Based Bank, As A Third-Party Participant In CLSSettlement - Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation (RCBC) Is The Second Bank In The Philippines To Gain Access To CLSSettlement Through UBS</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cls-welcomes-rcbc-a-philippine-based-bank-as-a-third-party-participant-in-clss-20251210/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cls-welcomes-rcbc-a-philippine-based-bank-as-a-third-party-participant-in-clss-20251210/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>CLS, a financial market infrastructure group delivering settlement, processing and data solutions across the global FX ecosystem, announced today RCBC has gained access to <a href="https://www.cls-group.com/products/settlement/clssettlement/">CLSSettlement</a> as a third-party participant. RCBC will access the service through UBS, one of CLS&rsquo;s 76 settlement members.</p>
<p>The addition of RCBC, the fifth largest privately owned bank in the Philippines and a major regional bank in Southeast Asia, further strengthens the growing community of Asia Pacific banks indirectly participating in CLSSettlement. As a third party participant, RCBC will benefit from industry-standard FX settlement risk mitigation, reduced funding requirements and improved operational efficiency through CLS&rsquo;s unique payment-versus-payment (PvP) system. PvP is the globally recognized method for mitigating settlement risk, as outlined in Principle 35 of the FX Global Code.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>CLSSettlement is recognized as the global standard in FX settlement risk mitigation across 18 of the most traded currencies, with an average daily settled value of USD7.9 trillion in H1 2025, an increase of 12% year-on-year.</p>
<p><b>Lisa Danio-Lewis, Chief Growth Officer,</b> CLS commented, &ldquo;We are pleased to welcome Rizal to CLSSettlement via UBS. Settlement risk continues to be a priority for FX market participants and policymakers alike. Enabling regional banks to access CLSSettlement through CLS settlement members plays an important role in managing this risk. We remain committed to broadening participation in across Asia Pacific, as more institutions look to strengthen settlement risk mitigation for Asian currencies.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Bennett Clarence D. Santiago, CRO, RCBC,</b> said, &ldquo;CLSSettlement enables substantial risk mitigation for RCBC, specifically by neutralizing settlement risk in foreign exchange dealings and significantly enhancing operational efficiency of the bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Alberto Magno N. Pedrosa, Treasurer, RCBC</b>, said, &ldquo;RCBC's integration into CLSSettlement not only strengthens the bank's liquidity but also diversifies its global reach. This access directly fuels the accelerated growth of RCBC's foreign exchange business by opening doors to a wider, more diverse selection of global FX counterparties.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Sandra Laielli van Scherpenzeel, Global Head of Cash Banks, UBS,</b> commented, &ldquo;CLS is a cornerstone for reducing settlement risk and liquidity needs through multilateral netting, strengthening resilience across the banking industry. The recent onboarding of Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation to CLSSettlement as a third party underscores CLS&rsquo;s growing importance in APAC and global markets. UBS remains dedicated to supporting this critical infrastructure and driving innovation for clients worldwide.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Lilian Chan, APAC Head of Cash Banks, UBS,</b> added, &ldquo;By joining the CLS community, RCBC has taken a significant step forward in the growth and expansion of its FX business. It is a testament to UBS&rsquo; commitment to supporting client implementation, and we look forward to further support this important business in the region.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1 Principle 35 states, <i>inter alia</i>:</p>
<p>Where practicable, Market Participants should eliminate Settlement Risk, for example by using settlement services that provide PvP settlement.</p>
<p>Where Settlement Risk cannot be eliminated, Market Participants should reduce the size and duration of their Settlement Risk as much as practicable. The netting of FX settlement obligations (in particular the use of automated netting systems) is encouraged.</p>

<title>Press Conference By KATAYAMA Satsuki, Japan Minister Of Finance And Minister Of State For Financial Services = Public Relations Campaign For Countermeasures Against Financial Crime</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>(Excerpt)</p>
<p>(Tuesday, December&nbsp;２, 2025, ９:14&nbsp;am to ９:36&nbsp;am)</p>
<h2 class="navihidden">[Opening remarks:]</h2>
<dl class="qanda2"><dt class="ans char2">Minister)</dt><dd>
<p>I would like to introduce a new, public-private, cross-industry public relations campaign for countermeasures against financial crime.<br />This year has seen the worst-ever losses from specialized scams, and losses from social media-based investment and romance scams continue to increase, creating an extremely serious situation. Illegally traded deposit accounts are being misused as destinations for money transferred by victims of these scams and other crimes. To stop this misuse, the Japanese Bankers Association has taken the lead in creating this video content to widely inform the public that account trading is illegal, and that financial institutions will strictly refuse to open new accounts for individuals involved in such transactions. Using this video content, the FSA, the National Police Agency, and financial institution associations will work together to carry out a public-private and cross-industry public relations campaign. Specifically, in addition to disseminating information through financial institutions&rsquo; branches and websites, we will also widely promote it via social media and other communication channels using short video formats so that the message also reaches younger generations. Preventing account trading helps prevent losses from crimes such as scams and thereby protects public safety and security. Therefore, I would like to ask for the cooperation of the media representatives present here.<br />Also, I would like to inform you about scam calls impersonating banks. Since mid-November, there has been a sharp increase in voice phishing scams. These involve calls impersonating certain regional banks or automated calls to companies, directing them to fake websites to steal their internet banking information. Incidents of losses have already been confirmed at multiple companies. Banks do not normally ask for information like IDs or passwords over the phone or by email. They simply do not do this. Therefore, please do not be deceived. To prevent loss, do not respond to suspicious calls in the first place. If you receive a call claiming to be from a bank, hang up and call the bank&rsquo;s main number to confirm. If you have already provided any information, contact the bank and the police immediately. We ask that these points be thoroughly observed.</p>
</dd></dl>
<h2>[Questions and answers:]</h2>
<dl class="qanda"><dt>Q.</dt><dd>
<p>Regarding the voice phishing scams impersonating regional banks that you mentioned at the beginning, incidents of losses have been confirmed at multiple companies. If you have any specific number of cases, amounts, or concrete examples that could be shared, could you please provide them as they would help raise public awareness?</p>
</dd><dt class="ans">A.</dt><dd>
<p>Given the current situation with various ongoing matters, this data is not being disclosed at the moment, so I would ask for your understanding.</p>
</dd><dt>Q.</dt><dd>
<p>Regarding the voice phishing scams impersonating regional banks mentioned earlier, for example, the Bank of Fukuoka has already disclosed the amount of loss. Could you reconsider disclosing further information, such as the overall scale of losses and the total number of cases, if available?</p>
</dd><dt class="ans">A.</dt><dd>
<p>It is true that some institutions have voluntarily disclosed information, as indicated in the materials I have here dated November 28. However, we do not yet have a complete picture of the overall situation, so disclosing anything now could be inaccurate. As there are cases where institutions have halted transactions, the FSA will be examining this going forward. I will take that request into consideration.</p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority: Two Kaupapa Māori Research Papers Released To Fill Gaps In Sector Data</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) - Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; has released two Kaupapa Māori research papers in its first steps to better understanding of the experiences of Māori consumers and providers in Aotearoa New Zealand&rsquo;s financial markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FMA CEO Samantha Barrass said: &ldquo;Our te ao Māori strategy, Matangirua, is designed to help the FMA enable Māori to participate as Māori in financial markets, and in so doing, strengthen our ability to fulfil our regulatory obligations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Māori asset base has grown at a significantly faster rate than the overall economy, from $69 billion in 2018 to $126 billion in 2023. &nbsp;Yet there are significant gaps in data and knowledge about Māori consumers&rsquo; and providers&rsquo; experiences across the sector. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The FMA is committed to understanding the perspectives of Māori participants in the financial services sector in Aotearoa New Zealand to ensure that the FMA&rsquo;s vision that more New Zealanders than ever believe the financial sector is working well for them is true for Māori.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This research is a beginning for the FMA, our first step into this realm, and we want to listen, to learn, to understand and to make changes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first report, Matangirua research wānanga: a case study on Māori consumer experiences of investment and savings, presents the kōrero of three wānanga held with Te Ora Hou Centres in Ōtautahi (Christchurch), Whanganui and Pōneke (Wellington) about</p>
<p>Māori consumer experiences with investment and savings.</p>
<p>FMA Pou Ahurea, Jacob De Berry, who co-facilitated the wānanga, said wānanga participants showed a common desire for collective participation, particularly around saving as a whānau and how this was impacted through a lack of appropriate products and services. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lack of te ao Māori values and the lack of opportunity for Māori to engage and act collectively, contribute to negative perceptions and feelings of exclusion.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Participants viewed KiwiSaver products and services as failing to understand or incorporate Māori values and collective identities, especially around collective decision making and whānau-centred investment approaches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some participants thought online share trading platforms and cryptocurrencies offered greater opportunity to exercise their rangatiratanga and mana motuhake. These options were also viewed as beneficial because they enabled participants to avoid direct contact with providers where, due to widespread experiences of prejudice or bias, prejudicial treatment is largely expected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Co-author and FMA Strategic Adviser Māori, Hannah Chapman said the FMA undertook the second report, titled He Kākahu Whenua: a case study of Toha Network and East Coast Exchange, to understand the opportunities, challenges and barriers encountered by innovative Māori providers in their pre-licensing context.</p>
<p>She said the research with Māori Fintech provider Toha Network demonstrated an innovative approach to embedding te ao Māori values in financial systems. &nbsp;It also highlighted the complex legal and legislative landscape that exists for Māori, particularly Māori landowners.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a growing number of Māori providers who are addressing barriers to Māori participation in financial markets by developing business models that are conducive to a Māori worldview.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The case study shows how by embedding te āo Māori principles, fostering innovative partnerships, and embedding Māori Data Sovereignty into their business model, Toha aims to enable Māori landowners to overcome regulatory challenges, diversify land-based revenue, and assert self-determination, while advocating for broader market reforms that recognise collective benefits,&rdquo; said Ms Chapman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both case studies have produced evidence and intelligence that is actionable for the FMA. &nbsp;We intend to apply what we have learned from this research to our ongoing regulatory engagement and risk awareness, to address market failures and promote fair, efficient and transparent markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FMA General Counsel Liam Mason said both reports emphasised why financial services providers and advisers should have a strong understanding of the worldview, collective identities and values that drive financial decision-making for Māori consumers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He Kākahu Whenua highlights how Māori consumers and providers build and redistribute their resources to practice cultural values and exercise their responsibilities to their whānau and whenua, supporting their collective ability to thrive and be self-sustaining. This is echoed in all three Te Ora Hou wānanga,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By utilising Kaupapa Māori research methods for this research it has revealed new insights and identified unmet needs which also have broader application, teaching us more overall about our role as an enabling regulator.</p>

<h2>About the research</h2>
<p>The research was led by FMA Principal Adviser Kaupapa Māori Research, Kahukore Baker. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Co-author and FMA Strategic Adviser Māori, Hannah Chapman attended the Kotahitanga hui called by the late Kīngi Tūheitia Pōtatau Te Wherowhero VII and the following hui-ā-motu hosted by Ngāti Kahungunu and Ngai Tahu in 2024. Insights from these hui helped inform the focus of this research.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>About Toha Network</h2>
<p>Toha Network is one of a growing number of Māori providers whose business models reflect a Māori worldview and are designed to address barriers to Māori participation, such as complex regulatory processes that limit Māori access to capital, innovation, and participation in financial markets.</p>
<p>The Toha Network connects investors, scientists and communities in a collaborative ecosystem for environmental regeneration. It uses digital public infrastructure and a dual-token system (MAHI for verified environmental work, TOHA for data/governance rights). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Te Kautuku is a land trust on the East Coast that is a partner in Toha&rsquo;s pilot project with Air New Zealand and Te Puni Kōkiri for regenerating the native ecosystem.</p>
<p>The East Coast Exchange (ECX) operationalises Toha&rsquo;s model, prioritising Indigenous Data Sovereignty and trust-based economies.  &nbsp;</p>

<title>CFTC Obtains Over $2M Restitution For Victims Of Precious Metals, Foreign Currency Pool Fraud</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission announced today the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon entered a consent order against&nbsp;<strong>Robert L. Adams</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>SimTradePro Incorporated</strong>, both of Oregon, for fraud involving multiple commodity pools.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The order requires the defendants to pay $2,072,986 in restitution to defrauded victims. It also permanently bans them from trading and registering with the CFTC and prohibits further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations, as charged.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The consent order resolves a CFTC enforcement action filed Sept. 30, 2024 [See CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8993-24">8993-24</a>].</p>
<p>According to the court&rsquo;s findings, Adams and SimTradePro fraudulently solicited and accepted more than $2.3 million from at least 100 customers, many of whom were planning for retirement, to trade leveraged foreign currency exchange and leveraged gold and silver contracts in the defendants&rsquo; commodity pools. The defendants misrepresented the amount of fees charged, falsely claiming to only be paid if their customers made money, and hid trading losses. The court also found that SimTradePro unlawfully acted as a commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor.</p>
<p>In a related criminal action involving the same misconduct, Adams was sentenced Aug. 12 to 2.5 years in prison and ordered to pay restitution.&nbsp;<em>United States v. Adams</em>&nbsp;(No. 6:23-cr-00211-MC D. Or.).</p>
<p>The CFTC cautions that orders requiring repayment of funds to victims may not always result in the recovery of any money because the wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CFTC thanks the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority for its assistance. The Division of Enforcement also appreciates the support of the Oregon Division of Financial Regulation, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, and the Central Bank of Ireland.</p>
<p>CFTC Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this action are Harry E. Wedewer, Mary Lutz, Patrick Marquardt, Chris Giglio, Lenel Hickson, and Chuck Marvine.&nbsp;</p>

<title>FINRA Publishes 2026 Regulatory Oversight Report To Empower Member Firm Compliance - Report Highlights Trends In Generative AI, Small Cap And Cyber-Enabled Fraud, Among Other Topics</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/finra-publishes-2026-regulatory-oversight-report-to-empower-member-firm-complian-2025129/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/finra-publishes-2026-regulatory-oversight-report-to-empower-member-firm-complian-2025129/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>FINRA published today the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/guidance/reports/2026-finra-annual-regulatory-oversight-report">2026 FINRA Regulatory Oversight Report</a>, a vital resource that draws insights from FINRA&rsquo;s regulatory operations programs that member firms can use to help enhance their resiliency and strengthen their compliance programs.</p>
<p>In response to feedback from member firms about how valuable the report is for their annual compliance planning and in support of a key&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/about/finra-forward">FINRA Forward</a>&nbsp;initiative&mdash;<a href="https://www.finra.org/about/finra-forward/empowering-compliance">empowering member firm compliance</a>&mdash;the report is being published earlier than usual. FINRA Forward is a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/media-center/newsreleases/2025/finra-announces-new-finra-forward-initiatives">series of initiatives</a>&nbsp;to improve FINRA&rsquo;s effectiveness and efficiency in pursuing its mission of protecting investors and safeguarding market integrity.&nbsp;Member firms have said they use the report to identify the findings and effective practices that are applicable to their businesses, incorporate the reports&rsquo; topics in their risk assessment processes, perform a gap analysis of their compliance programs, and for training, among other uses, which are detailed in the report.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our 2026 FINRA Regulatory Oversight Report captures important findings and translates them into practical guidance our member firms can act on immediately. We are not just identifying risks, we are equipping our member firms with the intelligence and resources needed to mitigate risks effectively. By sharing these insights, FINRA is engaging with members to help strengthen their defenses. Ultimately, this report is essential because member firm compliance protects investors and safeguards the integrity of our markets,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/about/governance/executives#regops">Greg Ruppert, Executive Vice President and Chief Regulatory Operations Officer at FINRA</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether it's about the evolving threat of cyberattacks including those powered by bad actors exploiting artificial intelligence, the increase in manipulation tactics that exploit market participants, or the need to protect senior investors from potential fraud and other threats, this report delivers useful, real-world insights from our regulatory oversight work. Our goal is simple: help firms build stronger compliance programs and more resilient operations so that investors can participate in markets with greater confidence,&rdquo; Ruppert added.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among the topics covered in the report are generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), cybersecurity and cyber-enabled fraud; manipulative trading in small-cap, exchange-listed equities; and third-party risk landscape. For each topic area covered, the report identifies the relevant rule(s); summarizes noteworthy findings from recent oversight activities involving firms; outlines firms&rsquo; effective practices that FINRA observed through its oversight activities; and provides additional resources that may be helpful to firms in reviewing their supervisory procedures and controls and fulfilling their compliance obligations.</p>
<h3>GenAI</h3>
<p>Through FINRA&rsquo;s survey of firms and engagement with other regulators, FINRA has noted that:</p>
<ul>
<li>firms have started to implement GenAI solutions with a focus on efficiency gains, particularly with respect to internal processes and information retrieval; and</li>
<li>the top GenAI use case among FINRA member firms is &ldquo;Summarization and Information Extraction,&rdquo; which refers to condensing large volumes of text and extracting specific entities, relationships or key information from unstructured documents.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The report notes that AI agents&mdash;systems or programs that are capable of autonomously performing and completing tasks on behalf of a user&mdash;can enhance GenAI capabilities by providing users with additional opportunities for task automation and the ability to interact with a wider range of data and systems faster and at a potentially lower cost than more traditional process automation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the report details notable risks and challenges that could result in adverse impacts to investors, firms or the markets, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Autonomy: AI agents acting autonomously without human validation and approval</li>
<li>Scope and authority: Agents may act beyond the user&rsquo;s actual or intended scope and authority</li>
<li>Auditability and transparency: Complicated, multi-step agent reasoning tasks can make outcomes difficult to trace or explain, complicating auditability</li>
<li>Data sensitivity: Agents operating on sensitive data may unintentionally store, explore, disclose, or misuse sensitive or proprietary information</li>
<li>Domain knowledge: General-purpose AI agents may lack the necessary domain knowledge to effectively and consistently carry out a complex and industry-specific tasks</li>
<li>Rewards and reinforcement: Misaligned or poorly designed reward functions could result in the agent optimizing decisions that could negatively impact investors, firms, or markets</li>
<li>Unique risks of GenAI: Bias, hallucinations, privacy, etc., also remain present and applicable for GenAI agents and their outputs</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cybersecurity and Cyber-Enabled Fraud</h3>
<p>FINRA has observed a variety of sophisticated cybersecurity threats targeting member firms and their customers, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ransomware and extortion events</li>
<li>Data breaches</li>
<li>Phishing,&nbsp;smishingor quishing</li>
<li>New account fraud</li>
<li>Account takeovers</li>
<li>Account impersonations</li>
<li>Imposter sites</li>
</ul>
<h3>Manipulative Trading&mdash;Increase in Small-Cap Fraud Involving Exchange-Listed Equities</h3>
<p>FINRA has observed the following trends in manipulative pump-and-dump schemes involving small-cap exchange-listed equities:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are occurring less frequently at the time of the small-cap issuers&rsquo; initial public offerings (IPOs), and more frequently months after these IPOs.</li>
<li>Suspected nominee accounts continue to be utilized to invest in small-cap IPOs to aid in bringing companies public.</li>
<li>In advance of the pump-and-dump scheme, nominee accounts may &ldquo;funnel,&rdquo; or sell their shares in a coordinated manner to one or more foreign omnibus accounts, which result in the omnibus account(s) holding a significant portion of the public float.</li>
<li>Well after the issuer&rsquo;s IPO, the issuer may sell a large amount of shares in a privately placed secondary offering to select foreign investors&mdash;lacking adequate public disclosure&mdash;leading to these investors holding a large amount of the issuer&rsquo;s public float.</li>
<li>The use of account takeover fraud to purchase shares of small cap companies that are the subject of pump-and-dump schemes.</li>
<li>A continued increase in the use of text messaging and social media-based scams to attract victims to purchase shares of small-cap issuers subject to pump-and-dump schemes.</li>
<li>The victims&rsquo; purchases occur in conjunction with&mdash;and likely cause&mdash;price increases in the targeted securities through the use of coordinated limit orders.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>In October, FINRA initiated a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/guidance/targeted-examination-letters/small-cap-offerings-oct2025">targeted examination</a>&nbsp;of firm practices regarding public and private offerings of small-cap exchange-listed issuers with business operations in foreign jurisdictions.</p>
<h3>Third-Party Risk Landscape</h3>
<p>FINRA has observed an increase in the reporting of cyberattacks and outages at firms&rsquo; third-party vendors.&nbsp;Given the financial industry&rsquo;s reliance on third-party vendors to support key systems and covered functions, an attempted cyberattack or an outage at a third-party provider could potentially impact a large number of member firms. FINRA continues to monitor third-party provider risks in the interests of member firms.&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today confirmed permissible bank activities related to riskless principal transactions in crypto-assets.</p>
<p>The OCC published Interpretive Letter 1188 confirming that a national bank may engage in riskless principal crypto-asset transactions as part of the business of banking.&nbsp; Such transactions involve a bank acting as principal in a crypto-asset transaction with one customer while simultaneously entering into an offsetting transaction with another customer.&nbsp; The bank serves as an intermediary and does not hold the crypto-assets in inventory, instead acting in a capacity equivalent to that of a broker acting as agent.</p>
<p>As with any activity, a national bank must conduct these activities in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with applicable law.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan V. Gould today issued the following statement following the decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in&nbsp;<em>National Association of Industrial Bankers v. Weiser</em>:</p>
<blockquote>In its recently issued National Association of Industrial Bankers v. Weiser decision, the 10th Circuit has allowed Colorado to dictate the interest rate that a state bank located outside of Colorado may charge on certain loans. This decision risks undermining state banks&rsquo; ability to effectively administer multi-state lending programs and, perhaps more importantly, disadvantages state banks that wish to lend in Colorado compared to national banks and Federal savings associations. Such an outcome is fundamentally inconsistent with Congress&rsquo;s efforts to create competitive equality between state and federally chartered banks. Courts or, if necessary, Congress should remedy this outcome.</blockquote>

<title>A Digital Euro For The Digital Age: Op-Ed By EU Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis And ECB Executive Board Member Piero Cipollone</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/a-digital-euro-for-the-digital-age-op-ed-by-eu-commissioner-valdis-dombrovskis-2025129/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>From barter to coins to banknotes to cards, the systems Europeans have relied on to facilitate exchange have never stopped evolving. Throughout history, innovations have made these systems increasingly sophisticated, efficient, and convenient. Today, technology is transforming our society at an extraordinary pace. It is only natural then that our currency should also adapt. Europe needs a digital euro for the digital age.</p>
<p>For now, euro cash exists only in physical form &ndash; the banknotes and coins we hold in our wallets. Cash brings us together as the most tangible expression of our single currency. We know we can rely on it. It is accepted throughout the euro area. It is easy to use and inclusive. It protects privacy. And it is our money, issued by a public institution, the European Central bank (ECB).</p>
<p>However, more and more Europeans are choosing to pay digitally in shops or buy products online. We therefore need a digital form of cash that would complement the banknotes and coins we are familiar with. The digital euro is designed to respond to the opportunities and challenges presented by this transition.</p>
<p>This is the purpose of the so-called Single Currency Package, presented by the European Commission in 2023. It includes two proposals that are currently being discussed by European legislators.</p>
<p>The first proposal aims to ensure individuals and businesses can continue to access and pay with euro banknotes and coins across the euro area. The ECB is in parallel developing the next generation of euro banknotes with a new design to make them more attractive, relatable and inclusive for all Europeans, while ensuring they remain as secure and sustainable as possible. Euro coins and banknotes are not going anywhere. Europeans will have the choice to pay in euro banknotes and coins or in digital euro. The digital euro is designed to complement, not replace, cash.</p>
<p>The second proposal sets out a framework for a digital euro. This framework provides that the digital euro will be free, simple and inclusive. It will be accepted for any digital payment across the euro area and embed the highest cash-like privacy protection standards. It will work both online and offline, supporting digital payments on websites as well as transactions without internet connection.</p>
<p>In addition, the digital euro should be seen in the broader context of the need to improve Europe's strategic autonomy. Today, our payments landscape is highly dominated by non-European providers. We lack a European digital solution that is accepted for any digital payments throughout the euro area to fill the space left behind by declining cash use.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this makes us dependent on foreign-owned companies in an increasingly polarised and fragmented world. Ceding such a degree of technological control over the EU's economy to others deeply impedes Europe's ability to act autonomously on the world stage. It poses real threats to our resilience and economic security. We therefore must act to reduce the external dependencies that might hinder our freedom to pursue policies in line with our own values and interests.</p>
<p>The digital euro will not compete with private means of payments. It will complement them, making it easier for European private payment solutions to scale up and expand the reach and features they offer.</p>
<p>The year 2026 will be crucial for the digital euro project. At a recent summit, leaders of euro area countries welcomed recent progress and stressed the importance of swiftly completing legislative work and accelerating other preparatory steps. The ECB is preparing for the potential issuance of the digital euro by 2029, assuming the necessary legislation is adopted next year. These preparations will include a pilot that is planned to begin in 2027.</p>
<p>The euro has become a mark of Europe's economic strength and a symbol of European unity in the world. In 2026, the euro area will welcome its 21st member, Bulgaria. The currency that will power the prosperity of 21 euro area countries must now fully embrace the technologies of the 21st century.</p>
<p>The digital euro is an idea whose time has come. It is not just the latest step in the evolution of our money, it is an imperative to promote our strategic autonomy and make the most of the opportunities of the digital age.</p>

<li>
<div class="elementToProof"><i>Integration with MyPuro 2.0 enables transparent, automated data flows to accelerate certification and strengthen trust in carbon removal</i></div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="elementToProof"><i>Puro dMRV Connect enhances certification efficiency and supports industry-wide digital monitoring and verification</i></div>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="elementToProof">Puro.earth, the leading carbon-crediting platform for durable carbon dioxide removal (CDR), today announced the launch of Puro dMRV Connect. This new digital integration connects digital monitoring, reporting, and verification (dMRV) platforms directly into Puro&rsquo;s certification platform, MyPuro 2.0.</div>
<div class="elementToProof"></div>
<div class="elementToProof">This innovation marks a further step in Puro.earth&rsquo;s digital roadmap, strengthening the company&rsquo;s role in building a reliable, transparent, investment-grade foundation for the carbon removal market.</div>
<div class="elementToProof"></div>
<div class="elementToProof">With close to 1.3million CORCs issued today, Puro.earth is the largest standard in the durable CDR sector. By providing a digital means to integrate with dMRV, Puro.earth is helping strengthen data quality and trust while enabling suppliers to scale more efficiently.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof"></div>
<div class="elementToProof"><span><i>&ldquo;Puro dMRV Connect links external platforms to MyPuro 2.0, enabling transparent, automated data flows that make certification faster and more reliable,&rdquo;</i></span>&nbsp;said&nbsp;<b>Jan-Willem Bode, President of Puro.earth.</b>&nbsp;<span><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a crucial step toward a more connected, digital ecosystem where data integrity and operational efficiency go hand in hand. dMRV is the future of monitoring and verification in carbon markets &ndash; as the largest standard in durable CDR, we are helping to make this future a reality.&rdquo;</i></span></div>
<div class="elementToProof"><b>Streamlining Digital MRV with Seamless Integration</b></div>
<div class="elementToProof"></div>
<div class="elementToProof">The new API allows dMRV providers to send audit data, documentation, and evidence directly to Puro.earth through secure, automated channels. By reducing manual uploads and repetitive exchanges, Puro dMRV Connect improves data accuracy and shortens time to issuance for CO₂ Removal Certificates (CORCs) and future credit types issued under the Puro.earth certification platform.</div>
<div class="elementToProof"></div>
<div class="elementToProof">These efficiencies help suppliers increase issuance predictability while giving buyers more consistent and transparent datasets.</div>
<div class="elementToProof">In this first release, the API supports dual data submission and data retrieval via MyPuro 2.0, allowing dMRV providers to access relevant audit package information and exchange data with Puro more efficiently.</div>
<div class="elementToProof"></div>
<div class="elementToProof">The API is available for Puro.earth-ecosystem dMRV partners and suppliers with built-in dMRV solutions. This first release has been shaped through collaboration with these partners, whose feedback informed the requirements and will continue guiding future iterations.</div>
<div class="elementToProof"></div>
<div class="elementToProof">To support integration, Puro.earth is providing detailed API documentation and access to a dedicated test environment, so partners can begin onboarding immediately.</div>
<div class="elementToProof"><b>Laying the Foundation for the Future of Digital Certification</b></div>
<div class="elementToProof"></div>
<div class="elementToProof">The launch of Puro dMRV Connect establishes the next phase of Puro.earth&rsquo;s digital certification infrastructure, following the release of MyPuro 2.0. Together, these innovations form the backbone of Puro&rsquo;s pathway toward a digital ecosystem where verified, automated data flows underpin a faster, more transparent, and scalable carbon removal market.</div>
<div class="elementToProof"></div>
<div class="elementToProof"><span><i>&ldquo;Our goal is to strengthen the infrastructure that underpins trust in carbon removal,&rdquo;</i></span>&nbsp;added&nbsp;<b>Bode.</b>&nbsp;<span><i>&ldquo;With Puro dMRV Connect, we&rsquo;re combining rigor, real-time data, and reliability to support suppliers, buyers, and investors as the market grows.&rdquo;</i></span></div>
<div class="elementToProof"></div>
<div class="elementToProof">Continuous improvements and expanded capabilities are planned as part of Puro&rsquo;s broader innovation roadmap, including a high-frequency issuance model for Puro.earth suppliers.</div>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The FCA has confirmed changes to simplify its rules and lower costs for insurers, while maintaining appropriate levels of protection for smaller commercial customers.</p>
<p><span>The final rules aim to give more flexibility and responsibility to insurance firms, such as determining the frequency of their product reviews and how much continual professional development (CPD) staff should undertake.</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA will make further changes to its insurance rules and cut unnecessary requirements next year, including reviewing the international application of its rules and the Consumer Duty.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Separately, the FCA has also published proposals that will benefit insurers and other firms, including a raft of technical changes to streamline its rules and reduce complexity following the introduction of the Consumer Duty. This includes proposals to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>remove 3 further insurance data returns</span></li>
<li><span>review eligibility and disclosure rules for packaged bank accounts (PBA)</span></li>
<li><span>streamline and simplify rules on collective investment client assets</span></li>
<li><span>remove Handbook references no longer needed now the Consumer Duty is in force.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>The FCA has also set out wider plans to better support smaller financial firms by creating sector guides to help them apply outcomes-based regulation, starting with consumer credit firms next year. The pilot will inform the FCA&rsquo;s longer-term approach to supporting smaller firms.</span></p>
<p><span>Graeme Reynolds, director of competition and interim director of insurance at the FCA, said:</span></p>
<p><span>'We&rsquo;re simplifying and removing rules for insurers and brokers, reducing regulatory costs and helping them focus on delivering better outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span>'Our focus on smarter regulation is not once and done, and by using the Consumer Duty we&rsquo;ll continue to look at rules we may no longer need. We want firms to keep engaging with us on further simplifications for the insurance sector, so we can support growth and innovation.'</span></p>

<title>ClearToken Launches CT Settle, A Game-Changer For Institutional Digital Asset Trading</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li> <strong><em><span>FCA-approved CT Settle will enable 24/7 instant settlement, cut credit risk, and free up vital working capital for financial institutions trading digital assets</span></em></strong> </li>
<li> <strong><em><span>Represents another step in ClearToken&rsquo;s mission to bridge today&rsquo;s crypto markets with tomorrow&rsquo;s universal settlement layer for all asset classes&nbsp;</span></em></strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><span>ClearToken today launched&nbsp;</span><strong><span>CT Settle</span></strong><span>, a new, multi-currency service designed to modernise how global financial institutions settle trades across the digital asset market. CT Settle acts as a neutral, supervised and regulated platform that standardises the trade completion process, making it safer and dramatically more efficient.</span></p>
<p><span>ClearToken&rsquo;s CT Settle completed its first complete settlement cycle, settling netted cryptoasset and fiat currency transactions between regulated institutional exchange, LMAX Digital and Flow Traders. The settlement transactions were conducted using Zodia Custody and Bank Frick as sole digital custody and banking partners, respectively, together with technology powered by Nasdaq Eqlipse Clearing.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>The challenge CT Settle solves</span></strong></p>
<p><span>ClearToken&rsquo;s CT Settle offers market participants a netting process that significantly reduces the amount of capital participants must hold in reserve, freeing up working capital across fragmented venues for other trading activities. CT Settle works on a Delivery-versus-Payment (DvP) model, a tried-and-tested method in traditional finance settlement, meaning that digital assets and the fiat currency change hands at exactly the same time.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Safer trading, simplified operations</span></strong></p>
<p><span>By centralising the trade completion process onto a single, regulated platform, CT Settle addresses the biggest pain points for institutional clients: trading risk and operational and capital efficiencies. CT Settle brings trust, transparency, and operational rigour to the evolving digital asset ecosystem.</span></p>
<ul>
<li> <strong><span>Reduced credit risk</span></strong><span>&nbsp;- The simultaneous exchange of asset and fiat currency removes the risk of one party failing to deliver their side of the trade (credit risk).</span> </li>
<li> <strong><span>Streamlined reconciliation&nbsp;</span></strong><span>- Applying a single, published rule set simplifies record-keeping and lowers the operational burden for institutions dealing with multiple trading venues and custody solutions.</span> </li>
<li> <strong><span>24/7 global availability&nbsp;</span></strong><span>- Supporting cryptoassets, stablecoins, and traditional fiat currencies, the service operates around the clock, matching the nature of the digital asset markets.</span> </li>
</ul>
<p><em><span>&ldquo;The launch of CT Settle is a major milestone in building trusted, regulated market infrastructure that enables traditional institutions to participate in the digital asset market safely and efficiently,&rdquo;</span></em><span>&nbsp;said&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Benjamin Santos-Stephens, founder and chief executive officer of ClearToken</span></strong><span>,&nbsp;</span><em><span>&ldquo;CT Settle reduces failed trades, simplifies settlement, reduces capital requirements, and helps institutions operate with predictable cash movements. As a UK FCA-regulated platform, CT Settle gives our clients the confidence to enter this space, knowing credit, operational, and regulatory risks are managed.&rdquo;</span></em></p>
<p><strong><span>Building the ecosystem</span></strong></p>
<p><span>ClearToken is already working with market makers, buy-side organisations and trading venues as initial users of CT Settle, with pathways open for additional institutions to join. The service is built to be a 'horizontal' piece of market infrastructure, meaning it connects smoothly between different trade sources, custodians, and banks. This ensures participants avoid the hassle of dealing with venue-specific settlement rules and duplicated instructions.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Partner Perspectives</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Julian Sawyer, CEO of Zodia Custody:</span></strong><strong><em><span>&nbsp;</span></em></strong><em><span>&ldquo;We believe in a compliant market infrastructure that enables consistent results for clients across all venues. As the sole custodian, we provide CT Settle with the right custody offerings through Zodia Custody&rsquo;s Solutions, our white-label digital asset custody service that empowers global institutions to navigate the digital asset future and reap the benefits of decentralized finance.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p><strong><span>Michael Lie, Global Head of Digital Assets, Flow Traders:&nbsp;</span></strong><em><span>&ldquo;Net settlement across clear timing windows improves capital efficiency and reduces operational overheads. For a liquidity provider, that structure is essential to deploying capital at scale. CT Settle provides the infrastructure that allows institutional liquidity to grow, and that is why this partnership fits so naturally with how we run our business across markets.&rdquo;</span></em></p>
<p><strong><span>Chris Knight, Managing Director, LMAX Digital:&nbsp;</span></strong><em><span>&ldquo;As a leading regulated exchange dedicated to supporting institutions with their digital asset trading strategies, we welcome familiar market structure that is secure, trusted and robust. CT Settle brings this to digital assets by reducing credit risk and reconciliation burdens, unlocking vital capital efficiencies for institutional clients. This advancement is another step forward in helping the digital asset market to mature further, ensuring meaningful institutional participation.&rdquo;</span></em></p>
<p><strong><span>Building the future of digital post-trade</span></strong></p>
<p><span>ClearToken&rsquo;s vision is to bring trust, transparency, and operational rigour to an evolving digital asset ecosystem, enable the unification of traditional finance with digital assets, release the possibilities of tokenisation and empower institutional adoption and drive sustainable market growth.</span></p>
<p><span>The company is majority owned by market participants and delivers CT Settle as the foundation for a fully regulated, &lsquo;always-on&rsquo; post-trade ecosystem for digital assets. The roadmap includes:</span></p>
<ul>
<li> <strong><span>Global reach:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Ensuring that ClearToken&rsquo;s services can be access by all market participants.</span> </li>
<li> <strong><span>Broader connectivity:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Adding more venues, custodians, banks, and market participants.</span> </li>
<li> <strong><span>Wider asset support:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Including a greater range of currencies and tokens.</span> </li>
<li> <strong><span>Risk mutualisation:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>The future launch of a Central Counterparty (CCP) service.</span> </li>
<li> <strong><span>Tokenised Securities:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>The future establishment of a Digital Securities Depository (DSD) to provide settlement finality for real world assets.</span> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span>ClearToken&rsquo;s working groups</span></strong></p>

<p><span><span>While venture capital (VC) investment in CGTs has declined in recent years after a peak during the COVID-19 pandemic, mirroring broader industry trends, CGT-focused deals within the biotech ecosystem have remained relevant.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>CGT capital deployment remains highly concentrated among a small group of major investors, including RA Capital, ARCH Venture Partners, Alexandria Ventures, OrbiMed, and Fidelity International Strategic Ventures, each of which has committed more than $3.5 billion across cumulative deals.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Big pharmaceutical companies including Johnson &amp; Johnson, AstraZeneca, Novartis, Bristol Myers Squibb, Roche, Eli Lilly and others are actively embedding CGT technologies into their pipelines through acquisition deals.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Irena Maragkou, Senior Healthcare Researcher at GlobalData, says: &ldquo;Such acquisitions are becoming increasingly modality-driven and focused on platforms, scalable manufacturing systems, and specialized capabilities that can support portfolio-wide CGT expansion efforts. However, big pharma continues to demonstrate willingness to pay a premium for some late-stage or clinically validated assets when they align with long-term strategic objectives and portfolios.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>While oncology-focused CGT deals remain heavily skewed toward early R&amp;D and gene-modified cell therapies, the merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activity centered on non-oncology CGT assets has become more mature and diversified.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Maragkou concludes: &ldquo;As therapeutic CGT approvals increase, and the CGT market is expected to grow at a rate of 34.2% by 2031, companies must simultaneously prepare for sector-specific challenges such as regulatory complexity and manufacturing scalability. Therefore, biotech companies need to be strategic in investing in differentiated technologies and build execution capabilities to deliver clinical and commercial impact.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<title>The Dubai Financial Services Authority Restricts Former SVS Securities PLC Chief Executive, Mr Kulvir Virk From Operating In Or From The DIFC</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA), the independent regulator of the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), has imposed a restriction on Mr Kulvir Virk, the former chief executive of the UK fund manager SVS Securities PLC (SVS), preventing him from performing any function in connection with Financial Services in or from the DIFC.</p>
<p>In June 2024, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) fined Mr Virk and prohibited him from performing any function in relation to regulated activities. The FCA found that Mr Virk had failed to act with integrity and failed to exercise due skill, care and diligence in connection with his role at SVS and considered Mr Virk not to be a fit and proper person, posing a risk to consumers and the integrity of the financial system.</p>
<p>In November 2024, it was brought to the DFSA&rsquo;s attention that Mr Virk had been involved in the management of a DFSA Authorised Firm. Accordingly, to maintain the integrity and reputation of the DIFC and ensure the confidence of participants in the market, the DFSA decided to restrict Mr Virk from performing any function in connection with Financial Services in or from the DIFC.</p>
<p><b>Alan Linning, Head of Enforcement of the DFSA, commented:</b> &ldquo;<i>The DFSA&rsquo;s role as the regulator of financial services in the DIFC includes ensuring that there are high standards of integrity and fair dealing. We will continue to take action to ensure that those carrying out regulated functions in our market are appropriate and that these high standards are maintained.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Looking ahead, the DFSA remains committed to developing, administering, and enforcing world-class regulation of financial services within the DIFC. As part of its strategy and ongoing mission, the DFSA will continue to implement stringent enforcement measures and provide clear regulatory guidance to ensure that all entities operating within the DIFC adhere to the highest standards of regulation and ethical conduct.</p>
<p>The restriction came into effect immediately. A copy of the DFSA&rsquo;s Decision Notice for Mr Virk can be found in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dfsa.ae/what-we-do/enforcement/regulatory-actions">Enforcement Decision Notices</a>&nbsp;section of the DFSA website.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC has today announced new measures to further foster innovation and growth in Australia&rsquo;s digital assets and payment sectors, granting class relief for intermediaries engaging in the secondary distribution of certain stablecoins and wrapped tokens.</p>
<p>This builds on previous&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/news-items/asic-supports-innovation-through-exemptions-for-distributors-of-australian-stablecoin/" title="ASIC supports innovation through exemptions for distributors of Australian stablecoin">stablecoin relief</a>&nbsp;by exempting intermediaries from the requirement to hold separate Australian financial services (AFS), Australian market, or clearing and settlement facility licences when providing services relating to eligible stablecoins or wrapped tokens.</p>
<p>ASIC has also granted relief to allow providers to hold digital assets that are financial products in omnibus accounts, subject to appropriate record-keeping arrangements and reconciliation procedures.</p>
<p>This relief was foreshadowed when ASIC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-250mr-updated-asic-guidance-supports-digital-asset-innovation-and-boosts-investor-protection/" title="25-250MR Updated ASIC guidance supports digital asset innovation and boosts investor protection">updated digital asset guidance</a>&nbsp;(INFO 225) was published in October.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>ASIC released Simple Consultation 32&nbsp;<em>Proposed relief for certain stablecoins and wrapped tokens, and extension of omnibus accounts for digital asset custody</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/consultations/cs-32-proposed-relief-for-certain-stablecoins-and-wrapped-tokens-and-extension-of-omnibus-accounts-for-digital-asset-custody/" title="CS 32 Proposed relief for certain stablecoins and wrapped tokens, and extension of omnibus accounts for digital asset custody">CS 32</a>) on 29 October 2025, seeking feedback on the proposed class relief.</p>
<p>Five non-confidential submissions were received in response to CS 32, with industry largely supportive of the proposals. Submissions sought further guidance, clarity of definitions, and broader eligibility aligned with global approaches. In response to the submissions, ASIC has expanded eligible stablecoins and wrapped tokens to include those whose issuers have applied for a licence to issue the financial product. Guidance has also been provided in response to other feedback in the relevant Explanatory Statement.</p>
<p>The class relief comes from Consultation Paper 381&nbsp;<em>Updates to INFO 225: Digital assets: Financial products and services</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/consultations/cp-381-updates-to-info-225-digital-assets-financial-products-and-services/" title="CP 381 Updates to INFO 225: Digital assets: Financial products and services">CP 381</a>). CP 381 asked for feedback on potential relief for wrapped tokens and &lsquo;stablecoins&rsquo; because of the transition to the Government&rsquo;s proposed digital asset platforms and payment regimes, and custody of digital assets.</p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority Releases Thematic Review On Financial Institutions’ Product And Services Reviews</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-releases-thematic-review-on-financial-in-2025129/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-releases-thematic-review-on-financial-in-2025129/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) - Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; has released a thematic review on financial institutions&rsquo; product and services reviews.</p>
<p>Executive Director, Licensing and Conduct Supervision, Clare Bolingford, said: &ldquo;When financial institutions proactively review products and services, they can identify and respond to consumer harms, and help promote improvements in the provision of financial services that meet the needs of consumers. This supports some of the key outcomes we want to see for consumers and financial markets, including fair services, quality ongoing service, and well-informed consumers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Institutions such as insurers and deposit takers should treat this report as a guide for continuous improvement. But it does not create new legal obligations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As part of our normal supervisory activity, financial institutions can expect proactive reviews of existing products and services to be a continued area of interest for the FMA,&rdquo; said Ms Bolingford.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Companies should ensure consumer requirements and objectives are central when they design and carry out reviews, and should adopt a risk-based and flexible review schedule that can respond to internal and external factors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They should also incorporate consumer vulnerability considerations and ensure products and services remain accessible and fair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strengthening governance and board reporting to ensure accountability and oversight is key, as is improving consumer communication strategies to build trust and transparency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And finally, companies should ensure they have established clear processes for tracking and implementing review outcomes, including post-review monitoring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ms Bolingford said the FMA was pleased all 20 participating institutions confirmed they conduct reviews, with varied approaches reflecting their size and complexity.</p>
<p>Firms could learn from good practice examples in the report, she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Communication with consumers about review outcomes is inconsistent; some firms have mature strategies although some lack clarity on when and how to inform consumers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Action tracking from reviews is a developing area, with good practice involving structured follow-up, ownership, and effectiveness monitoring."</p>
<p>Firms could also learn from opportunities for improvement in the report, Ms Bolingford said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For example, off-sale and legacy products and services were often reviewed less frequently than on-sale products and services. &nbsp;Risks may be heightened where consumers interact with the product or service less frequently, as it is less likely issues will be surfaced by consumers. The FMA&rsquo;s fair dealing enforcement activity has often related to off-sale or legacy products. Conducting regularly scheduled Reviews may help prevent the types of issues that lead to consumer harm and potential enforcement action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The report also highlights the importance of proactive detection of systems weakness. As noted in our Financial Conduct Report, conduct risks in the deposit taking and insurance sectors remain high from reliance on legacy technology, systems, and manual controls and processes, as well as inadequate staff training. Failures in systems and technology have led to consumer harm in the past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dispute Resolution Services were overlooked as a source of insights by the majority of participants, although we consider them to be a valuable resource. As noted in our complaints info sheet, complaints can offer important insights into what is and isn&rsquo;t working well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>ASIC has released a&nbsp;<a href="https://download.asic.gov.au/media/jhib5ax5/asic-pcf-catalogue.pdf" title="ASIC PCF Catalogue">catalogue</a>&nbsp;summarising key legal obligations and regulatory guidance to help private credit fund operators more easily identify and comply with existing regulatory obligations.</p>
<p>The catalogue provides a practical reference point and applies to operators of retail and wholesale private credit funds in Australia. It is also relevant to the broader funds management sector.</p>
<p>This work was flagged in its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-264mr-a-roadmap-for-capital-markets-to-grow-our-economy/" title="25-264MR A roadmap for capital markets to grow our economy">roadmap for capital markets</a>&nbsp;released last month. This initiative complements issue of principles issued as a benchmark for firms to urgently assess its current practices, lifting them where necessary. This step will enhance trust and integrity in the private credit fund sector.</p>
<p>ASIC also intends to refresh regulatory guidance in 2026-2027 to consider private credit surveillance findings, reflect current risks and apply clearer guidance for wholesale funds.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, ASIC called on the private credit industry to lift its practices following expert observations of poorer practices, which were supported by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-820-private-credit-surveillance-report-retail-and-wholesale-surveillance/" title="REP 820 Private credit surveillance report: Retail and wholesale surveillance">ASIC&rsquo;s surveillance findings</a>. If &lsquo;done well&rsquo;, private credit complements the banking system and provides further opportunities for innovation, employment and growth.</p>
<p>Importantly, the catalogue does not include all applicable legal and regulatory obligations. It is not intended to be a substitute for legal advice.</p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority: Tower Ordered To Pay $7 Million Penalty For Misleading Representations</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-tower-ordered-to-pay-7-million-penalty-2025129/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-tower-ordered-to-pay-7-million-penalty-2025129/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>General insurer Tower has been ordered to pay a $7 million penalty for misleading representations that resulted in more than $11 million in overcharges to its customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The $7 million penalty follows admissions in civil proceedings brought by the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) - Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko - at the High Court in Auckland after Tower self-reported the issue to the FMA in March 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tower admits it breached section 22 of the Financial Markets Conduct Act (FMC Act) by misleading customers in its invoices about its multi policy discount (MPD) offer since 10 September 2016, resulting in the overcharges. This overcharging continued until February 2025. Tower has also admitted to making false or misleading representations in marketing material in relation to MPDs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The breach arising from the false or misleading representations in its invoices affected approximately 61,000 customers (or approximately 90,200 policies); approximately 11% of Tower&rsquo;s total customer base.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tower has carried out remediation and repaid over $11.7 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more than two decades, Tower offered a MPD to customers holding multiple qualifying insurance policies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2017, Tower entered into a settlement agreement with the Commerce Commission under which Tower agreed to fix its policy system which had caused a historic issue resulting in the miscalculation of MPD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Justice O&rsquo;Gorman accepted &ldquo;the FMA is justifiably critical that the previous settlement was intended to ensure that Tower sufficiently invested in and maintained adequate systems and processes to ensure any MPD is applied correctly, including through any migration process.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Margot Gatland, FMA&rsquo;s Head of Enforcement said: &ldquo;Tower&rsquo;s issues stemmed from deficiencies in its systems that meant the insurer failed to deliver to customers a publicly advertised discount.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tower used the advertised MPDs to attract and retain customers, without having systems that could reliably deliver on the promised discount.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The FMA acknowledges that Tower self-reported the MPD Issues, co-operated with the FMA&rsquo;s investigation, made admissions and carried out a comprehensive remediation programme.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The FMA&rsquo;s statutory objective is to promote and facilitate the development of fair, efficient and transparent financial markets, and to promote the confident and informed participation of businesses, investors and consumers in financial markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confident participation in New Zealand&rsquo;s financial markets can only exist if an intrinsic level of market integrity exists. This is why we continue to respond to fair dealing breaches like this.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<title>Acting CFTC Chairman Pham Announces Launch Of Digital Assets Pilot Program For Tokenized Collateral In Derivatives Markets - CFTC Issues New Guidance To Provide Regulatory Clarity, Eliminates Outdated Requirements That Hurt Innovation</title>

<p><span>Commodity Futures Trading Commission Acting Chairman Caroline D. Pham today announced the launch of a&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/csl/25-40/download"><span>digital assets pilot program</span></a><span>&nbsp;for certain digital assets, including BTC, ETH, and USDC, to be used as collateral in derivatives markets;&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/csl/25-39/download"><span>guidance on tokenized collateral</span></a><span>; and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/csl/25-41/download"><span>withdrawal of outdated requirements</span></a><span>&nbsp;given the enactment of the GENIUS Act. Today&rsquo;s announcement marks a significant milestone in the expanded adoption of digital assets in regulated markets with appropriate guardrails, and follows the tokenized collateral&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/9130-25"><span>initiative&nbsp;</span></a><span>Acting Chairman Pham launched in September as a part of the CFTC&rsquo;s&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/9104-25"><span>Crypto Sprint</span></a><span>&nbsp;to implement recommendations in the President&rsquo;s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/crypto/"><span>report</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Under my leadership this year, the CFTC has led the way forward into America&rsquo;s Golden Age of Innovation and Crypto. This imperative has never been more important given recent customer losses on non-U.S. crypto exchanges. Americans deserve safe U.S. markets as an alternative to offshore platforms, and that&rsquo;s why last week I announced that spot crypto can now be traded on CFTC registered exchanges,&rdquo;&nbsp;<strong>said Acting Chairman Pham</strong>. &ldquo;Today, I am launching a U.S. digital assets pilot program for tokenized collateral, including bitcoin and ether, in our derivatives markets that establishes clear guardrails to protect customer assets and provides enhanced CFTC monitoring and reporting. The CFTC is also providing regulatory clarity through tokenized collateral guidance for real world assets like U.S. Treasuries, and withdrawing CFTC requirements that are now outdated under the GENIUS Act. As I&rsquo;ve said before, embracing responsible innovation ensures that U.S. markets are the world leader, and drives progress that will unleash U.S. economic growth because market participants can safely put their dollars to work smarter and go further.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>"The CFTC's decision confirms what the crypto industry has long known: That stablecoins and digital assets can make payments faster, cheaper, and reduce risk,&rdquo; said<strong>&nbsp;Paul Grewal,</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Coinbase Chief Legal Officer</strong>. &ldquo;We applaud Acting Chair Caroline Pham and the CFTC for swiftly recognizing that tokenized innovation is the future of finance, and thank Acting Chair Caroline Pham for her leadership and vision. This major unlock is precisely what the Administration and Congress intended the GENIUS Act to enable&mdash;and will allow digital innovation to transform and improve traditional areas of finance. We encourage other regulators to quickly follow suit."</span></p>
<p><span>"Circle applauds Acting Chairman Pham's breakthrough leadership for derivatives markets and responsible innovation," said&nbsp;<strong>Heath Tarbert, President of Circle</strong>. "Deploying prudentially supervised payment stablecoins across CFTC-regulated markets protects customers, reduces settlement frictions, supports 24/7 risk reduction, and advances U.S. dollar leadership through global regulatory interoperability. Enabling near-real-time margin settlement will also mitigate settlement-failure and liquidity-squeeze risks across evenings, weekends, and holidays. Acting Chairman Pham and the Commission have set a course for the future in which the United States will continue to have the safest, deepest, and most trusted global derivatives markets."</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Today marks an important milestone in the history of the crypto industry&mdash;we have been given regulatory certainty for the future,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<strong>Kris Marszalek, Co-Founder and CEO of Crypto.com</strong>. &ldquo;The CFTC guidance on tokenized collateral is the latest example of Acting Chairman Pham delivering on the promise of President Trump to make the United States the &lsquo;crypto capital of the world.&rsquo; Acting Chairman Pham should be commended for these leadership efforts. For years, we have been able to offer tokenized collateral in markets other than the United States. It has only been because of the leadership of Acting Chairman Pham and the CFTC's exclusive jurisdiction over our CFTC-regulated clearinghouse that we will now be able to use tokenized collateral to support our CFTC-regulated crypto and predictions market products, as well as our margined derivatives. This means 24/7 trading is a reality in the United States. We are fully open for business and are excited for this new chapter.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>"The CFTC's actions mark a pivotal moment for integrating digital assets into regulated derivatives markets. By recognizing tokenized digital assets&mdash;including stablecoins&mdash;as eligible margin, the CFTC is providing the regulatory clarity needed to move the industry forward,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<strong>Jack McDonald, SVP of Stablecoins at Ripple</strong>. &ldquo;This step will unlock greater capital efficiency and solidify U.S. leadership in financial innovation. At Ripple, we look forward to continuing to partner with the CFTC and the industry to ensure the safe and responsible scaling of digital assets."</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Digital Assets Pilot Program and Guidance for Tokenized Collateral</strong></span><br /><br /><span>The CFTC&rsquo;s Market Participants Division, Division of Market Oversight, and Division of Clearing and Risk issued new guidance today on the use of tokenized assets as collateral in the trading of futures and swaps. The guidance highlights that CFTC regulations are technology-neutral, and encourages the analysis of tokenized assets on an individual basis in accordance with the CFTC&rsquo;s existing regulatory framework and firms&rsquo; policies and procedures. The guidance applies to tokenized real world assets, including U.S. Treasury securities and money market funds. Topics include eligible tokenized assets; legal enforceability; segregation, custody and control arrangements; haircuts and valuation; and operational risks.</span></p>
<p><span>MPD also issued a no-action position with respect to certain requirements applicable to Futures Commission Merchants (FCMs) that accept non-securities digital assets, including payment stablecoins, as customer margin collateral or hold certain proprietary payment stablecoins in segregated customer accounts. The no-action position provides market participants with regulatory clarity regarding the application of the segregation and capital requirements to FCMs that accept these digital assets as margin collateral, while highlighting the importance of FCMs&rsquo; maintaining robust risk management practices. By setting up a framework for registered FCMs to accept and take into account the value of non-securities digital asset customer margin collateral and deposit payment stablecoins as residual interest, the no-action letter establishes a pilot program that fosters responsible financial innovation while providing an opportunity for CFTC staff to closely monitor developments associated with non-securities digital asset collateral.</span></p>
<p><span>As set forth in the conditions of the letter, during the first three months from the commencement of an FCM&rsquo;s reliance on the no-action position, the digital assets that an FCM could accept as margin collateral will be limited to bitcoin, ether, and USDC. In addition, during this initial period, an FCM relying on the no-action letter will be required to provide weekly reporting of the total amount of digital assets held in customer accounts, listing each asset type separately for each of the three customer account classes, and promptly notify CFTC staff of any significant issue affecting the use of digital assets as customer margin collateral. The frequent reporting and notice requirements will provide an opportunity for CFTC staff to assess the proper application of FCM regulatory requirements without unnecessarily limiting the ability of FCMs to accept digital assets as collateral and deposit proprietary payment stablecoins as residual interest in customer accounts.</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, MPD withdrew CFTC Staff Advisory No.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/csl/20-34/download"><span>20-34</span></a><span>, Accepting Virtual Currencies from Customers into Segregation, effective immediately. That advisory, which was issued by MPD&rsquo;s predecessor division, placed certain restrictions on an FCM&rsquo;s ability to accept virtual currencies as customer collateral. The substantial developments with respect to digital assets and the use of tokenized collateral in the derivatives markets that occurred in the intervening years since its issuance, including the enactment of the GENIUS Act, have rendered the advisory outdated and no longer relevant.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>These actions are based on significant&nbsp;</span><a href="https://comments.cftc.gov/PublicComments/CommentList.aspx?id=7623"><span>stakeholder input</span></a><span>&nbsp;and public comments, feedback from a&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/9049-25"><span>CFTC Crypto CEO Forum</span></a><span>, and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/9009-24"><span>recommendations&nbsp;</span></a><span>from the Digital Asset Markets Subcommittee of the Global Markets Advisory Committee, which Acting Chairman Pham sponsors.</span></p>

<title>Whistleblower Protections Threatened In Landmark Supreme Court Case - Slaughter v. Trump To Determine Whistleblower Protections Nationwide</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/whistleblower-protections-threatened-in-landmark-supreme-court-case-slaughter-2025128/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/whistleblower-protections-threatened-in-landmark-supreme-court-case-slaughter-2025128/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Today, the U.S. Supreme Court is hearing arguments in the case of&nbsp;<em>Slaughter v. Trump.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>At issue is the President&rsquo;s authority to fire, at-will and for political reasons, any appointee within the government, including members of Senate-confirmed Commissions, where the underlying statute limits the President&rsquo;s authority.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Although today&rsquo;s argument concerns the ability to fire members of the Federal Trade Commission, it will set precedent for numerous other independent Commissions, including those that decide whistleblower cases.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>According to Stephen M. Kohn, the Chairman of the Board of the National Whistleblower Center (NWC), and co-author of the&nbsp;<em>amicus&nbsp;</em>brief filed by the NWC,&nbsp; &ldquo;this case could have a radically devastating impact on whistleblowers.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>&ldquo;The entire framework of protecting federal employee whistleblowers is at stake in this case,&rdquo; Kohn added.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Whistleblower cases are decided by a Congressionally mandated independent Board, similar to the requirements of the FTC.&nbsp; Known as the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), it is required to have three members, two from the President&rsquo;s political party and one member from the opposition party.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Members can only be terminated from the Board&nbsp; &ldquo;for cause.&rdquo;&nbsp; Because whistleblowers are often critical of a sitting President, this limit was required by Congress to ensure that whistleblower cases could be heard by an independent agency, without direct pressure from the White House.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>However, asserting his executive authority to terminate federal appointees, President Trump fired the only Democratic member of the Board, causing the MSPB to lose its quorum.&nbsp; The result:&nbsp; All federal employee whistleblower cases are now in limbo.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Kohn explained:&nbsp; &ldquo;The MSPB is only one of numerous boards that whistleblowers rely on for independent and non-partisan decision-making.&nbsp; For example, the Securities and Commodities Exchange Commission decides all whistleblower award cases under Dodd-Frank and their members currently have similar protections as those being at issue in Slaughter. Stripping these protections is bad policy, bad law, and constitutionally indefensible,&rdquo; Kohn added.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The NWC&rsquo;s Brief cited a landmark speech by James Madison, a highly respected member of the Convention that drafted the U.S. Constitution and the First Congress.&nbsp; The NWC explained that Madison firmly believed that Congress was the proper authority to place limits on Presidential appointees.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The Brief also quoted from the highly influential Constitutional scholar, former Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story, who warned in his 1839&nbsp;<em>Commentaries on the Constitution,&nbsp;</em>of the dangerous implications of granting the President &ldquo;unlimited power to remove&rdquo; members of the executive branch:</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><em><span><span>&ldquo;Indeed, it is utterly impossible not to feel, that, if this unlimited power of removal does exist, it may be made, in the hands of a bold and designing man, of high ambition, and feeble principles, an instrument of the worst oppression, and most vindictive vengeance.&rdquo;</span></span></em></span></span></span></p>

<p><span>The Bank of England chairs the London Foreign Exchange Joint Standing Committee (FXJSC) Legal Sub-Committee. The FXJSC is made up of market participants, infrastructure providers and the UK financial regulators.</span></p>
<p>Date of meeting: 17 September 2025</p>
<p>Time: 16:00 &ndash; 17:30 | Location: Bank of England, Threadneedle St, London, EC2R 8AH</p>
<p><section class="page-section">
<div class="section-heading">
<h2 id="chapter-0">Minutes</h2>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-0">Minute 1: Introduction</h3>
<p>The Chair (Sharon Blackman) opened the meeting, welcoming those online and in person.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-1">Minute 2: Minutes</h3>
<p>As the 24 June 2025 meeting minutes were circulated late, members were asked to email any questions to the Chair and Bank Secretariat after the meeting, as no comments were received, they were deemed to be approved.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-2">Minute 3: FXJSC Operations Sub-Committee contingency planning</h3>
<p>Matthew Hartley (MH) (Bank of England) gave an update regarding the recent discussions that have taken place at the Operations Sub-Committee (OSC). The OSC discussed contingency plans for a specific scenario relating to Sterling settlement issues. The proposal from the OSC was to create a triage process following an alert of a potential issue.</p>
<p>The process will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upon incident notification, a core group will validate it and assess its significance and determine if the OSC or a part of the OSC should convene.</li>
<li>If a meeting is held, the OSC will confirm the event and review market communications.</li>
</ul>
<p>The FXJSC LSC observed that broader market notifications should take into account Market Abuse Requirements and competition considerations when determining timing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-3">Minute 4: MiFID3</h3>
<p>Tom Harkus (TH) (Simmons &amp; Simmons LLP) gave a MiFID II/MiFIR Regulatory Update and discussed the below topics.</p>
<ol>
<li>Dark Trading &ndash; Volume Cap</li>
<li>Pre-Trade Transparency (Non-Equity Instruments)</li>
<li>Post-Trade Transparency (Derivatives)</li>
<li>Business Clock Synchronisation</li>
<li>Consolidated Tape Provider (CTP) &ndash; OTC Derivatives</li>
<li>Transaction Reporting</li>
<li>Post-Trade Risk Reduction Services (PTRRS)</li>
<li>Dealing on Own Account</li>
<li>Systematic Internaliser (SI) Definition</li>
<li>Best Execution</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-4">Minute 5: Topics for discussion at future meetings</h3>
<p>It was proposed that a joint meeting between OSC and LSC should be scheduled for November to talk through the comms plan.</p>
<p>The Committee recommended discussing ISDA FX definitions changes at the November joint meeting as well.</p>
<h4>Further suggestions included:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Examine AI's influence on the FX market.</li>
<li>Pre-Hedging Discussion (Based on IOSCO&rsquo;s Discussion Paper).</li>
<li>US policy changes and FX swaps reporting impacting venue boundaries, with UK responses reflecting global market dynamics.</li>
<li>Benchmark regulations in Europe especially target FX swaps, as the EU aims to exclude them from benchmark scope unless deemed systemically important.</li>
<li>Discussing mood on T+0 (trade date) and its impact on the market, especially in legal, compliance, or risk contexts.</li>
<li>Digital assets had been discussed previously but the conversation continues to move forward, and there could be further discussion of how they might reshape FX settlement in future.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-5">Minute 6: Any other business</h3>
<p>The Chair raised the possibility of introducing a co-chairing arrangement. While no decision has been made yet, expressions of interest (EoIs) for the role are welcome. Having a co-chair could be beneficial in terms of sharing responsibilities and workload. MH noted that the OSC currently uses a similar model.</p>
<p>The Terms of Reference (ToR) will need to be reviewed accordingly, so any feedback on any other section of the ToRs should be sent to the Bank Secretariat team.</p>

<title>The Transformation Of Money: Technological Disruption And The Future Of Financial Services - Guest Lecture By Piero Cipollone, Member Of The Executive Board Of The ECB, At The Frankfurt School Of Finance &amp; Management, Frankfurt am Main, 8 December 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-transformation-of-money-technological-disruption-and-the-future-of-financia-2025128/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-transformation-of-money-technological-disruption-and-the-future-of-financia-2025128/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Money is at the heart of what central banks do.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251208~4c07c78304.en.html#footnote.1" id="fn1">1</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;Ever since central banks have existed, their fundamental role has been to issue money and protect its value. This role has been the same for centuries, and I don&rsquo;t expect it to change. But what is changing is the environment in which central banks must deliver on this mandate. There are obviously many sides to this, but today I will focus on technology.</p>
<p>Digital payments are the new normal. And new technologies have emerged that are disrupting financial services, leading us to rethink their future. We are facing no less than a paradigm shift. Financial institutions have become technological entities. At the same time, tech firms have entered the realms of payments and finance. In fact, financial institutions and tech firms have all become fintechs. What was once a niche has become the norm. Harnessing technology to provide better financial services is now the name of the game.</p>
<p>Central banks are no exception. If they are to retain their role in issuing money that is fit for purpose, they have to embrace technology and shape the transformation of money. Adapting to new technologies is not an option, it is an existential must. If central banks don&rsquo;t issue digital money, they will lose their central role in money issuance and fail to provide an anchor of stability to the entire financial system. Central banks are increasingly becoming tech organisations; they must evolve with technology, or risk falling behind.</p>
<p>Today, I will argue that in the European context, the central bank needs to not just follow but take a leading role in this transformation. If it doesn&rsquo;t, Europe risks failing to leverage its collective strength. This is because financial integration is key to achieving the network effects and economies of scale required to enable our economy and financial sector to reap the benefits of these new technologies while mitigating their risks. This is particularly vital for the European Central Bank, which operates in a monetary union, where the singleness of money across the union is necessary for the smooth functioning of payments and the effective transmission of monetary policy. Looking ahead, we also need to ensure the singleness of digital money. Doing so will provide a Europe-wide ecosystem in which the private sector can compete by offering, and scaling up, innovative new services.</p>
<p>We can build on strong foundations. Over the past 25 years, the euro has become the currency of 20 member countries, with Bulgaria set to become the 21st euro area member next month. The euro has established itself firmly as the world's second most important currency. The Eurosystem &ndash; that is, the ECB and the national central banks of euro area countries &ndash; implements a single monetary policy that safeguards the value of the euro and sustains the trust Europeans place in their money.</p>
<p>We have built robust market infrastructures that underpin the euro. T2 (for large-value payments), T2S (for securities) and TIPS (for instant payments) make it possible to settle in central bank money, a risk-free asset. Together with ECMS (for collateral management), these public payment rails allow money, securities and collateral to move freely, safely and efficiently across the euro area. Seen from where we were 25 years ago, the degree of integration achieved in just over two decades is remarkable.</p>
<p>However, we still face three key challenges.</p>
<p>First, fragmentation persists for retail payments. While the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) has provided a pan-European solution for credit transfers and direct debits, we have not achieved the same result at the point of interaction.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251208~4c07c78304.en.html#footnote.2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;Despite infrastructures like TIPS enabling instant payments across the euro area and the encouragement of the Eurosystem, we still lack a European solution that can be used to pay digitally throughout the euro area for all use cases. This has resulted in an excessive dependency on non-European providers for critical retail payment services like cards and digital wallets. This raises fundamental questions about our strategic autonomy, as this dependency could potentially be used against us as an instrument of economic coercion.</p>
<p>Second, the very nature of money and payments is changing in ways that could undermine the balance that has underpinned monetary stability in Europe. The emergence of new technologies, such as tokenisation and distributed ledger technology (DLT)<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251208~4c07c78304.en.html#footnote.3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span>, has the potential to enhance efficiency in capital markets. But in the absence of tokenised central bank money, the new ecosystem would not have a common risk-free settlement asset at its core. The lack of the latter could undo the progress achieved in wholesale payments between financial institutions by reintroducing fragmentation and credit risk, while creating new dependencies. Moreover, the expansion of alternative settlement assets denominated in foreign currencies would go against the objectives of the savings and investments union and undermine monetary sovereignty. This would also challenge the balance between public and private money that has served us well so far, with public money providing an anchor of stability into which all private assets can be converted.</p>
<p>Third, cross-border payments have been a lingering challenge. Because they remain slow and expensive, the race is on to make them more efficient. While this is a possible use case for stablecoins, the latter create a number of risks for domestic currencies and financial systems. They could also threaten the international role of the euro if no strong European alternative emerges to challenge the currently dominant dollar-denominated stablecoins.</p>
<p>In this context, inaction is not the best choice for Europe. Doing nothing could lead to central bank money becoming increasingly marginalised, which could end up challenging the resilience of our payments system and undermining the stability of our financial system, our monetary sovereignty, our strategic autonomy and our economic security. Over time, this could also weaken the competitive position of European financial institutions and infrastructures, which, given their importance for the financing of the economy, could in turn weigh on European productivity. And it could diminish the role of the euro on the global stage.</p>
<p>Our mandate does not allow us to take these risks lightly. When the foundations of money and payments are shifting along with technology, the central bank cannot stand still. We must modernise our payments offering so that it evolves alongside technological progress and supports the development of an integrated European market for digital payments and digital assets. Our goal is not to replace private innovation but to provide a solid public foundation that will enable the private sector to innovate at scale while avoiding excessive dependencies.</p>
<p>This requires a reinvigorated public-private partnership across three payment dimensions: retail, wholesale and cross-border. In my remarks today, I will outline our overall approach and then explain our strategy for retail payments (with the issuance of a digital equivalent of cash, the digital euro), wholesale payments (by making it possible to settle DLT-based transactions in central bank money) and cross-border payments (with the interlinking of fast payment systems).</p>
<h2>A public-private partnership anchored in central bank money</h2>
<h3>The complementarity of public and private money</h3>
<p>The Eurosystem&rsquo;s starting point is its core responsibility as an issuer of money and guardian of the smooth functioning of payment systems. In practice, this means offering means of payment for retail and wholesale transactions, while ensuring that payment systems remain safe and resilient.</p>
<p>This has several implications.</p>
<p>First, central bank money is a key pillar of our financial system, and we have a duty to keep it fit for purpose as technologies and preferences evolve.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251208~4c07c78304.en.html#footnote.4" id="fn4">4</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;It cannot be merely a niche solution for specific use cases or a dispensable add-on; it must respond to the evolving needs of people, businesses and market participants.</p>
<p>Second, we want to see a strong European payments ecosystem, where the private sector can provide robust, efficient and innovative solutions that can be scaled up.</p>
<p>These two objectives are not contradictory. In fact, they have strong synergies.</p>
<p>Central bank money solutions are based on pan-European infrastructures and standards that the private sector can leverage. This not only reduces the risk of fragmentation and ensures interoperability, but also avoids the need for the private sector to duplicate investments, and reduces costs for the system as a whole. This is particularly important in a sector characterised by network effects, where technological dominance and proprietary standards can otherwise restrict the ability of others to compete, innovate and scale up, as is currently the case in digital retail payments.</p>
<p>Another complementarity stems from the characteristic of central bank money as a settlement asset free of credit and liquidity risk, issued by an institution that can deliver finality and stability, even under stress. Some fear that this may create the perception that private money is unsafe. I think the opposite is true. It is the very existence of central bank money as a safe asset and the convertibility of private money at par at all times that gives people confidence when using private money. That is what makes a euro a euro across instruments, institutions and technologies. On the rare occasions when this relationship was broken &ndash; in the Free Banking Era in the United States<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251208~4c07c78304.en.html#footnote.5" id="fn5">5</a>]</sup></span>, for example &ndash; financial instability ensued. Experimenting without central bank money for retail or wholesale payments would be unwise.</p>
<p>In fact, in the wholesale space, this is a key reason why the private sector has explicitly told us that the absence of central bank money as a settlement asset is a major impediment to the growth of the digital assets ecosystem. Today, wholesale settlement in the euro area is already digital and in central bank money. But innovation is moving into new environments: tokenised securities, DLT-based trading and settlement, and smart contract automation. If we want these innovations to be scaled up safely in Europe, central bank money has clear advantages in terms of safety, scalability and liquidity management compared with private settlement assets constrained by reserves backing and market risk.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251208~4c07c78304.en.html#footnote.6" id="fn6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>In other words, central bank money guarantees the availability of a European settlement solution covering the euro area as a whole, ensuring the singleness of money and strengthening resilience. At the same time, it provides common rails that create a level playing field and a safe basis for the private sector to compete and innovate on functionality, user experience, value-added services and business models.</p>
<h3>A collaborative approach</h3>
<p>To leverage public-private synergies, our approach is explicitly collaborative. We actively engage with all stakeholders, for instance in the context of the Euro Retail Payments Board and our advisory groups on market infrastructures.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251208~4c07c78304.en.html#footnote.7" id="fn7">7</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;We also conduct tests in conjunction with the market rather than building solutions in isolation. Let me give you two examples.</p>
<p>First, in the retail space, we set up a digital euro innovation platform to explore innovations and applications that the digital euro could enable. The first round involved almost 70 participants &ndash; including merchants, fintech companies, start-ups, academia, banks and other payment service providers.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251208~4c07c78304.en.html#footnote.8" id="fn8">8</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;Market participants identified conditional payments, i.e. payments that are triggered automatically when predefined conditions are met, as a key driver of innovation. Using the digital euro&rsquo;s standards and its reservation of funds functionality &ndash; which would allow money to be set aside while a payment is in progress &ndash; payment service providers could offer conditional payments throughout the euro area that go far beyond what is available today. In online shopping transactions, for example, funds could be released to the seller only after the buyer confirms delivery. Reimbursements could be automated and, in the case of delayed services, refunds could be streamlined. Payment service providers would also be able to automate business-to-business payment flows in a standardised way, helping to speed up payments, reduce paperwork and cut costs.</p>
<p>Second, in wholesale markets, the Eurosystem conducted extensive exploratory work in 2024 on settling DLT-based transactions in central bank money. Some 64 participants were involved in real and mock transactions covering a wide range of securities and payments use cases.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251208~4c07c78304.en.html#footnote.9" id="fn9">9</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;With a total of &euro;1.6 billion settled over a six-month period, this was the largest and most comprehensive exploratory work on wholesale DLT settlement in the world to date.</p>
<h3>Technology neutrality</h3>
<p>In adapting our offering of central bank money and supporting the digital transformation of financial services, we are technology neutral. We are not picking winners.</p>
<p>In retail, offering cash in both physical and digital form is in itself an example &ndash; and even a condition &ndash; of technology neutrality. It avoids limiting the choice of paying in central bank money to the payment format. This supports consumers&rsquo; freedom of choice. Discriminating against central bank money in digital payments would, on the contrary, reduce this freedom.</p>
<p>Another example of technology neutrality is that we are designing the digital euro to remain open to new technologies. Take privacy, for instance. The digital euro is designed to make privacy a priority, not least by offering an offline functionality that will offer cash-like privacy. And for online payments, the Eurosystem will only see encrypted codes for the payer and the payee. We will not see any personal information. Moreover, we are committed to keep using the most advanced privacy-enhancing technologies suitable for a system that must reliably and instantaneously process a considerable number of transactions every day.</p>
<p>In wholesale markets, we may see a future where DLT is used in some segments, traditional databases in others, with hybrid architectures in many cases. Our objective is not to oblige market participants to use a particular technological stack, but to ensure that whichever technology they adopt, the system remains safe, integrated and resilient by being connected to central bank money. This is why we will offer central bank money settlement for both DLT-based and traditional transactions. We are also neutral towards private business models and actors, provided they operate within a robust regulatory perimeter. Market participants should be able to innovate, but they must respect prudential and conduct requirements and meet expectations for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism.</p>
<h2>The digital euro: establishing a European solution and a single market for everyday retail payments</h2>
<p>Having presented the key pillars of our approach, namely complementarity between public and private money, public-private collaboration and technology neutrality, let me now discuss in more detail what this approach entails for retail, wholesale and cross-border payments.</p>
<p>In retail payments, the digital euro will ensure all Europeans can use a European solution to pay throughout the euro area, in shops, in ecommerce and from person to person. At the same time, the digital euro will establish a single market for everyday retail payments by making it much easier for providers to scale up private European solutions.</p>
<h3>A digital equivalent of cash</h3>
<p>For decades, cash has provided a universal means of payment that everyone could use for most payments, thanks to its legal tender status. But as commerce becomes increasingly digital &ndash; with online payments, for instance, now accounting for one-third of day-to-day transactions &ndash; the use of cash is declining.</p>
<p>In the absence of an equivalent public option in the digital sphere, the gap has been filled by a few mostly non-European solutions. International card schemes account for two-thirds of card transactions in the euro area. Out of 20 euro area countries, 13 do not even have a domestic card payment solution.</p>
<p>This situation cannot be solved through the interoperability of existing domestic solutions. While such interoperability can help address some challenges, it does not create domestic solutions where they do not exist, nor does it allow existing domestic solutions to expand to use cases they do not currently cover. Interoperability requires each participant to develop functionalities in parallel. This increases costs and complexity, hindering scalability.</p>
<p>The digital euro would be fundamentally new in the European context. It would provide a European digital means of payment in central bank money that would have legal tender status and would thus be accepted throughout the euro area wherever one can pay digitally. For consumers, it would extend the benefits of cash to the digital sphere. And for merchants, it would reduce costs compared with the dominant international payment solutions, both directly and indirectly by increasing merchants&rsquo; negotiating power.</p>
<h3>Preserving the role of banks in financing the economy</h3>
<p>The digital euro has been designed to preserve the role of banks in the financing of the economy. In the euro area, banks assume a key role in this regard and thus in the transmission of monetary policy. We have no intention of disrupting this role. In fact, the digital euro will protect it.</p>
<p>Banks will be at the centre of the digital euro distribution; they will keep the customer relationship and manage the digital euro accounts. This will allow them to retain data that are crucial for assessing the creditworthiness of their clients and thus for their role in financing the economy. And we will prepare with banks so that they are ready to distribute the digital euro. In 2027 we plan to launch a pilot&nbsp;offering banks an opportunity to gain first-hand experience in a simulated digital euro ecosystem. This pilot will not only provide the Eurosystem with valuable insights, but will also allow banks to provide feedback.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251208~4c07c78304.en.html#footnote.10" id="fn10">10</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>Moreover, the digital euro will allow banks to be compensated (they will continue receiving fees), while no longer having to pay the fees charged by international card schemes (as the Eurosystem will cover scheme and settlement costs).</p>
<p>And by offering a convenient payment solution, the digital euro will reduce the risk that the banks&rsquo; customers turn to alternatives. This will reduce the risk of deposit outflows to stablecoins, which could soon represent an alternative to banks as the source of funds for payments with cards and mobile solutions.</p>
<p>Several safeguards have been included in the design of the digital euro to ensure it does not disintermediate banks. First, the digital euro will not be remunerated. Second, a link to their commercial bank account will allow consumers to pay amounts that exceed their digital euro holdings, thereby reducing their incentive to keep high digital euro holdings in the first place. And third, digital euro holding limits will avoid any destabilising deposit outflows.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251208~4c07c78304.en.html#footnote.11" id="fn11">11</a>]</sup></span></p>
<h3><a id="_Hlk215823993"></a>A springboard for European private solutions to expand</h3>
<p>Moreover, the digital euro is a major opportunity for European payment service providers, including banks.</p>
<p>First, co-badging with digital euro would allow existing European payment solutions to expand their reach, without losing transactions for which they are already accepted.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251208~4c07c78304.en.html#footnote.12" id="fn12">12</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;This applies to both physical cards and digital wallets.</p>
<p>Second, the digital euro would provide a single standard across Europe with unparalleled coverage given the digital euro&rsquo;s legal tender status.&nbsp;Using this standard would significantly reduce the cost of expanding the acceptance network of European payment solutions. We have been working on this standard with market participants as part of the Rulebook Development Group.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251208~4c07c78304.en.html#footnote.13" id="fn13">13</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;This standard could be made available shortly after the legislation is adopted and merchants would start to use it even before the digital euro&rsquo;s launch, as they seek to be &ldquo;digital euro-ready&rdquo; when updating their payment terminals.</p>
<p>Third, the digital euro would allow banks to offer new, innovative payment services at scale, for instance using the reservation of funds functionality as I explained earlier.</p>
<p>Overall, this could make it much easier for current European private initiatives to achieve their objectives, whether they are based on cross-border integration like Wero or interoperability like EuroPA. I believe there is no dichotomy between the digital euro and European private initiatives, but instead complementarities and synergies.</p>
<p>To reap these synergies, it is crucial that the digital euro and European private initiatives progress in parallel. By aligning on digital euro standards, while making maximum use of existing standards and building on established infrastructures as much as possible, costs will be minimised and the digital euro will create a single market for digital retail payments.</p>
<h2>Tokenised central bank money: powering an integrated European market for digital assets</h2>
<p>Let me now turn to wholesale payments.</p>
<p>Besides seeking to offer central bank money to settle DLT-based digital asset transactions, we aim to fundamentally upgrade the infrastructure of our capital markets. If we want a future-proof savings and investments union, and if we want Europe to remain competitive, then we must collectively modernise the way financial assets are issued, traded, settled and serviced.</p>
<p>Europe needs to develop a market for digital assets that is based on European infrastructure, euro-denominated settlement assets and EU-wide regulation. This will also protect our strategic autonomy, monetary sovereignty and financial stability.</p>
<h3>Safely unleashing the innovation potential of tokenisation</h3>
<p>A key promise of DLT and tokenisation is to bring the full lifecycle of a financial transaction &ndash; issuance, trading, settlement and custody &ndash; to a single digital environment. By design, this can reduce reconciliation processes, shorten settlement chains and lower operational risk. It can also enable atomic delivery-versus-payment and support trading and settlement on a 24/7 basis, 365 days a year, rather than being constrained by the opening hours of legacy systems.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251208~4c07c78304.en.html#footnote.14" id="fn14">14</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;Furthermore, smart contracts can automate corporate actions and cash flows that today require multiple intermediaries and manual checks.</p>
<p>This explains the significant interest for this technology in the European market. A large share of EU banks are experimenting with DLT applications, while a significant portion have already begun deploying them.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251208~4c07c78304.en.html#footnote.15" id="fn15">15</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>But a key risk is fragmentation. If tokenised payments and finance rest on fragmented pools of private settlement assets, liquidity can splinter and assets cannot be traded across platforms. Market participants may need to hold multiple stablecoins just to pay different counterparties. And in stress situations, the promise of one-to-one convertibility may be tested precisely when it matters most.</p>
<p>Central bank money, by contrast, is not constrained by the business model limits of private tokens. If made usable on DLT platforms, it can support the system in times of stress by elastically providing the ultimate liquidity. This matters not only for safety, but for the practical ability of a tokenised market to function smoothly at high volumes.</p>
<h3>Establishing an integrated European market for digital assets</h3>
<p>However, structural problems cannot be fixed by technology alone.</p>
<p>Europe&rsquo;s post-trade landscape remains fragmented. Simply look at the number of central securities depositories across the EU, which is far higher than in other major jurisdictions. In itself, this would not be a problem, provided infrastructures were seamlessly interoperable and operated under comparable rules. But Europe still has too many operational frictions, legal discrepancies and national practices that make cross-border activity costly and complex.</p>
<p>A recent industry study finds that post-trade fees in Europe remain materially higher than in North America, and that fee schedules are often complex and hard to compare. Fragmentation ultimately shows up in the cost of capital and the attractiveness of European markets.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251208~4c07c78304.en.html#footnote.16" id="fn16">16</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>Tokenisation creates a rare opportunity to design a European market for digital assets that is integrated from the outset, in other words, a digital capital markets union. We must prevent the risk of creating platforms and standards that are incompatible and recreate the market segmentation we are trying to overcome.</p>
<p>We need an enabling framework that reduces legal uncertainty for tokenised securities and supports EU-wide scalability. I therefore welcome the legislative proposals published last week by the European Commission.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251208~4c07c78304.en.html#footnote.17" id="fn17">17</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;They extend, enhance and expand the DLT Pilot Regime. And, in this respect, the idea of a dedicated EU legal framework for tokenised assets &ndash; sometimes described as a &ldquo;28th regime&rdquo; &ndash; captures the direction of travel.</p>
<h3>Supporting Europe&rsquo;s strategic autonomy in digital finance</h3>
<p>Another reason to provide tokenised central bank money is to ensure a digital asset ecosystem can grow in Europe without depending on non-European settlement assets. This is key to avoiding the creation of a similar dependency in wholesale payments to what we have now in retail payments.</p>
<p>If we do not provide a euro-anchored wholesale solution and a European infrastructure for the settlement of digital assets, Europe could find itself importing technology, standards, governance choices and ultimately strategic dependencies. Or worse: the digital assets market could simply fail to achieve scale in Europe and could end up growing elsewhere, which would weaken the international role of the euro and our strategic autonomy. In contrast, offering tokenised central bank money will help European innovation to scale up without outsourcing the monetary anchor.</p>
<p>So how are we implementing this strategy in practice? In July, the ECB&rsquo;s Governing Council approved a dual-track approach to settle DLT-based wholesale transactions in central bank money.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251208~4c07c78304.en.html#footnote.18" id="fn18">18</a>]</sup></span></p>
<h3>Pontes: bridging today and tomorrow</h3>
<p>The first track, also known as Project Pontes, will deliver a regular service for settling DLT transactions in central bank money as early as the third quarter of 2026.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251208~4c07c78304.en.html#footnote.19" id="fn19">19</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>Pontes is designed as a bridge between DLT platforms and our existing TARGET services. This bridge will enable tokenised asset transactions recorded on market DLT platforms to settle in central bank money. It will build on existing TARGET services, so it will maintain the Eurosystem&rsquo;s standards for safety, resilience and efficiency, while being cost-efficient. It will combine the features of the three solutions we used in our exploratory work, which will enable delivery-versus-payment and support automation.</p>
<p>We aim to gradually enhance Pontes with new functionalities following its launch, for instance by offering 24/7 operation and settlement, or by enabling the market to deploy automated smart contracts directly on the Eurosystem DLT.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, Pontes is about ensuring that, whichever DLT market platforms develop, safe euro settlement in central bank money will be available.</p>
<h3>Appia: the future ecosystem</h3>
<p>The second track, Project Appia, will lay the groundwork for an integrated European digital asset ecosystem.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251208~4c07c78304.en.html#footnote.20" id="fn20">20</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;A launch paper to explain our vision will be published in early 2026. We want to explore how a future European digital financial market could operate if central bank money, commercial bank money and assets are able to interact efficiently in a tokenised environment.</p>
<p>Appia will explore two approaches, with the potential to combine them if needed. First, a European shared ledger that brings together central bank money, commercial bank money and other assets on a single platform where market stakeholders provide services. Second, a European network of interoperable platforms that reduces current frictions in the market.</p>
<p>This is also where the public-private partnership becomes tangible. Our role is to foster trust, develop European standards and ensure that the settlement anchor remains solid. The private sector&rsquo;s role is to build the services, liquidity, business models and possibly platforms that make tokenised markets valuable.</p>
<p>If we get this right, Europe can achieve something that is both technologically advanced and economically decisive: a tokenised market that operates at continental scale, with European rules and the euro at its core.</p>
<h2>Cross-border payments: openness with autonomy</h2>
<p>Finally, we must look beyond our own borders.</p>
<p>Too often, cross-border payments still feel like they belong to a different era. They can be slow, expensive and opaque. According to the G20 monitoring framework, the cost of sending a USD 200 remittance averages around 6.5% of the transaction value globally, while the cost of business-to-business cross-border payments averages 1.6% of the transaction value and close to one-third of cross-border retail payments took more than one business day to be settled in 2024.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251208~4c07c78304.en.html#footnote.21" id="fn21">21</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>Structural factors are a significant cause of these issues. Much of the world still relies on correspondent banking chains. This model is inherently complex, as it multiplies intermediaries, compliance checks and points of failure, and it can require multiple currency conversions.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, our objective is to build up European capability by combining openness and improving our payment connections with partners.</p>
<h3>Stablecoin limits</h3>
<p>One possible trajectory is a world in which cross-border payments increasingly depend on one or a handful of global, US-dollar-backed stablecoins distributed through dominant platforms. There are three fundamental concerns with such an outcome.</p>
<p>The first is concentration and operational fragility. If global payments depend on a small number of issuers and technology stacks, operational incidents, governance failures or runs become systemic issues rather than firm-level problems. Stablecoins may promise frictionless transfer but they can also create vulnerabilities in payments.</p>
<p>The second concern is external rule-setting via infrastructure. If the main settlement asset and rails are anchored outside Europe, then Europe&rsquo;s payment outcomes are shaped elsewhere. In a world where payment networks can be weaponised, this is a risk to our economic security.</p>
<p>And third, there are currency substitution risks if the stablecoin ecosystem remains overwhelmingly dollar-based. If these instruments achieve scale via global platforms, they can amplify digital dollarisation dynamics &ndash; especially in regions with weaker currencies, but also by shifting the unit of account and settlement conventions in digital markets. We should avoid Europe&rsquo;s cross-border payments being structurally dependent on private settlement assets denominated in another currency.</p>
<h3>Enhancing cross-border payments</h3>
<p>Against this backdrop, the Eurosystem has explored alternative ways to enhance cross-border payments.</p>
<p>TIPS already acts as a hub for instant payments within the euro area.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251208~4c07c78304.en.html#footnote.22" id="fn22">22</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;And it is open to currencies of European countries outside the euro area, with Sweden and Denmark already using TIPS as a platform to run fast payments in their own currencies, and Norway soon to join. Since October, TIPS also provides the option to make cross-currency payments between the euro area, Sweden and Denmark.</p>
<p>In the near future, TIPS could evolve into a global hub for instant cross-border payments by interlinking with other fast payment systems. The Eurosystem is making progress with its work to connect TIPS with India&rsquo;s Unified Payments Interface &ndash; which has one of the largest instant payment transaction volumes in the world&nbsp;&ndash; and with Nexus Global Payments, which will connect the fast payments systems of Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and India.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251208~4c07c78304.en.html#footnote.23" id="fn23">23</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;We also announced in September that we will start exploring the interlinking of TIPS with Switzerland&rsquo;s fast payments systems,&nbsp;and we are in discussions with other possible partners. The Eurosystem, through Banca d&rsquo;Italia, is also supporting the central banks of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro and North Macedonia in their efforts to develop an instant, multi-currency payments system modelled on TIPS. This &ldquo;TIPS clone&rdquo; is due to become operational in July 2026, after which it will be technically possible to link it up with TIPS.</p>
<p>This strategy will facilitate cross-border payments, making them cheaper, faster and more transparent.</p>
<p>Interlinking can reduce the number of intermediaries, shorten transaction chains and lower costs, as it allows payment service providers to transact without routing payments through a long chain of correspondents.</p>
<p>However, the settlement leg of cross-border payments, by which money moves from the payer&rsquo;s to the payee&rsquo;s account, is also crucial. This is why we are also exploring how tokenised settlement assets could complement interlinking. We can build on the foundation of the BIS Innovation Hub&rsquo;s Project Rialto, which aims to improve instant cross-border payments using central bank money settlement. Other solutions based on tokenised forms of private money can also be explored.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, the digital euro could also act as a connector. It is first and foremost intended for domestic use. But it is also being designed with international use in mind, based on an approach that respects the sovereignty of other countries and mitigates potential risks.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251208~4c07c78304.en.html#footnote.24" id="fn24">24</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>When visiting the euro area temporarily, non-euro area residents would have access to the digital euro through a European payment service provider. Merchants outside the euro area may also be allowed to accept digital euro payments from euro area residents. Moreover, users outside the euro area could be granted permanent access to the digital euro, subject to an agreement between the EU and non-EU countries, and complemented by an arrangement between the ECB and the respective central banks. Appropriate safeguards would be put in place to avoid stoking currency substitution in those countries.</p>
<p>Finally, like TIPS, the digital euro&rsquo;s design includes multi-currency enabling features that would allow non-euro area countries to use the digital euro infrastructure to offer their own digital currencies and facilitate transactions across these currencies.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Let me conclude.</p>
<p>In a rapidly digitalising economy where new technologies are emerging, we need to ensure central bank money remains fit for purpose. This is key for innovation, integration and independence in digital payments and digital finance.</p>
<p>This is of particular importance in the European context. As Mario Draghi has underlined, Europe&rsquo;s problem is that innovation is often blocked by fragmented markets at the scale-up stage, pushing successful firms to seek scale elsewhere. Digital payments are a case in point and we need to avoid digital finance following the same path.</p>
<p>This is highly relevant for Europe&rsquo;s competitiveness. Digital payments and finance stand at the interface between technology and the financial system, which together explain most of the productivity gap between Europe and the United States.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251208~4c07c78304.en.html#footnote.25" id="fn25">25</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>In this context, our strategy is neither state-centric nor hands-off, rather it is built around three principles.</p>
<p>First, central bank money must remain available and usable, also in digital form, to provide stability and trust.</p>
<p>Second, our approach is based on public-private partnership. The Eurosystem provides settlement in central bank money and common standards, while private intermediaries compete and innovate on top of this, delivering services that are innovative and scalable.</p>
<p>Third, we do not decide which technology or business models should prevail. This is up to market participants. The public sector&rsquo;s role is to ensure that our payment systems and our financial system remain robust in the face of technological disruption and that markets for money and assets remain fully integrated.</p>
<p>In retail payments, the digital euro is about ensuring that people in Europe can continue to use public money by complementing cash with its digital equivalent. This keeps pace with the shift of commerce towards digital payments. Its infrastructure, acceptance network and standards will also make it easier for European private solutions to scale up.</p>
<p>In wholesale payments, Pontes in the short term and Appia in the longer term will make it possible to settle digital asset transactions in central bank money. This will provide a safe basis for tokenisation to scale in Europe.</p>
<p>In cross-border payments, we can increase speed and reduce costs by interlinking fast payment systems and exploring innovative settlement arrangements.</p>
<p>The choice, ultimately, is about whether Europe wants to sit on the sidelines watching the next wave of innovative payment solutions, or be a co-architect of an innovative, integrated and resilient digital financial system that has the euro at its core.</p>
<p>By acting now, as part of a public-private partnership, we can play a leading role in the transformation of money and we can embrace innovation. This will support Europe&rsquo;s competitiveness, resilience and sovereignty, while delivering tangible benefits for European people and businesses.</p>

<p>Decentralised ledger technology allows information to be shared and kept synchronised across a network. Tokenisation is the process of converting or issuing assets as programmable tokens. Tokenisation allows programmable tokens to carry two sets of information at the same time: information about the asset itself (what it is, who issued it, who holds it, etc.) and the rules about how this token can be used (who can hold it, how it can change ownership, as well as more complex rules compiled into smart contracts).</p>

<title>Euronext Unlocks New Liquidity Opportunities For Equities With The Launch Of Auction Volume Discovery (AVD)</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/euronext-unlocks-new-liquidity-opportunities-for-equities-with-the-launch-of-auc-2025128/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/euronext-unlocks-new-liquidity-opportunities-for-equities-with-the-launch-of-auc-2025128/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Euronext today announced the launch of its new Auction Volume Discovery (AVD) order type for equities, enhancing Euronext&rsquo;s offering around opening and closing auctions. Through a seamless and integrated workflow, this new service addresses growing client demand for innovative ways to interact with liquidity during auctions.</p>
<p>As Europe&rsquo;s leading capital market infrastructure, Euronext operates the largest auctions mechanism in Europe. Auctions represent over 25% of consolidated lit volumes on Euronext stocks, and have benefited from long-term growth as strategic liquidity events. In 2024, Euronext&rsquo;s average daily auction imbalance exceeded &euro;200 million in unmatched liquidity, around 6% of the volume traded in auctions, highlighting the significant opportunity available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Auction Volume Discovery orders will allow participants to leverage the auction imbalance as well as provide them with unique block trading opportunities.</p>
<p>Market members will be able to submit non-displayed Auction Volume Discovery orders throughout the trading day. These orders will trade at the official opening or closing auction price without contributing to its determination process.</p>
<p>At the opening or closing auction uncrossing, Auction Volume Discovery orders will first match against the auction imbalance. The remaining AVD orders will then execute against other AVD orders. Any unexecuted AVD order will expire at the conclusion of the respective auction.</p>
<p><span>Nicolas Rivard, Global Head of Cash Equity and Data Services at Euronext, said:</span>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;The launch of the Auction Volume Discovery order type for equities is an important milestone in our Innovate for Growth 2027 strategic plan for cash trading. This new solution underlines our commitment to expand trading opportunities for our clients while enhancing liquidity across our European markets. We are proud to leverage our leadership in trading in Europe to deliver added value to market participants."</em></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The Bank of England chairs the London Foreign Exchange Joint Standing Committee (FXJSC), which is a forum for discussion of the wholesale foreign exchange market. The FXJSC is made up of market participants, infrastructure providers and the UK financial regulators.</span></p>
<p>Date of meeting: 25 September 2025</p>
<p>Time: 2pm &ndash; 4pm | Location: Bank of England, 20 Moorgate, London, EC2R 6DA</p>

<h2 id="chapter-0">Minutes</h2>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-0">Item 1: Welcome and Apologies</h3>
<p>Andrea Rosen (Chair, Bank of England) confirmed that she had taken over as Chair from Vicky Saporta, following Vicky&rsquo;s recent announcement. Ms Rosen noted apologies from Alan Barnes (Financial Conduct Authority), Galina Dimitrova (The Investment Association), Philippe Lintern (Bank of England), Rajesh Venkataramani (Goldman Sachs), Richard Bibbey (HSBC) and Sophie Rutherford (State Street).</p>
<p>Ms Rosen welcomed Meera Chandan (JP Morgan) and Timothy Graf (State Street) as guest presenters, and Oliver McCausland (Financial Conduct Authority) and Hugo Gordon (The Investment Association) as alternates. She also welcomed Tsvetoslav Tsonev (Aviva Investors) and Nick Singh (M&amp;G) as observers.</p>
<p>Ms Rosen announced that Jatin Vara (BlackRock) had joined the Committee. She also flagged that Sarah Collins (UBS Asset Management) had stepped down from the Committee and thanked Ms Collins for her valuable contributions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-1">Item 2:</h3>
<p>The minutes of the 26 June 2025 meeting were approved.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-2">Item 3:</h3>
<p>Stephen Jefferies, Meera Chandan (JP Morgan) and Timothy Graf (State Street) presented an update on recent market developments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms Chandan highlighted that economic growth, particularly in the US, had been resilient and market volatility had eased. This environment had supported procyclical currencies (those that tend to strengthen when global growth prospects improve) which contributed to a weaker US dollar. Ms Chandan also noted that recent fiscal policy trends and monetary policy were key drivers influencing global currency performance.</p>
<p>Mr Graf gave an overview of asset manager flows into UK and US assets, noting that overall risk appetite had remained firm, with equity allocations (relative to bonds) returning to their highest levels since January 2025. Mr Graf also discussed recent FX hedging activity and highlighted some of the differences between UK and US-based investors&rsquo; hedging behaviour.</p>
<p>The Committee discussed recent drivers of global bond market moves and inflation dynamics in the UK and the US. Members also considered how these developments &ndash; along with the expected impact of tariffs - could influence the FX market and the broader global economic outlook.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-3">Item 4:</h3>
<p>Munalula Lisimba (Bank of England) presented the key findings of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/london-foreign-exchange-joint-standing-committee/results-of-the-semi-annual-fx-turnover-survey-april-2025"><span>April 2025 FXJSC Turnover Survey</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span>Mr Lisimba noted that daily average FX turnover had reached a record &pound;4,045 billion, which was the largest survey-on-survey increase since 2013. Mr Lisimba added that FX spot and options had been the main contributors to the growth of FX turnover in London.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-4">Item 5:</h3>
<p>Jeremy Smart (XTX) gave an overview on the use of AI in the FX market, with a particular focus on the use of deep learning and machine learning. Mr Smart outlined the potential implications AI could have on FX market making and noted that the development of deep learning models required significant computing power and investment. Mr Smart added that high barriers to entry could lead to further bifurcation of the FX market, where only a small number of participants are able to compete effectively in the primary market.</p>
<p>Mr Smart further noted that increased automation could reduce the need for lower-skilled coding roles, as AI systems become capable of performing many of these tasks. In contrast, demand is likely to rise for highly skilled technical specialists who can develop, manage, and oversee advanced AI systems. The Committee also discussed the impact AI could have on current technology and compliance considerations for regulated firms.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-5">Item 6:</h3>
<p>Natalie Lovell (Bank of England) provided an update on the work of the Global Foreign Exchange Committee (GFXC). It was noted that the GFXC Secretariat would collaborate with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) Secretariat to co-author an article on the key findings from the FX settlement risk section of the 2025 BIS Triennial Survey.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk210308750"></a></p>
<p>Ms Lovell also noted that the GFXC FX Settlement Risk Working Group would produce a discussion paper on the impact on the FX market as a result of the upcoming UK, EU, and Swiss move to T+1 securities settlement.</p>
<p>Lisa Dukes (Dukes and King) provided an update on the GFXC Motivation for Code Adherence Working Group. Ms Dukes explained that the group had been divided into three subgroups which were focused on: i) asset manager and hedge fund outreach, ii) engagement with corporates, and iii) FX Global Code training. Ms Dukes noted that the Working Group was also aiming to raise its media presence and increase participation in industry events - particularly through collaboration with trade associations and corporate networks.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-6">Item 7:</h3>
<p>Oliver McCausland provided an update on a recent FCA/Bank of England guidance consultation on the UK European Market Infrastructure Regulation (UK EMIR) reporting framework, which governs how derivatives are reported to trade repositories. Mr McCausland noted that the consultation included guidance on how to accurately report FX swaps. Mr McCausland added that the consultation had closed, the responses were being analysed and the FCA would publish finalised Q&amp;As in due course.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-7">Item 8:</h3>
<p>Sharon Blackman (Chair of the Legal Sub-Committee) noted that the Legal Sub-Committee had met on 17 September. The discussion had included the 29 September 2025 deadline for EU member states to align national laws with the revised Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID).</p>
<p>James Kaye (Chair of the Operations Sub-Committee) noted that the Operations Sub-Committee had met on 18 September. The Operations Sub-committee had continued to develop a communications playbook for use during systemic issues in the FX market. There had also been a presentation from the Bank of England on proposals to extend RT2 and CHAPS settlement hours<sup><sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/minutes/2025/september/fxjsc-main-committee-meeting-25-september-2025#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup></sup>. Mr Kaye also noted that the Principles for Managing an FX Settlement Outage (CLS Playbook) had also been published on the CMORG website on 27 August.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-8">Item 9:</h3>
<p>Shivani Khetia (Bank of England) provided an overview of topics discussed by other local FX committees in 2025 to support the FXJSC&rsquo;s forward agenda planning for 2026. The Committee shared their experiences from other local FX committees and flagged a range of potential discussion topics for 2026, including cryptocurrency, stablecoins and the implications of T+1 Settlement on the FX market. It was noted that Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&amp;I) initiatives would also remain central to the FXJSC&rsquo;s forward agenda.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Lori J. Schock, who has served as the Director of the Office of Investor Education and Assistance (OIEA) since 2009, will retire from the agency at the end of December.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have known Lori for decades, when I was a Commissioner and now as Chairman, and I have witnessed firsthand her unwavering commitment to provide America&rsquo;s investors with invaluable information to help them make better informed investing decisions,&rdquo; said SEC Chairman Paul S. Atkins. &ldquo;She has a unique ability to make a deep connection with everyday investors explaining the most complex investing terms in a way they can understand. Her dedication to educating investors has been a touchstone for the agency. I wish her all the best in her future endeavors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under her leadership, Ms. Schock has enhanced OIEA&rsquo;s presence in the financial literacy community and has increased the SEC&rsquo;s investor education outreach and assistance efforts. Some highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building the SEC&rsquo;s Investor.gov website, which more than 8 million Americans use annually to check the background of their investment professional and access financial planning tools and resources to help them invest wisely and protect their money.</li>
<li>Creating Investor Alerts and Bulletins to provide investors with timely information on how to avoid the latest investment scams and to help educate investors on current investment topics and trends.</li>
<li>Writing numerous&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investor.gov/additional-resources/spotlight/directors-take">Director&rsquo;s Take</a>&nbsp;articles to provide investors with tips and information on topics, such as building wealth and protecting their retirement money.</li>
<li>Overseeing the handling of hundreds of thousands of investor questions and complaints through the SEC&rsquo;s investor assistance program.</li>
<li>Spearheading efforts to provide creative ways to reach investors, such as through the SEC&rsquo;s decade-long public service campaign, the HoweyCoins fake ICO website and HoweyTrade investment program, and informational videos on topics, such as the power of compounding and the advantages of adding a trusted contact person to a brokerage account.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;It has been an absolute privilege and honor to serve with Chairman Atkins and such esteemed Chairmen, Commissioners and colleagues throughout my career at the SEC,&rdquo; said Ms. Schock. &ldquo;I am so proud of the positive, impactful work of the entire OIEA team as they truly make a difference in investors&rsquo; lives. I know they will carry on their important work and continue to be a champion to assist, educate and protect investors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ms. Schock previously was Associate Director at the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority&rsquo;s Investor Education Foundation and Office of Investor Education, and before that, was Director of Outreach at the Center for Audit Quality.</p>
<p>She joined the SEC in 2001 as a Staff Attorney in OIEA. She also served as Special Counsel to the Director from 2002-2006 and as Acting Director and Deputy Director from 2006-2007.</p>
<p>A member of the Colorado bar, Ms. Schock received her J.D. from the University of Akron School of Law while also earning her Master of Taxation from the University of Akron College of Business. She received her B.A. from Furman University.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Sets Out Landmark Package To Boost UK Investment Culture</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li><span>The FCA has set out a suite of measures to empower retail investment, reinforce wholesale markets and maintain the UK&rsquo;s position as a world-leading financial centre.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p>With new rules for investment product information, the FCA is playing its part to build a stronger investment culture, supporting firms to innovate and make investing more engaging for consumers. And the FCA is seeking views to make sure regulation supports consumers to invest with confidence.</p>
<p>Proposals to enhance how firms classify their clients will give confidence to firms when they deal with professional investors, drawing a line so wholesale markets can remain agile and innovative.</p>
<p>The regulator has worked closely with industry and consumer groups to deliver practical policy that moves the dial on risk.</p>
<p>Simon Walls, executive director of markets at the FCA, said:</p>
<p>'Today&rsquo;s measures support investment risk culture right along the spectrum. They ensure that firms can compete to give retail customers material that informs and engages them. They also draw a brighter line for professional markets, defined by contracting parties, informed consent and regulation that is proportionate to that.'</p>
<h2>Making it easier for consumers to understand investments</h2>
<p>In retail investment disclosures, the FCA will make a decisive shift away from prescriptive and complex templates that consumers don&rsquo;t find useful. This gives firms more freedom to put the consumer first, innovate, and help their customers understand potential returns as well as costs and risks. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA is also seeking views on how longer-term regulation can keep up with the evolving retail investment landscape and help shift the dial on risk appetite, to give consumers confidence to access investments that meet their needs and benefit from the potential returns. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Distinguishing between professional and retail</h2>
<p>The FCA is setting a clearer boundary between retail and professional investors, allowing firms to deal with professional investors with confidence operating outside retail regulations. This will free up firms to innovate and offer a more diverse range of products to truly experienced clients with the resources to bear more of the risks. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The threshold to qualify as a professional investor will remain high, so only those with experience, advice or the ability to bear risk are taken out of retail protections, such as the Consumer Duty, that they don&rsquo;t need. High standards in classification mean that wholesale regulation remains proportionate and firms are freed from unnecessary guardrails.</p>
<p>Proposals remove some arbitrary tests and give firms more responsibility to get it right. This includes a new way for wealthy and experienced individuals to opt out of retail protections and streamline how firms assess professional investors.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ol>
<li>Rules for targeted support will be set out in the coming days. Elsewhere, the FCA supports the industry-led campaign that will help to explain the benefits of investing.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/consultation-papers/cp25-36-client-categorisation-conflicts-interest" title="CP25/36: Client categorisation and conflicts of interest">CP25/36: Client categorisation and conflicts of interest</a>: these proposals would allow firms to confidently operate with professional clients who don&rsquo;t need retail protections. However, the regime only works if firms can demonstrate that their clients genuinely meet the threshold of a professional client and the clients give informed consent. The FCA has recently published findings from its supervisory work to ensure firms do this well, including:<ol>
<li>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-warns-investors-cfds-risk-losing-out-protections" title="FCA warns investors in CFDs risk losing out on protections">warning</a>&nbsp;for investors in contracts for difference.</li>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/eexs-nordic-power-derivatives-market-shows-consistent-liquidity-growth-2025128/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The European Energy Exchange (EEX) reports steady growth of trading volumes on the EEX Nordic Power derivatives market since the start of the comprehensive liquidity programme on 1 September. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Traded volumes throughout the months of September to November significantly exceeded previous levels in 2025 and show a +210% growth over the same period last year (7.2 TWh Sep-Nov 2025 versus 2.3 TWh Sep-Nov 2024). Reflecting this expansion, EEX&rsquo;s net Open Interest for Nordic Power grew by 49.7% YoY, reaching the highest value in 15 months. In addition, the net Open Interest in the SE2 and SE3 zones now both surpassed the milestone of 1 TWh. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the first three months of the programme, 11 out of the 13 EEX Nordic areas registered trades, including first trades in the Norwegian NO3, NO4, NO5 as well as the Swedish SE1 and SE3 zones. In addition, November saw the highest number of trades executed in the past two years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>EEX has also extended its Nordic Power Open Interest scheme until 31 March, which now has no minimum trading volume requirement in order to provide wider support for all trading participants. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Peter Reitz, CEO of EEX, comments: &ldquo;<em>It&rsquo;s very positive to see the growth of the overall trading volume in only a few months, as well as the engagement of the whole trading community, including the international participants who have been with EEX on other markets. We have now updated our liquidity programme to extend support to an even wider range of trading members. We are looking forward to further growth in liquidity in the Nordics.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>EEX&rsquo;s product offering for the region includes both Nordic System Price contracts, the so-called Zonal Futures with price determination for each Nordic delivery area, and Implied EPADs, a combination of Zonal Futures and the Nordic System Price Futures, which provide the benefits of the location spread. This setup reduces capital requirements through cross-margining effects.&nbsp;<br /><br />The steadily growing EEX member base on the Nordic power derivatives market covers both European and US-based market participants. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Open Interest (OI) is the total number of unsettled futures and options in a given market, indicating the interest level and liquidity of this market.</p>

<title>Nigerian Federal Government, Nigeria SEC, NGX Group Forge Unified Direction On Capital Gains Tax Reform</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/nigerian-federal-government-nigeria-sec-ngx-group-forge-unified-direction-on-c-2025128/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/nigerian-federal-government-nigeria-sec-ngx-group-forge-unified-direction-on-c-2025128/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Federal Government has inaugurated the National Tax Policy Implementation Committee (NTPIC), marking a deliberate shift toward a more predictable and market-aligned rollout of the newly enacted capital-gains-tax (CGT) provisions. The move follows extensive technical engagements with key capital-market institutions, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX Group), reflecting policymakers&rsquo; recognition of the market&rsquo;s role in sustaining liquidity, price discovery and long-term capital formation.</p>
<p>Chaired by leading tax and fiscal-policy expert Joseph Tegbe, the committee has been tasked with steering the implementation process toward clarity, investor protection and policy coherence. Its mandate includes ensuring transparent guidelines, broad stakeholder consultation and an execution framework that minimizes market disruption while reinforcing confidence among domestic and foreign investors.</p>
<p>Tegbe said the government would avoid policies that risk disrupting market activity or business investment. &ldquo;Implementation of the new tax laws will be fair, transparent and humane. We will not roll out these policies in a way that cripples businesses or investors. Stakeholder engagement will be central to this process,&rdquo; he said at the inauguration.</p>
<p>The shift follows sustained engagements by NGX Group and the SEC, during which market operators outlined the potential implications of a rapid CGT rollout on liquidity, investor sentiment and the market&rsquo;s competitiveness at a time when Nigeria is seeking deeper pools of domestic and foreign capital.</p>
<p>Temi Popoola, GMD and CEO of NGX Group, commended the government&rsquo;s approach, noting that the group, in collaboration with the SEC, has consistently advocated for a data driven approach that balances fiscal objectives with the need to preserve market depth. &ldquo;We support the modernisation of Nigeria&rsquo;s tax system, but reforms of this scale must be carefully calibrated to protect liquidity, sustain participation and maintain competitiveness,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Our engagements with government have focused on ensuring that implementation supports the capital market&rsquo;s role in long-term investment and economic growth&rdquo;. Popoola added that global competitiveness hinges not only on policy intent but also on the precision of execution, particularly for emerging markets seeking cross-border flows.</p>
<p>The government&rsquo;s consultations intensified after the Honorable Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy, Wale Edun, visited NGX Group, where market operators outlined the potential unintended consequences of an abrupt CGT rollout.</p>
<p>Analysts view the inauguration of the NTPIC as a constructive signal to investors, indicating that authorities intend to anchor fiscal reforms in evidence and consultation, rather than speed alone.</p>
<p>Both SEC and NGX Group have pledged continued collaboration with the committee to ensure that the eventual CGT implementation supports confidence, broadens participation and aligns with long-term capital-market development objectives</p>

<title>ICE Mortgage Monitor: Mortgage Refinance Retention Hits Multi-Year High As Falling Rates Spur Activity Among Recently Originated Loans</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ice-mortgage-monitor-mortgage-refinance-retention-hits-multi-year-high-as-falli-2025128/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ICE Mortgage Technology, neutral provider of a robust end-to-end mortgage platform and part of Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), today released its December 2025 ICE Mortgage Monitor Report. The latest analysis reveals servicer refinance retention rose to a 3.5-year high in Q3 2025 as falling interest rates expose homeowner eagerness to reduce monthly payments for lower returns than in past cycles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Modest rate relief this fall has driven mortgage application volumes to multi-year highs, showing the outsized impact that incremental affordability improvements have on borrower behavior and servicer retention opportunities,&rdquo; said Andy Walden, Head of Mortgage and Housing Market Research at ICE. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re now seeing the highest concentration of rate-and-term refinances in nearly five years, almost entirely driven by borrowers holding 2023-2025 vintage loans. Notably, the market has become more rate sensitive as hundreds of thousands of borrowers move in and out of refinance incentive with small daily rate shifts. This behavior shows how quickly demand can return when affordability improves, and it highlights just how closely households are watching rates as they try to manage monthly costs and access equity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Key findings from the December Mortgage Monitor include:</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li><span>Refinance retention hit a 3.5-year high, led by non-bank servicers</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="bwmarginl1">Refinance retention reached a 3.5-year high (28%) in Q3 2025, with servicers retaining more than half of borrowers refinancing out of 2024 vintage loans. Rate-and-term retention rose to 37%, one of the highest points in the past decade, while cash-out refinance retention rose to a more modest 23%, reflecting the challenge of identifying and retaining equity-seeking borrowers.</p>
<p class="bwmarginl1">Non-banks retained refinancing borrowers at roughly three times the rate of banks (35% versus 13%). Retention was highest among FHA and VA mortgages (36%), trailed by GSE (25%) and portfolio-held loans (23%) and privately securitized loans (6%).</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li><span>Rate-and-term refinances dominated activity as more borrowers move back &ldquo;in the money&rdquo;</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="bwmarginl1">Rate-and-term refinances accounted for 62% of all refinance activity in October, the highest share in nearly five years. An estimated 95% of rate-and-term refinances in September and October involved 2023&ndash;2025-era loans, with the average refinancer carrying a loan balance of $505,000 and a credit score around 762. On average, they reduced their mortgage rate by 0.92 percentage points, translating to an average monthly savings of about $200.</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li><span>Second-lien home equity withdrawals surged to 18-year high</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="bwmarginl1">Second-lien home equity loan (HEL) withdrawals climbed to their strongest level since 2007 in Q3 2025 as falling short-term rates made tapping equity more affordable. With millions of homeowners still locked into historically low first-lien rates, many are opting to access equity through HELs or HELOCs rather than refinancing their first mortgage.</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li><span>Home affordability is at its best levels in nearly 3 years, but remains stretched</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="bwmarginl1">In mid-November, mortgage rates averaged 6.25%, bringing the monthly principal and interest payment for a median-priced home to $2,126. That payment equals 29.7% of the median household income, the lowest since early 2023.</p>
<p>&ldquo;ICE&rsquo;s 2025 Borrower Insights Survey found that 78% of borrowers only shop one or two options before choosing a lender,&rdquo; said Tim Bowler, President of ICE Mortgage Technology. &ldquo;In a sensitive rate environment, this limited shopping behavior amplifies the importance of being first to reach motivated borrowers. ICE Mortgage Technology&rsquo;s integrated mortgage platform and deep data and analytics enable mortgage professionals to efficiently identify financing opportunities that benefit borrowers and act quickly to retain their business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The full December Mortgage Monitor report contains a deeper analysis of mortgage origination trends, payment performance trends, and housing market trends featuring ICE Home Price Index (HPI) data.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="mfn-preamble">
<p><strong>Scila AB, a leading international provider of innovative risk and surveillance solutions, today announced that the firm has been named Best Market Risk Provider at the prestigious American Financial Technology Awards (AFTAs) 2025, hosted by Waters Technology.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mfn-body">
<p>The award recognizes Scila's ability to deliver innovative technology that solves day-to-day, real-world challenges in the capital markets. This respected recognition validates Scila&rsquo;s strategic decision to challenge traditional reliance on siloed systems with a high-performance, unified, and multi-asset architecture.<br /><br />The winning solution, Scila Risk, is recognized for its high-performance technology that masters real-time risk management across multiple asset classes. This capability directly delivers commercial benefits, such as the ability to optimize collateral use, unlocking revenue-generating capital. The use of the highly effective Position Limits module adds a key component, offering clients a flexible entry point to improved risk management with regulatory compliance, as it can be deployed either fully integrated or as a standalone solution.<br /><em><br /></em><em>&ldquo;This is yet another prestigious award that validates our architectural strength,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;commented Mikko Andersson, CEO of Scila.&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;We remain the nimble speedboat challenging the large tankers in the industry. By delivering a unified, real-time platform for multi-asset risk management, we give clients substantial commercial benefits, not just optimizing working capital, but also giving deep insights into their business that can generate revenue.&rdquo;</em><br /><br />Bj&ouml;rn Thornquist, CTO of Scila, added:&nbsp;<em>"Our technology&rsquo;s core is built on a single, high-performance architecture that masters both Surveillance and Risk. It is this fundamental design choice that enables us to deliver true multi-asset coverage and granular, real-time risk calculations in one system. This is the difference between simply reporting risk and actively controlling it."</em><br /><br />The AFTAs success, hosted by the respected Waters Technology, follows a period of significant achievement for the firm. Earlier this fall, Scila Risk was named Enterprise Risk Software of the Year at the Energy Risk Asia Awards, and the firm improved its place in the Chartis RiskTech100 global ranking by climbing 18 spots, demonstrating consistent industry recognition of Scila&rsquo;s dual excellence in Surveillance and Risk Management.</p>

<p><a href="https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4573292-1&amp;h=2146208071&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.broadridge.com%2F&amp;a=Broadridge+Financial+Solutions%2C+Inc." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.</a>&nbsp;(NYSE: BR), a global&nbsp;<span>Fintech</span>&nbsp;leader, today announced a major advancement in its Global Proxy modernization program with the successful migration of its Shareholder Disclosure Hub (SDH) to&nbsp;<a href="https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4573292-1&amp;h=3467862744&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2F&amp;a=Amazon+Web+Services" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services</a>&nbsp;(AWS). This latest milestone enhances the platform's resilience, performance, and security while expanding its global reach, now including the key markets of Singapore and South Africa across the EMEA and APAC regions.</p>
<p>"This significant investment in our proxy and shareholder disclosure infrastructure, powered by AWS, provides enhanced security, resilience, and operational efficiency for our clients," said Demi Derem, SVP, Investor Communications Solutions International at Broadridge. "We remain committed to continuous innovation and client value, ensuring our solutions evolve with the needs of global capital markets while providing the robust, scalable foundation required to support shareholder transparency mandates worldwide."</p>
<p>The migration to AWS represents a comprehensive re-engineering of the SDH platform. The new cloud-native architecture delivers substantial improvements in performance, stability, scalability, and security, leveraging multiple AWS Regions and Broadridge's Managed Cloud Architecture Standards, which are certified to Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) STAR Level 2.</p>
<p>With these enhancements, the platform further reduces operational complexity for market participants by supporting shareholder disclosure requirements across all SRD II markets in the European Economic Area (EEA), as well as Australia, Hong Kong, the United Kingdom, and the newly added markets of Singapore and South Africa. This expanded, unified solution enables institutional investors, intermediaries, and issuers to meet regulatory disclosure obligations efficiently and securely across multiple jurisdictions&mdash;strengthening transparency and promoting broader shareholder democracy.</p>

<title>CoinShares 2026 Outlook: Digital Assets Move From Disruption To Integration - Flagship Research Report Charts The Rise Of 'Hybrid Finance' As Blockchain Merges With Traditional Financial Infrastructure</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/coinshares-2026-outlook-digital-assets-move-from-disruption-to-integration-fl-2025128/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/coinshares-2026-outlook-digital-assets-move-from-disruption-to-integration-fl-2025128/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When Bitcoin launched in 2009, it promised to bypass banks, governments and intermediaries. Fifteen years later, something unexpected has happened: the world's largest asset manager is issuing tokenised funds on public blockchains, J.P. Morgan is launching tokenised deposits on Ethereum, and the US government holds Bitcoin in a strategic reserve.</p>
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://coinshares.com/insights/research-data/2026-outlook/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">In its 2026 Digital Asset Outlook published today</a>,<b>&nbsp;CoinShares International Limited (Nasdaq Stockholm: CS; US OTCQX: CNSRF)&nbsp;</b>argues this convergence, not disruption, will define the years ahead. The report introduces 'hybrid finance' as the merging of crypto ecosystems with traditional financial systems, creating infrastructure neither industry could build alone.</p>
<p><b>"Digital assets are no longer operating outside the traditional economy,"</b>&nbsp;said&nbsp;<b>Jean-Marie Mognetti, CEO of CoinShares</b>.&nbsp;<b>"They are increasingly embedded within it. If 2025 was the year of the graceful return, 2026 looks positioned to be a year of consolidation into the real economy."</b></p>
<p><b>Hybrid Finance Takes Shape</b></p>
<p>The scale of integration is now measurable. Stablecoin transaction volumes rival Visa and Mastercard combined, with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent projecting a US$3 trillion market by 2030. Tokenised assets, led by private credit and US Treasuries, have more than doubled in 2025. A single DeFi lending protocol, AAVE, holds enough liquidity to rank among America's fifty largest banks.</p>
<p>BlackRock's BUIDL tokenised money market fund, J.P. Morgan's tokenised deposits on Base, and PayPal's PYUSD stablecoin signal that traditional finance is no longer observing from the sidelines, it is building on public blockchains.</p>
<p><b>Bitcoin Enters the Mainstream</b></p>
<p>Bitcoin's transformation mirrors this shift. US spot ETFs have attracted over US$90 billion. Corporate treasuries have accumulated more than one million BTC across 190 public companies, nearly four times the count from eighteen months ago. Options markets have matured, retirement plan restrictions have lifted, and the US government has established a strategic Bitcoin reserve.</p>
<p>The report forecasts continued mainstreaming in 2026: major wirehouses formally opening Bitcoin ETF allocations, at least one major 401(k) provider enabling access, and custody banks providing direct institutional settlement services.</p>
<p>On price, CoinShares outlines three potential scenarios depending on macro conditions: a soft landing with productivity gains could push Bitcoin beyond US$150,000; subdued but stable growth suggests a US$110,000&ndash;140,000 range; while stagflation or recession would create near-term pressure before recovery.</p>
<p><b>Platform Competition Intensifies</b></p>
<p>The race to become the settlement layer for hybrid finance is accelerating. Ethereum remains dominant, with US$13 billion in ETF net inflows and institutional experiments including J.P. Morgan's deployment on Base network. Solana has staged a dramatic comeback, growing stablecoin supply from US$1.8 billion to US$12 billion since January 2024. Hyperliquid, a derivatives platform with just eleven employees, has processed nearly US$3 trillion in cumulative volume, and returns 99% of revenue to token holders through daily buybacks.</p>
<p><b>"2026 will be defined by a financial system quietly rearchitecting itself around public blockchains and digital settlement layers,"</b>&nbsp;said&nbsp;<b>James Butterfill, Head of Research at CoinShares</b>.&nbsp;<b>"Markets, regulators and institutions now treat crypto as part of the financial industry rather than an exception to it."</b></p>
<p><b>Regulatory Divergence Creates Opportunity</b></p>
<p>The report charts distinct regulatory philosophies emerging globally. The EU's MiCA framework now provides comprehensive legal certainty across issuance, custody and trading. In the US, the GENIUS Act classifies payment stablecoins as non-securities with Treasury backing requirements, creating new demand for US government debt from global stablecoin holders. Asia is pivoting toward Basel-inspired prudential standards, with Hong Kong finalising crypto capital requirements effective January 2026.</p>
<p><b>Industry Transformation</b></p>
<p>Two additional shifts signal structural change. Bitcoin miners have announced US$65 billion in HPC and AI contracts with hyperscalers, transforming these companies from pure miners into diversified compute infrastructure providers. And prediction markets have achieved mainstream relevance, Intercontinental Exchange, parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, made a strategic investment of up to US$2 billion in Polymarket, whose market odds now function as a well-calibrated forecasting system rivalling traditional polling.</p>

<title>PRISM, Pepper Advantage’s Credit and Mortgage Servicing Platform, Goes Live</title>

<ul>
<li><i>End-to-end platform automates workflows across the entire credit lifecycle and provides real-time data analysis for lenders, institutional investors and credit managers</i></li>
<li><i>Over &pound;1.5 billion in AUM representing over 17,000 loans for 12 clients now live</i></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.pepper-advantage.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Pepper Advantage</a>, a global credit management and technology company, today announced that&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.pepper-advantage.com/resources/prism-powering-the-future-with-innovation-data-and-customer-centric-technology" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">PRISM</a>, its proprietary, end-to-end credit management platform, has officially launched. Purpose built in-house, PRISM unifies portfolio loan data and analysis, workflow management, and servicing tools in one place, helping lenders, managers and investors optimise portfolio performance while delivering better outcomes for borrowers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PRISM combines a fully integrated mortgage management engine with advanced analytics, real-time data visualisation and automated workflows. It gives users earlier visibility of emerging risks, enhances operational efficiency by reducing manual and inefficient processes, and equips firms with the reporting capabilities required to meet regulatory expectations. Crucially, the platform also provides an intuitive digital interface that can replace fragmented legacy systems with a single, user-friendly access point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PRISM&rsquo;s cutting-edge technology has already created strong market demand. Pepper Advantage has migrated over a dozen portfolios representing more than &pound;1.5 billion in assets under management to the platform. This includes recently completing its largest migration to date of an internal, nearly &pound;400 million portfolio. Over 17,000 loans are currently managed on PRISM across the UK and Spain on behalf of over a dozen clients, including eight leading banks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These numbers continue to grow as PRISM is fully integrated into banking infrastructure, enabling the migration of data from multiple banks on a daily basis. PRISM&rsquo;s data architecture cleanses this data and aggregates it on behalf of the end investor, enabling the securitization of portfolios aggregated from different originators &ndash; a huge innovation in an industry that still relies on outdated systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Fraser Gemmell, Group CEO, Pepper Advantage, said</b>: &ldquo;PRISM is hitting milestone after milestone, with demand far exceeding expectation. It offers the seamless, tech-driven experience clients crave while supporting an improved borrower experience. Our team has created the new standard in credit management technology, one that allows us to better serve customers, opens up new direct lending opportunities, and provides a faster go-to-market path for both traditional and non-traditional lenders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PRISM&rsquo;s progress follows a period of technology investment by Pepper Advantage into its data, software and AI capabilities. The platform sits at the centre of the company&rsquo;s strategy to modernise credit markets and supports portfolios of all sizes and credit types, with residential mortgages, equity release and unsecured loans now available. Buy-to-let and other offerings will be launched in 2026.&nbsp; PRISM can also be&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.pepper-advantage.com/resources/kravings-the-uks-first-app-built-just-for-personal-loans-goes-live" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">white-labelled</a>&nbsp;and configured to fit seamlessly within both&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.pepper-advantage.com/resources/paydown-the-app-designed-to-help-borrowers-break-up-with-credit-cards-goes-live" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">new</a>&nbsp;and existing systems, offering a modern user interface without the need for long and expensive in-house development.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li>Bank of China&rsquo;s latest issuance expands its total outstanding listings on Nasdaq Dubai to approximately USD 1.9 billion</li>
<li>Total outstanding value of debt securities listed on Nasdaq Dubai now exceeds USD 145 billion</li>
</ul>
<p>Nasdaq Dubai has welcomed the listing of a USD 500 million floating-rate bond issued by Bank of China Dubai Branch under its USD 40 billion Medium Term Note Programme. The three-year conventional bond, maturing on 24 November 2028, set a record for the narrowest issuance spread of U.S. dollar bonds with a three-year maturity among Chinese banks, highlighting the international market's strong recognition of Bank of China's credit strength and financing capabilities</p>
<p>The issuance underscores the strong and growing presence of Chinese financial institutions on Nasdaq Dubai and reflects continued investor confidence in Bank of China&rsquo;s credit strength and global funding strategy. With this listing, the total outstanding value of Bank of China&rsquo;s debt instruments listed on Nasdaq Dubai has reached approximately USD 1.9 billion across multiple tranches and maturities.</p>
<p>To mark the listing, Consul General of China in Dubai H.E. Ou Boqian<b> </b>rang the market-opening bell at Nasdaq Dubai, in the presence of Hamed Ali, CEO of Nasdaq Dubai and Dubai Financial Market (DFM), and senior executives from both organisations.</p>
<p><b>Consul General of China in Dubai </b><b>H.E. </b><b>O</b><b>u</b><b> Boqian emphasized</b>: "The bond issuance by Bank of China not only reflects the influence of Chinese institutions in the international capital markets but also further underscores Dubai's status as an international financial centre in the Middle East. In recent years, China-UAE financial cooperation has yielded fruitful results. The successful listing of these bonds serves as a powerful testament to the deepening and broadening of financial collaboration between the two countries."<b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Hamed Ali, CEO of Nasdaq Dubai and DFM,</b> said: &ldquo;Bank of China has built a longstanding and trusted relationship with Nasdaq Dubai, and we are delighted to welcome the Bank&rsquo;s latest bond listing. Dubai continues to serve as a strategic bridge between China and global capital markets, offering issuers a transparent, internationally aligned platform and access to a deep and geographically diverse investor base. Listings of this calibre highlight the strength and resilience of our marketplace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chinese issuers, including Bank of China, China Development Bank, the Ministry of Finance of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China, ICBC, Agricultural Bank of China, and China Construction Bank, have collectively raised more than USD 27 billion through listings on Nasdaq Dubai. The exchange has hosted milestone transactions, including the first-ever bond issuances in the Middle East by China&rsquo;s Ministry of Finance and China Development Bank. This sustained activity highlights Dubai&rsquo;s role as a key conduit for capital flows between Asia and global markets.</p>
<p>The total outstanding value of debt securities on Nasdaq Dubai has exceeded USD <b>145</b> billion, underscoring the exchange&rsquo;s role as the region&rsquo;s leading venue for international fixed-income instruments and a global hub for cross-border capital flows.</p>

<title>Malaysia’s Advisory Committee On Sustainability Reporting Sets Out Approach For Non-Compliance To Sustainability Reporting Requirements</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/malaysias-advisory-committee-on-sustainability-reporting-sets-out-approach-for-2025128/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/malaysias-advisory-committee-on-sustainability-reporting-sets-out-approach-for-2025128/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Advisory Committee on Sustainability Reporting (ACSR), chaired by the Securities Commission Malaysia (SC), today announced its approach to addressing non-compliance with regulatory sustainability reporting requirements developed in alignment with the National Sustainability Reporting Framework (NSRF).<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The SC, together with Bank Negara Malaysia, Bursa Malaysia, the Companies Commission of Malaysia and the Audit Oversight Board, will focus on a phased and practical approach in reviewing disclosures. This is in acknowledgement of the period of transition for reporting entities to adopt the IFRS<sup>&reg;</sup> Sustainability Disclosure Standards (ISSB Standards).</p>
<p>Launched in September last year, the NSRF marks a significant step forward in advancing Malaysia&rsquo;s corporate sustainability agenda. It is applicable for listed issuers on Bursa Malaysia&rsquo;s Main and ACE Markets, as well as large non-listed companies (NLCos) with annual revenue of RM2 billion and above.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The SC Chairman Dato&rsquo; Mohammad Faiz Azmi said, &ldquo;We recognise the challenges companies face in meeting the new sustainability reporting standards due to, among others, a lack of resources, the quality of external data or the difficulty in obtaining necessary expertise.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our approach is to balance the need for compliance with the varied levels of readiness across reporting entities.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As such, emphasis will be made on capacity building and skills enhancement during the review process to ensure reasonable and meaningful progress by reporting entities in disclosing consistent, comparable and reliable sustainable information. In the case of noncompliance generally, this may be addressed through active engagement and corrective action, among others.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, reporting entities' failure to take corrective action to address the deficiencies may result in the relevant authorities taking appropriate enforcement action.</p>
<p>In instances of willful or serious non-compliance/breaches, such as fraudulent and/or misleading material disclosures/omissions, enforcement action remains an essential safeguard to uphold standards and protect public interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information or inquiries, please contact the ACSR Secretariat at <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="mailto:nsrf@seccom.com.my" title="nsrf@seccom.com.my">nsrf@seccom.com.my</a></span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<title>Statement On The Global Research Analyst Settlement, SEC Commissioner Mark T. Uyeda, Dec. 5, 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-on-the-global-research-analyst-settlement-sec-commissioner-mark-t-uy-2025126/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-on-the-global-research-analyst-settlement-sec-commissioner-mark-t-uy-2025126/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, the Commission took an important step toward eliminating outdated and costly requirements on firms and improving the availability of equity research in our markets by agreeing to amend the Global Research Analyst Settlement (the &ldquo;Global Research Settlement&rdquo;).<a class="ck-anchor" id="_ednref1"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-global-research-analyst-settlement-120525?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn1">[1]</a></p>
<p>The history behind the Global Research Settlement dates back to the dot-com bubble of the late-1990s that eventually burst. During that time, concerns were raised about the role played by sell-side investment research. Specifically, investment bankers were alleged to have influenced research analysts, biasing their work product to attract investment banking business based on favorable company reports. The SEC, the then-NASD (now FINRA), the NYSE, the North American Securities Administrators Association, and the New York State Attorney General settled with 12 major broker-dealer firms for failing to manage conflicts of interest between their research analysts and investment bankers.<a class="ck-anchor" id="_ednref2"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-global-research-analyst-settlement-120525?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn2">[2]</a></p>
<p>The Global Research Settlement was the result. It required these broker-dealers to wall off research analysts from investment banking by undertaking several prescriptive measures. Being a product of an enforcement action, however, these undertakings never went through a notice-and-comment rulemaking process. The very terms of the settlement itself contemplated that future rulemakings in this area would follow, and that the Commission should reevaluate its application over time.</p>
<p>Since 2004, the regulatory framework in this area has developed dramatically. The SEC adopted Regulation AC, which generally requires research analysts to certify the truthfulness of the views they express in research reports and public appearances, and to disclose whether they have received any compensation related to the specific recommendations or views expressed in those reports and appearances.<a class="ck-anchor" id="_ednref3"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-global-research-analyst-settlement-120525?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn3">[3]</a>&nbsp;Additionally, in 2015, FINRA adopted Rule 2241, which sought to address the same conflicts of interest targeted by the Global Research Settlement, but in a more principles-based manner.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that additional regulation has come from outside the United States. Following the actions of regulators in the European Union and United Kingdom, U.S. broker-dealers that sell research to E.U. and U.K. asset managers are now subject to myriad, and sometimes conflicting, regulations.<a class="ck-anchor" id="_ednref4"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-global-research-analyst-settlement-120525?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn4">[4]</a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a coincidence that since 2004, there has been a lot less research out of Wall Street, particularly for small and medium-sized companies. The result has been a chilling effect on research coverage in precisely the segments&mdash;emerging growth and smaller public companies&mdash;where investors most need high‑quality analysis. In 2017, the U.S. Department of the Treasury recommended that the SEC conduct a holistic review of the Global Research Settlement and the research analyst rules to determine which provisions should be retained, amended, or removed, with the objective of harmonizing a single set of rules for all financial institutions.<a class="ck-anchor" id="_ednref5"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-global-research-analyst-settlement-120525?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Today, the Commission moved toward more thoughtfully regulating some of the most important providers of sell-side equity research. It seems hard to argue that the requirements of the Global Research Settlement still hold their relevance. FINRA Rule 2241 now provides a robust framework for managing research analyst conflicts, disclosures, and supervision, but does so through a principles-based SRO rule that can be updated through notice-and-comment and interpreted consistently across member firms. These are not weaker protections; rather, they are conflict‑mitigation tools that are targeted, transparent, and aligned with how research is actually produced, paid for, and consumed. The Commission&rsquo;s action will lower compliance friction, promote more consistent interpretations, and, ultimately, expand the availability of research coverage that helps investors make better decisions.</p>
<p>In short, this is the kind of good government reform that will better serve investors, issuers, and the integrity of our U.S. capital markets.</p>

<title>Alberta Securities Commission Finds That GRS Hydrogen Solutions Inc. Breached Alberta Securities Laws</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>An Alberta Securities Commission (ASC) panel has found that GRS Hydrogen Solutions Inc. (GRS) contravened Alberta securities laws by illegally distributing GRS securities, and by making prohibited representations and misrepresentations to investors. The panel also made findings against Albert Eugene Cerenzie &ndash; GRS&rsquo;s founder, sole director, president, and chief executive officer.</p>
<p>In a decision dated December 1, 2025, an ASC panel found that GRS breached Alberta securities laws.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Illegal distributions</strong>: Between December 2021 to May 2023, GRS raised $282,500 by selling GRS securities to approximately 17 investors without a prospectus. GRS failed to ensure that 12 of those investors (representing $143,500) met the criteria for an available exemption from the prospectus requirement and illegally distributed securities.</li>
<li><strong>Prohibited representation</strong>s: GRS made prohibited representations to investors and the general public that its shares would be listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and that they had applied to be listed or would apply to be listed on the TSX.</li>
<li><strong>Misrepresentations</strong>: GRS made additional statements to investors that GRS had a contract with an established Alberta-based energy company. Those statements and the representations about listing on the TSX were materially misleading or untrue (or both).</li>
</ul>
<p>The panel found that Cerenzie authorized, permitted or acquiesced in GRS&rsquo;s contraventions. He did not fulfill his responsibilities as the director and officer of GRS.</p>
<p>Alberta securities laws generally require that companies using a prospectus exemption to raise capital are responsible for ensuring investors meet certain criteria before they invest, and they will be expected to take reasonable steps to verify that investors meet the criteria.</p>
<p>The proceeding will now move into a second phase to determine what, if any, orders for sanction or cost-recovery ought to be made against GRS and Cerenzie. The timing of the next steps will be set after hearing from the parties.</p>
<p>A copy of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asc.ca/-/media/ASC-Documents-part-1/Notices-Decisions-Orders-Rulings/Enforcement/2025/12/GRS-Hydrogen-Solutions-Inc-DECISION-20251201-6260563.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">decision</a>&nbsp;is available on the ASC website at asc.ca.</p>
<p>The ASC is the regulatory agency responsible for administering the province's securities laws. It is entrusted with fostering a fair and efficient capital market in Alberta and with protecting investors. As a member of the Canadian Securities Administrators, the ASC works to improve, coordinate and harmonize the regulation of Canada's capital markets.</p>

<title>Interagency Statement On US Office Of The Comptroller Of The Currency And Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Withdrawal From The Interagency Leveraged Lending Guidance Issuances</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (collectively &ldquo;the agencies&rdquo;) are rescinding the &ldquo;Interagency Guidance on Leveraged Lending&rdquo; (&ldquo;2013 Guidance&rdquo;), dated March 21, 2013, and the &ldquo;Frequently Asked Questions for Implementing March 2013 Interagency Guidance on Leveraged Lending&rdquo; (&ldquo;2014 FAQs&rdquo;), dated November 7, 2014. The agencies expect banks to manage leveraged lending exposures consistent with general principles for safe and sound lending.</p>
<p># # #</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Leveraged lending plays a vital role in the U.S. financial system. It provides a wide range of businesses, including those that are highly indebted or highly leveraged or that have low obligor ratings, with access to capital for business transformations, including mergers, acquisitions, re-capitalizations, refinancings, and equity buyouts, as well as for business and product line buildouts and expansions. It enables businesses to grow in a manner and at a rate that may not otherwise be possible. This growth helps fuel the nation&rsquo;s economy, contributing to innovation and job creation.</p>
<p>Banks traditionally participate in the leveraged lending market by providing or arranging financing and by facilitating the syndication process. Banks also have indirect exposure to leveraged borrowers via lending to business development companies and certain debt funds, as well as investments in collateralized loan obligations that contain securitized leveraged loans.</p>
<p>The 2013 Guidance and 2014 FAQs were overly restrictive and impeded banks&rsquo; application to leveraged lending of the risk management principles that guide their other business decisions. This resulted in a significant drop in leveraged lending market share by regulated banks and significant growth in leveraged lending market share by nonbanks, pushing this type of lending outside of the regulatory perimeter. In addition, the guidance was overly broad and captured certain types of loans that were not intended to be covered, including loans to investment-grade companies.</p>
<p>Moreover, the U.S. Government Accountability Office&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/b-329272" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">found</a>&nbsp;that the 2013 Guidance was a rule for the purposes of the Congressional Review Act that was required to be submitted to Congress for review. However, the agencies never submitted the 2013 Guidance to Congress.</p>
<p>For these reasons, the agencies are rescinding the 2013 Guidance and the 2014 FAQs. In place of these issuances, banks should apply the agencies&rsquo; general principles for prudent risk management of commercial loans and other types of lending to their leveraged lending activities. In general, banks should consider the following general principles for safe and sound lending when managing the risks associated with leveraged lending:</p>
<ol>
<li>Banks involved in leveraged lending are exposed to core financial risks&mdash;primarily credit and liquidity risks&mdash;which may be more pronounced given the activity and profile of the borrowers. The key to safe and sound banking is effectively managing these risks. A bank should manage the risks associated with its leveraged lending activities and tailor its risk management practices based on the quantity of the risk inherent in such activities.</li>
<li>A bank should have a clearly defined risk appetite that is reasonable and reflects the aggregate level and types of risk it is willing and able to assume to achieve its strategic objectives. A bank&rsquo;s leveraged lending activities should clearly align with this risk appetite.</li>
<li>Each bank should have effective risk management and controls for transactions in its pipeline, including loans to be held and those to be distributed.</li>
<li>Each bank should determine its own definition of a &ldquo;leveraged loan.&rdquo; A bank&rsquo;s application of a bank-wide, consistent definition supports its ability to identify, measure, monitor, and control its aggregate exposure to leveraged lending and to determine adherence to its risk appetite and concentration limits, including for indirect exposures.</li>
<li>A bank&rsquo;s underwriting criteria should consider a loan&rsquo;s purpose and sources of repayment and the capacity to de-lever over a reasonable period. Given the risk profiles of leveraged lending transactions, underwriting criteria should be consistently applied to these transactions.</li>
<li>Because leveraged borrowers start with high debt relative to cash flow, a bank should conduct an analysis of a leveraged borrower&rsquo;s past and current performance compared with projections, as well as the assumptions on which the projections are based.</li>
<li>Because leveraged borrowers generally depend on access to the capital markets or banks for refinancing, a bank should monitor a leveraged loan throughout its life cycle to assess the risk that refinancing is unavailable and to appropriately manage changes to the loan&rsquo;s risk profile.</li>
<li>A bank that purchases a participation in a leveraged loan should make a thorough independent evaluation of the transaction and risk involved before committing funds. The same credit assessment and underwriting criteria should be applied as if the bank were originating the loan internally.</li>
</ol>
<p>Examiners will examine banks&rsquo; underwriting, review risk ratings, and monitor the adequacy of loan loss reserves in accordance with general principles of safe and sound lending in a manner tailored to the size, complexity, and risk of leveraged lending activities.</p>
<p>The agencies will consider issuing additional guidance related to leveraged lending as appropriate. The agencies commit to issuing any further guidance through the notice and comment process.</p>

<title>Steps To A Vibrant And Resilient Derivatives Market, December 4, 2025, Remarks At The Mediterranean Partnership Of Securities Regulators, Scott O’Malia, ISDA Chief Executive Officer</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good afternoon and thank you to the Mediterranean Partnership of Securities Regulators (MPSR) for inviting me to deliver remarks to such a distinguished audience.</p>
<p>This is a very valuable coalition of regulators that promotes cooperation and stability across EU and Mediterranean countries. We welcome the recent launch of the ambitious Pact for the Mediterranean and will be ready to support the market-related initiatives in cooperation with the International Organization of Securities Commissions.</p>
<p>This has been a fascinating event that speaks to some of the key challenges and opportunities confronting financial markets, from the green transition to the rise of artificial intelligence and digital finance. There is no doubt that big changes are coming, and we need to be ready.</p>
<p>At ISDA, we&rsquo;re no strangers to change. We&rsquo;re now coming to the end of our 40<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;anniversary year, and we&rsquo;ve been reflecting on our journey since 1985, when a small group of dealers first got together to develop common standards for the derivatives market. We&rsquo;ve spent the past 40 years responding to continuous changes in the products, the participants and the regulatory framework.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve campaigned relentlessly for the enforceability of close-out netting in jurisdictions around the world &ndash; an absolutely fundamental step in the development of vibrant and resilient derivatives markets. By allowing counterparties to compress their obligations to a single net payment from one party to another in the event of a default, netting drastically reduces credit risk, which, in turn, increases liquidity and credit capacity. Many jurisdictions have opted to use the ISDA Model Netting Act as the basis for their legislation, and ISDA has now published more than 90 netting opinions, giving international firms the confidence and certainty they need to increase their participation in those markets.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take three other examples where ISDA has worked hand in hand with regulators to respond to seismic market changes.</p>
<p>First, the retirement of LIBOR, a benchmark that once underpinned trillions of dollars of financial contracts. When policymakers called time on the benchmark and asked market participants to transition to alternative reference rates, many said it couldn&rsquo;t be done without major disruption. Following a multi-year effort that required painstaking preparation in close collaboration with the public sector, ISDA launched contractual fallbacks in 2020 that helped pave the way for the safe removal of LIBOR.</p>
<p>Second, the implementation of margin requirements for non-cleared derivatives. When this was added to the post-crisis reform program, it was clear it would be a huge operational undertaking, especially as the scope of the rules extended to smaller entities over time. We developed the ISDA Standard Initial Margin Model (ISDA SIMM) so that market participants would have a common methodology for the calculation of margin, reducing costs and the potential for disputes. The ISDA SIMM is now used by hundreds of entities around the world, and we&rsquo;ve worked closely with policymakers to ensure it remains appropriate and effective in all market conditions.</p>
<p>Finally, the framework for bank resolution. When policymakers introduced resolution regimes that would temporarily suspend the right to terminate trades with a bank under resolution, they needed a watertight mechanism to ensure this kind of stay would be enforceable in a cross-border context. We developed the ISDA Resolution Stay Protocol, under which adherents opted into the stay provisions of overseas resolution regimes, delivering the legal certainty that was needed to properly resolve the &lsquo;too big to fail&rsquo; problem.</p>
<p>In each of these cases, ISDA worked tirelessly to develop robust solutions that enabled change. The challenges were neither simple nor easy to resolve &ndash; they required ambition, commitment and collaboration with regulators. As we look to the future, it&rsquo;s clear that a similar approach will be needed to overcome the challenges and harness the opportunities that are coming. We&rsquo;ve learned from our 40-year track record that while the issues change, the process endures.</p>
<p>I want to use these remarks to talk about several areas where ISDA is now focusing its efforts to enable positive, meaningful and lasting change and to maintain vibrant and resilient derivatives markets. These include the global capital framework, collateral management, regulatory reporting and carbon market development.</p>
<p><span>Capital</span></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start with capital.</p>
<p>Over the next few years, implementation of the Basel III framework is due to be completed in key jurisdictions. This is the last major set of reforms to the global capital framework, and includes the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB) market risk rules. The preservation of vibrant and resilient markets depends on appropriate, risk-sensitive capital requirements, so we must get this right. If we fail, we&rsquo;ll see reduced access to funding, a lack of hedging solutions and increased vulnerability to external shocks.</p>
<p>When we scrutinize proposed rules and recommend targeted changes, it is always with the aim of making sure capital requirements are appropriate for the underlying risks. We also believe the rules should be as consistent as possible across borders. A lack of alignment creates added complexity for globally active banks, making it more difficult for them to effectively manage their risks and service their clients.</p>
<p>As it stands, there is fragmentation between the major jurisdictions, both in the timing and content of the rules. In the US, regulators are revising the Basel III endgame proposal in light of industry feedback, and we expect to see a new proposal in the coming months. In the EU and the UK, the FRTB is currently due to be implemented from the start of 2027, but the UK Prudential Regulation Authority has proposed delaying the rollout of internal models until the following year. Meanwhile, the European Commission is consulting on a set of temporary changes to the FRTB that would bring some short-term relief. We&rsquo;re working with our members to respond to that consultation, but, as a general principle, we believe it would be preferable to develop solutions that ensure lasting risk sensitivity.</p>
<p>One of the key features of the FRTB is a much more stringent testing and approval process for banks that want to use internal models. Last year, an ISDA survey found that only 10 out of 26 global banks plan to use internal models for a much-reduced scope of trading desks under the FRTB. That&rsquo;s a big change that would mean less alignment between risk and capital and less diversity in models and behavior. It could lead to herd behavior and drive concentrations in particular assets. While the FRTB standardized approach is designed to be more risk-sensitive than previous iterations, its calibration will inflict the highest capital increases on those banks with large, diversified portfolios.</p>
<p>We must make sure there is a future for internal models, which means revisiting the rules. ISDA has recommended changes to improve the incentives to use internal models, which include the recalibration of certain elements of the FRTB, including the profit &amp; loss attribution test, the risk factor eligibility test and non-modellable risk factors.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to say we&rsquo;ve had very productive engagement with policymakers in recent months, particularly in the US. We&rsquo;re hopeful that the revisions to the Basel III endgame will make internal models a more viable option than in the original proposal. Once the revised proposals are published, ISDA will work with its members to evaluate the calibration and test the impact to ensure we achieve a capital framework that is truly risk-appropriate and fit for purpose.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also engaging with policymakers on the Basel Committee&rsquo;s prudential standard for crypto-asset exposures, which is scheduled to be implemented from January 1, 2026. In its current form, this standard would impose overly conservative and punitive capital requirements that do not accurately reflect the risks of crypto assets and would be inconsistent with established market risk practices. Earlier this year, we joined with other trade associations in calling for a pause and recalibration, and we welcome the Basel Committee&rsquo;s recent announcement that it would undertake a review of targeted elements of the standard.</p>
<p>Financial markets are moving rapidly to adopt powerful technologies like tokenization, which could bring significant advances in efficiency. It is vital that disproportionate capital requirements don&rsquo;t hinder those efforts, so we will continue to advocate for greater risk sensitivity in the capital treatment of crypto-asset exposures.</p>
<p><span>Collateral</span></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll now turn to one particular area where we&rsquo;re working hard to realize the benefits of tokenization &ndash; collateral management.</p>
<p>With markets becoming ever faster and smarter, we&rsquo;re seeing growing momentum behind the shift to 24/7 trading. But if markets are to remain vibrant and resilient, the risk management infrastructure will need to catch up. There are still far too many bottlenecks and inefficiencies in our existing systems and processes to accommodate 24/7 trading.</p>
<p>Collateral management is a case in point. As I mentioned at the start of these remarks, the ISDA SIMM has provided a robust and transparent methodology for market participants to calculate margin requirements for non-cleared derivatives. Collateral has helped to mitigate counterparty risk in the derivatives market, but the financial system has become increasingly prone to liquidity crunches during periods of stress. As margin calls spiked, many firms struggled to meet their obligations because of the continued reliance on manual intervention and a lack of interoperability across internal systems and with external parties.</p>
<p>It is critical that firms have sound liquidity risk management, liquidity stress testing, resilient operational processes and sufficient levels of cash and liquid assets to meet their margin calls. But it&rsquo;s also vital that the collateral gets to where it needs to be quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>In response, ISDA has developed suggested operational practices for collateral management. We&rsquo;ve also used the Common Domain Model (CDM), a standardized data and process model, to digitize key documents, represent eligible collateral terms and automate cash collateral calculations and payment processes.</p>
<p>Tokenization also has a part to play in modernizing the collateral management infrastructure. For example, it could help to alleviate the workflow challenges by enabling near-instantaneous settlement of collateral transfers. We&rsquo;re also exploring how tokenization might help firms to use a wider range of eligible assets as collateral.</p>
<p>Market participants are increasingly looking to use non-cash securities for margin, but there are certain economic, capital and operational constraints that prevent some counterparties from holding anything other than cash or government securities. For example, money market funds would have to be liquidated and posted as cash and then transformed by the custodian, which can lead to increased liquidity and operational risks.</p>
<p>Once tokenized on a shared ledger, money market funds could be much more efficiently mobilized as collateral. Shares of a fund could be directly posted and returned without the need for liquidation within the collateral management process.</p>
<p>ISDA is now engaging with experts across financial markets to identify and address certain legal, regulatory and operational challenges to enable the adoption of tokenization. We&rsquo;re focusing on two key areas. First, we&rsquo;ll work with the official sector to establish clear and consistent legal and regulatory frameworks to bring certainty, enable cross-border adoption and improve market confidence. Second, we&rsquo;ll aim to establish interoperability, underpinned by common data models, smart contract standards and messaging protocols, to reduce fragmentation, lower integration costs and enable cross-platform connectivity.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt that tokenization has real potential to improve the timeliness and efficiency of collateral management, increasing the vibrancy and resilience of derivatives markets. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re focused on helping to realize its potential.</p>
<p><span>Data reporting</span></p>
<p>The completion of Basel III and the introduction of an effective legal and regulatory framework for tokenization will only be successful with continued engagement and collaboration between the public and private sectors. The same is true of another of the post-crisis reforms &ndash; derivatives data reporting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that this has been one of the most difficult reforms of all and, despite repeated efforts, we haven&rsquo;t yet got it right. The original mandate from the G-20 to report trades to designated repositories made a lot of sense in the wake of the financial crisis. The dangers of opacity had just been laid bare, and regulators clearly needed a more effective way to identify emerging risks before they threatened market stability.</p>
<p>I was a commissioner at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) when the US rules were drafted, and it was clear that reporting would only work if we managed to implement the rules consistently around the world. Without global consistency, we&rsquo;d have a patchwork of fragmented data that would be of very little use to the public sector.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that consistency never materialized. Every jurisdiction took its own approach, with little alignment in what was reported from one market to the next, making it very difficult to reconcile cross-border trades. In some cases, multiple rules in a single jurisdiction meant firms had to report the same trade several times, leaving regulators trying to make sense of duplicative information.</p>
<p>With inaccuracies, repetition and omissions in what is reported, and privacy rules preventing the sharing of data, regulators don&rsquo;t always have the information at their fingertips to enable them to identify the build-up of derivatives exposures and risks. It may exist in some form within trade repositories, but it&rsquo;s not always easily accessible. As ISDA put it in a paper in 2023, the information regulators need is often &ldquo;hidden in plain sight&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Policymakers are well aware of these problems and want to address them. Earlier this year, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) sought industry feedback on the major cost drivers associated with reporting, in an effort to establish how the reporting burden in the EU could be reduced and simplified.</p>
<p>We welcome this initiative and believe a key part of any solution should be a holistic review of the EU&rsquo;s multiple reporting regimes to clearly identify what information regulators really need. As it stands, trade reporting is required under three separate rulebooks &ndash; the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (MIFIR), the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) and the Securities Financing Transactions Regulation (SFTR) &ndash; and there are many instances where the same transaction has to be reported under multiple regulations. This is not only unnecessary &ndash; it also creates an additional burden on regulators to reconcile duplicative reports.</p>
<p>A holistic review of reporting rules under these three regulations would pave the way towards a single regime that optimizes reporting and enhances its value for the public sector, while reducing the burden for the market. A single EU reporting regime would comprise only the relevant data fields without duplicative or unnecessary reporting, requiring firms to deliver a single transaction report to meet their obligations under the current MIFIR, EMIR and SFTR regimes.</p>
<p>The good news is that ESMA&rsquo;s call for evidence included some very constructive proposals that would help to reduce these costs and improve the quality of reported data. For example, the removal of the dual-sided reporting model and the clear delineation of reporting by instrument type would simplify processes, reduce the number of reports and avoid mismatches in what is reported.</p>
<p>We welcome ESMA&rsquo;s engagement on this important issue and look forward to further progress next year. We also welcome the UK Financial Conduct Authority&rsquo;s new consultation on a set of proposals to improve transaction reporting under UK MIFIR. This is part of a long-term strategic approach to streamline transaction reporting requirements across multiple regimes. We&rsquo;re working with our members to analyze the proposals and develop a response.</p>
<p>Of course, creating an effective global reporting framework means working across borders in pursuit of consistent, appropriate rules. Over the past three years, regulators around the world have updated their reporting rules to incorporate globally agreed data standards and bring greater consistency to their reporting regimes. Starting with the CFTC in December 2022, we now have updated reporting rules in eight jurisdictions, with Hong Kong being the latest to implement changes in September. That&rsquo;s a very welcome step forward and ISDA has been working hard to help market participants implement the rules in a uniform way that properly reflects what is required.</p>
<p>In 2022, we launched the Digital Regulatory Reporting (DRR) initiative, which converts an industry-agreed interpretation of multiple reporting rule sets into machine-executable code using the CDM. Users can take this code as the basis of their implementation or use it to validate their own interpretation of the rules. The ISDA DRR has yielded massive efficiencies and improved the accuracy of what is reported &ndash; an important consideration, given nearly $300 million has been paid in fines for misreported data in the US, UK and EU. The DRR has so far been adapted to all eight sets of updated reporting requirements, and we&rsquo;ve committed to supporting 12 core reporting regimes across nine jurisdictions.</p>
<p><span>Carbon markets</span></p>
<p>Before finishing, I&rsquo;ll briefly touch on one more area where we need continued collaboration to realize progress &ndash; the development of a vibrant and resilient global voluntary carbon market.</p>
<p>We must never lose sight of the important role carbon markets can play in channeling the capital that is needed to achieve the transition to net-zero. Following last year&rsquo;s agreement to establish a UN-backed carbon market under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, recent negotiations at COP30 focused on implementation. ISDA is fully supportive of these efforts, and we&rsquo;ve shared our recommendations with policymakers on the vital steps we believe are needed to enable the voluntary carbon market to reach its full potential.</p>
<p>First, we need a globally consistent definition of a ton of carbon that is adopted by all market participants. This must be accompanied by an independent, science-based system to verify and audit the soundness and integrity of voluntary carbon credits. Second, we need a robust legal framework to create greater certainty and confidence. Third, we need a liquid forward market, which will provide valuable signals as the market evolves. Finally, we need a globally consistent regulatory framework to create the clarity companies need to trade and invest.</p>
<p>ISDA is working hard to provide legal certainty for this market. To sustain deep and liquid secondary markets, create clear price signals and allow funds to be efficiently channeled to emissions-reducing projects, the legal treatment of carbon credits must be properly defined. We set out the steps needed to create greater legal certainty in a series of whitepapers, and we&rsquo;re making good progress.</p>
<p>The International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT), an intergovernmental institution, is now in the final stage of developing critical guidance on the appropriate standards to ensure bankruptcy treatment and the exchange of security are properly defined, and the rights of holders are protected. This guidance will provide a common legal baseline for carbon trading, and ISDA will advocate for countries to incorporate the principles when drafting rules for these markets.</p>
<p>The UNIDROIT guidance will build on the foundations we established with the ISDA Verified Carbon Credit Transactions Definitions, which created a single contractual framework for the trading of these contracts. Last year, we updated the definitions to incorporate the Core Carbon Principles developed by the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market, and we recently published the latest iteration that includes standards from the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation.</p>
<p>These are positive steps in the right direction, and we will continue to engage with policymakers to build confidence in the voluntary carbon market through strong and consistent standards.</p>
<p><span>Conclusion</span></p>
<p>I started these remarks by reflecting on some of the big industry challenges that ISDA helped to solve over the past decade. In each case, from LIBOR and initial margin to the bank resolution framework, the challenge at times seemed insurmountable &ndash; too big, too complex to overcome. But we never gave up. We showed that with ambition, commitment and collaboration, nothing is impossible.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about some of the key areas where we&rsquo;re now focusing to ensure vibrant and resilient derivatives markets &ndash; capital, margin, reporting and the voluntary carbon market. These are also complex, thorny issues, but I&rsquo;m confident the same approach we&rsquo;ve used in the past will once again succeed. It&rsquo;s a full book of work, and we need ambition, commitment and collaboration with the public sector. So, let&rsquo;s make it happen.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Good afternoon and thank you for the flexibility in allowing me to deliver my remarks towards the end of the day due to scheduling issues. Earlier, the Committee engaged in discussions on corporate governance and tokenization and will later discuss artificial intelligence disclosures.</p>
<p>Today, also, is the final Committee Meeting for our Investor Advocate. I want to extend my appreciation to Cristina [Martin Firvida] for her dedication and professionalism. Cristina is the second Investor Advocate in the Commission&rsquo;s history. When she was selected, I was not quite sure what to expect from her. However, Cristina won me over by finding areas of mutual agreement and then executing upon them. One of Cristina&rsquo;s important contributions is reforming the selection process for Committee members. As an SEC staff member, I was here at the very beginning of the Committee. It became clear that the departure of a significant majority of the Committee members every four years was not conducive to longer-term thinking. Through Cristina&rsquo;s efforts, we now have a plan where approximately a quarter of the Committee will be replaced annually, thereby obtaining a smoother transition of new members into the Committee. Thank you, Cristina, for your outstanding service and I wish you the best in your future endeavors!</p>
<h1>The Role of Corporate Governance in Capital Markets</h1>
<p>Corporate governance plays a role in investor confidence and market integrity. It encompasses the systems, principles, and processes by which companies are directed and controlled. At its core, effective governance ensures that companies are accountable to shareholders and resilient in the face of evolving risks.</p>
<p>Over time, the role of governance has expanded beyond traditional oversight. Companies are increasingly expected to navigate complex issues such as cybersecurity and emerging technologies. A well-functioning board must not only monitor management but also anticipate and adapt to systemic shifts that could affect long-term value creation.</p>
<p>However, Congress specifically left the states in charge of governance under state corporate law. The federal securities laws and regulations play an important complimentary role in providing disclosure, describing the governance structure, the rights of shareholders, and potential risks associated with a company&rsquo;s particular structure as well as for providing a regulatory framework for proxy solicitation.</p>
<p>Yet, as we consider reforms, we must be mindful of the temptation to use the Commission&rsquo;s disclosure authority for registration statements and proxy materials, as well as oversight of exchange listing requirements, to impose prescriptive governance mandates. It is inappropriate to mistake the &ldquo;investor protection&rdquo; and &ldquo;public interest&rdquo; standards contained in the federal securities laws as Congressional authority to set national corporate governance standards. Congress does not &ldquo;hide elephants in mouse holes.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-iac-120425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Corporate governance is best left to the market to decide. If a potential shareholder does not like a particular governance framework &mdash; such as whether it is board composition, independence, expertise, then there is a simple solution: do not invest. Companies with corporate governance structures that are not well received by investors will have a higher cost of capital and a depressed stock price.</p>
<h1><span>Mandatory Arbitration and Acceleration of Effectiveness</span></h1>
<p>Similarly, another area of recent discussion is the Commission&rsquo;s clarification regarding mandatory arbitration provisions in registration statements and how the presence of such provisions will not be an impediment to acceleration of effectiveness. Some panelists might have argued earlier today that this represents a reversal of prior Commission policy or weakening of investor protections. In fact, the Commission has never had a policy prohibiting such provisions. Our recent Policy Statement simply articulates that, absent a clear congressional directive, the applicability of the Federal Arbitration Act was not overruled by the federal securities laws, and the existence of an arbitration provision is not grounds for denying effectiveness under Section 8(a) of the Securities Act.</p>
<p>This approach is consistent with judicial precedent and ensures that our rulebook is clear, transparent, objective, and predictable. To suggest otherwise is to mischaracterize both the law and the absence of any prior Commission&rsquo;s policy.</p>
<p>During consideration of this Policy Statement at the open meeting, I specifically asked whether the Commission could adopt the opposite position. In other words, assume that the parade of horrible described by critics of mandatory arbitration provisions were to occur. Would the Commission have the legal authority to issue a policy statement specifically denying the acceleration of effectiveness of any registration statement if it disclosed the preference of a mandatory arbitration provision? The answer was essentially no &mdash; if the disclosure was adequate, then that would be essentially merit regulation, which was not authorized by the federal securities laws.</p>
<h1>Artificial Intelligence: Committee Recommendations and Regulatory Considerations</h1>
<p>Finally, let me express my appreciation for the Committee&rsquo;s recent work on artificial intelligence disclosures. This is a rapidly evolving area of corporate activity. As AI becomes more deeply integrated into business operations, the need for material information by investors may grow. The Committee has proposed that issuers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Define what they mean by &ldquo;artificial intelligence&rdquo; in their disclosures;</li>
<li>Disclose board oversight mechanisms, if any, for AI deployment; and</li>
<li>Report separately on the material effects of AI on internal operations and consumer-facing matters.</li>
</ol>
<p>I recognize that these recommendations are grounded in a materiality-based approach and are designed to fit within the existing disclosure framework under Regulation S-K. Furthermore, the Committee&rsquo;s decision to build on existing disclosure items&mdash;rather than propose a standalone AI regime&mdash;is a pragmatic one that avoids unnecessary structural complexity.</p>
<p>That said, it is important to approach this area with caution. There are practical and conceptual challenges that merit further consideration. For example, the lack of a universally accepted definition of &ldquo;artificial intelligence&rdquo; could create interpretative and disclosure issues. Boards, management, and their outside counsel may struggle to determine what qualifies as AI, particularly when distinguishing between traditional automation and more advanced machine learning systems.</p>
<p>Similarly, while board oversight is a critical governance function, mandating disclosures in this area may not always yield meaningful insight for investors&mdash;especially if oversight responsibilities are diffuse or still evolving. And while reporting on the material effects of AI is a reasonable goal, it may be difficult in practice to isolate those effects separately from regular business operations.</p>
<p>Moreover, we must be mindful of the potential for regulatory overreach. Prematurely codifying rigid disclosure mandates could stifle innovation, particularly for smaller issuers that may lack the resources to implement complex compliance systems. A one-size-fits-all approach may not be appropriate in a space where use cases, risks, and maturity levels vary widely across industries.</p>
<p>As we consider the Committee&rsquo;s recommendation, our goal should not be to use the federal securities laws as a backdoor attempt to regulate AI. Rather, we must ensure that investors are not left in the dark about material risks and opportunities that may arise from the use of AI in business operations and strategy and to do so in a manner without being encumbered by prescriptive or duplicative requirements.</p>
<p>The Committee provides a forum for this ongoing dialogue, and I look forward to continued engagement on this issue.</p>

<title>Basel Committee Consults On Standard Format For Machine-Readable Disclosures</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/basel-committee-consults-on-standard-format-for-machine-readable-disclosures-2025125/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li>The Basel Committee has published a consultation on a standard format for&nbsp;machine-readable disclosures by banks.</li>
<li>The proposed standard format would make existing disclosure by banks more accessible and easier to aggregate.</li>
<li>Comments on the proposals are requested by 5 March 2026.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision today published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d604.htm"><span class="firstword">consultative</span>&nbsp;document</a>&nbsp;proposing additions to its disclosure standard to make the data disclosed by banks (so-called Pillar 3 disclosures) available in a machine-readable format.</p>
<p>Pillar&nbsp;3 disclosures by internationally active banks under the Basel Committee's standards are an important source of their key risk metrics. Most banks, however, currently publish their disclosures in PDF format only, which makes it difficult to aggregate, process and compare data across banks.</p>
<p>To make Pillar 3 disclosure data more accessible, the Committee is proposing that they should be made available in standardised machine-readable formats across its member jurisdictions. The proposed standard would introduce a requirement and technical specifications to produce machine-readable quantitative Pillar&nbsp;3 disclosures, without changing the underlying disclosure requirements for banks. National supervisors would decide whether banks should publish machine-readable Pillar&nbsp;3 disclosures on their own websites or via a centralised data repository.</p>
<p>It is also envisaged that the proposed standard would not increase burdens on banks in jurisdictions where machine-readable Pillar&nbsp;3 disclosures are already required. Instead, existing approaches would be integrated into the proposed global standard.</p>
<p>The Committee welcomes comments on the proposed additions to the standard covering machine-readable quantitative Pillar 3 disclosures, which should be submitted&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/commentupload.htm"><span class="firstword">here</span></a>&nbsp;by 5 March 2026. All submissions will be published on the BIS website unless a respondent specifically requests confidential treatment.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Background</em></p>
<p><em>The Basel Committee is the primary global standard setter for the prudential regulation of banks and provides a forum for cooperation on banking supervisory matters. Its mandate is to strengthen the regulation, supervision and practices of banks worldwide with the purpose of enhancing financial stability. The Committee reports to the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision and seeks its endorsement for major decisions. The Committee has no formal supranational authority, and its decisions have no legal force. Rather, the Committee relies on its members' commitments to achieve its mandate. The Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision is chaired by Tiff Macklem, Governor of the Bank of Canada. The Basel Committee is chaired by Erik Thed&eacute;en, Governor of Sveriges Riksbank.&nbsp;</em></p>

<h2>Speech</h2>
<p>Many thanks to BAYES Business School for the invitation to address you today. My remarks will preview the forthcoming joint PRA and FCA Mutuals Landscape Report, which we will publish on Friday at a launch event in Rochdale, with the FCA and the Economic Secretary to the Treasury. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To help set the context for your discussions today, I will focus on the evolving mutuals landscape, the challenges this presents and opportunities it creates. I will also set out the work we, the regulators, are doing to support sustainable growth in the mutuals sector.</p>
<p>Financial mutuals play an important part in the UK&rsquo;s financial services industry. Their distinct model of ownership and governance places members at the heart of their business model. Mutuals increase the diversity of the UK financial services sector which in turn makes it more resilient and provides consumers with greater choice, often to underserved communities.</p>
<p>We see that effect across the sectors we supervise. Mutual insurers serve 26 million people, often serving consumers less served by proprietary firms. Credit Unions support over 2 million adults, and research carried out by the FCA suggests that adults living in the most deprived areas of our country are the most likely to use credit unions for savings or loans.</p>
<p>Building societies offer nearly 30% of mortgage lending in the UK, and their asset book has almost doubled in the last ten years. They were able to provide credit to the economy after the financial crisis, in a period where many banks had to be more focussed on repairing their balance sheets. And building societies now account for 35% of the UK&rsquo;s branch network, up from 14% in 2012.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The UK has a long history of mutuals, with building societies and friendly societies originating in the UK. Friendly societies (or mutual insurers) date back to the Great Fire of London and the first building society was founded in Birmingham 250 years ago. The sector has evolved over time, reflecting changes in competition and customer demands, economic conditions and the regulatory and legislative environment. The mutuals sector today is diverse, with several very large firms operating across the UK and a vast number of smaller firms, often operating within a local area or niche sector.</p>
<p>The mutuals sector is thriving. It has experienced significant growth in recent years, and the sector is in a robust financial position, with many firms holding substantial capital buffers.</p>
<p>Despite financial mutuals&rsquo; success and well-established presence, the sector does face challenges. Some of these challenges are common across all firms operating in the financial services sector, for example those relating to high levels of competition and keeping pace with technological change. Some challenges can be heightened for mutuals due to the difficulties of raising additional capital for growth while retaining a mutual ownership structure. And some challenges are heightened for smaller financial services firms because of a lack of economies of scale.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will take a thematic look at how the financial mutuals sector is evolving, focussing on the challenges and opportunities across the life cycle of a firm. I will outline some of the ways in which the sector is adapting to these challenges and the role that regulation can play in supporting sustainable growth.</p>
<h3>Entry: opening the door to new mutuals&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The mutuals sector in aggregate has grown over recent years, but we have seen limited entry of new firms. Over the past decade, seven new credit unions have been registered. The last mutual insurer to write new business for consumers was authorised in 1988 and the last building society authorisation was in 1981. A new building society was registered in 2025 but is not yet authorised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Establishing a new mutual &ndash; or any new financial firm &ndash; is not without its challenges. The process is costly, requiring investment in staff, operational infrastructure, and customer acquisition. Capital raising can be particularly difficult for new entrants, and especially so for mutuals given the limited options available.</p>
<p>However, support is available: the regulators offer pre-application guidance through the New Bank Start-up Unit and the New Insurer Start-up Unit, which have between them authorised over 80 new firms. These units offer support and guidance for those looking to enter the market. To help support authorisation of new firms in as low a cost way as possible, we offer a &lsquo;mobilisation&rsquo; regime which allows firms to be authorised and, in many cases, start writing business at an early stage.</p>
<p>One possible source of funding for new mutuals is from regional bodies and public funding to support mutuals is available in some parts of the UK. For example, public funding has been provided to various credit unions.</p>
<p>We have seen recent interest in the establishment of regionally focussed mutual or co-operative banks. These are banks owned by their members, typically customers or depositors, but they can provide services and products to non-members as well. This approach is an opportunity for new entrants to the market.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Economies of scale and diversification: building sustainable models</h3>
<p>The mutuals sector is made up of a small number of large firms and a large cohort of smaller ones.</p>
<p>The largest six building societies hold around 90% of total assets. Only seven credit unions have assets over &pound;100 million, representing about 25% of the sector, while roughly 240 credit unions have less than &pound;10 million each. In insurance, the three largest mutuals account for 84% of sector assets, with most concentrated in the largest mutual. And the remaining 90 insurance mutuals together hold just 16%, equivalent to about 1% of total UK insurance sector assets in 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many smaller mutuals are thriving, but smaller firms can face more acute business model challenges, particularly those related to managing their expense base in the face of rising operational costs and necessary investment in technology. For example, smaller scale operations can face difficulties in absorbing increasing costs related to IT infrastructure or cyber security as customer expectations for digital services continue to grow and technology continues to develop at pace. To face these challenges, mutuals are continuing to evolve their offering, looking to grow by playing to their strengths and seeking new ways of managing their costs.</p>
<p>Building society services tend to be accessed from branches, with building societies&rsquo; branch network accounting for 35% of the UK&rsquo;s overall branch network, and up to 46% of the network in smaller towns and communities. This presents both an opportunity for the sector in terms of customer acquisition and retention but also a challenge in terms of cost. Several societies have adapted their operating models to reduce costs and deliver improved services, such as running Head Office functions from their branches. Some are making branches into hubs and resources for the wider community. And some societies are trialling multi-bank kiosks in their branches which enable consumers to deposit and withdraw cash and access banking services with a range of banks.</p>
<p>Mutuals can also diversify through their product offerings and often offer niche products or services that their larger competitors do not. Many building societies operate in specialist parts of the mortgage market, such as self-build and shared ownership, leveraging their strengths in manual underwriting. Similarly, mutual insurers operate in specialist markets where members would otherwise by underserved.</p>
<p>Some mutuals may determine that mergers may be a mechanism for gaining scale to maintain the provision of services for their members. Last year, we saw two building societies diversify by acquiring retail banks. We are often asked if the regulators would like to see more consolidation in the mutuals sector and, while we stand ready to support mutuals which wish to enter mergers or transfers of engagements, from a regulatory perspective, we are agnostic on sector structure.</p>
<p>We are committed to supporting mutuals&rsquo; efforts to grow sustainably by doing our part to make sure the regulatory cost of doing business is proportionate, especially for smaller firms. We are streamlining the Senior Managers and Certification Regime, have consulted on removing the &lsquo;building societies sourcebook&rsquo; to allow building societies to compete on a level playing field with banks, and have removed regulatory fees for a swathe of smaller firms. We are also committed to providing active support for firms&rsquo; growth ambitions with initiatives like the FCA/PRA Scale-up Unit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recent regulatory reforms, such as the Strong and Simple regime for banks and building societies and Solvency UK for insurers, are designed to reduce burdens and support sustainable growth. 97% of eligible building societies have already benefited from simplified liquidity requirements, including reduced liquidity reporting under Strong and Simple. The introduction of &lsquo;Solvency UK&rsquo; has removed almost 50 reporting templates and changed the threshold to allow smaller firms to become eligible to qualify for the simpler &lsquo;non-directive&rsquo; regime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For credit unions, we will undertake a comprehensive review of the regulatory regime to ensure it is fit for the future needs of the sector. This will consider the implications of larger and more complex credit unions and more proportionate regulation for smaller credit unions.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Access to skills and expertise: strengthening governance and capability</h3>
<p>Access to specialist skills &ndash; such as risk management, technology, operational resilience and governance &ndash; is a persistent challenge, especially for smaller mutuals. Many credit unions rely heavily on volunteers, with 20% of credit unions operating without any paid staff and only a quarter employing more than ten paid staff members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Collaboration across the sector can play an important role here. Sharing expertise and pooling resources within the sector can be a way to address these pressures, help raise standards and ensure sustainable growth. Such cooperation can be facilitated through networks, such as trade associations or structures such as service organisations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Credit Union Service Organisations (CUSOs) are an established way of pooling resources and services in other countries, and we have started to see their adoption in the UK. We support such initiatives and are committed to removing barriers to such collaboration, recognising that shared services and secondary structures can help mutuals remain competitive and resilient. We recently consulted on amending our rules to make entering such arrangements easier for Credit Unions wishing to use CUSOs. These rules will be finalised and published early next year. We would also be supportive of conversations with building societies and mutual insurers who may wish to explore a similar approach.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Capital: fuelling growth and innovation&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Capital levels across the mutuals sector are strong in aggregate.</p>
<p>Raising capital can be a challenge for all firms, but it can be particularly acute for mutuals due to the mutual ownership structure and limited external options with a lack of a liquid market in mutual capital instruments.</p>
<p>Take up of capital instruments such as Core Capital Deferred Shares (CCDS) has been limited due to factors like cost, complexity, lack of secondary market and scale. On the insurance side, there is significant legislative complexity around insurance capital instruments. As regulators, we would welcome proposals from the industry to broaden capital-raising tools, including secondary structures and new capital instruments, and stand ready to engage on these initiatives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many mutuals hold capital significantly above their regulatory requirements or risk appetites. This, of course is prudent, but there is a danger that it ties up capital which could otherwise be used to invest, innovate, and grow. We are clear that we have no regulatory expectation for firms to hold capital buffers over buffers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also understand that transparency, predictability and consistency of the capital regime is important. This gives firms the confidence to use surplus capital for additional investment, or lending, thereby supporting members and the economy. The Strong and Simple regime and Solvency UK deliver this clarity for smaller building societies and mutual insurers.</p>
<h3>Exit: ensuring orderly transitions&nbsp;</h3>
<p>A well-functioning and dynamic market need unviable firms to leave with minimal disruption. For banks, building societies and insurers we have published supervisory statements around preparing for orderly solvent exits. We also ask the largest Credit Unions to prepare credible solvent wind down plans. The aim of this policy is to ensure firms can, if necessary, cease regulated activities responsibly and without market disruption. These regulatory expectations are proportionate to firms&rsquo; size and complexity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some firms may decide that mergers are the best route for them. This can be a legitimate way to secure a mutual future for members. But the process of merging or otherwise exiting the market can be complex. For insurers, the &lsquo;Part VIII&rsquo; process of merger can be daunting, we are committed to simplifying this process as much as possible and plan to publish our approach to this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For credit unions, a transfer of engagement or dissolution are well-trodden paths. However, a lack of transfer partners and significant administration costs means these are less feasible exit options for larger credit unions. We are also aware that there are potential legislative obstacles to exit for some credit unions, although plans from HM Treasury to reform the &lsquo;common bond&rsquo; requirement may help.</p>
<p>Where firms are struggling with viability, we stand ready to engage in discussions on solvent (and insolvent) exit options, to prevent disorderly exit and help maintain assets in the mutual sector.</p>
<h3>Conclusion: a collaborative path forward&nbsp;</h3>
<p>In closing, mutuals play an important role in UK financial services and today they are a resilient and growing sector. To ensure mutuals remain a thriving part of the financial services landscape of the future, we need to address the challenges of entry, scale, skills, capital, and exit; thereby ensuring delivery of value, choice, and resilience to millions across the UK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have taken and are taking significant steps to support the sector and remain committed to supporting the sector through proportionate regulation, targeted initiatives, and ongoing engagement. But further progress will require action from all stakeholders &ndash; industry, regulators, legislators and academics like yourselves &ndash; working together to shape a vibrant future for mutuals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to thank Anthony Brown, Alison Emblow, Izzy Jennings and Shoib Khan for their support in preparing these remarks.</p>

<title>The EBA Publishes A Follow-Up Peer Review On Authorisation Of Payment Institutions And Electronic Money Institutions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published a follow-up to the</span><a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document_library/Publications/Reports/2023/1050744/Peer%20Review%20Report%20on%20authorisation%20under%20PSD2.pdf"><span>&nbsp;2023 Peer Review</span></a><span>&nbsp;Report assessing progress in the authorisation of payment institutions and electronic money institutions under the revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2). While notable improvements and increased convergence have been observed, significant differences persist in key areas such as governance, internal control mechanisms, and local substance. These divergent implementations continue to pose risks of regulatory arbitrage and an uneven playing field across Member States.</span></p>
<p>The follow-up Peer Review, covers 2022-2024 and&nbsp;assesses how supervisors have implemented the 2023 recommendations, focusing on authorisation processes, implementation of the EBA Guidelines on authorisation, governance and internal controls, AML/CFT frameworks, and local substance.</p>
<p>The Review identifies ongoing market shifts since the previous assessment.&nbsp; Application volumes and authorisation timelines still vary significantly across Member States. Most Member States saw fewer applications compared to 2019-2022, mainly due to market maturity and the end of Brexit-driven demand, though some jurisdictions experienced increases. The median authorisation process in the EEA (counting from submission of an application) now takes 9.5 months, with delays often resulting from incomplete or poor-quality applications and the time needed to address deficiencies.</p>
<p>Most supervisors have improved efficiency by providing clearer guidance, engaging with applicants earlier on, and streamlining internal procedures. However, delays remain, as not all changes have had a significant impact. While supervisors report better assessments of applicants&rsquo; governance and internal control mechanisms, divergent implementations persist in these areas and in the assessment of local substance. These differences, linked to the broad requirements of PSD2, risk creating an uneven playing field and regulatory arbitrage.</p>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-extends-transitional-relief-for-foreign-financial-services-providers-2025125/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC has extended the transitional relief for foreign financial services providers (FFSPs) by an additional 12 months. This relief exempts FFSPs from the requirement to hold an Australian financial services (AFS) licence when providing financial services to Australian wholesale clients.</p>
<p>Under the current arrangements, ASIC&rsquo;s sufficient equivalence relief and limited connection relief were due to expire on 31 March 2026. With this extension, the transitional relief will remain in place until 31 March 2027.</p>
<p>On 26 November 2025, the Australian Government introduced legislation for a new licensing exemption regime for FFSPs under the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r7409"><em>Treasury Laws Amendment (Genetic Testing Protections in Life Insurance and Other Measures) Bill 2025</em></a>&nbsp;(the Bill). The new regime is due to commence 12 months after the Bill receives Royal Assent.</p>
<p>FFSPs that have been granted a foreign AFS licence will be able to continue to operate their financial services business in Australia under the licence issued by ASIC.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2025L01494/latest/text"><em>ASIC Corporations (Foreign Financial Services Providers) Instrument 2025/798</em></a>&nbsp;remakes the relief previously provided under&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2022C00873"><em>ASIC Corporations (Repeal and Transitional) Instrument 2016/396</em></a>. As a result, FFSPs currently relying on an individual relief instrument&mdash;where the expiry is linked to 2016/396&mdash;can continue to rely on that relief until 31 March 2027.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2025L01495/latest/text"><em>ASIC Corporations (Amendment) Instrument 2025/799</em></a>&nbsp;extends the relief contained in the following instruments:</p>

<title>Time To Get On With Business, Speech By ASIC Commissioner Kate O’Rourke At The 2025 Small Business Association Of Australia (SBAA) International Small Business Summit On 5 December 2025.</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul>
<li>ASIC recognises that small businesses are often time-poor and resource-stretched &ndash; and ASIC is working to ease some of the pressure through our regulatory simplification program.</li>
<li>This includes by making our guidance and information clearer, simpler and easier to access and improving our registry services for the millions of small businesses who rely on them.</li>
<li>While climate reporting obligations apply mainly to larger entities, over time they will have some impact on some small businesses and ASIC is working to help businesses prepare.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I would like to begin by acknowledging the traditional owners and custodians of the land on which we meet today, the Yugambeh people. I pay my respects to their elders past and present &ndash; and extend that respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people here today.</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone. It&rsquo;s lovely to be here. I want to thank the Small Business Association of Australia for inviting me to speak to you.</p>
<p>The small business sector is ASIC&rsquo;s largest stakeholder group. But that&rsquo;s not typically what comes to mind when most people think of us. Present company excepted, of course.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably because, when ASIC is covered in the media, it&rsquo;s more often about some other aspect of our work &ndash; usually enforcement-related and usually involving a large or well-known entity.</p>
<p>But, in fact, one of the key drivers for taking enforcement action is to help ensure a fair playing field and protect small businesses from unfair practices and harmful conduct.</p>
<p>We regularly take regulatory and enforcement action, for example, against financial services and credit providers that engage in misconduct that impacts small business &ndash; and we have a dedicated small business enforcement team.</p>
<p>We also have a highly active small business team, who engage with government agencies, industry associations and small business representatives to share insights, improve regulatory coordination, and minimise duplication and unnecessary regulatory burden for small businesses.</p>
<p>In the last financial year, we took part in around 100 small business events and meetings &ndash; in every state and territory. This face-to-face engagement is a critical part of ASIC&rsquo;s small business strategy.</p>
<p>What I want to focus on today, though, is the important work that ASIC does to support the sector through our regulatory guidance and information &ndash; and by providing efficient registry services.</p>
<p>In particular, I want to talk about the work we&rsquo;re doing through our regulatory simplification program to improve those services &ndash; for the millions of small businesses who rely on them.</p>
<p>I will also talk about climate reporting. These obligations apply mainly to larger entities. They&rsquo;re new and still being phased in. But, over time, they will have some impact on some small businesses. So, we&rsquo;re doing a range of things to help those businesses prepare.</p>
<h2>Regulatory simplification</h2>
<p>So, first to regulatory simplification. This is a multi-year program that touches on almost every part of our work, including our registry services. But, at its heart, it&rsquo;s designed to make it easier for our regulated entities to meet their obligations &ndash; small businesses very much included.</p>
<p>We understand that small businesses are often time-poor and resource-stretched. Unlike the big corporates, they don&rsquo;t have legions of support staff to help out. So, it&rsquo;s often very much a DIY situation &ndash; and that means time out of an already busy day. Time that could have been spent doing business.</p>
<p>ASIC wants to give small businesses some of that time back &ndash; and that&rsquo;s one of the things we&rsquo;re aiming for with our regulatory simplification program.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve broken the program down into four workstreams:</p>
<ol>
<li>Improving access to regulatory information</li>
<li>Reducing complexity in regulatory instruments</li>
<li>Making it easier to interact with ASIC</li>
<li>Simplification through law reform.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to focus on the first and the third: &lsquo;improving access to regulatory information&rsquo; and &lsquo;making it easier to interact with ASIC&rsquo;.</p>
<p>These are the areas that will make the biggest difference to small businesses, day to day. We&rsquo;ve already made some improvements, with more planned &ndash; as I&rsquo;ll explain.</p>
<h2>Improving access to regulatory information</h2>
<p>So, to workstream number one: improving access to regulatory information. What have we done so far?</p>
<p>We've redesigned the ASIC website.</p>
<p>We heard that finding the right information could be &lsquo;hit and miss&rsquo;. So, we gave it an overhaul. We&rsquo;ve improved the navigation, put in a better search function and removed more than 9,000 pages of duplicated content.</p>
<p>This means users will be able to access the information they need quicker &ndash; and can be confident all the relevant information has been surfaced.</p>
<p>The new website features a specific&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/regulatory-resources-search/" title="Regulatory resources search">regulatory resources search</a>&nbsp;&ndash; a click away from the homepage. Here, users can find all ASIC forms, instruments and regulatory documents in one place. You can filter these by topic and/or type by selecting the advanced search option at the top of the page.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also got a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/for-business-and-companies/business-basics/" title="Business basics">business basics</a>&nbsp;area, with useful information for small businesses including &lsquo;registering a business name&rsquo; and &lsquo;business name requirements for different types of businesses&rsquo;. You can find that by entering it into the search bar on our homepage.</p>
<p>Of course, being able to find the information you&rsquo;re looking for is one thing. But if it&rsquo;s confusing or hard to understand, then the benefits are limited.</p>
<p>So as part of this workstream, we&rsquo;re also looking at how to make our information simpler and clearer. That&rsquo;s not just about how it&rsquo;s written, though that&rsquo;s obviously important. It&rsquo;s also about thinking through how the different materials we produce work together.</p>
<p>While all designed to help our regulated populations understand their obligations, we understand that the range of materials available can be a source of confusion in itself.</p>
<p>Users have told us they don&rsquo;t always feel sure they&rsquo;re looking at the most relevant information for their purposes &ndash; or that they&rsquo;ve found all the information they need on a topic.</p>
<p>So, we&rsquo;re working to better structure these materials &ndash; and are considering some proposals to take this forward. To help us, we engaged some experts. As part of their work, they reviewed the needs of our different audiences &ndash; including small businesses and directors of small companies.</p>
<p>This is an important audience group for us &ndash; and one that has distinct needs. We appreciate that it can be difficult for them to find materials that really help them &ndash; and it can be equally difficult to find the time to engage with them if they do.</p>
<p>One way we&rsquo;re working to address their needs is through a regulatory roadmap we&rsquo;re developing for small-company directors. This will guide users through all the stages of starting and running a company &ndash; as well as closing and/or reinstating it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s some of what we&rsquo;ve done so far &ndash; and some of what&rsquo;s to come.</p>
<h2>Making it easier to interact with ASIC</h2>
<p>Turning now to workstream number three: making it easier to interact with ASIC.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start with some of the pain points we know users are experiencing and that we&rsquo;re working to address.</p>
<p>To begin with, we&rsquo;ve got multiple portals, each with their own purpose, access and authentication methods. That&rsquo;s creating a fragmented experience for users. There are also issues with navigation and usability, system slowness &ndash; and difficulties being able to quickly lodge and update information.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a time cost to all of that &ndash; and, to my earlier point, that&rsquo;s time that could be spent doing business.</p>
<p>So, what are we doing about it?</p>
<p>We have a major multi-year program of work underway to improve our business registry related technology and processes. Through that program, which we call RegistryConnect, we are working to stabilise, secure and modernise the ASIC registers.</p>
<p>Importantly, from a user&rsquo;s perspective, this will enable simpler and more reliable interactions with ASIC. It will also improve the quality and integrity of our registry data.</p>
<p>While these longer-term improvements are being implemented, we&rsquo;ve been working to ease the pressure through some short-term solutions to some of the most pressing issues.</p>
<p>For example, we&rsquo;ve started accepting email lodgements in place of any paper forms that can&rsquo;t be lodged online. We now accept electronic signatures on all ASIC forms. We&rsquo;ve also cut call waiting times &ndash; by expanding our team of customer service officers and investing in new technology.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve upgraded ASIC&rsquo;s mainframe, which supports our online registry services, to help address that system slowness. We&rsquo;ve also reduced scheduled downtime for planned maintenance, delivering more reliable access to company searches.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got a new professional registers search, with a refreshed and modern interface and advanced search functionality across multiple registers. It also incorporates a simple and secure payment process.</p>
<p>In addition to these relative quick fixes, as I mentioned, we have other, more substantial improvements underway in relation to our registry services.</p>
<p>In this next phase of our RegistryConnect program, we&rsquo;re working to improve online company registration and lodgement services. This will provide a better user experience, allow users to track the status of their interactions with ASIC and make secure digital payments.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll also expand our streamlined digital services to support more professional registrations and licence types. This is part of a broader effort to reduce the number of transaction channels &ndash; responding to the issue of fragmentation I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>Separately, through our new and improved companies register search, it will be easier to access company information &ndash; thanks to its enhanced search functionality and improved service availability.</p>
<p>We are also working to improve the integrity of the data held on our registers by strengthening our authentication processes. This will reduce the risk of fraudulent or misleading lodgements and provide greater assurance to users and the public.</p>
<p>Lastly, another key priority will be to link director IDs to the companies register. Over time, this will improve the traceability of director&ndash;company relationships and further prevent the use of fraudulent identities.</p>
<p>In doing so, it will provide the public and stakeholders &ndash; including small businesses &ndash; with greater certainty about who they are dealing with when engaging with directors and corporate entities.</p>
<p>As our work in this area develops, we will continue engaging with our stakeholders in the design of future services. This includes ongoing collaboration through the Registry Business Advisory Group, whose membership includes end users of these services.</p>
<p>We will also continue to engage with Treasury and others, including on policy and law reform to improve registry outcomes.</p>
<h2>Climate reporting</h2>
<p>Turning now to a different category of law reform &ndash; and that&rsquo;s the new mandatory climate-related financial disclosure requirements, which came into effect just over a year ago.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still some way from this being fully phased in. But are expecting to see the first reports &ndash; from the largest of the three cohorts &ndash; from around March next year.</p>
<p>These requirements won&rsquo;t directly apply to any small businesses.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll only apply to large companies that meet two of the three following criteria: revenue of over $50 million, assets of over $25 million and/or companies with more than 100 employees.</p>
<p>However, many small businesses form part of the value chains of larger businesses. That means they may need to engage with climate reporting considerations in the future. Even though they do not have any direct climate reporting obligations.</p>
<p>So, if a small business has a customer or supplier that is a large business or financial institution, they may request further information to help them meet their reporting obligations.</p>
<p>For example, that large business or financial institution may need to report on their energy usage &ndash; and may ask for records, such as electricity bills, so they can create a full picture.</p>
<p>ASIC has been developing our capability in this area for a number of years &ndash; and we&rsquo;ve been working with reporting entities to help them prepare. So, it&rsquo;s been a learning experience for all &ndash; and we do appreciate that there are some concerns.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s acknowledged by academia &ndash; and was identified in public submissions to the law reform process &ndash; that there is a need for capacity-building in this area across the financial system.</p>
<p>So, in that sense, small business is not alone on the learning journey. But, for all the reasons mentioned previously, we recognise that the smaller the business the bigger the relative impact of any additional requirements.</p>
<p>That said, there will be time to prepare &ndash; and ASIC will be assisting with that however we can.</p>
<p>For those who want more detail, I would recommend visiting our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/sustainability-reporting/sustainability-reporting-for-small-business/" title="Sustainability reporting for small business">sustainability reporting for small business</a>&nbsp;page, which, incidentally, you can also find by using the search bar on our homepage. There&rsquo;s some good information there.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also developing a suite of educational materials in partnership with the University of Technology Sydney and the Australian Accounting Standards Board.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re aimed at the smallest reporting cohort as well as SMEs who are required to submit emissions-related information &ndash; and they&rsquo;re focused on the foundational concepts underpinning the sustainability reporting requirements.</p>
<p>These educational materials will help those who are interested to understand, for example, the basics of climate change, what climate-related physical risks and transition risks are, case studies on identifying climate-related opportunities, and an introduction to emissions accounting.</p>
<p>Once these materials are complete, we&rsquo;ll make them available on our website &ndash; and will also be holding a series of roadshows to take people through them.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, finally, I just want to thank you all for your time. I hope that has been useful. I know we have a Q&amp;A session coming up. So, if there&rsquo;s anything more you want to know about these topics &ndash; or anything else &ndash; I&rsquo;ll be happy to answer your questions.</p>

<title>ASIC Issues DDO Stop Order Against FXCM For TMD Deficiencies</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-issues-ddo-stop-order-against-fxcm-for-tmd-deficiencies-2025125/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-issues-ddo-stop-order-against-fxcm-for-tmd-deficiencies-2025125/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC has made an interim stop order preventing Stratos Trading Pty Limited (trading as FXCM) from issuing contracts for difference (CFDs) to retail clients because of deficiencies in its target market determination (TMD).</p>
<p>ASIC acted because it was concerned that the TMD inappropriately included investors with a medium risk appetite in the target market for FXCM&rsquo;s CFDs.</p>
<p>ASIC considers that the risks associated with trading FXCM&rsquo;s CFDs, including leverage, volatility, liquidity and pricing risk, make them unlikely to be suitable for investors who have a &lsquo;medium risk appetite&rsquo;, regardless of any other investment criteria noted in the TMD.</p>
<p>The interim stop order prohibits FXCM from issuing CFDs to retail clients and opening trading accounts for new retail clients to trade in those CFDs. It covers CFDs issued by FXCM that reference the following underling asset classes:</p>
<ul>
<li>currency pairs and forex baskets</li>
<li>treasuries and commodities</li>
<li>stock indices</li>
<li>stocks and stock baskets, and</li>
<li>cryptocurrencies.</li>
</ul>
<p>ASIC made the interim order to prevent FXCM from issuing CFDs to retail clients, where distribution of the products is unlikely to be consistent with the financial objectives, situation or needs of consumers in its target market. The order does not prevent FXCM&rsquo;s existing clients from varying or closing their CFD positions.</p>
<p>The order is valid for 21 days unless revoked earlier.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Under the design and distribution obligations (DDO), financial product issuers must define an appropriate target market for a financial product offered to retail clients, having regard to the risks and features of the product. Issuers also need to consider how their product will be distributed and specify appropriate conditions on distribution conduct so that the product is directed to the target market and is unlikely to be acquired by consumers outside the target market.</p>
<p>CFDs are leveraged derivative contracts that allow a client to speculate in the change in value of an underlying asset, such as foreign exchange rates, stock market indices, single equities, commodities or crypto assets.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s product intervention order for CFDs strengthened consumer protections after reviews in 2017, 2019 and 2020 found that most retail clients lose money trading CFDs (refer&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2020-releases/20-254mr-asic-product-intervention-order-strengthens-cfd-protections/" title="20-254MR ASIC product intervention order strengthens CFD protections">20-254MR</a>). In April 2022, ASIC extended this order for a further five years to 23 May 2027 (refer&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2022-releases/22-082mr-asic-s-cfd-product-intervention-order-extended-for-five-years/" title="22-082MR ASIC&rsquo;s CFD product intervention order extended for five years">22-082MR</a>).</p>
<p>On 6 September 2023, ASIC released Report 770&nbsp;<em>Design and distribution obligations: Retail OTC derivatives</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-770-design-and-distribution-obligations-retail-otc-derivatives/" title="REP 770 Design and distribution obligations: Retail OTC derivatives">REP 770</a>), outlining how issuers of retail OTC derivatives are meeting DDO and highlighting areas for improvement, including their over-reliance on client questionnaires as a primary distribution filter and making greater use of available data to assist the distribution arrangements.</p>
<p>On 10 September 2024, ASIC released REP 795&nbsp;<em>Design and distribution obligations: Compliance with the reasonable steps obligation&nbsp;</em>(<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-795-design-and-distribution-obligations-compliance-with-the-reasonable-steps-obligation/" title="REP 795 Design and distribution obligations: Compliance with the reasonable steps obligation">REP 795</a>), outlining our key observations on how issuers of high-risk products including CFDs are complying with the reasonable steps obligation and highlighting further areas for improvement.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://moneysmart.gov.au/">Moneysmart website</a>&nbsp;has further information about&nbsp;<a href="https://moneysmart.gov.au/investment-warnings/forex-trading">forex trading</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://moneysmart.gov.au/glossary/contracts-for-difference-cfd">CFDs</a>.</p>

<p>PNG Registries is a key provider of securities registry services and the proposed acquisition will strengthen the foundation for capital market modernization.</p>
<h4>Part of a Broader Market Development Strategy</h4>
<p>The acquisition is aligned with broader national efforts to strengthen the capital market ecosystem. In due course, it is expected to support the end-to-end automation of trading, settlement, and registration processes, enabling a more modern, transparent, and efficient market platform. This development is intended to enhance liquidity and facilitate broader market participation.</p>
<h4>Continuity for Customers</h4>
<p>Until regulatory clearance is obtained, PNG Registries and PNGX Group will continue to operate as separate businesses. There will be no changes to services or operations in the interim. Customers and partners of both companies have been notified and will be kept informed as the process progresses.</p>
<p>MUFG Pension &amp; Market Services and PNGX Group are committed to a smooth and transparent transition, with a focus on continuity and customer service.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday announced pricing, effective January 1, 2026, for payment services the Federal Reserve Banks provide to banks and credit unions, such as the clearing of checks, automated clearing house (ACH) transactions, instant payments, and wholesale payment and settlement services.</p>
<p>By law, the Federal Reserve must establish fees to recover the costs, including imputed costs, of providing payment services over the long run. The Federal Reserve expects to recover 108 percent of actual and imputed expenses in 2026, including the return on equity that would have been earned if a private-sector firm provided the services. Overall, price changes for 2026 will result in an estimated 0.9 percent average price increase for established, mature services.</p>
<p>The entire 2026 fee schedule is published on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.frbservices.org/resources/fees">FRBservices.org</a><span>&reg;</span>. Additional information on the Federal Reserve's payments services, including service usage statistics, is available on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems.htm">Board's website</a>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday requested public input on the impact of potential strategic changes to check services provided by the Fed, as well as check usage and preferences.</p>
<p>The Reserve Banks offer check collection and processing services at a fee to banks and credit unions. Over time, check use has steadily declined, digital payment methods have grown in availability and use, and check fraud has risen. Also, the Reserve Banks will need to make substantial investments in their check infrastructure to continue providing the same level of check services going forward. To help the Board understand stakeholder needs and balance tradeoffs as it considers the future of the Reserve Banks' check services, the Board is seeking input on potential future changes to check services with varying effects on the level of check services offered and their costs. For example, potential future changes could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Foregoing investments in the Reserve Banks' check infrastructure to keep operating costs at existing levels with reduced reliability of check services over time;</li>
<li>Investing in the Reserve Banks' check infrastructure to maintain and potentially improve check services with higher operating costs; or</li>
<li>Significantly reducing check services, or alternatively, substantially winding them down, both resulting in reduced operating costs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Board's request for public input asks several questions about these potential changes, including the impact on consumers and businesses. This request for public input is preliminary. Accordingly, if commenters and the Board's analysis support a strategy that may have significant longer-run effects on the nation's payments system, the Board would seek additional public comment on such changes to check services prior to adoption.</p>
<p>Comments are due within 90 days after publication in the&nbsp;<em>Federal Register</em>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On Thursday, December 11, Secretary of the Treasury Scott K. H. Bessent will preside over a meeting of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council) at the Treasury Department. The meeting will consist of an executive session and an open session. The preliminary agenda for the executive session includes an update on the Council&rsquo;s workstreams, as well as an update on the Council&rsquo;s interpretive guidance on nonbank financial company determinations and the Council&rsquo;s analytic framework for financial stability risk identification, assessment, and response.* The preliminary agenda for the open session includes a presentation and vote on the Council&rsquo;s 2025 annual report, and an update on banking supervision and regulatory reforms.</p>
<p>The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires the Council to convene no less than quarterly, but the Council has historically convened on a more frequent basis. The meetings bring Council members together to discuss and analyze emerging market developments and financial regulatory issues. The Council is committed to conducting its business as openly and transparently as practicable, given the confidential supervisory and sensitive information at the center of its work. Consistent with the&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/261/The%20Council%26%23039%3Bs%20Transparency%20Policy_1.pdf">Council's transparency policy</a>, the Council opens its meetings to the public whenever possible.</p>
<p><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/webcasts">Open session Council meetings are made available to the public via live webcast and can also be viewed after they occur</a>. Upcoming Council meeting dates and times are posted following the official notification to Council members of an upcoming meeting.</p>
<p>Meeting minutes and readouts for past Council meetings are available below. Meeting minutes for the most recent Council meeting are generally approved at the next Council meeting and posted online soon afterwards.</p>
<p><small>* In accordance with the Council&rsquo;s Transparency Policy, which is available at&nbsp;</small><a href="http://www.fsoc.gov/"><small>www.fsoc.gov</small></a><small>, this portion of the meeting will be held in a closed session to prevent the potential disclosure of information contained in or related to investigation, examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of, an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial markets or financial institutions; information which would lead to significant financial speculation, significantly endanger the stability of any financial market or financial institution, or significantly frustrate implementation of a proposed agency action; information exempted from disclosure by statute or by regulation, or authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order to be kept secret; trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential; and inter-agency and intra-agency memoranda or letters which would not otherwise be available by law.&nbsp;</small></p>

<title>Remarks At The Meeting Of The Investor Advisory Committee, SEC Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw, Washington D.C., Dec. 4, 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Good morning.&nbsp;Welcome to the members of the Committee as well as the panelists.&nbsp;This is the final Investor Advisory Committee meeting of my tenure as an SEC Commissioner, so today&rsquo;s meeting is bittersweet for me.</p>
<p>First and foremost, I want to express my sincere gratitude to all of the members of this Committee.&nbsp;Your work on behalf of investors is deeply important; it is meaningful and tireless; it is thoughtful and balanced.&nbsp;You do this work in your free time, even though, for many of you, it could be a full-time job. You bring diverse expertise to the table, as well as the clear-eyed, common goal of making the markets better for investors, so that Americans of all stripes can live their own versions of the American Dream. That is no small task, but it is one that you all have approached with steel and grace. These are more than just platitudes.</p>
<p>I want each of you to know that I&rsquo;ve listened to your recommendations and they have universally improved our policy making.&nbsp;As you move forward, I hope you will continue to bring energy and enthusiasm to the tasks that lie ahead.&nbsp;As the Commission will no doubt continue to deregulate in the months ahead, please act as a voice for those investors who stand to benefit from those rules that will be threatened with potential revision or repeal.&nbsp;I have no doubt that you are up for the challenge.</p>
<p>And for my fellow Commissioners, I hope that you will continue to seek a diversity of viewpoints as you select Committee members in the future, because I believe sincerely that a robust and respectfully dissonant discussion leads to more considered policy advice and outcomes.</p>
<p>And another big thank you to Cristina [Martin Firvida], who leaves us at the end of this month. You have been a leader and a friend, and your work will benefit investors well beyond your time here.&nbsp;The agency will miss you. I wish you great success in your future endeavors.</p>
<h3>Changing Corporate Governance Landscape</h3>
<p>Shifting gears, there is no better topic to underscore the important work of this Committee on behalf of investors than the changing corporate governance landscape.</p>
<p>In under one year, this landscape has shifted dramatically.</p>
<ul>
<li>Staff rescinded Staff Legal Bulletin 14L, making it easier to exclude certain shareholder proposals;<a class="ck-anchor" id="_ftnref1"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-meeting-investor-advisory-committee-120425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a></li>
<li>Staff has determined not to weigh in on the majority of no-action requests as part of the 14a-8 process, except that it will issue &ldquo;no objection&rdquo; relief to those who ask for it, based on no substantive review of underlying requests;<a class="ck-anchor" id="_ftnref2"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-meeting-investor-advisory-committee-120425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2">[2]</a></li>
<li>the Chairman has indicated that the Commission will greenlight the exclusion of most precatory proxy proposals, based not on changes in state law, but on the speculations of certain Delaware practitioners;<a class="ck-anchor" id="_ftnref3"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-meeting-investor-advisory-committee-120425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3">[3]</a></li>
<li>the Commission has issued a policy statement effectively permitting public companies to employ mandatory arbitration clauses to prevent shareholders from litigating either their singular or class-action claims in federal court;<a class="ck-anchor" id="_ftnref4"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-meeting-investor-advisory-committee-120425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4">[4]</a></li>
<li>staff has granted no-action relief to allow retail shareholders to &ldquo;check the box&rdquo; to a standing instruction that automatically votes their shares in conformance with board recommendations, without individual consideration of specific issues, including, potentially, merger or divestiture votes;<a class="ck-anchor" id="_ftnref5"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-meeting-investor-advisory-committee-120425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5">[5]</a></li>
<li>staff has issued guidance under Rules 13D/G that limits investor interaction with management to chill those communications;<a class="ck-anchor" id="_ftnref6"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-meeting-investor-advisory-committee-120425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6">[6]</a></li>
<li>and, as stated by the Chairman, we know it is his intention to seek to reduce the cadence of quarterly reporting requirements, and diminish disclosures in areas such as executive compensation.<a class="ck-anchor" id="_ftnref7"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-meeting-investor-advisory-committee-120425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7">[7]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And that is just the beginning.</p>
<p><em><span>Any one</span></em>&nbsp;of these changes would be groundbreaking;&nbsp;<em><span>together</span></em>, they represent a seismic shift in the corporate governance landscape happening right under our feet.</p>
<p>And yet, as my colleagues know because I keep reminding everyone, not a single one of the changes effected to date has been done through notice-and-comment rulemaking.&nbsp;That means that we have not had the benefit of statutorily mandated economic analysis to assess the impacts of the deeply important policy shifts that we&rsquo;re making.&nbsp;We haven&rsquo;t measured the economic costs or benefits of any single change, and we&nbsp;<em><span>certainly</span></em>&nbsp;have not measured the cumulative effect of these policy changes, which I have been told repeatedly in the past<em><span>&nbsp;</span></em>is important to members of the industry.&nbsp;Moreover, we have not benefitted from the considered feedback of impacted investors &ndash; investors who will have fewer disclosures; less input over how the management of the companies&nbsp;<em><span>they own</span></em>&nbsp;put their investor dollars to work; and, potentially fewer (if any) avenues of redress when they are the victims of fraud.</p>
<p>Indeed, all of these changes lopsidedly inure to the benefit of management and to the detriment of shareholders, corporate accountability, and the governance structures that provide checks on corporate decision makers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why today&rsquo;s panel is so timely and so important.&nbsp;Help us understand both the singular and cumulative impacts that our deregulatory efforts in this space will have on investors.&nbsp;Bring data, analysis and precedent to the conversation.&nbsp;Help lend a voice to investors who didn&rsquo;t have the opportunity to weigh in before these changes were made because the Commission chose to leave them out in the cold.</p>
<h3>Tokenization</h3>
<p>I am also looking forward to today&rsquo;s panel on tokenization, which will tackle the many challenges associated with tokenized equity products.&nbsp;As I have said before,<a class="ck-anchor" id="_ftnref8"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-meeting-investor-advisory-committee-120425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8">[8]</a>&nbsp;tokenization raises a host of complex, novel issues on how tokenized securities could be issued, traded, cleared, and settled.&nbsp;Altering established regulatory standards to accommodate these novel processes would carry significant risk, both to market integrity and to investors.&nbsp;At the same time, new rules may be warranted to address these products&rsquo; unique risks.</p>
<p>For example, tokenized equities are commonly marketed as &ldquo;wrapped securities&rdquo; that provide exposure to an underlying asset.&nbsp;Some are touted as expanding access to assets, such as private company shares, that are typically inaccessible to retail investors. But in truth, these tokenized products are far from one-to-one replicas of the underlying asset to which they are supposedly linked.&nbsp;The ownership rights and entitlements are different, often unclear, and potentially entirely unconnected to the issuer of the underlying asset.&nbsp;They are generally less liquid than traditional securities and much harder to price and trade.</p>
<p>How can investors, or their advisors, fairly evaluate the risks of these wrapped tokenized securities?&nbsp;Should the regulatory requirements that govern them be relaxed just because the product exists on a blockchain?&nbsp;Do wrapped tokenized securities offer any clear benefits to investors that may justify their heightened risks?</p>
<p>Most importantly, what are we actually trying to achieve by tokenizing equities in secondary markets?&nbsp;If the purpose is to achieve settlement efficiencies, then that presents a much different use case than if the purpose is to allow tokenized equities to trade without any front-end investor protections, which would create an environment ripe for regulatory arbitrage at the expense of the traditional equities markets.&nbsp;If this new ecosystem does not provide either common market transparency about price or visible customer protections, I ask again&mdash;what is the goal and the likely outcome here?</p>
<p>These are difficult and complex questions, and I look forward to hearing the panelists&rsquo; views.</p>
<p class="text-align-center">***</p>
<p>Many thanks again to the Committee for both your hard work leading up to today&mdash;including what I thought was a very helpful recommendation on disclosures around artificial intelligence&mdash;and thank you in advance for your continued work in the future.&nbsp;I sincerely hope that our paths will cross again.&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>One cannot jump to the &ldquo;How&rdquo; when the &ldquo;What&rdquo; has <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> been properly defined. Despite the EU being the first to come up with their Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act and Canada being at the forefront of digital assets laws, there is NO first mover advantage in rule making. It is better late than never if we can get it right when framing the regulatory solutions to the problems in the AI and Crypto spaces. This 3-part sequel aims to decipher the noumenon of and define what AI, DeFi, tokenization and cryptocurrencies truly are.</p>
<p><img alt="KTO_AI_Part_1_2025" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/KTO_AI_Part_1_2025.jpg" title="KTO_AI_Part_1_2025" /></p>
<h2>Definition of AI</h2>
<p>AI is NO ordinary <i>&ldquo;machine-based systems&rdquo;</i> or <i>&ldquo;automations&rdquo;</i>, but a <i>&ldquo;cognitive system&rdquo; </i>capable of <i>&ldquo;learning&rdquo;</i> to continuously improve the Functioning of a Computer / to any Other Technology or Technical Field (e.g. a GPS Satellite system is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> AI, but traffic predictions and personalized recommendations are). By referring to AI as <i>&ldquo;cognitive&rdquo;</i>, the focus is on the system&rsquo;s internal (mental like) processes, rather than SOLELY on external behaviors and consequences.</p>
<p>Learning per the <i>&ldquo;</i><a href="https://cavcanine.com/classical-conditioning/"><i>Dog Salivating Theory</i></a><i>&rdquo;</i> that nurtures voluntary behavior by pairing external conditioned stimulus to associate two or more phenomena, such technique alone does <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> constitute it as AI. Computational techniques that mimic pet training in itself are insufficient or unlikely to pose an existential threat to humanity, except exploitation of Dopamine for addictive behaviors. Also, the presence or absence of <i>&ldquo;</i><a href="https://psychcentral.com/health/operant-conditioning"><i>operant conditions</i></a><i>&rdquo;</i> could merely be automation in itself to modify voluntary behavior through external consequences (reacting to the laws) of reward and punishment. Without combining it with other internal (mental like) computational techniques, such systems should <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> be considered as AI.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA">CAPTCHA</a> &ndash; a security test that uses a <i>"</i><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/Turing-test"><i>Turing test</i></a><i>"</i> to differentiate between humans and bots is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> AI in itself.&nbsp; However, Google reCAPTCHA system is part of an AI that consists of internal processes (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystroke_logging">keylogging</a> to track and analyze user interactions, such as mouse movement and typing patterns) to determine if a user is human. Keylogging without a user&rsquo;s consent could be invasive to privacy; hence it should be a regulated activity. Another computing activity that should be regulated is &ndash; the <a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/future-technology/ai-vs-captcha">use of AI to help bots bypass CAPTCHA</a> or the like security test, except when used for ethical hacking.</p>
<p>fA crawler or web scraper that automatically extracts data from an external environment (web) is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> inherently an AI. When combining crawler&rsquo;s function with internal processes involving intelligent data analysis to enhance the data collection with contextual understanding (rather than just the keywords search), then such system is an AI.</p>
<p>A scanner or camera to surveil the public area outside of private property is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> an AI. Adding a sophisticated system that has internal processes to control one or orchestrate multiple surveillance camera(s) to enhance the monitoring with contextual awareness (e.g. facial recognition to analyze identity) is an AI.</p>
<p>We despise heavy-handed government policies to brutally force AI firms to censor / filtering so-called <i>&ldquo;unsafe behaviors / outputs&rdquo;</i> or require adversarial training to ban or reveal what authoritarian may constitute as <i>&ldquo;vulnerabilities&rdquo;</i>. We are thankful for <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-vice-president-the-artificial-intelligence-action-summit-paris-france">Vice President JD Vance remarks</a> at the AI Action Summit, in particular <i>&ldquo;AI must remain free from ideological bias, and that American AI will not be co-opted into a tool for authoritarian censorship.&rdquo; </i>It helps address civic concerns over <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/cs181/projects/ethics-of-surveillance/ethics.html">massive government surveillance</a>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOTE</span>: <i>&ldquo;Ideological bias&rdquo;</i> is a human bias driven by political or social belief. Whereas <i>&ldquo;bias&rdquo;</i> in many domains &ndash; especially competitive ones like defense or finance &ndash; bias is not just inevitable, it is essential to: prioritize certain outcomes (e.g. speed over accuracy, stealth over transparency), reflect strategic performance (e.g. risk tolerance, adversary modeling), and/or to exploit asymmetries (e.g. alpha in trading, deception in war).</p>
<p>There are different AI machine learning algorithms, some use cognitive reasoning for multi-step strategic plans (e.g. chess game) where <i>&ldquo;bias&rdquo;</i> is essential. Others use non-reasoning (or generative) models excel at fast, pattern-based tasks like content generation or chatbots where consensus building and/or optimization for the most commonly accepted respond (consistency in reproducibility of outcomes) is prioritized. One size does not fit all.</p>
<p>Bias can be <i>&ldquo;conscious&rdquo;</i> and <i>&ldquo;unconscious&rdquo;</i>. A cognitive system does <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> have to be conscious. Neuroscientists believe consciousness could be a distributed process that does not depend on a singular <i>&ldquo;self&rdquo;</i>. Unconscious bias can inflict harm amid unintentional &ndash; negligence. <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/cs/cognitive-computing-vs-ai">Cognitive systems with no recommendations</a> should <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> escape AI responsibilities. <i>&ldquo;Bias&rdquo;</i> depends on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_norm">social norm</a>. Social norm evolves overtime.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Signal amplification&rdquo;</i> is an absolute necessity in sequencing technologies. It enables detection, ensures accuracy via redundancy, and is particularly useful when working with limited input material. However, amplification inherently introduces <i>&ldquo;technical bias&rdquo;</i> into sequencing data &ndash; a known and acknowledged challenge, but it may be better than the inability to generate any data at all.</p>
<p>The US trade surveillance process <i>objectively</i> checks if a trade has the effect of altering the worth of a target. It is a <i>red flag</i> of market manipulation if the trade caused a <i>&ldquo;bias&rdquo;</i> in market mechanism. The challenge is how to distinguish between a <i>systematic technical bias</i> or human-made <i>artifact</i> in data, from <i>natural evolutionary bias</i> or <i>selection</i>. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/joc/article/73/5/463/7190600">Content preference</a> and <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jrsssa/article/185/Supplement_2/S620/7069513">context bias</a> are highly dependent on the specific use case or application, i.e. largely <i>subjective</i> and situational.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Normalization&rdquo; is the statistical data smoothing process that meant to address <i>&ldquo;bias&rdquo;</i>. Yet, whenever one applies computational methods to the data, the relationship between the true <i>&ldquo;signal&rdquo;</i> and the technical <i>&ldquo;noise&rdquo;</i> is inherently altered. There is a trade-off in gaining clarity of signal at the potential cost of introducing subtle <i>&ldquo;new biases&rdquo;</i> or <i>suppressing</i> real, but weak, <i>&ldquo;signals&rdquo;</i>. Strive for the most timely, accurate, relevant, and complete data where possible to avoid excessive manipulation in normalization for the best sequencing results. Unfortunately, consolidated tape without <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/market-data-available-securely-synchronized-time-kelvin-to/">time-lock encryption to make market data available securely in synchronized time</a> caused <i>&ldquo;initial bias&rdquo; </i>that exacerbates the gap between subscribers of proprietary feeds and the public SIPs.</p>
<p>Hallucination is considered an output that is out of norms. Hallucinations are like dreams (a state of consciousness that one&rsquo;s <i>&ldquo;awareness&rdquo;</i> of external environments may be out of synch), except dreams may be more vivid / emotion than hallucinations. Human&rsquo;s five senses are less active when dream. When AI sensory attenuation primarily focused on language or visual images, it undermines other sensory inputs, such as sound, touch, smell and taste, etc.</p>
<p>AI is often being mythologized by humans as all-knowing. People expect instant gratification. Yet, AIs are like <i>replicas</i> of humans. There will be occasions of <i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo;</i>, irrelevant fluff being generated, stuttering, or words could not catch up with thoughts. The ability to form and process complex thoughts is distinct from the ability to articulate fluently and coherently. Improve context awareness, better adversary training, use of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/381994127_Ensemble_Deep_Learning_and_Machine_Learning_Applications_Opportunities_Challenges_and_Future_Directions">ensemble learning</a>, and <a href="https://www.sdu.dk/en/forskning/cmc/key-terms/multimodality">multimodality</a> all contribute to reducing AI hallucinations but cost extra time, efforts, and may introduce noise.</p>
<p>Unlike <i>data</i> extraction that can be <i>timely</i>, <i>accurate</i> and <i>complete</i> if one is willing to pay extra, <i>intelligence</i> may never be 100%. I.e. AI <i>prediction</i> or <i>advice</i> seldom possess all attributes simultaneously due to in inherent constraints, such as information asymmetry, the tension between speed and quality, cognitive limitations, and the dynamic nature of reality. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Do <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> lambast AI for hallucination. Humans often fail to think critically, unable to synthesize information from various sources for evaluating information to find deeper meaning, and lack adaptability and creativity. Yet, humans like to dream and imagine. Should cognitive systems be allowed to dream &ndash; a possible indicator of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence">Artificial General Intelligence</a>? AI hallucinations may discover <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_unknown_unknowns">unknown unknowns</a> which were previously nonsensical to human. To better understand nuances and enhance AI performance, policy makers should incentivize the industry to turn <i>&ldquo;unknowns&rdquo;</i> into <i>&ldquo;knowns.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>The last administration inappropriately assumed or interpreted <i>&ldquo;AI bias&rdquo;</i> as systematic and repeatable error in a computer system that creates unfair outcomes, such as disadvantaging a particular gender or race. This contradicts with the current administration&rsquo;s merit-based policy (<a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-02097.pdf">EO 14173</a>) that dismantles Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives. Trying to <i>&ldquo;neutralize&rdquo;</i> biases in pursuit of consensus or fairness can dilute the US strategic advantage, especially when foreign adversaries are not playing by the same rules.</p>
<p>The EU AI Act mandates development of a Code of Practice on General-Purpose AI is problematic. Best practice sharing is not wrong. Concern is &ndash; how they would consider <i>&ldquo;the Code&rsquo;s design and build coherence where needed&rdquo;</i>? Regurgitating GRC tools as AI compliance is the wrong approach. <i>&ldquo;Coherence&rdquo;</i> limits creativity. Differentiation is what drives innovation. The EU Digital Markets Act aims to ensure <i>&ldquo;fair competition and practices among large online &lsquo;gatekeeper&rsquo; platforms like search engines and app store&rdquo; </i>is nothing but a protectionism policy. Invoke Antitrust laws may suffice.</p>
<p>China recently released their <i>&ldquo;AI Safety Governance Framework 2.0&rdquo; </i>(<a href="https://www.cac.gov.cn/2025-09/15/c_1759653448369123.htm">CN-AISGF2</a>). Their <a href="https://digichina.stanford.edu/work/translation-cybersecurity-law-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china-effective-june-1-2017/">cybersecurity law</a>, computer crime criminal law (<a href="https://www.warnathgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/China-Criminal-Code.pdf">Articles 285-287</a>), and <a href="https://digichina.stanford.edu/work/translation-personal-information-protection-law-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china-effective-nov-1-2021/">Personal Information Protection Law</a> are their broader policies that prioritize their national security and state control. CN-AISGF2 looks undeniably comprehensive as we compared it against the 2022 version of the US NIST-AIRMF (see pages 9-10 of our <a href="https://www.databoiler.com/index_htm_files/DataBoiler%20WHOSTP%2020251027R.pdf">comment letter</a>). Their usage of familiar GRC best practices make it appealing for foreign jurisdictions to adopt it. The US NIST-AIRMF playbook and related guidances if blindly continuing the oversimplified <i>&ldquo;Govern&rdquo;</i> in center of <i>&ldquo;Map, Measure, and Manage&rdquo;</i> (GMMM) path may end-up similar to CN-AISGF2.</p>
<p>In order for the US to exert influence on Global AI policies, the US AI regulatory regime should re-center the focus on the identified key AI risks (energy; addictive, herd and/or polarized behaviors / destroy humans&rsquo; abilities to think independently; censorship; hyper optimization; insurgent / unhealthy competition) to mitigate the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-risks-downfall-humanity-kelvin-to-yhzge/">downfall of humanity</a>. Policy Makers should consider the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics">Asimov&rsquo;s Three Laws</a> and <a href="https://www.streetdirectory.com/travel_guide/120083/technology/the_fourth_law_of_robotics.html">Zeroth (Forth) Law</a> for AI. The ISO 23894 Risk, ISO 42001 management system, and ISO 38507 governance frameworks should be redirected accordingly. Meanwhile, the Department of Justice&rsquo;s Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (<a href="https://www.justice.gov/jm/jm-9-48000-computer-fraud">CFAA</a>) has a narrower statute if <a href="https://digitalcommons.harrisburgu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1006&amp;context=other-works">compared to other jurisdictions</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; CFAA is meant to target external hackers&rsquo; unauthorized access and damage; it does <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> impute liability to internal workers who disregard a use policy. Bypassing code would constitute a cybercrime ONLY if the code is a <i>&ldquo;</i><a href="https://columbialawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Orin-S.-Kerr.pdf"><i>real barrier</i></a><i>&rdquo;</i> as opposed to a <i>&ldquo;speed bump&rdquo;</i>. <i>&ldquo;</i><a href="https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/function-creep"><i>Function creep</i></a><i>&rdquo;</i> is concern we identified with the FINRA Consolidated Audit Trail (<a href="https://www.databoiler.com/index_htm_files/DataBoiler%20SEC%20CAT%2020210503.pdf">CAT</a>) system. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden">Adverse</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015%E2%80%932016_SWIFT_banking_hack">scenarios</a> with government and bank systems have happened with serve consequences.</p>
<p>The original inventor may never come up with an exhaustive list of usage purposes or anticipate the possible repurpose of his/her technology. It is unjust to require AI firms to <i>&ldquo;establish comprehensive and explicit enumeration of AI systems&rsquo; context of business use and expectations.&rdquo; </i>&nbsp;Do not expect examiners to truly understand every bit of &ldquo;contextual factors may interact with AI lifecycle actions&rdquo;, for they are rule and law enforcers not technologists.&nbsp; Free enterprise should NOT be obligated to reveal the secret ingredient of their technologies, unless it is being identified with evidence for suspicious crime.</p>
<p>We agree with the NIST AI Risk Management Framework <a href="https://www.acc.com/sites/default/files/2024-08/2023.01.26-AI_RMF_Playbook.pdf">(NIST-AIRMF) Playbook</a> (page 63 - Map 1.4) where it said, <i>&ldquo;Socio-technical AI risks emerge from the interplay between technical development decisions and how a system is used, who operates it, and the social context into which it is deployed.&rdquo;</i> Yet, these are applicable to all technologies, not just AI. There are already a long list of US data / information security standards and technical safeguarding requirements, such as PCI DSS, GLBA, SOX DS 5.7, 5.8, 5.11, 11.6, HIPPA ePHI &sect;164.306, &sect;164.312, etc. Rights to revoke a user agreement with a standard provision, such as <i>&ldquo;no illicit or manipulative use of technology&rdquo;</i> may suffice.</p>
<p>The collective thoughts above lead us to recommend a revised definition of AI under 15 U.S.C. &sect; 9401(3) to preempt state AI laws, we suggest using the following or the like:</p>
<div>
<p><i>&ldquo;Covered AI technologies refer to cognitive systems (beyond learning from pairing a neutral stimulus that becomes a conditioned stimulus), comprise of memory AND topology of known lessons, that learn from regularities and irregularities of pattern(s) / knowns and unknowns / models/ simulations, AND </i></p>
<p><i>the system&rsquo;s internal process EITHER comprises of multi-steps reasoning (understand in a way that mimics humans; NOT merely extracting signals to generate alerts; NOT unconscious thinking) OR capable of generating datum uniquely different from a plagiarized copy, that </i></p>
<p><i>manipulates or presents at least an abstracted </i><i>phenomenon</i><i> (person or avatar, thing or computer-generated element, or real or virtual event that is hypothetical or observed to exist or happen in a distanced past, real-time, or irrespective of space-time) in a metaverse, real, or virtual environment </i></p>
<p><i>autonomously OR follow commands/ instructions, to generate expectations, make-believe, or assert that certain selected or perceived phenomenon is or will occur / available for use (regardless of the system internalizes, consumes, or makes feed(s) / datum available to its users in a domain, a dark web, or any iteration of the internet or intranet), AND </i></p>
<p><i>through action (including provision of customized or generic recommendation that reinforces, strengthen or weaken an ideology) OR inaction to stimulate the thought processes of at least an individual human OR the operations of a machine.&rdquo;</i></p>

<title>Iceboxes And Soapboxes: Remarks At The Meeting Of The SEC Investor Advisory Committee, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, Washington D.C., Dec. 4, 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good morning and thank you, Brian [Schorr]. And good morning to all of today&rsquo;s panelists and members of the Committee. Thank you for your participation in this last Investor Advisory Committee meeting of the year.</p>
<p>Before discussing today&rsquo;s agenda, I want to thank Cristina Martin Firvida&nbsp;whose dedication and passion for her job and commitment to investors has greatly benefited this Committee, the Commission, and investors. Today is Cristina&rsquo;s last IAC meeting as the Commission&rsquo;s Investor Advocate. Cristina has served as the Commission&rsquo;s second Investor Advocate for the last three years. I have enjoyed working with her and particularly have appreciated her willingness to brainstorm on any issue of concern to investors, even the hard ones that nobody else wants to discuss.</p>
<p>We are a week past Thanksgiving, and I am wondering if I will ever reclaim my refrigerator. Leftovers still occupy every shelf and have spilled into my backup refrigerator, aka my balcony. I am paying for my overly ambitious menu planning. Maybe if I had concentrated on making fewer dishes of higher quality, my guests would have eaten more, and I would not be eating mashed potatoes, stuffing, and cranberry sauce for breakfast for the foreseeable future. This experience got me thinking about corporate governance and shareholder engagement, which happen to be on the menu for our first panel today.</p>
<p>When it comes to shareholder engagement with corporations, some people seem to believe that more is always better and that quality does not matter. In this view, every shareholder deserves&mdash;as often as she likes&mdash;to have her concerns&mdash;as many as she has&mdash;aired on the corporate ballot, discussed in corporate boardrooms, and reflected in corporate budgets. But, as my former colleague Elad Roisman noted, &ldquo;While we all have a right to get on our soapboxes, we have no right to force others to pay for them.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-meeting-sec-investor-advisory-committee-120425#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Where the SEC has a role to play in shaping corporate governance, those rules should recognize both the benefits and the costs of shareholder engagement. Rules should provide avenues for shareholders to be heard when they speak to the mutual interests of the company and its shareholders writ large. On the other hand, rules should dissuade shareholders that seek to de-prioritize financial return as the sine qua non of corporate purpose. Amplifying those voices could drive companies into the treacherous terrain of catering to shareholders&rsquo; idiosyncratic objectives, which may undermine rather than enhance corporate value.</p>
<p>A well-calibrated ruleset gives shareholders a voice in proportion to their alignment with the corporation. Therefore, I support broad shareholder engagement by enabling all shareholders to enter standing proxy voting instructions. Mechanisms that facilitate shareholder voting make sense and may save the company money that would otherwise have been spent on drumming up votes to meet quorum requirements. I also supported the Commission&rsquo;s recent acknowledgment that mandatory arbitration provisions do not run afoul of the federal securities laws. Shareholder litigation&mdash;even when it is baseless&mdash;costs companies a lot of money and time, so some companies and their shareholders may prefer resolving their disputes through arbitration. The SEC should not override their preferences. Finally, eligibility to submit a shareholder proposal under Rule 14a-8 should be limited to shareholders whose interests align with those of the corporation. Otherwise, shareholders, to extract special interest concessions from the company, will submit shareholder proposals, which divert company time, attention, and resources.</p>
<p>The second panel is linked to the first because, among other benefits, tokenization could facilitate informed shareholder engagement by making it easier for companies to communicate with shareholders and for shareholders to vote. More generally, the tokenization of equity securities has the potential to transform how securities are issued, traded, and settled and empower investors by giving them more direct control over their assets. Investors will benefit from near-instantaneous settlement, reduced counterparty risk, enhanced transparency through immutable ledgers, and lower transaction costs.</p>
<p>At the same time, tokenization raises a host of interesting legal and policy questions. For example, tokenization models vary widely. On the one hand, issuer-sponsored securities issued directly on blockchain networks maintain full integration with master security holder files; they preserve traditional ownership rights while enabling direct ownership. Conversely, third-party sponsored tokens, depending on how they are structured, may provide synthetic exposure to an equity&rsquo;s price movements though derivative instruments, such as through tokenized structured notes or security-based swaps, but offer no ownership or voting interest in the issuer.</p>
<p>Additional questions arise because technologically savvy investors will be able to buy, sell, and hold assets without a traditional intermediary (or without any intermediary at all). Determining how to fit this activity into our rulebook, which is built around intermediaries, is challenging. Some rules may not be necessary to advance the regulatory objective they ostensibly serve given distributed ledger technology&rsquo;s ability to reduce certain risks and enhance transparency.</p>
<p>We do not have the luxury of time in tackling these questions. Tokenization of U.S. equities is already happening: Anybody can spin up a liquidity pool or launch a trading protocol that enables investors to get exposure to our equities markets. Only the quick, careful, and creative development of a workable regulatory framework for the issuance and trading of tokenized securities will provide American investors with the protections they have come to expect when trading U.S. equities. Otherwise, American investors will buy tokenized securities overseas. Commission staff is working on a tailored innovation exemption that would permit this activity in the United States, with strong investor protection guardrails, including Commission oversight.</p>
<p>As we embark on this important discussion, I encourage our panelists to consider several key questions that will help shape our path forward. These questions do not have easy answers, but addressing them thoughtfully will be essential as we work to create a regulatory framework that both protects investors and allows innovation to flourish.</p>
<ol>
<li>Are we adequately considering the full range of emerging tokenization models, and are there additional benefits or drawbacks the Commission should consider that are unique to certain models?</li>
<li>What are the broader implications for fundamental market mechanics like settlement processes and short selling?</li>
<li>What parts of our existing rulebook simply do not work for this emerging market structure? For instance, should Regulation NMS apply to tokenized equities in its current form?</li>
<li>How do we ensure interoperability across different blockchain networks while maintaining the market integrity on which investors depend?</li>
<li>What might an appropriately tailored innovation exemption look like? What type of activity should it permit? What conditions would be both necessary and workable?</li>
<li>Looking longer term, how can we build a regulatory framework that is fit for a future where intermediaries have less sway and investors exercise more autonomy as they move through our markets?</li>
</ol>
<p>Another captivating technology is the subject of the final discussion of the day: artificial intelligence (&ldquo;AI&rdquo;). The Committee will discuss a draft recommendation about public company disclosures related to AI.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-meeting-sec-investor-advisory-committee-120425#_ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;In some ways, the Committee&rsquo;s discussion is timely. AI has been a theme of 2025: eye-popping valuations of AI companies, hopes for AI&rsquo;s ability to increase productivity, questions about how AI will affect companies&rsquo; hiring needs, and fears about AI&rsquo;s ability to turbocharge cybercriminals. But, in other ways, today&rsquo;s discussion is just the latest iteration of the evergreen tug-of-war between principles-based rules and prescriptive rules responding to the hottest issue du jour. Principles-based disclosure rules allow companies to tell investors how&nbsp;<em>they</em>&nbsp;are approaching challenges and opportunities, while companies following prescriptive disclosure mandates merely fill in the blanks of the SEC&rsquo;s script.</p>
<p>I look forward to your discussion and have several questions for your consideration before you finalize the draft recommendation:</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>The draft recommendation laments that current disclosures related to AI are &ldquo;uneven and inconsistent&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-meeting-sec-investor-advisory-committee-120425#_ftn3">[3]</a>&nbsp;and that practices &ldquo;var[y] significantly among industries.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-meeting-sec-investor-advisory-committee-120425#_ftn4">[4]</a>&nbsp;But are such differences problematic? A small, recently-public company with only a handful of employees, for example, certainly has a different relationship with AI than mature, global companies with thousands of employees. If company and industry adoption of AI is not entirely homogenous why should our disclosure regime force conformity? Would any attempt to do so open the Commission up to critiques similar to those leveled against the SEC for its predictive data analytics proposal, which critics feared would chill advisers&rsquo; and broker-dealers&rsquo; use of AI and other technologies?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-meeting-sec-investor-advisory-committee-120425#_ftn5">[5]</a></li>
<li>Is this an area where prescriptive disclosure requirements would shape corporate behavior, which is not a proper role for merit-neutral SEC disclosure rules? For example, a requirement to disclose board oversight, if any, of AI implementation and utilization could nudge companies to set up a superfluous AI oversight function.</li>
<li>Why did the Committee include a materiality qualifier in only the third prong of the draft recommendation? Such a qualifier is entirely sensible here as it is with our existing disclosure rules. In fact, I would contend that absent a Congressional directive to the contrary, the SEC does not have the authority to mandate immaterial disclosure.</li>
<li>The Committee notes that participants from a prior panel held by the Committee agreed that the Commission should give guidance on the definition of AI so that &ldquo;issuers know whether they are using AI in the first place.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-meeting-sec-investor-advisory-committee-120425#_ftn6">[6]</a>&nbsp;Even if we draw on a definition drafted by another agency, why should the Commission attempt to define the limits of emerging technologies? Why not leave that task to the companies using the technologies?</li>

<p>Thank you all once more for your willingness to dedicate so much of your time to the Investor Advisory Committee. Thank you also to Cristina Martin-Firvida, Marc Sharma, and Adam Moore for their work with the Committee.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) announced the launch of InnovateSafe, a regulatory sandbox designed to allow CIRO-regulated firms to safely test innovative products and technologies in a controlled environment with CIRO oversight.</p>
<p>As the financial industry continues to evolve rapidly, keeping pace with the change is crucial for CIRO to retain the trust of investors and the organizations and people it regulates. InnovateSafe reinforces CIRO&rsquo;s commitment to delivering efficient, effective regulation that responds to the evolving needs of investors, dealers, and markets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;InnovateSafe reflects CIRO&rsquo;s vision to be an agile and trusted regulator &ndash; helping the industry deliver the right financial outcomes for investors,&rdquo; said Alexandra Williams, Senior-Vice President, Strategy, Innovation and Stakeholder Protection. &ldquo;This initiative will ensure we are enabling innovation while keeping our mandate of investor protection and supporting fair and efficient markets at the forefront.&rdquo;</p>
<p>InnovateSafe will support CIRO-regulated firms in building compliant solutions that are ready for full market deployment by granting temporary approvals and, where warranted, targeted exemptive relief. The testing environment could help accelerate the adoption of transformative or novel products, services, ideas or technologies that could help position Canada as a global leader in financial innovation. InnovateSafe would also enable CIRO to gather essential evidence and insights needed to provide regulatory clarity in areas that have not been previously addressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By providing a controlled environment to responsibly test new products and technologies, we will also be able to collect real data needed to shape clearer and more complete regulatory positions on matters we haven&rsquo;t dealt with before,&rdquo; said Williams. &ldquo;This initiative will advance our ability to become a more data-driven regulator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>InnovateSafe will operate under CIRO oversight, with safeguards in place to protect investors. Approved projects will have mandatory reporting requirements throughout the testing period, which include reporting deviations from the test plan and unexpected outcomes.</p>
<p>Key metrics and performance data reported by participants will also enable CIRO to generate regulatory insights that will help it better understand risks and their implications, as well as shape future policy development and supervisory approaches.</p>
<p>More information on InnovateSafe, including how to apply and details on approved projects, will be available in the coming weeks on CIRO&rsquo;s website.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. It is a pleasure to join you for the fourth and final Investor Advisory Committee meeting of 2025. Before I share a few reflections, I must note that the views I express here today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the SEC as an institution or of the other Commissioners. Of course, I also want to thank each of you for the time, expertise, and spirited commitment that you brought to the Committee this year. Your work is essential&mdash;our markets prosper when investors have confidence that our rules are fair, our processes are predictable, and our regulators are not smothering innovation out of fear. I convey and share in the agency&rsquo;s appreciation for your dedicated service, and extend special thanks to Cristina Firvida, who will conclude her tenure as Investor Advocate at the end of January. Our work at the SEC should always be responsive to the needs and interests of investors, and Cristina has provided essential support in service of these objectives. Cristina, we wish you every success in your future endeavors and we thank you for the contributions that you have made to our agency and to investors as a whole.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am also grateful for the valuable insights that we heard during this morning&rsquo;s panel discussion regarding regulatory changes in corporate governance. One of my top priorities as Chairman is to make being a public company an attractive proposition for more firms&mdash; and I look forward to engaging in this important work over the coming months as we guide the SEC back to the bedrock fundamentals on which our mandate is based.</p>
<p>The next panel, meanwhile, will focus on how the Commission can modernize our rules to enable our markets to move on-chain. Distributed ledger technology and the tokenization of financial assets, including securities, have the potential to transform our capital markets. Our financial markets have long been the envy of the world, and to ensure that they remain so, U.S. firms and investors must have the opportunity to leverage this technology as they lead the future of global capital markets.</p>
<p>Today, our rules assume that securities are issued, traded, and managed through layers of intermediaries, which help to address risks like information asymmetry and operational friction. But as we consider the rise of public blockchains and tokenization, we must acknowledge that these technologies have the capacity to streamline not only trading but the entire issuer-investor relationship.</p>
<p>In other words, tokenization is not just about transforming how trades occur. It can also enable direct connectivity for proxy voting, dividend payments, and shareholder communications, reducing the need for multiple intermediaries in those processes as well. As we modernize our rules, we must consider the full scope of these changes, both in how markets trade and in how security ownership is recorded and serviced. I welcome the IAC&rsquo;s assistance in helping us think through how to respond appropriately to these innovations.</p>
<p>As with any technological shift, market participants are experimenting with different tokenization models, and I am interested to hear the panel&rsquo;s thoughts about the implications of these approaches. Several models may warrant discussion. First, some companies are issuing equity directly on public distributed ledgers in the form of programmable assets that, in some cases, have the ability to embed compliance, voting rights, and other governance functions. This path allows investors to hold a security in digital format, with fewer intermediaries and more transparency.</p>
<p>Second, third parties are tokenizing equities by creating on-chain security entitlements, which represent ownership interests in equities that exist off-chain.</p>
<p>Third, we are seeing synthetic exposures&mdash;tokenized products that seek to mirror public equity performance. While today the offer and sale of these products are proliferating offshore, they illustrate the global demand for U.S. market exposure built on distributed ledger-powered infrastructure.</p>
<p>Of course, the shift to on-chain capital markets requires more than just issuance. We must also tackle other stages in the securities transaction lifecycle. For example, tokenized shares risk becoming nothing more than conversation pieces if their owners cannot trade them competitively in liquid on-chain environments. But making this possible requires the Commission to think carefully about how our regulatory mandate intersects with technological realities. Furthermore, issuers should be at the center of the discussion to help ensure that these new systems work effectively and align with the overarching goals of transparency and investor protection.</p>
<p>The previous Commission attempted to address on-chain markets through a brute-force redefinition of &ldquo;exchange&rdquo; to include even basic &ldquo;communication protocols,&rdquo; and then subjecting whatever was captured by that new definition to the full panoply of our regulatory framework for exchanges. That approach lacked limiting principles, expanded the SEC&rsquo;s reach beyond what Congress intended, and ultimately created uncertainty that chilled innovation.</p>
<p>We must not repeat that mistake. If we want to boost innovation, investment, and jobs here in the United States, we must provide compliant pathways that allow market participants to leverage the unique capabilities of this new technology. That is why I have asked staff to recommend to the Commission ways in which we can use our exemptive authorities to allow for on-chain innovation while we continue to work on long-term, durable rules of the road.</p>
<p>Congress has given the SEC broad exemptive authorities under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, and we must use these authorities responsibly. A thoughtful exemptive framework&mdash;cabined, time limited, transparent, and anchored in strong investor protections&mdash;could allow the markets to develop on-chain models and give investors innovative new choices. And, drawing on input from market participants, we will be able to craft rules that distinguish between truly decentralized finance and the wide spectrum of centralized, on-chain finance in existence today.</p>
<p>A durable rulebook must recognize this spectrum without forcing square pegs into round holes. If we attempt to regulate decentralized protocols as if they were centralized brokers, we will undermine the very innovation that makes them resilient and transparent. But if we allow centralized intermediaries to benefit from regulatory arbitrage just because they operate on-chain, we erode the principles of accountability and investor protection that have contributed to our global market dominance. Our task, as well as our responsibility, is to write rules that match functional reality. I look forward to working with my counterparts across the Administration in the coming years to do just that.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s role is not to resist the market&rsquo;s transition to on-chain capital markets, nor to force it into legacy definitions, nor to push innovators offshore. Rather, it is to allow market participants to operate and innovate subject to clear guardrails that protect the public, ensuring that U.S. markets remain the most dynamic, transparent, and trusted in the world. If we stay true to this course, we can ensure that the United States leads&mdash;not follows&mdash;in the next chapter of capital markets innovation.</p>
<p>Finally, just as tokenization represents one evolution in our markets, so does the subject of the recommendation that the Committee will be considering today. The advent of artificial intelligence promises to transform workflows and business models. Yet with every emerging development, the question for the SEC to consider is not necessarily its novelty, but whether our existing disclosure framework sufficiently provides investors with material information about it. And on that point, I believe that investors can rely on our current principles-based rules to inform them of how AI impacts companies.</p>
<p>Indeed, we should resist the temptation to adopt prescriptive disclosure requirements for every &ldquo;new thing&rdquo; that affects a business. Our principles-based rules were intentionally designed to allow companies to inform investors of material impacts of any new development, including how AI affects their financial results, how AI can be a material risk factor to an investment, and how AI is a material aspect of their business model. These rules have stood the test of time because they rely on the fundamental principle of materiality rather than on ever-expanding checklists.</p>
<p>As we consider these topics together, I am grateful once again for the rigor and thoughtfulness that you bring to every Investor Advisory Committee meeting. Your collective expertise makes this Committee an indispensable partner in safeguarding investors and strengthening our markets. So, thank you all for your time and engagement today. I look forward to the discussions ahead.</p>

<p>The FINRA Investor Education Foundation (FINRA Foundation) released today new research<a>,&nbsp;</a><a href="https://www.finrafoundation.org/sites/finrafoundation/files/2025-11/NFCS_Investor_Survey_Report_White_Paper.pdf?utm_source=shared&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=nfcsinvestor24" target="_blank">Investors in the United States: Results from the FINRA Foundation&rsquo;s National Financial Capability Study</a>, which offers insights into the attitudes, behaviors, knowledge and experiences of retail investors in the U.S.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The latest FINRA Foundation research on investors provides rich insights into how market conditions, technology and generational shifts are changing the profile of investing and reshaping investor behaviors and attitudes,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/about/governance/executives#econ">Jonathan Sokobin, FINRA Foundation Chair and Chief Economist at FINRA</a>. &ldquo;This research can serve as a roadmap and essential resource for policymakers, researchers, educators, firms and financial professionals as they continue their efforts to help educate and protect investors.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.finra.org/about/executives/gerri-walsh">FINRA Foundation President Gerri Walsh</a>&nbsp;noted that the findings point to the needs of younger, less experienced investors. &ldquo;They still struggle with gaps in investing knowledge and risk assessment, which can leave them vulnerable to costly missteps,&rdquo; Walsh said. &ldquo;Investor education efforts remain critically important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The findings are drawn from the investor survey component of the FINRA Foundation&rsquo;s latest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/media-center/newsreleases/2025/finra-foundation-releases-sixth-wave-national-financial-capability">National Financial Capability Study</a>&nbsp;(NFCS), including a total of 2,861 respondents in the U.S. with non-retirement investment accounts. The report builds on previous NFCS Investor Survey reports (conducted in 2021, 2018 and 2015), and includes new or expanded topics, such as attitudes towards risk, reliance on finfluencers and awareness of investment fraud.</p>
<p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New investors.</strong>&nbsp;The pace at which new investors are entering the market has declined significantly. In the 2024 NFCS, 8% of investors reported beginning to invest within the last two years&mdash;a sharp drop from the 21% who began investing in the two years preceding the 2021 NFCS.</li>
<li><strong>Investor characteristics.</strong>&nbsp;While the overall proportion of U.S. adults with investments held outside of retirement accounts did not materially change from 2021, fewer young adults (21% vs. 26% in 2021), men (40% vs. 43% in 2021), and persons of color (29% vs. 36% in 2021) reported owning non-retirement investments in 2024, largely erasing the gains made in the prior wave.</li>
<li><strong>Risk attitudes.</strong>&nbsp;The proportion of those willing to take substantial risks in their investment portfolios declined to just 8% in 2024 from 12% in 2021. Among investors under 35, those willing to take substantial risk dropped to 15% from 24%. Despite this, over one-third of investors (34%) feel they need to take big risks to reach their financial goals, including 62% of investors under 35.</li>
<li><strong>Risk-taking.</strong>&nbsp;Compared to older investors, those under 35 are more likely to engage in investment behaviors that can carry greater risk, including trading options (43% vs. 10% of those 55 and older) and making purchases on margin (22% vs. 4% of those 55 and older).</li>
<li><strong>Social media.</strong>&nbsp;Twenty-nine percent of investors report relying on social media as an information source. When asked separately about the social channels they use for investing information, YouTube emerged as the most popular, used by 30% of respondents overall and 61% of those under 35.</li>
<li><strong>Finfluencers.</strong>&nbsp;Over a quarter of investors (26%) use recommendations from social media influencers when making investment decisions, including 61% of those under 35 and 57% of those with less than two years of investing experience.</li>
<li><strong>Meme stock popularity.</strong>&nbsp;Thirteen percent of investors report buying meme stocks or other viral investments, including nearly one-third (29%) of investors under 35.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto interest</strong>.&nbsp;While the percentage investing in cryptocurrency in 2024 did not change from 2021 (27%), fewer investors reported considering cryptocurrency investments (either purchasing more or for the first time), dropping to 26% in 2024 from 33% in 2021.</li>
<li><strong>Investment information sources.</strong>&nbsp;The most commonly used sources of investment information are research and tools provided by brokerage firms (75%), recommendations from financial professionals (69%), business and finance articles (67%), and word of mouth from friends/family/colleagues (65%).</li>
<li><strong>Investment fraud.</strong>&nbsp;Concern over investment fraud has increased somewhat. Thirty-seven percent of investors are worried about losing money due to investment fraud, up from 31% in 2021. Still, the vast majority (89%) do not believe they have been targeted in an investment scam.</li>
<li><strong>Low investing knowledge.</strong>&nbsp;On average, respondents answered slightly less than half of the investing quiz questions correctly (5.3 out of 11 questions). Questions about margin and short selling had the most incorrect answers, with over half of respondents answering each incorrectly (55% and 54%, respectively). Notably, 75% of those who actually make purchases on margin incorrectly answered the margin question.</li>
</ul>

<title>Acting CFTC Chairman Pham Announces First-Ever Listed Spot Crypto Trading On U.S. Regulated Exchanges - Federally Regulated Spot Crypto Markets Open A New Golden Age For Innovation In America</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Commodity Futures Trading Commission Acting Chairman Caroline D. Pham today announced that listed spot cryptocurrency products will begin trading for the first time in U.S. federally regulated markets on CFTC registered futures exchanges. The announcement marks a significant step forward in the Trump Administration&rsquo;s pledge to usher in a Golden Age of Innovation and make America the &ldquo;crypto capital of the world.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;The CFTC has a rich history of welcoming responsible innovation on futures exchanges by balancing regulatory flexibility with core principles that safeguard both institutional and retail traders. Thanks to President Trump&rsquo;s leadership, this Administration has developed a comprehensive all-of-government plan for America to reclaim its place as the world leader in digital asset markets, and the CFTC has a central role to play,&rdquo; Acting Chairman Pham said. &ldquo;Recent events on offshore exchanges have shown us how essential it is for Americans to have more choice and access to safe, regulated U.S. markets. Now, for the first time ever, spot crypto can trade on CFTC-registered exchanges that have been the gold standard for nearly a hundred years, with the customer protections and market integrity that Americans deserve.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Fifteen years ago, Congress passed important reforms to strengthen U.S. markets after the great financial crisis, including the requirement that leveraged retail commodity trading can only occur on futures exchanges. But the CFTC never implemented this critical customer protection reform by providing regulatory clarity on how to list these retail exchange traded products despite years of market demand. Instead, the CFTC chose regulation by enforcement rather than making clear rules of the road, resulting in huge fines that targeted the crypto industry but did not protect the retail public by giving them a safe place to trade.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Under my leadership this year, the CFTC is finally using our decades-long existing authority to work smarter and faster to protect Americans who deserve safe U.S. markets now, not offshore exchanges that lack basic safeguards against uncontrolled customer losses.

<title>ESMA Welcomes Commission’s Ambitious Proposal On Market Integration</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, welcomes the&nbsp;<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_2893">European Commission&rsquo;s legislative proposal on market integration and supervision</a>&nbsp;published today. The package represents a major step towards deeper and more efficient EU capital markets and reflects many of the recommendations set out in ESMA&rsquo;s 2024 Position Paper on building more effective and attractive capital markets in the EU.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The proposal directly addresses fragmentation stemming from divergent national rules and supervisory practices. By removing barriers in trading, post-trading and asset management, and by enabling more harmonised supervision, the package will help market participants operate more seamlessly across the Single Market and support scale, efficiency and better outcomes for investors and businesses. We also welcome the strong focus on streamlining regulatory requirements, reducing administrative burden, and facilitating innovation.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>All of this will enhance the competitiveness and agility of EU capital markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A key element of the package is the proposed transfer of direct supervision of certain significant cross-border infrastructures and crypto-asset service providers to the EU level. ESMA stands ready to take on these specific responsibilities, drawing on almost 15 years of growing experience supervising diverse and selective parts of our capital markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This proposal represents a shift in supervision for a limited subset of our capital markets, in which ESMA would work hand in hand with the National Competent Authorities (NCAs) to develop the capacity and expertise to take on such new responsibilities. At the same time, for the broader market that remains under national supervision, coordinating supervisory standards and achieving aligned outcomes across the EU remains a key priority. This would be reinforced for example by giving ESMA an enhanced convergence role for large cross-border asset management groups.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s proposal forms a central pillar of the Commission&rsquo;s Savings and Investments Union (SIU) strategy. ESMA looks forward to working with the co-legislators as they advance this important initiative to build deeper and more integrated EU capital markets.</p>

<ul class="rte--list">
<li>Eurex trading volume&nbsp;fell&nbsp;18&nbsp;percent in&nbsp;November&nbsp;indicating&nbsp;more subdued&nbsp;market&nbsp;activity.</li>
<li>OTC Clearing&nbsp;posted substantial&nbsp;growth&nbsp;as&nbsp;notional outstanding volumes&nbsp;grew by&nbsp;33&nbsp;percent.</li>
<li>Eurex Repo&nbsp;delivered&nbsp;strong&nbsp;November&nbsp;results,&nbsp;fueled&nbsp;by a&nbsp;49&nbsp;percent&nbsp;surge&nbsp;in GC Pooling transactions.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Eurex&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Europe&rsquo;s leading derivatives exchange and, together with Eurex Clearing, one of the world&rsquo;s&nbsp;leading&nbsp;central counterparties&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;reported lower trading volumes in November amid a general slowdown in market activity. The exchange handled 146.1 million contracts during the&nbsp;month,&nbsp;an 18 percent drop from the 177.6 million contracts&nbsp;traded&nbsp;a year earlier. Interest rate derivatives were down 16 percent year-on-year to 70.5 million contracts. Equity derivatives declined 11 percent to 28.3 million contracts, while index derivatives decreased 21 percent to 47.0 million contracts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>OTC Clearing&nbsp;recorded robust growth in&nbsp;November,&nbsp;with notional outstanding volumes rising 33 percent year-on-year to EUR 46,573 billion, up from EUR 34,922 billion in November 2024. The increase was led by overnight index swaps, which surged 57 percent to EUR 6,611 billion. Interest rate swaps also contributed significantly, climbing 29 percent to EUR 20,197 billion.</p>
<p>Eurex Repo, Eurex&rsquo;s leading electronic market for secured funding and financing,&nbsp;delivered another strong result in November 2025. Average term-adjusted volumes increased by 51 percent&nbsp;year-on-year, reaching EUR 525.4&nbsp;billion. Growth was driven primarily by the GC Pooling segment, which rose 49 percent, while the Repo Market segment also saw a solid expansion of 54 percent. The month&rsquo;s standout achievement was a new record in daily trading volume on 28 November 2025, coming in&nbsp;roughly 66 percent above the average daily level.</p>

<div class="VerticalSpacing VerticalSpacing--l">
<div class="RichText   ">
<p>FTSE Russell, the global index provider, today published the findings from its eighth annual asset owner&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lseg.com/en/ftse-russell/sustainable-investing-solutions/global-asset-owner-survey">survey</a>, analysing how sustainable investment (SI) is perceived, considered and used by asset owners across the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sustainability considerations remain firmly embedded in investment strategies, with 73% of asset owners implementing sustainable investment approaches to their portfolios, a figure that has remained largely unchanged since 2023. However, asset owners are increasingly concerned with the investment impact posed by climate risk, with 85% of respondents ranking this as a major concern, up from 76% last year. While climate remains the primary focus, other sustainability factors such as diversity and inclusion and human rights are also ranked highly.</p>
<p><span>Stephanie Maier, Global Head of Sustainable, FTSE Russell, said:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Global asset owners&rsquo; commitment to integrating sustainability considerations remains steady. Against a backdrop of geopolitical headwinds, investor concerns regarding climate and broader sustainability risks continue to intensify and the focus on financial performance remains a central priority. This shift signals that sustainable investment is becoming a core component of fiduciary responsibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The survey, which gathered insights from 415 asset owners across 24 countries, also shows that financial performance (56%) and risk management (54%) have become the leading motivations for sustainable investment. More than half of respondents believe these strategies help mitigate long-term risk and deliver better risk-adjusted returns, while fiduciary duty (42% in 2025 compared to 14% in 2024) is increasingly cited as a driver. In contrast, societal good is now a secondary consideration for many asset owners (37%).</p>
<p>Implementation approaches remain diverse. Thematic investing (60%) and ESG integration (61%) continue to be the most popular strategies, while engagement is gaining traction as investors seek to support transition towards low-carbon business models rather than divest from carbon-intensive assets.</p>
<p>While one in four (23%) asset owners are still evaluating whether to implement sustainable investment strategies, barriers such as greenwashing concerns and the availability and accuracy of ESG data were listed as issues to adoption. In addition, 60% of respondents cited different disclosure requirements and taxonomies as challenges to meeting regulatory requirements, and 61% cited an inability to align portfolios or indices with the sustainable investment or climate requirements set out by regulators.<br /><br />Download the full report here:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lseg.com/en/ftse-russell/sustainable-investing-solutions/global-asset-owner-survey">FTSE Russell - Sustainable Investment Asset Owner Survey 2025</a></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Digital Asset, the creator of the Canton Network and a leader in privacy-enabled blockchain technology for global financial markets, today announced a new strategic investment from&nbsp;<b>BNY</b>,&nbsp;<b>iCapital</b>,&nbsp;<b>Nasdaq</b>, and&nbsp;<b>S&amp;P Global</b>. Their participation reflects the accelerating convergence of traditional finance (TradFi) and&nbsp;<span>decentralized</span>&nbsp;finance (<span>DeFi</span>) towards an "AllFi" future on the Canton Network.</p>
<p>These investments build on Digital Asset's strong momentum following recent funding milestones and underscore the growing institutional alignment behind the Canton Network&ndash; the only public, permissionless Layer-1 blockchain designed with configurable privacy, institutional-grade compliance, and the ability to support hundreds of billions of dollars in onchain real-world assets.</p>
<p>The new strategic partners represent leading global institutions in asset servicing, wealth management, market infrastructure, financial data, financial technology, and&nbsp;<span>digital asset</span>&nbsp;trading. Their investment reinforces the critical role Canton is playing in the next phase of financial market infrastructure, bringing together decentralization with the privacy, legal certainty, and regulatory compliance required by global markets.</p>
<p>Today, the Canton Network underpins a diverse and rapidly expanding set of use cases, including bonds, equities, money market funds, alternative investment funds, commodities, repos, mortgages, life insurance, and annuities. With more than $6 trillion of assets onchain, over 600 institutions now participate across the Canton ecosystem, including global leaders in both traditional and&nbsp;<span>decentralized</span>&nbsp;finance.</p>
<p><b>Yuval Rooz, CEO of Digital Asset:</b><br class="dnr" />"Institutions across the financial ecosystem recognize the necessity of blockchain infrastructure purpose-built for regulated markets. The addition of BNY, iCapital, S&amp;P Global, and Nasdaq marks another milestone in the evolution of both Digital Asset and Canton. Their participation reinforces the inevitability of interoperable, privacy-enabled markets operating at global scale. We look forward to deepening our collaboration as we continue to transform how onchain real-world assets move, settle, and interconnect."</p>
<p><b>Brian Ruane, Head of Global Clearing, Credit Services &amp; Corporate Trust, BNY:<br class="dnr" /></b>"As capital markets move faster towards a real-time, always-on operating model, the development of financial infrastructure that seamlessly connects digital and traditional markets has never been more important. We're excited to work with Digital Asset and Canton to continue advancing privacy-enabled and interoperable settlement solutions at institutional scale. This investment reflects our commitment to reimagining a faster and more efficient future for financial market infrastructure."</p>
<p><b>Lawrence Calcano, Chairman and CEO, iCapital:</b><br class="dnr" />"By investing in Digital Assets, the leader in blockchain innovation, iCapital is reinforcing its commitment to building next-generation financial infrastructure. By combining our expertise in private markets and proven technology with Canton's blockchain platform, we are establishing the foundation for&nbsp;<span>tokenization</span>&nbsp;of alternatives&mdash;driving efficiency, transparency, and broader access across the investment ecosystem."</p>
<p><b>Tal Cohen, President of Nasdaq:<a class="ticket-symbol" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/digital-asset-announces-strategic-investments-from-bny-icapital-nasdaq-and-sp-global-302632617.html#financial-modal"></a></b><br class="dnr" />"We're excited to deepen our relationship with Digital Asset and the Canton Network as we continue building the next generation of institutional market infrastructure. This investment builds on the work we've already done together to modernize post-trade and collateral workflows, and positions us to accelerate adoption of interoperable, tokenized solutions across the global capital markets. By combining Nasdaq's markets and infrastructure expertise with Digital Asset's technology, we can help our clients unlock new efficiencies, better manage risk, and confidently participate in the evolving digital asset ecosystem."</p>
<p><b>Swati Sawjiany, Global Head of Enterprise Strategy, M&amp;A and Investments, S&amp;P Global:<br class="dnr" /></b>"The accelerated convergence of off-chain and on-chain financial markets underscores the importance of trusted market data, industry-leading benchmarks, and risk assessments as critical enablers in the transformation of market infrastructure. Digital Asset Holdings has played a central role in building a public blockchain capable of supporting the privacy and compliance demands of financial institutions. We are excited to join this round and see opportunity to collaborate with Canton and network participants to enhance transparency, integrity, and insight to digital markets."</p>

<p>DTCC, the premier market infrastructure for the global financial services industry, and Ernst &amp; Young LLP (EY US) today announced the publication of their research findings on 24x5 trading, titled &ldquo;<a href="https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/Transformation/theshiftto24x5trading.pdf" target="_blank">The Shift to 24x5 Trading: What It Means for U.S. Equity Markets.</a>&rdquo; The report details the industry&rsquo;s transition toward near-continuous trading, operational and risk implications, and strategic considerations for market participants in preparation for the change.</p>
<p>Key findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Impact to volumes:</span>&nbsp;Most surveyed firms expect overnight trading volumes to gradually rise. By 2028, 1%&ndash;10% of total equity volume is projected to be traded during the overnight sessions, boosting global market access.</li>
<li><span>Retail and institutional participation:</span>&nbsp;Retail investors are expected to initially drive overnight trading, with institutional participation assumed to rise during market stress and as infrastructure develops. Over half of survey respondents foresee greater institutional activity in volatile periods.</li>
<li><span>Market harmonization and safeguards:</span>&nbsp;Extending trading hours requires aligning market safeguards, such as circuit breakers and surveillance, and updating SIP data feeds to a 24x5 model for real-time accuracy and market stability.</li>
<li><span>Risk, margin, and liquidity:</span>&nbsp;Extended hours add complexity to risk, margin, and liquidity management. Almost 60% of firms plan technology and risk upgrades.</li>
</ul>
<p>Global demand, especially from APAC investors, and regulatory permissibility are key drivers for the move to 24x5 equity trading. The convergence of securities and crypto brokerages is also influencing expectations for near continuous access. Firms are encouraged to assess their readiness, participate in industry forums, enhance risk management and operational capabilities, and critically evaluate their global footprint and vendor dependencies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As interest in near round-the-clock trading of U.S. equities grows, we are meeting this demand by extending our clearing hours to support our clients and further strengthen the safety and soundness of the markets,&rdquo; said Val Wotton, DTCC&rsquo;s Managing Director and Global Head of Equities Solutions. &ldquo;DTCC is committed to leading large-scale, industry-wide initiatives that deliver positive change for the industry and the investing public. We look forward to continuing to work collaboratively across the industry towards a successful implementation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Extending trading hours represents a significant step for U.S. equity markets, aligning market structure with the expectations of an increasingly global, always-on investor base,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ey.com/en_us/people/mark-nichols">Mark Nichols, Principal and Capital Markets Strategy &amp; Market Structure Leader, EY US</a>. &ldquo;Through this collaboration with DTCC, we aim to equip market participants with clear, actionable insights on navigating the complex firmwide implications and operating model considerations of a 24x5 trading environment &mdash; helping the industry collectively build a more accessible and resilient marketplace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In March 2025,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dtcc.com/news/2025/march/18/dtccs-nscc-to-increase-clearing-hours-to-support-extended-trading" target="_blank">DTCC announced NSCC&rsquo;s plans</a>&nbsp;to extend clearing hours to support 24x5 trading, from Sunday at 8:00 PM ET to Friday at 8:00 PM ET, targeted for implementation in Q2 2026.</p>
<p><span>The full white paper is available for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/Transformation/theshiftto24x5trading.pdf" target="_blank">download</a>&nbsp;at DTCC&rsquo;s website.</span></p>
<p><span>Research Methodology</span><br /><span>In support of this paper, DTCC surveyed 95 participants from 84 firms, including 72 NSCC members.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Tradeweb Markets Inc. (Nasdaq: TW), a leading, global operator of electronic marketplaces for rates, credit, equities and money markets, today reported total trading volume for the month of November 2025 of $56.8 trillion (tn). Average daily volume (ADV) for the month was $2.9tn, an increase of 22.3 percent (%) year-over-year (YoY).</p>
<h4><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Record Highlights:</span></strong></h4>
<p>For<strong>&nbsp;</strong>November of 2025, Tradeweb records included:</p>
<ul>
<li>ADV in European government bonds</li>
<li>ADV in rates futures</li>
<li>ADV in repurchase agreements (repo)</li>
<li>ADV in other money markets</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">November 2025 Highlights</span></strong></h4>
<h5><span><span>Rates</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h5>
<ul>
<li>U.S. government bond ADV was up 2.7% YoY at $252.7 billion (bn). European government bond ADV was up 33.1% YoY to $70.7bn.  
<ul>
<li>U.S. government bond ADV was led by strong growth in the institutional client channel, which achieved a record. Record European government bond ADV was driven by strong volumes across our institutional and wholesale client channels. Strong activity in the U.S. and Europe was supported by an increased number of clients trading across a diverse set of trading protocols.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mortgage ADV was up 2% YoY to $277.2bn.  
<ul>
<li>The increase in To-Be-Announced (TBA) activity was primarily driven by heightened trading from real-money accounts and increased participation from mortgage originators. Tradeweb&rsquo;s specified pool platform reported strong volumes driven by expanding client and dealer adoption, setting another monthly record for the total number of accounts on the platform.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Swaps/swaptions &ge; 1-year ADV was up 4% YoY to $495.7bn and total rates derivatives ADV was up 41.5% YoY to $1.1tn.  
<ul>
<li>Swaps/swaptions &ge; 1-year saw a strong increase in risk trading activity YoY driven by continued uncertainty around central bank policy and pending rate cuts, as well as a 10% YoY increase in compression activity, which carries a relatively lower fee per million (FPM). 4Q25 to-date compression activity as a percentage of swaps/swaptions &ge; 1-year is trending higher than 3Q25.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5><span><span>Credit</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h5>
<ul>
<li>Fully electronic U.S. credit ADV was up 9% YoY to $8.5bn and European credit ADV was up 16.5% YoY to $2.9bn.  
<ul>
<li>U.S. credit volumes were driven by increased client adoption of Tradeweb protocols, most notably in request-for-quote (RFQ), Portfolio Trading (PT), and Tradeweb AllTrade&reg;. Tradeweb captured 17.1% and 8.4% share of fully electronic U.S. high grade and U.S. high yield TRACE, respectively, as measured by Tradeweb. We also reported 24.5% total share of U.S. high grade TRACE and 10.2% total share of U.S. high yield TRACE. European credit volumes were driven by continued adoption of Tradeweb&rsquo;s Automated Intelligent Execution (AiEX) tool, which saw record activity in November. Cash credit PT ADV increased by 5% YoY, with non-comp PT ADV down 10% YoY. PT carries a relatively lower FPM as compared to the broader cash credit average, with non-comp PT carrying a lower FPM than PT overall.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Municipal bonds ADV was up 17.4% YoY to $480 million (mm).</li>
<li>Municipal bonds reported strong growth across the retail and institutional platforms, outpacing the broader market, which remained flat<sup>1</sup></li>
<li>Credit derivatives ADV was up 46.5% YoY to&nbsp;$19.8bn.  
<ul>
<li>Increased hedge fund and systematic account activity YoY, along with heightened credit volatility, led to increased swap execution facility (SEF) and multilateral trading facility (MTF) credit default swaps activity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5><span><span>Equities</span></span><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>U.S. ETF ADV was up 32.2% YoY to $11.3bn and International ETF ADV was down 0.2% YoY to $3.3bn.  
<ul>
<li>U.S. ETFs reported strong growth YoY on the institutional and wholesale platforms. On the institutional platform, adoption of our automated rules-based RFQ protocol continued to grow, accompanied by an expanding client base. On the wholesale side, our client base also expanded and we saw higher market volatility YoY.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong><span>Money Markets&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Repo ADV was up 17.9% YoY to $828.4bn.  
<ul>
<li>Record global repo trading activity was supported by increased client participation across the platform. In the U.S., strong growth was driven by the effects of the Fed&rsquo;s balance sheet unwind. Additionally, balances in the Fed&rsquo;s reverse repo facility (RRP) remained close to zero for a majority of the month. In Europe, strong activity continued despite ongoing central bank balance sheet reduction putting some mild upward pressure on European funding levels.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Money Markets ADV was up 0.7% YoY to $304.4bn.  
<ul>
<li>Record other money markets activity was driven by record ICD money market fund balances, aided by recent debt issuance from several large clients that replenished liquidity after periods of elevated capex, share buybacks, and dividend activity had reduced cash earlier in the year, alongside addition from new clients.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<div class="row-with-description ">
<div class="text-highlight">
<ul class="rte--list">
<li>Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group and Kraken (Payward Inc.) are joining forces combining regulated infrastructure with crypto-native expertise to deliver frictionless institutional access.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The partnership encompasses regulated crypto, tokenized markets and derivatives, as well as enhanced liquidity for institutional clients across geographies.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row-with-picture">
<div class="detailText">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Kraken, one of the world&rsquo;s longest-standing, most liquid and secure cryptocurrency platforms, and Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group, one of the world&rsquo;s leading financial market infrastructures, today announced a strategic partnership to create unified access across traditional and digital asset markets.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Effective immediately, the two firms will leverage their complementary capabilities to bridge traditional financial markets and the digital asset economy. Spanning trading, custody, settlement, collateral management, and tokenized assets, the partnership will unlock a new range of enhanced products and services that deliver frictionless access to both ecosystems, creating a holistic experience for institutional clients.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the first phase of the partnership, Kraken will integrate directly with 360T, a Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group subsidiary and one of the world&rsquo;s largest foreign-exchange trading venues. The integration will give Kraken clients access to competitive, bank-grade FX liquidity through one of the deepest global liquidity pools available, significantly improving fiat on- and off-ramp efficiency while ensuring institutional-grade execution and reliability.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The partnership will also leverage Kraken Embed to expand institutional crypto access across Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group&rsquo;s network. Together, the companies will develop advanced white-label solutions enabling banks, fintechs, and other financial institutions to offer secure, compliant crypto trading and custody services to clients across Europe and the U.S.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Subject to regulatory approvals, the two companies plan to make Eurex-listed derivatives available to trade on Kraken, broadening access to Europe&rsquo;s largest regulated futures and options marketplace. The collaboration will also allow Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group clients to trade cryptocurrencies and derivatives via Crypto Finance, as well as through Kraken&rsquo;s exchange, to service enhanced end-client models, while leveraging Clearstream and Crypto Finance, both Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group subsidiaries, for custody.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Kraken and Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group will also work together to integrate xStocks within 360X&rsquo;s ecosystem, significantly expanding the reach of one of the most widely adopted tokenized equity standards globally. In addition, Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group and Kraken will work to enable the distribution of securities held in custody at Clearstream in a tokenized form to Kraken&rsquo;s client base.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The partnership also establishes a framework for geographical access: Kraken will offer its U.S. capabilities to Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group&rsquo;s institutional clients seeking exposure to crypto and tokenized assets, while Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group will provide its European infrastructure and services to Kraken&rsquo;s global client base. This two-way integration underscores the shared vision to connect traditional and digital markets seamlessly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>&ldquo;Our partnership with Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group demonstrates what happens when two infrastructures designed for scale and trust intersect,&rdquo; said Arjun Sethi, Co-CEO of Kraken. &ldquo;By linking traditional and digital markets across a wide range of asset classes, we&rsquo;re building a holistic foundation for the next generation of financial innovation: defined by efficiency, openness, and client access.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Stephan Leithner, CEO of Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group emphasized: &ldquo;This collaboration with Kraken is a great strategic fit for Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group. It underscores our ongoing commitment to shaping the future of financial markets by combining the trust and resilience of our regulated infrastructure with the innovation of the digital asset ecosystem. Across our entire value chain this partnership will further enhance our support for institutional clients in the digital asset era and pave the way for digital capital markets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In addition, ICE has published the 2026 UKA auction calendar here:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ice.com/emissions/auctions/uk-emission-allowances" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">www.ice.com/emissions/auctions/uk-emission-allowances</a>.</p>
<p>ICE has hosted carbon auctions on behalf of the UK Government since 2012. ICE conducted Phase III EUA auctions on behalf of the UK Government from 2012 to 2021 and has conducted UKA auctions on behalf of the UK Government since the UK emissions trading scheme began in 2021.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Market-based mechanisms like carbon cap and trade programs are critical in allowing policy makers to control the quantity of carbon to align with their environmental commitments, price emissions and decarbonise in the most cost-effective way,&rdquo; said Gordon Bennett, Managing Director of Utility Markets at ICE. &ldquo;The UK ETS is a successful, market driven program and we are pleased to continue to host carbon auctions on behalf of the UK Government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>UKAs are one part of ICE&rsquo;s global environmental markets where ICE has been a leader for over two decades, offering the most liquid futures markets to trade emission allowances under the EU Emissions Trading System, California Cap and Trade Program, Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and the Washington Cap and Invest Program.</p>

<p><b>Client-Initiated Channel</b></p>

<p><b>November 2025 Variable Transaction Fees Per Million<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>(See table 1D)</b></p>

<title>Smart Centres Index 12: Zurich Leads The Pack In Smart Development With London And Singapore Strong Contenders</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Smart Centres Index explores the ability of global commercial centres to create, develop, and deploy technology. Leading centres in the SCI are based in places which combine an innovative, cultural centre with a high-performing university sector across STEM subjects, supported by a well-developed regulatory, commercial, and financial services.</p>
<h4>CI 12 Results</h4>
<ul>
<li>Zurich took first place in the index, with London and Singapore overtaking San Francisco to take second and third positions.</li>
<li>Five Western European centres feature in the top 10, alongside two US centres Busan and Tel Aviv also feature in the top 10.</li>
<li>Six centres rose 10 or more places in the ranking in SCI 12, while five centres fell 10 or more places. </li>
<li>The average rating in SCI 12 rose by 3.33%, building on a rise of 0.63% in SCI 11. </li>
<li>The biggest increase in average ratings of 4.01% was in Eastern Europe &amp; Central Asia, while the lowest increase in the average rating was for North America where ratings rose 2.46%. </li>
<li>Assessments in the SCI survey appear to favour centres with strong people skills. This assists leading centres such as Zurich, Singapore, San Francisco, and London. </li>
</ul>
<p>We asked respondents to the SCI survey to identify the areas of technology which are likely to have the most impact on industry over the next five years. Almost a quarter of respondents identified &lsquo;Artificial Intelligence, Digital And Computing&rsquo; as likely to have the greatest impact, with &lsquo;Energy And Environmental Technology&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Robotics&rsquo; mentioned by 17% and 14% of respondents respectively.</p>
<p><img alt="Smart_Centres_Index_One_04Dec25" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/Smart_Centres_Index_One_04D.jpg" title="Smart_Centres_Index_One_04Dec25" /></p>
<p>The top 20 ranked centres in SCI 12 are shown in the table below:</p>

<p>Professor Michael Mainelli, Chairman of Z/Yen said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;AI continues to be a technology exciting business interest and investment froth. However, centres with the skills, know how, and research depth in AI are not just the ones with the investment bubbles. Centres appear to be emerging that focus on &lsquo;boring&rsquo; AI work and research into statistical probity, IP rights, information chain-of-custody, regulation, standards, data provenance, and ethics. AI is a rapidly emerging field moving into deployment, so it&rsquo;s not surprising to see significant shifts in emphasis, shifts that may align with future investments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We invite all those with an interest in the development of innovation and technology centres to take part in SCI 13 by rating the financial and commercial centres you know on our continuously running survey &ndash; <a href="https://mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/rss/smartcentresindex.net/survey/" title="smartcentresindex.net/survey/">smartcentresindex.net/survey/</a>.</p>

<title>New WFE Research Analyses Global Price Inequalities In The Voluntary Carbon Market</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The World Federation of Exchanges (&ldquo;WFE&rdquo;), the global industry group for exchanges and CCPs, has published new research which provides the first transaction-level evidence of how prices form in the voluntary carbon market (VCM). It reveals significant disparities between advanced and developing economies and offers insights for improving transparency and fairness in carbon trading.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>The WFE Research Paper,&nbsp;</span><em>Carbon Inequality: Price Discovery and Market Dynamics in the Voluntary Carbon Market</em><span>, authored by Dr Ying Liu, Financial Economist at the WFE, analyses more than 250,000 carbon credit transactions across 2,200 projects worldwide between 2017 and 2024, using econometric and machine learning methods.</span><br /><br /><strong>Key Findings:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Credits from nature-based solutions such as forestry and land use projects are priced 67% higher than those from technology-based projects like renewable energy.</li>
<li>Older credits trade at 9&ndash;23% discounts, reflecting buyer preference for newer vintages, presumably perceived as more credible.</li>
<li>Projects with larger available inventories experience lower future returns, confirming that excess supply depresses prices.</li>
<li>Past returns and prior inventory levels are the strongest predictors of near-term price movements.</li>
<li>Credits from advanced economies are priced 28% higher on average than those from emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs), even after adjusting for project characteristics. The premium is closely linked to stronger rule of law and governance quality of the jurisdiction where the carbon project is located, not to investor home bias.</li>
<li>Retirements of credits peak in December, aligning with corporate sustainability reporting cycles and offset deadlines.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><span>The analysis shows that governance quality and institutional strength of the project&rsquo;s host jurisdiction play a central role in determining carbon credit value. This is why price discrepancies occur between carbon credits in advanced economies compared to EMDEs.</span><br /><br /><strong>Dr Pedro Gurrola Perez, Head of Research at the WFE</strong><span>, said, &ldquo;Climate finance is critical for sustainable development in Emerging Markets and Developing Economies. While this is where most carbon offset projects are located, these credits are priced lower than those located in advanced economies. Without closing this pricing gap, the VCM won&rsquo;t reach its true potential.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><strong>Nandini Sukumar, CEO of the WFE</strong><span>, said, &ldquo;To make the VCM a truly global climate finance mechanism, we must ensure pricing reflects project quality - not jurisdictional biases. This underscores the urgent need to enhance transparency and address institutional disparities in the VCM. Strengthening governance and pricing mechanisms in emerging economies could expand access to climate finance for high-quality projects in these regions.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>Read the full paper&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://world-exchanges.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=48ddcbc11eb58f141a51219ea&amp;id=8712c94213&amp;e=979576350c" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a><span>.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Offa, the UK&rsquo;s leading Islamic property finance fintech, has grown its headcount yet again with the appointment of a new Senior Underwriting Manager.</p>
<p>Trevor Melly brings 25 years&rsquo; experience in financial services, most recently at Signature Finance where he spent a decade as Credit and Risk Director. He previously managed a &pound;200 million funding line, held a credit mandate of &pound;2 million and completed more than 1,800 deals in the alternative finance space.</p>
<p>Speaking about his new role, Trevor said: &ldquo;I chose to join Offa because I&rsquo;m impressed by their ambition and growing presence in the specialist property finance market. Offa&rsquo;s commitment to ethical, customer-focused lending demonstrates a responsible approach to finance, I&rsquo;m excited to contribute to a business that is shaping a modern way in the industry. I hope to bring strong technical expertise across the full finance lifecycle as Offa continues to grow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trevor will be reporting to Naseer Ahmed, Managing Director of Bridging and Development Finance. He said: &ldquo;I am delighted to welcome Trevor to Offa at such a critical stage of our rapid growth. His depth of experience within the alternative finance space will undoubtedly add significant value and further enhance the service we provide to both our broker partners and our customers. This is a major appointment for the business, and we&rsquo;re incredibly excited to have someone of Trevor&rsquo;s calibre join the Bridging team.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Offa already had already more than doubled its headcount to 45 in the past year as the business continues to expand its service offering and plans to continue hiring.</p>
<p>Offa, the first company to launch Sharia-compliant bridge finance in the UK, recently launched an innovative bridge-to-let finance service combining its ultra-fast bridge product with its modern, paperless Buy-to-Let. The company also recently purchased Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s Alburaq Sharia-compliant home finance portfolio in a landmark deal and announced it had received Financial Conduct Authority authorisation to provide upcoming Islamic home purchase plans.</p>
<p>The company received &pound;230 million of sharia-compliant funding for its BTL product, offering significant capacity for the business to expand and diversify its financial propositions in the UK property market.</p>

<title>ACER: Regulators Request More Time To Decide On The Minimum Activation Period Of Frequency Containment Reserves Providers</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/acer-regulators-request-more-time-to-decide-on-the-minimum-activation-period-of-2025124/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/acer-regulators-request-more-time-to-decide-on-the-minimum-activation-period-of-2025124/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On 3 December 2025, the national regulatory authorities of the Continental Europe Synchronous Area submitted to ACER a joint request for a six-month extension to decide on the transmission system operators&rsquo; proposal. This concerns the minimum activation period that frequency containment reserve providers with limited energy reservoirs must ensure in order to remain available during the alert state.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is it about?</span></p>
<p>EU&rsquo;s electric power systems operate at the frequency of 50 Hz. Any imbalance between electricity supply and demand causes the frequency to deviate. If not corrected quickly, this can lead to blackouts.</p>

<title>The Association Of National Numbering Agencies (ANNA) And Digital Token Identifier Foundation (DTIF) Win ‘Best Data Solution For Digital Assets' At The Data Management Insight Awards Europe 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>We are pleased to announce that&nbsp;the Association of National Numbering Agencies (ANNA) and the Digital Token Identifier Foundation (DTIF) have won &lsquo;<span>Best Data Solution for Digital Assets</span>' at the Data Management Insight Awards Europe 2025.&nbsp;These annual awards recognise leading providers of data management solutions, services and consultancy to capital markets participants within Europe and&nbsp;are voted for by clients and financial users in the data management space.</span></p>
<p><span>This award acknowledges the&nbsp;<span>groundbreaking identifier alignment solution developed through the partnership between ANNA and the DTIF,&nbsp; including the issuance of the first set of International Securities Identification Numbers (ISINs) for crypto assets.</span><span></span></span></p>
<p><span>ANNA is the central membership organisation for global Numbering Agencies, serving as the identification and Registration Authority for the&nbsp;International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) and Financial Instrument Short Name (FISN) standards, under appointment by the&nbsp;International Organization for Standardization (ISO).</span></p>
<p><span>The DTIF issues and maintains DTIs (ISO 24165) as open, reference data to uniquely identify crypto assets and enhance transparency in digital markets.<br /><br /></span><span>This initiative meets the urgent need for standardised identification in digital assets by uniting emerging digital asset standards with those long established in traditional finance. Through the alignment of two complementary and interoperable identifiers-the International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) and the Digital Token Identifier (DTI) - it delivers greater transparency and creates a foundational reference data set built on open data principles.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span><strong>Stephan Dreyer, Managing Director of ANNA, said: &ldquo;</strong>Voted for by industry users, we are delighted to receive this award that acknowledges our collaboration with the DTI Foundation. Together, we&rsquo;ve helped bridge traditional and digital asset markets with interoperable, ISO-based identifiers, and built a partnership that marks a major step forward in building critical investor confidence across the evolving digital asset ecosystem.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>The connection of reliable standards from authoritative sources represents a major advance in enabling product validation for both digital asset market participants and its regulators.</span></p>

<title>SIX To Integrate SIX x-clear And BME Clearing Into One International And Multi-Asset CCP</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/six-to-integrate-six-x-clear-and-bme-clearing-into-one-international-and-multi-a-2025124/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/six-to-integrate-six-x-clear-and-bme-clearing-into-one-international-and-multi-a-2025124/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>SIX announces its plan to integrate SIX x-clear and BME Clearing into one multi-asset CCP with international presence and interoperable links in the cash equity segment. Subject to required regulatory approvals, SIX will create a single multi-asset clearing house.</span></p>
<p>SIX operates two CCPs, SIX x-clear in Switzerland and BME Clearing in Spain. Currently, the two clearing houses collaborate but maintain separate local entities and systems. As a unified clearing house, SIX Clearing, as it will be named, will gain scale, optimize processes and create a foundation for growth in all segments.</p>
<p>The acquisition of BME by SIX laid the foundation for a pan-European growth platform and strengthened SIX&rsquo;s position in EU capital markets. This latest strategic project merges SIX x-clear and BME Clearing into one single, multi-asset CCP headquartered in Madrid with presences in Zurich and Oslo. The unified CCP is designed to enhance resilience, efficiency and competition across European financial markets.</p>
<p>The interoperability links and functions of SIX x-clear will be transferred to the consolidated CCP, making the new CCP a true pan-European interoperable cash equity CCP. SIX Clearing will continue to champion and promote the adoption of interoperability across Europe to enhance efficiency in European financial markets. The existing EU license under BME Clearing will give SIX Clearing access to European Central Bank (ECB) EUR liquidity, T2 and T2S and other EU relevant regulated markets and MTFs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The combined CCP will bring together SIX x-clear&rsquo;s interoperable pan-European cash equity model with BME Clearing&rsquo;s multi-asset strengths, creating a scaled, open and competitive alternative for clearing across asset classes in Europe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are very pleased to announce this project, that will create a more comprehensive clearing service. As a consolidated CCP, SIX will be able to diversify into other asset classes and expand the reach of our offering. With the EU license, we are in a position to become the leading provider of integrated and digital post-trade solutions for the European market and compete internationally with a unique value proposition&rdquo;, said<span>&nbsp;Rafael Moral Santiago,&nbsp;Head Securities Services &amp; Executive Board Member, SIX</span>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Disclaimer - Important Legal Notice:</span>&nbsp;The above mentioned information is subject to the required regulatory approvals. The timeline as well as the currently planned form of execution of this integration are depended on these approvals.</p>

<title>SET Market Report For November 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/set-market-report-for-november-2025-2025124/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Although the US government shutdown has ended, certain months of economic data remain unavailable. Markets are currently pricing in high odds that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will resume interest rate cuts at its final meeting of this year, scheduled for December 9-10, 2025. Some Federal Reserve (Fed) officials have voiced opposition to rate cuts, citing concerns about elevated valuations of U.S. technology stocks. However, current NASDAQ index levels remain below the 2000 Dot-com peak, while forward 12-month earnings per share forecasts for most U.S. listed companies continue to demonstrate sustained growth. Against this backdrop, numerous analysts recommend portfolio diversification away from U.S. technology stocks towards other bourses, including emerging markets.</p>
<p>Regarding the Thai stock market, the SET Index at the end of November 2025 fell 4.0% from the previous month, closing at 1,256.69 points, aligning with global stock market trends. Thailand's economic slowdown in the third quarter of 2025 and flooding in Southern Thailand added downward pressure.</p>
<p><b>SET Senior Executive Vice President Soraphol Tulayasathien</b> stated that Thailand's third-quarter 2025 economic growth decelerated to 1.2% from 2.8% in the second quarter, attributed to slower exports and tourism, reduced government consumption and investment spending, and baht strengthening. This trend dealt a blow to sales revenues of listed companies across nearly all business sectors. Additionally, the unexpected flooding in Southern Thailand further weighed on the investment sentiment. However, on a positive note, Thai ESG funds (ThaiESG) continue to attract inflows as investors pursue tax benefits. Historically, net outflows from Long-Term Equity Funds (LTF) moderate in the year's final two months.</p>
<p><b>Key highlights for November 2025</b></p>
<ul>
<li>At end-November 2025, the SET Index closed at 1,256.69 points, or a 4.0 percent decrease from the previous month and a 10.2 percent drop since the beginning of the year. Compared to the end of 2024, the industry groups that outperformed the SET Index were Technology and Financials.</li>
<li>SET&rsquo;s and Market for Alternative Investment (mai)&rsquo;s average daily trading value dropped 22.4 percent YoY to THB 34.32 billion (approx. USD 1.07 billion), with a YTD average daily trading value of THB 41.91 billion.</li>
<li>Foreign investors sold a net THB 12.56 billion, with THB 113.30 billion in net selling for the January-November period of 2025.</li>
<li>Foreign investors continued to dominate trading activity, representing 54.20 percent of total trading value, followed by local retail investors at 29.06 percent, local institutional investors at 10.88 percent, and securities companies at 5.85 percent.</li>
<li>There were two newly listed companies on SET: Smothong Group pcl (SMO) and MR. D.I.Y. Holding (Thailand) pcl (MRDIYT); and another two on mai: MMM Capital pcl (MMM) and Laundry You pcl (WASH).</li>
<li>SET&rsquo;s forward P/E ratio at end-November 2025 stood at 11.7 times, lower than the Asian stock market average of 14.6 times. The historical P/E ratio was at 11.6 times, well below the Asian stock market average of 16.4 times.</li>
<li>SET&rsquo;s dividend yield at end-November 2025 was 4.01 percent, notably higher than the Asian stock market average of 2.93 percent.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Derivatives Market</b></p>
<ul>
<li>At the end of November 2025, Thailand Futures Exchange (TFEX)&rsquo;s daily trading volume was recorded at 329,001 contracts, down 19.10 percent from the previous month, mainly due to the decline in Single Stock Futures, SET50 Index Futures, and Gold Online Futures. The YTD average daily trading volume in 2025 totaled 413,695 contracts, down 14.5 percent from the same period last year, mainly due to the decline in Single Stock Futures and SET50 Index Futures. </li>

<title>Simplification Update - ASIC Expands Email Lodgements</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/simplification-update-asic-expands-email-lodgements-2025124/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC has introduced email lodgement for 35 paper forms to help streamline interactions and reduce administrative burden for those needing to comply with their obligations.</p>
<p>This initiative is part of ASIC&rsquo;s simplification work outlined in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/regulatory-simplification/" title="Regulatory simplification">Regulatory Simplification</a>&nbsp;report to transition more &lsquo;paper-only&rsquo; documents to email lodgement and enable electronic signatures on all forms.</p>
<p>Selected based on stakeholder feedback, the forms relate to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share capital notifications</li>
<li>Changes to responsible entities</li>
<li>Managed investment schemes</li>
<li>Auditor changes</li>
<li>Company structure updates, and</li>
<li>Other regulatory lodgements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recently added forms are shown below. Our website has a complete&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/for-business-and-companies/forms-and-fees/how-to-lodge-forms-online-email-mail/" title="How to lodge forms: online, email, mail">list of forms that can be lodged by email</a>.</p>
<p>Email lodgement provides a faster, more convenient submission option while paper lodgement remains available for those who prefer the existing postal option.</p>
<p>While most forms submitted to ASIC can already be completed online, some still require submission by post. Over time, ASIC will continue to expand the option to lodge these forms via email to support a more convenient and streamlined user experience.</p>
<p>To support the transition, ASIC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/for-business-and-companies/forms-and-fees/how-to-lodge-forms-online-email-mail/#email" title="How to lodge forms: online, email, mail">document lodgement requirements</a>&nbsp;have been consolidated into a single resource. This includes lodgement guidance on forms, manner of lodging documents and signing documents.</p>
<h2>Electronic signatures</h2>
<p>ASIC also now accepts&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/for-business-and-companies/forms-and-fees/how-to-lodge-forms-online-email-mail/#electronicsignatures" title="How to lodge forms: online, email, mail">electronic signatures</a>&nbsp;on approved PDF forms available on our website, including those enabled for email lodgement.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC is seeking feedback on a proposal to remake relief instruments for Australian financial services (AFS) licensees and foreign authorised deposit-taking institutions (ADIs).<br /><br /><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2016L00451/latest/text"><em>ASIC Corporations (Foreign Licensees and ADIs) Instrument 2016/186</em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2021L00500/latest/text"><em>ASIC Corporations (Licence Conditions&mdash;Treatment of Lease Assets) Instrument 2021/229</em></a>&nbsp;(the Instruments) are due to sunset on 1 April 2026 and automatically repeal on 1 May 2026 respectively.<br /><br />We have assessed that the instruments are operating effectively and continue to form a necessary part of the legislative framework.<br /><br />The relief provided under the Instruments will remain largely unchanged other than an amendment to a relief condition, and clarification of a note under Section 5(2) of ASIC Instrument 2016/186. Other minor changes have been made to ensure the relief is up-to-date and current.</p>
<h2>Providing feedback&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Please send your submissions to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:rri.consultation@asic.gov.au">rri.consultation@asic.gov.au</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<strong>5pm AEDT on Friday 23 January 2026</strong>.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Under the&nbsp;<em>Legislation Act 2003</em>, all legislative instruments are automatically repealed, or &lsquo;sunset&rsquo;, after 10 years, unless ASIC takes action to preserve them.</p>
<h3>Financial reporting and record keeping relief</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2016L00451/latest/text">ASIC Instrument 2016/186</a>&nbsp;exempts:</p>
<ul>
<li>foreign licensees from certain record keeping obligations, as well as the requirement to lodge financial statements and have them audited under Div 6 of Pt 7.8 of the Corporations Act, and</li>
<li>foreign ADIs from the requirement to hold an AFS licence when dealing in derivatives and foreign exchange contracts on their own behalf.</li>

<h3>Financial requirements &ndash; treatment of lease assets relief</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2021L00500/latest/text">ASIC Instrument 2021/229</a>&nbsp;specifies that a right-of-use asset under a lease is not an excluded asset for the purposes of an AFS licensee&rsquo;s general duty to comply with its licence conditions. This allows certain AFS licensees when calculating their financial resource requirements to include a right-of-use asset under a lease in the calculation of their net tangible assets and, where applicable, adjusted surplus liquid funds and surplus liquid funds.</p>

<p>ASIC is seeking feedback on a proposal to remake two legislative instruments.<br /><br />These provide technical relief relating to Australian financial services (AFS) licensees (and persons providing financial services on their behalf) and make minor updates to certain prescribed credit disclosures.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2015L01936/latest/text"><em>ASIC Corporations (Miscellaneous Technical Relief) Instrument 2015/1115</em></a><em>, and</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2016L00319/latest/text"><em>ASIC Credit (Updated details for prescribed disclosure) Instrument 2016/200</em></a>&nbsp;(the Instruments) are due to sunset on 1 April 2026.<br /><br />We have assessed that the instruments are operating effectively and continue to form a necessary part of the legislative framework.<br /><br />ASIC proposes to remake:</p>
<ul>
<li>the relief provided under ASIC Instrument 2015/1115, without substantial change other than amendments to ensure the instrument is up to date, and</li>

<title>ASIC Calls On Australian Companies To Adopt Better Practices To Protect Whistleblowers</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A first-of-its-kind ASIC questionnaire has shown significant differences in the whistleblower policies and practices adopted across corporate Australia, and highlighted opportunities for companies to better support and protect those who speak up.</p>
<p>Report 827&nbsp;<em>Insights from the ASIC Whistleblower Questionnaire: July 2024 to June 2025</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-827-insights-from-the-asic-whistleblower-questionnaire-july-2024-to-june-2025/" title="REP 827 Insights from the ASIC Whistleblower Questionnaire: July 2024 to June 2025">REP 827</a>) benchmarks whistleblower policies and practices across 134 entities in 18 industries, examining how far companies have adopted better practices outlined in previous ASIC publications.</p>
<p>ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland said: &lsquo;Whistleblowers play a crucial role in identifying and exposing misconduct that can harm customers, shareholders, companies and the broader community.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Without effective policies and programs to encourage whistleblowers to come forward, misconduct may otherwise go unreported and undetected,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s questionnaire found significant variation in the maturity of whistleblower practices.</p>
<p>There are opportunities for companies to adopt better practices for whistleblower disclosures. ASIC&rsquo;s review found:</p>
<ul>
<li>over one third of participating entities did not provide a dedicated whistleblower web page for raising concerns</li>
<li>a quarter failed to provide regular staff training on their whistleblower program, and</li>
<li>more than half had not sought employee feedback on their whistleblower program in the past year.</li>
</ul>
<p>ASIC observed larger companies and companies within the mining sector were most likely to have mature whistleblower practices and higher disclosure rates. Some smaller companies also demonstrated better practices, suggesting firm size was not an impediment to strong whistleblower programs.</p>
<p>Commissioner Kirkland said ASIC's review highlighted actions Australian companies could adopt to improve their whistleblower programs and practices.</p>
<p>&lsquo;While whistleblower processes need to be tailored to the circumstances of each company, providing dedicated web pages for whistleblower reporting, enabling communication with anonymous disclosers, and fostering a stronger speak-up culture are all steps companies can take to support whistleblowers and encourage disclosures,' said Mr Kirkland.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Strong, appropriate and effective whistleblower practices go to the core of good corporate governance. These programs provide important information for directors to oversee their company&rsquo;s operations and compliance with the law.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We encourage companies to benchmark themselves against the findings of the report and consider how they can improve their own whistleblower policies and practices,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>ASIC will continue to monitor whistleblower practices across corporate Australia and engage with companies identified as having non-compliant or significantly less mature practices.</p>
<p>Companies are reminded that they are required to provide specific protections for whistleblowers and to manage whistleblower disclosures confidentially. Proper whistleblower policies should reflect these protections and outline how they will support and protect whistleblowers, taking into account the specific circumstances and characteristics of the company.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Good afternoon and thank you Amy [Lally]<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn1">[1]</a>, for the kind words. I appreciate the opportunity to address the 2025 Institute for Corporate Counsel.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Its focus on the intersection of law, business, and politics is particularly timely. As our Chairman Paul Atkins has proclaimed earlier this year, it is a new day at the SEC and there have been changes in perspective on these three factors.</p>
<p>What has not changed, however, is the recognition that law, business, and politics impact our shared efforts to build and maintain strong capital markets. Economic growth, jobs creation, and innovation are powered by free enterprise and opportunity, which are not possible without investors being willing to supply risk capital.</p>
<p>Law underpins the Commission&rsquo;s authority to protect investors, to maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and to facilitate capital formation. Business operates within this legal framework to provide goods and services demanded, and desired, by the public. Lastly, politics responds to the voting electorate and their general views on policies are reflected in the election of the President and members of Congress.</p>
<p>During the next several years, the Commission is expected to focus on crypto, encouraging more companies to go public, and facilitating more opportunities to invest in private markets. Today, I will focus on the second part of that agenda &mdash; encouraging more businesses to go, and stay, public by making it less onerous to be a public company.</p>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span>Periodic Reporting Should be Reconsidered to Promote Effectiveness and Decrease Costs</span></em></p>
<p>Earlier this year, President Donald J. Trump, in a Truth Social post, expressed his view that public companies should have the option to move from reporting quarterly to semiannually.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn3">[3]</a>&nbsp;President Trump observed that this would &ldquo;save money, and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we seek to incentivize businesses to have IPOs, and increase the number of public companies, we should consider whether the current SEC reporting regime remains optimal. This exercise is not particularly novel. Other major capital markets have shifted their reporting periods specifically in order to minimize burdens and promote longer term thinking.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn4">[4]</a>&nbsp;Even in the United States, foreign private issuers are not required to file quarterly reports, in contrast to the quarterly filing requirement that applies to domestic issuers.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn5">[5]</a>&nbsp;The capital markets depend on the quality and integrity of the information provided by companies to investors. However, the channels for providing material information to market participants have grown significantly due to advances in technology and communications. The investing world simply does not wait with bated breadth for the filing of the next Form 10-Q with the SEC. Nearly twenty years ago, then-Chairman Chris Cox recognized the possibility that websites, including blogs, might be an appropriate method for distributing material corporate information without running afoul of Regulation FD.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn6">[6]</a>&nbsp;Today, important information can be flashed instantaneously across the globe with little cost.</p>
<p>With respect to reporting frequency, this is an issue that we have struggled with over time. Currently, regulations require dissemination of financial and other information through quarterly filings made with the SEC. This was not always the case, however. For decades prior, the SEC did not mandate quarterly disclosures.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn7">[7]</a></p>
<p>There has been a longstanding debate over whether a short-term outlook harms long-term investment in companies.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn8">[8]</a>&nbsp;Chairman Arthur Levitt referenced this debate in 1998, noting that &ldquo;&hellip; we have got to break this pattern where short-term estimates rather than long-term results drive a company&rsquo;s stock. Wall Street needs to focus less on quarterly earnings and more on the long-term health and viability of a company. Don&rsquo;t settle for anything less &hellip; If we satisfy short-term needs at the expense of long-term values, we defy the very principle companies and our markets operate on &ndash; the efficient allocation of capital.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn9">[9]</a></p>
<p>In 2018, the SEC requested public comment on the disclosures that reporting companies must provide in their quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn10">[10]</a>&nbsp;The Commission was interested in exploring ways to promote efficiency in periodic reporting by reducing unnecessary duplication in disclosure and how such changes could affect capital formation, while maintaining appropriate investor protection.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn11">[11]</a></p>
<p>Given the efforts to make public capital markets great again, it is appropriate to revisit this question. As some commentators have noted &ldquo;frequent reporting can distort managerial incentives, leading to a prioritization of short-term accounting performance over long-term value creation.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn12">[12]</a></p>
<p>In this regard, the current Form 10-Q framework potentially captures two negative regulatory outcomes: first, the sheer cost to prepare a Form 10-Q every quarter; and, second, whether the disclosures contained in that filing substantially benefit price discovery for shareholders. It takes a significant amount of time and effort to prepare a Form 10-Q, particularly when there is personal civil and criminal liability under Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Thus, when preparing a Form 10-Q, do not forget that every company must have disclosure controls and procedures (DCPs) on mine safety, even if the company has never had any involvement in such activities. After all, DCPs are needed to confirm that the company did not have any reportable mine safety incidents during that quarter. Exactly how does that benefit investors?</p>
<p>The SEC estimates that Form 10-Qs average reporting burden per response to be a modest 135.13 hours.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn13">[13]</a>&nbsp;It would not be surprising, however, if this figure vastly understates the actual burden.</p>
<p>Given the diversity of business models, it would be presumptuous to think that a single prescriptive regime perfectly fits each company. Shifting from quarterly to semiannually would provide more flexibility for companies to align the reporting period with the potential needs of their shareholder base, business cycle, and securities analyst coverage.</p>
<p>For companies with a multi-year development cycle, such as those who have a single product in the pipeline and no current revenue, shareholders may find quarterly financial information less relevant than disclosure on the progress towards development milestones. Even if no longer required to file on Form 10-Q, such companies would remain subject to current report filing obligations on Form 8-K for certain material events.</p>
<p>The experience of other jurisdictions can provide useful case studies as to whether shifting to semiannual reporting would have a negative impact on our capital markets. As one study noted, &ldquo;[w]hen quarterly reporting was no longer required of U.K. companies in 2014, less than 10% stopped issuing quarterly reports (as of the end of 2015) &hellip; [t]here was no statistically significant difference between the levels of corporate investment of the UK companies that stopped quarterly reporting and those that continued quarterly reporting.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn14">[14]</a></p>
<p>In 2013, the European Union abolished the requirement to publish the quarterly report, known as the interim management statement (IMS). The E.U., noted that the IMSs were a burden for small and medium-sized issuers without being necessary for investor protection.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn15">[15]</a>&nbsp;Furthermore, &ldquo;the IMSs were thought to encourage a focus on short-term performance and discourage long-term investment.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn16">[16]</a></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not confuse omitting the Form 10-Q for the first and third quarters with the absence of any information to the market. Even if a company adopted a semi-annual reporting schedule, they could still report earnings and other information on a quarterly basis on Form 8-K.</p>
<p>The financial markets tend to react to quarterly earnings information distributed in earnings releases and analyst calls, all of which are subject to the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. There tends to be far less reaction to the Form 10-Q disclosures, which often come several weeks later. This raises questions about the marginal informational value provided by the Form 10-Q. Some of the information, like material changes to risk factors, unregistered sales of equity securities, and defaults upon senior securities &ndash; and the aforementioned mine safety disclosures &mdash; may be better suited to disclosure elsewhere.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn17">[17]</a></p>
<p>The fundamental question is whether the costs and burdens associated with the preparation of quarterly Form 10-Q filings provide corresponding levels of benefits to shareholders and the financial markets. Regulators should be open to change rather than have a reflexive instinct to maintain existing frameworks.</p>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span>Our Rulebook Should Promote Transparent Clarity, Not Complex Secrecy</span></em></p>
<p>Additionally, where the Commission can promote transparency behind its thinking, then it should do so. There are many aspects to its regulatory framework where such transparency is not forthcoming. One example is shareholder proposals under Rule 14a-8,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn18">[18]</a>&nbsp;where most of the analysis is documented in internal memoranda that only Commission staff and former staff have seen.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn19">[19]</a>&nbsp;Our rulebook should not be based on secret internal writings or codes; while such secrecy might have entertainment value such as when watching Nicholas Cage in&nbsp;<em>National Treasure</em>,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn20">[20]</a>&nbsp;it is inconsistent with a transparent regulatory framework. Deciphering our rules should not be akin to solving complex cryptographic puzzles. Instead, our rules and policies should be stated clearly and openly. (That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed having possession of the mythical SEC Chairmen&rsquo;s Book of Secrets during the three months that I served as acting chairman.)<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn21">[21]</a></p>
<p>The need for transparency is also reflected in the Commission&rsquo;s recent decision to articulate its policies regarding the acceleration of effectiveness of registration statements with mandatory arbitration provisions (the &ldquo;Policy Statement&rdquo;).<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn22">[22]</a>&nbsp;For years, many operated under the assumption that mandatory arbitration provisions were not permissible in registration statements. However, such a regulation or formal policy has never been adopted by the Commission.</p>
<p>Describing the Policy Statement as a reversal of the Commission&rsquo;s previous position is inaccurate and misleading as the Commission has never adopted a policy in this regard. For that reason, critics of the Policy Statement cannot point to any prior Commission or staff policy statements. Rather, prior practice was for Commission staff to inform registrants that without Commission guidance, which could take weeks, if not months, to obtain, the staff would not use its delegated authority to accelerate the effectiveness of registration statements if there was a mandatory arbitration provision. One should not be surprised that registrants have opted to remove those provisions rather than undergo the potentially time consuming process of obtaining a Commission policy position. From a practical standpoint, this approach operated as a de facto ban on mandatory arbitration provisions. I think this is wrong: policies should be stated clearly and not be cloaked. The Policy Statement now achieves that objective.</p>
<p>Critics point to the public interest standard contained in the federal securities laws as a reason to prohibit the inclusion of mandatory arbitration provisions. However, the case law cited in the Policy Statement fully supports the Commission&rsquo;s approach. As the Policy Statement observes, &ldquo;nothing in the text of the anti-waiver provisions or any other provisions of the Federal securities statutes could be construed as a clearly expressed congressional intention that the Arbitration Act would not apply to Federal securities laws claims.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn23">[23]</a></p>
<p>The public interest and investor protection requirements of Section 8(a) of the Securities Act cannot form the basis for a backdoor merit review standard. As the Policy Statement notes: &ldquo;Courts have considered the scope of the public interest and investor protection standard in the context of the Federal securities laws and determined that, when applying this standard, it is only permissible to consider those matters over which the Commission has authority under the Federal securities laws.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn24">[24]</a>&nbsp;The Policy Statement concludes that &ldquo;[b]ecause the Federal securities statutes do not override the Arbitration Act when applied to arbitration provisions, the existence of such a provision is not within the ambit of appropriate considerations under Section 8(a)&rsquo;s public interest and investor protection standard&hellip;&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn25">[25]</a></p>
<p>Taking a contrary position would run afoul of the overwhelming weight of judicial precedent, run counter to a common sense interpretation, and would open the registration statement review process to a subjective merit review standard. Should the public interest standard be used to deny acceleration to companies involved in mining, fossil fuels, artificial intelligence, or fast-fashion? Should acceleration of registration statements be denied because a company takes stances on controversial political issues deemed counter to the &ldquo;public interest&rdquo; by the powers that be? Should excessive performance-based compensation for corporate executives be viewed as against the public interest because some say it increases wealth disparity? Who would define what is the &ldquo;public interest&rdquo;? Would there be any limiting principle? The list of potentially subjective &ldquo;public interest&rdquo; criteria for denying acceleration would be never ending and in perpetual flux. Congress could have adopted a merit review standard during the passage of the Securities Act, but it did not and, instead, adopted a framework based on disclosure of material information.</p>
<p>In short, the Policy Statement addresses a specific issue that has been left unaddressed for decades and articulates clear views on how the Commission and its staff will administer this particular statutory provision.</p>
<p class="text-align-center"><span>Unaccountable and Concentrated Proxy Voting Power</span></p>
<p>Lastly, we should ensure that market participants comply with statutory and SEC requirements to disseminate information when they are acting in a coordinated manner. This activity includes coordinated proxy voting, which can occur through the efforts of proxy voting advisory businesses (PVAB) to recommend particular policy choices to funds and asset managers. In 2021, Commissioner Elad Roisman noted that &ldquo;they can influence the outcome of a variety of matters that companies submit to a shareholder vote.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn26">[26]</a></p>
<p>With regard to proxy voting, practices that directly or indirectly result in coordinated voting should be evaluated with respect to compliance with reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act. Shareholders form a group if they act together for the purpose of voting the equity securities of an issuer. Depending on the facts and circumstances, funds and asset managers using PVABs for voting decisions may have formed a group for purposes of Section 13(d)(3) or Section 13(g)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn27">[27]</a>&nbsp;Indeed, the Commission itself raised this issue in 2020 when it stated that &ldquo;[u]se of a proxy voting advice business by investors as a vehicle for the purpose of coordinating their voting decisions regarding an issuers&rsquo; securities&rdquo; would raise issues under the SEC&rsquo;s beneficial ownership rules.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn28">[28]</a>&nbsp;Of course, a group is not formed simply because a shareholder independently determined how it wants to vote on an issue, announced its voting decision, or advised others on how it intended to vote.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-institute-corporate-counsel-120325#_ftn29">[29]</a>&nbsp;The key is that the vote is based on an independent decision by the shareholder itself. If, in lieu of such independent decision-making, funds and asset managers automatically vote shares solely based on PVAB recommendation regarding shareholder proposals that have the purpose or effect of influencing control over the company and the aggregated voting power of such persons exceeds 5% beneficial ownership, such persons may have formed a group and need to file a Schedule 13D even if they beneficially own less than 5% on an individual basis.</p>
<p>To the extent that funds and asset managers are engaging in &ldquo;robo-voting&rdquo; based on PVAB recommendations, such practices should be reviewed to determine whether they comply with the Exchange Act and SEC rules. The evaluation of whether a group has been formed should take into account the business realities of the arrangements, particularly if robo-voting results in coordination of voting practices where owners of the same securities vote in tandem with each other with the effect of influencing control of an issuer. The substance of such arrangements has implications under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and we should not shy away from scrutinizing such consequences.</p>
<p>Thank you for your attention today and future engagement on these important topics. I welcome questions.</p>

<p>Recently I expressed my concern about &ldquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-091725-repeal-extension-statement-yet-another-extension-form-pf-compliance-date">Repeal by Extension</a>&rdquo;&mdash;the concept of using compliance date extensions that are long in duration to indefinitely delay the compliance dates of final rules.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-extension-compliance-dates-120325#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;I am disappointed that this pattern continues today with the issuance of an exemptive order<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-extension-compliance-dates-120325#_ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;that provides a two-year compliance date extension for two rules aimed at increasing transparency in the securities lending and short sale markets: Rule 10c-1a (Securities Lending Reporting)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-extension-compliance-dates-120325#_ftn3">[3]</a>&nbsp;and Rule 13f-2 (Short Position and Short Activity Reporting) (collectively, the &ldquo;Rules&rdquo;).<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-extension-compliance-dates-120325#_ftn4">[4]</a>&nbsp;The Commission adopted both of these Rules in 2023 under rulemaking authority granted by Congress through the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (&ldquo;Dodd-Frank&rdquo;),<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-extension-compliance-dates-120325#_ftn5">[5]</a>&nbsp;the well-known legislative response to the wreckage generated by the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
<p>Let me briefly explain how we got here. Trade groups challenged the Rules on various grounds, and, on August 25, 2025, the Fifth Circuit largely rejected the arguments they raised.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-extension-compliance-dates-120325#_ftn6">[6]</a>&nbsp;It did, however, agree with one argument and remanded the Rules to the Commission, without vacating them, to allow the Commission &ldquo;to analyze [the Rules&rsquo;] cumulative economic impact and respond[] to further comments in view of that analysis.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-extension-compliance-dates-120325#_ftn7">[7]</a>&nbsp;The Court determined that &ldquo;there is at least a serious possibility that the agency will be able to substantiate its decision given an opportunity to do so.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-extension-compliance-dates-120325#_ftn8">[8]</a></p>
<p>It should not take two years to complete a narrow revision of the Rules&rsquo; economic analyses consistent with the Court&rsquo;s request. This could be done expeditiously and concisely. However, rather than following the Court&rsquo;s narrow directive, the Commission not so subtly signals that no one should even bother with implementation; the Rules will be changing.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-extension-compliance-dates-120325#_ftn9">[9]</a></p>
<p>The right (and legal) thing to do would be to implement the Rules, which are already effective since the Fifth Circuit declined to vacate them. If extra time is truly necessary to allow registrants more runway to prepare for the Rules in light of the Court&rsquo;s decision, this could be accomplished by a short compliance date extension.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-extension-compliance-dates-120325#_ftn10">[10]</a>&nbsp;Any future modifications should be addressed separately, as required by statute, through notice-and-comment rulemaking.</p>
<p>Under the guise of compliance date extensions, we are attempting to camouflage a new willingness to repeatedly bend the rules until they break&mdash;eroding the rule of law.</p>

<div id="ftn10">
<p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-extension-compliance-dates-120325#_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;Unlike the prior &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; compliance date extensions issued for these Rules, which acknowledged that the exemptions would delay the benefits of the Rules, today&rsquo;s second round of extensions make no mention of the benefits that will be forgone while the Rules are stalled. For example, with respect to Rule 10c-1a, the prior exemption stated that the public availability of accurate securities loan data will result in (1) protections against potentially unfair pricing of securities loans by broker-dealers and protect broker-dealers&rsquo; customers against potential instabilities, (2) better decision-making by investors, beneficial owners and other market participants, (3) reduced costs of business for broker-dealers, (4) improved performance and reduced costs for lending programs, and (5) improved market stability and price discovery both in the securities lending market and the market for the underlying security.&nbsp;<em>See</em>&nbsp;Prior Securities Lending Exemptive Order at 5-6. Nevertheless, today we are delaying the realization of the Rules&rsquo; benefits yet again, and we are possibly embarking down a path to further diminish those benefits by amending the Rules before their anticipated benefits are ever realized.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Good afternoon, everyone.</p>
<p>Marc, thank you so much for that kind introduction. It&rsquo;s wonderful to be back at an ABA event and I am excited to be doing so in my new role as SEC IM Division Director. I am eager to engage with you today and am glad to see so many familiar faces.</p>
<p>Before we get started, I must start with our standard disclaimer.&nbsp;Thanks to the lapse in appropriations, this is only my second time making this statement, so forgive me for reading off a card.</p>
<p><em>These remarks are provided in my official capacity as the Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s Director of the Division of Investment Management, but do not necessarily reflect the views of the Commission, the Commissioners, or other members of the staff.</em></p>
<p>With that said: I have been with the Commission now for five months, one and half of which coincided with the longest government shutdown on record. As I roamed the 8th Floor for 45 days &ndash; only able to work on a very short list of &ldquo;excepted&rdquo; activities &ndash; I couldn&rsquo;t help but ponder the Division&rsquo;s path forward. With your indulgence, I thought that this would be a good forum to share some of our priorities.</p>
<h3>Listening</h3>
<p>Now, when it comes to our priorities, I want to be clear about something: I serve at the pleasure of the Commission. The Chairman sets the overall direction, and the Commissioners&mdash;nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate&mdash;vote to implement that agenda.&nbsp;So, my personal priorities for the division are always shaped by and aligned with the broader goals of the Commission. If those priorities shift, we shift with them.</p>
<p>That said, my top priority for the Division is simple: to be good listeners.</p>
<p>My mother used to say, &ldquo;The minute you start talking is the minute you stop learning.&rdquo; And she was correct. Listening&mdash;really listening&mdash;is one of the most effective tools we have as regulators.</p>
<p>Some of you can see that I am wearing cufflinks shaped like tiny hippopotamuses.&nbsp;Why? Because hippos have two tiny ears and one huge, massive mouth.&nbsp;These are to remind me not to be a hippo.</p>
<p>We are deeply interested in what the industry has to say, how investors feel, and how the public perceives our proposals.&nbsp;While my track record is short, our public outreach to date has been fruitful, sometimes in unexpected ways.&nbsp;In some cases, after engaging with stakeholders, it became clear that some of my brilliant ideas were off-base.&nbsp;Some were solutions to problems that didn&rsquo;t exist, and others addressed issues that the market had already evolved past.</p>
<p>But by asking questions and listening carefully, we&rsquo;ve been able to redirect our resources toward initiatives that do make sense&mdash;initiatives that are grounded in reality and responsive to the needs of investors and the industry alike.&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll get a feel for those in the next publication of the RegFlex agenda&hellip;</p>
<p>And by listening, we became smarter&mdash;often about parts of your businesses that we weren&rsquo;t even asking about. It&rsquo;s funny how, when you give experts the space to tell you what they think is important, you might be surprised by what you hear.</p>
<p>So yes, we have policy goals. Yes, we have regulatory responsibilities. But above all, we have a duty to listen, to learn, and to lead with humility and purpose.</p>
<h3>Agenda</h3>
<p>But let&rsquo;s shift to more concrete points.&nbsp;While it is impossible to completely reduce a four-year workplan to a short list of bullets, hope springs eternal.</p>
<p>When you look at our various efforts, I think that you will see each step the Division takes falls into one (or more) of the following themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>An overall&nbsp;<em><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">deregulatory</span></span></em>&nbsp;effort;</li>
<li><em><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Modernization</span></span></em>&nbsp;initiatives;</li>
<li><em><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Democratization</span></span></em>&nbsp;of alternative asset investments; and</li>
<li>Promotion of&nbsp;<em><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">artificial intelligence</span></span></em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Deregulation</h3>
<p>The American capital markets are the envy of the world.&nbsp;In my opinion, the reason for American dominance in finance is simple, we allow more innovation than our competitors.</p>
<p>Thoughtful and measured deregulation can unlock value.&nbsp;In 2019, the Commission streamlined the ETF approval process, and in six short years, the exchange traded fund has literally changed the face of retail investing.&nbsp;Retail investors have more investment options, at lower cost, than ever before.&nbsp;ETFs deliver true beta, cheaply, and provide active management in a wide variety of forms.</p>
<p>And with our new ETF Share class orders, we are allowing industry the option to link ETFs and mutual fund structures to deliver even more choices, at reduced expenses, for retail investors.</p>
<p>Commission actions and restraint also allowed the private fund market to flourish.&nbsp;America invented the hedge fund, the private equity fund, and the private credit fund, and these structures transformed institutional investing, with compensation structures that aligned mangers and investors in innovative ways.&nbsp;And why here?&nbsp;Again, because we allowed a lighter-touch regime to develop for sophisticated investors capable of managing their own risks.</p>
<p>In our rulemaking, oversight, and exemptive efforts over the next few years, you can expect that the Division will be receptive to suggestions on how thoughtful changes to existing rules can facilitate innovation. We are asking &ldquo;Why is this still on the books?&rdquo; in a number of contexts, and you should too.</p>
<p>To be clear, we are still the Investor&rsquo;s Advocate (a motto you will see framed throughout the building, including in the Chairman&rsquo;s office).&nbsp;And you can expect us to remain laser focused on retail protection and market stability.&nbsp;But where we can remove restrictions that do not serve the common good, we are interested in doing so.</p>
<h3>Modernization</h3>
<p>We need to modernize our rulebook. Is that news to anyone here?</p>
<p>Many of our rules were well-intentioned when adopted, with underlying policy goals that often remain valid&mdash;but the requirements themselves have become outdated.</p>
<p>The Custody Rule &ndash; for example &ndash; clearly did not contemplate digital assets. While more thinking on this is needed, we were able to issue a no action letter hours before the shutdown related to advisers&rsquo; ability to custody client crypto assets with state-chartered trusts. We have more catch-up work to do here, but that is a good first step.</p>
<p>Our recordkeeping rule is an even better example. This rule was written in a time when communications were physical and manual. Think about a letter that might begin, &ldquo;Dear Mr. Smith, a company called Micro Software is coming to market soon. We believe we can secure an allocation of IPO shares for this newfangled computer company. If you&rsquo;re interested, please write back to us at the following address&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The world the recordkeeping rule was built for no longer exists.&nbsp;Today, we live in a digital, cloud-based, multi-platform environment. Yet the language of the rule still reflects a paper-based mindset. We&rsquo;ve even seen past regulatory missteps&mdash;ours and others&rsquo;&mdash;where we mandated specific technologies, like WORM (Write Once, Read Many) storage on CD-ROMs, only to watch the industry move on to more effective and flexible solutions.</p>
<p>So, across the advisory rulebook, if and when we recommend changes to the Commission, our goal will be to do so in a way that is platform-independent, technology-neutral, and future-ready. I would be very sad if someone is giving this same speech in 40 years because our recommendations to accommodate a digital world were not compatible with the quantum one that future Director is living in.</p>
<h3>Democratization</h3>
<p>As you all know, the arc of the trend toward the retailization of private markets has been observable for some time, but it became even more pronounced with the issuance of President Trump&rsquo;s Executive Order directing the Department of Labor to take steps to expand access to alternative investments within 401(k) retirement accounts. We are working closely with our colleagues at the Department of Labor to support their efforts in the context of ERISA plan options.</p>
<p>However, democratization options for retail investors using post-tax, pre-retirement dollars fall squarely in our purview.</p>
<p>But what does this look like? It does not necessarily mean a &ldquo;big bang&rdquo; &ldquo;Retailization Rule&rdquo; that suddenly transforms everything about how private funds are structured, marketed, and operated. Instead, the markets and investors may be better served by a thoughtful and incremental reconsideration of our existing regulatory framework across different access points, investment structures, and disclosure requirements.</p>
<p>Let me give you a concrete example: You may recall that the Chairman directed us to reconsider our practice of asking closed-end funds that invest in private funds to either ensure that their investors were &ldquo;accredited investors&rdquo; or to limit their exposure to private funds to a relatively small percentage of their net asset value.&nbsp;We did that and followed it with the publication of an Accounting and Disclosure Information bulletin (an &ldquo;ADI&rdquo;) intended to provide our high-level views to managers of closed-end and private funds navigating this less constrained retail environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But look at what we did&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;do. We did not respond with another prescriptive regulatory regime.&nbsp;We did&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;trade one set of restrictions for another based on an unproven worst-case scenario.&nbsp;We did not orchestrate a bunch of examinations and enforcement actions to establish&nbsp;<em>de facto</em>&nbsp;substantive limits that made sense to us.</p>
<p>We are not withdrawing from the field, but we are allowing you enough space to innovate.&nbsp;When the time is right for us to get involved on this topic, we will do so, but that time is not today.</p>
<p>I predict that you will see a lot of this from us: targeted actions, followed by additional staff engagement and observations.&nbsp;And I hope that when we look back three or four years from now, you will see a broader shift that was effected through a number of carefully considered, linked steps that collectively reflect the evolving nature of our markets and the needs of today&rsquo;s investors.</p>
<h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
<p>Another area of growing importance for our division&mdash;and for the broader financial ecosystem&mdash;is artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>We see AI as a transformative force in the investment management industry&mdash;one that we want to enable, support, and regulate thoughtfully. In this we are aligned with all three pillars of the Administration&rsquo;s AI Action Plan: Accelerating AI Innovation, Building American AI Infrastructure; and Leading in International AI Diplomacy and Security.</p>
<p>We are constantly thinking about how AI can transform disclosure and the investor experience.&nbsp;Some of your clients have received unsolicited calls from me personally, following up on some kind of article or announcement about a novel AI application and asking if your clients would be willing to share their experiences with our team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally, I think that AI can be a boon to effective disclosure.&nbsp;Imagine taking the traditional stack of mutual fund offering documents&mdash;hundreds of pages long, written in dense legal language&mdash;and pairing it with an investment adviser&rsquo;s proprietary AI Agent. Suddenly, you&rsquo;ve moved from a linear, text-heavy disclosure model to an interactive, personalized experience&mdash;one that reflects how people actually consume information today, in the age of iPhones, TikTok, and YouTube.</p>
<p>This shift&mdash;from 20th-century PDFs to 21st- and even 22nd-century AI interfaces&mdash;has the potential to revolutionize investor engagement. But it also raises important questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the AI Agent&rsquo;s output considered marketing material?</li>
<li>Is it investment advice?</li>
<li>When will the AI Agent itself need to be registered?</li>
<li>Who bears liability for bad advice &mdash; the adviser, the developer, or a third-party platform?</li>
</ul>
<p>We know that these are not hypothetical concerns. They are real regulatory questions that we want to actively explore with you.</p>
<p>The Chairman sometimes refers to the SEC as &ldquo;The Innovation Commission. &rdquo;That&rsquo;s real and we want to hear from you. Let&rsquo;s discuss what relief or guidance is needed to support your efforts.</p>
<p>If you want to innovate, this is the Commission that you have been waiting for.&nbsp;</p>

<title>FINRA Orders Securities America To Pay $2 Million In Restitution To Customers, Fines Firm $1 Million For Mutual Fund Supervision Failures - Firm Failed To Reasonably Supervise Recommendations That Customers Switch Between Mutual Fund Families Or Sell Class A Mutual Funds Shortly After Purchasing Them</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>FINRA&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/2025-12/securities-america-awc-2021069337301-20251203.pdf">has ordered Securities America, Inc. to pay $2 million in restitution to its customers and has fined the firm $1 million</a><a>&nbsp;</a>for failing to reasonably supervise Class A mutual fund recommendations, resulting in customers paying unnecessary fees through recommendations that were potentially unsuitable or not in customers&rsquo; best interest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Firms have a fundamental obligation to supervise their representatives&rsquo; recommendations and ensure they serve their customers&rsquo; best interests,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/about/bill-st-louis">Bill St. Louis, Executive Vice President and Head of Enforcement at FINRA</a>. &ldquo;When firms fail to supervise mutual fund recommendations, investors pay the price through unnecessary fees and charges. This $2 million in restitution will make affected customers whole, but prevention should always be the priority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Between January 2018 and June 2024, when it became part of Osaic Wealth, Inc., Securities America effected the purchase of approximately $3.8 billion in Class A mutual fund shares, which generated a substantial portion of the firm&rsquo;s revenue. Nonetheless, the firm failed to implement a system, including written policies and procedures, reasonably designed to supervise recommendations of Class A shares for compliance with FINRA&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/2111">Rule 2111</a>&nbsp;(Suitability) and Regulation Best Interest&rsquo;s Care Obligation. The Care Obligation requires broker-dealers and associated persons to exercise reasonable diligence, care and skill when making recommendations to retail customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Securities America&rsquo;s supervisory system was not reasonably designed to detect switches and short-term sales. Even when the firm identified such trades, the firm failed to reasonably review them to ensure that representatives had reasonably considered fees and commissions. As a result, the firm failed to reasonably supervise recommendations of more than 1,000 Class A mutual fund switches and more than 2,000 short-term sales that were potentially unsuitable or not in the customer&rsquo;s best interest. Collectively, these trades caused customers to pay $2,019,040 in commissions and fees, which will now be returned to them. This matter originated from a FINRA cycle examination.</p>
<p>Mutual funds offer different share classes, each with its own fee structure. Class A mutual fund shares typically collect a front-end sales charge when purchasing the fund, but this fee is typically waived when a customer exchanges a mutual fund for a new fund within the same fund family. Class C shares, by contrast, charge higher ongoing annual fees than Class A shares but typically have no upfront load.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a representative recommends switching from one fund family to another, the customer pays a new front-end sales charge on Class A shares&mdash;a cost that could be avoided by staying within the original fund family. Similarly, selling a Class A mutual fund shortly after buying it creates a risk that a customer has paid an upfront fee without holding the investment long enough to benefit from it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In settling this matter, Securities America consented to the entry of FINRA&rsquo;s findings, without admitting or denying the charges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FINRA makes available disciplinary actions and other information on its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/oversight-enforcement/finra-disciplinary-actions-online">Disciplinary Actions Online</a>&nbsp;database. In addition, FINRA publishes on its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/oversight-enforcement/disciplinary-actions">Monthly Disciplinary Actions</a>&nbsp;page a summary of disciplinary actions against firms and individuals for violations of FINRA rules; federal securities laws, rules and regulations; and the rules of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. FINRA&rsquo;s use of fine monies is limited to specific purposes set forth in its public&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/finra_financial_guiding_principles_0.pdf">Financial Guiding Principles</a>, which are approved by its Board of Governors. FINRA publicly&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/about/annual-reports">itemizes and discloses</a>&nbsp;how it uses fine monies each year.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>FESE has just released the&nbsp;<strong>enlarged edition</strong>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://fese.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=687918590e08f6261c02a932e&amp;id=5c7fd88cb0&amp;e=aa9592b626" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Listed Equity Database</a>&nbsp;(LED) for 2023 and 2024, a unique analysis which offers a detailed breakdown of all the new listings, delistings and total listed equity instruments for FESE Members during these years.</p>
<h3><strong><span>Key trends</span></strong></h3>
<p><strong>New listings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li> After a subdued performance in 2023 compared to 2022, the number of new listings increased slightly in 2024, particularly in regulated markets (RM) and SME-focused multilateral trading facilities (MTFs). </li>
<li> In 2024, growth of new listings was observed across industrials, real estate, technology, consumer discretionary and health care, whereas financials contracted and other sectors remained relatively stable compared to 2023. </li>
<li> The most common way of listing is through an IPO, followed by direct listings and private placements.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Delistings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li> In contrast, delistings increased on both RMs and MTF for SMEs in 2024 compared to the previous year. </li>
<li> In 2023 and 2024, going private remained the most common reason for delisting, followed by company wind-up.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Total listed companies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li> In 2024, Sweden was the country of incorporation for the largest number of listed companies, followed by Poland, France, Germany and Spain. </li>

<title>ISDA derivatiViews: Addressing Termination Troubles</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-derivativiews-addressing-termination-troubles-2025123/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-derivativiews-addressing-termination-troubles-2025123/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When Enron announced a shock $618 million loss on October 16, 2001, it took a further 47 days until it filed for bankruptcy. For Bear Stearns, it took 266 days between its bailout of a structured credit fund run by Bear Stearns Asset Management and an eventual bridging loan from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on March 14, 2008, and its sale to JP Morgan two days later. Compare that to Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), which collapsed on March 10, 2023, just two days after announcing a loss on the sale of securities and a plan to raise capital that prompted a devastatingly fast outflow of deposits. The SVB episode suggests that financial institution failures seem to be happening in an accelerated time frame, fueled by online banking and social media rumor &ndash; meaning counterparties need to be ready to move very quickly to terminate their derivatives trades if a counterparty gets into trouble.</p>
<p>Derivatives close outs have never been straightforward, but they&rsquo;ve become even more complicated in recent years with the introduction of bank resolution legislation that applies a temporary stay on terminations and the implementation of margin requirements for non-cleared derivatives, which set strict rules on the segregation of collateral. It means firms must understand what they need to do when, and who to involve from the legal, operations and trading teams. Given the accelerated timeline of recent failures, this is not something that can be navigated in real time &ndash; institutions need to have an established and well understood playbook they can draw on.</p>
<p>To help with this, ISDA published a&nbsp;<a href="https://close-out.isda.org/#/">close-out framework</a>&nbsp;last year that sets out key steps in the process, and outlines what actions counterparties need to take at what point. We&rsquo;ve also run a series of close-out seminars over the course of the year in London, New York, Singapore and Sydney, enabling small groups of people from different parts of a financial institution, as well as resolution authorities and other public sector representatives, to come together in a classroom environment and better understand the decisions that need to be made. Overall, 257 people have attended these seminars so far, hopefully enabling those firms to act quickly and decisively in the event the worst happens and a counterparty is heading for failure.</p>
<p>An early but vital part of the close-out process is the delivery of a termination notice &ndash; this sets the clock ticking on when an ISDA Master Agreement can be terminated and the underlying transactions valued. But this theoretically straightforward process has been hampered by the fact that firms can move offices without updating the contact details in their documentation, which must be used as the address for delivery. A further problem occurred during the pandemic, when offices were closed during lockdown, and again in Russia following its invasion of Ukraine, when it became difficult to deliver notices in a hostile environment. The reality is that even short delays in delivery can lead to ballooning risk exposures and costs running into the tens, if not the hundreds, of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>A solution to those particular problems now exists, thanks to the launch of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2025/07/16/isda-launches-notices-hub-and-protocol-to-streamline-delivery-and-receipt-of-critical-notices/">ISDA Notices Hub</a>&nbsp;earlier this year. The Notices Hub is an online platform that enables the rapid delivery and receipt of notices from anywhere in the world, with automatic alerts sent to the receiving entity, reducing the risk of unhedged exposures and potential losses from delivery delays. The Notices Hub also requires users to maintain current physical address details across all their agreements, which can be done via a single entry, creating an up-to-date golden source.</p>
<p>More than 145 buy- and sell-side entities, including 65% of global primary dealers and array of asset managers, pension and insurance companies and hedge funds, have now adhered to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/protocol/isda-2025-notices-hub-protocol/">ISDA 2025 Notices Hub Protocol</a>, which provides the legal framework to allow delivery of notices via the platform, demonstrating strong industry support for the service. If you&rsquo;re interested in adopting, you can contact the team here:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:NoticesHub@isda.org">NoticesHub@isda.org</a>.</p>
<p>Dealing with a termination has never been easy, but the speed with which a failure can occur today means firms need to act quickly, and that means preparation is critical.&nbsp;<a href="https://close-out.isda.org/#/">ISDA&rsquo;s close-out framework</a>, the close-out seminars and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/isda-solutions-infohub/isda-notices-hub/">ISDA Notices Hub</a>&nbsp;are intended to make that process a little easier.</p>
<p>ISDA will run a virtual series of close-out seminars in 2026. Watch out for further details here:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/events">https://www.isda.org/events</a></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today launched a public consultation on draft amendments to the Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on certain prudential requirements for central securities depositories (CSDs) and designated credit institutions offering &lsquo;banking-type ancillary services&rsquo;.</span>&nbsp;<span>The proposed amendments reflect changes introduced by the Central Securities Depositories Regulation (CSDR) Refit, notably allowing&nbsp; banking CSDs to provide banking-type ancillary services to other CSDs. This consultation runs until 3 March 2026.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The proposed updates to the RTS address cases where banking CSDs offer cash accounts directly to participants of other CSDs ( &ldquo;designating CSDs&rdquo;) for settling cash payments in currencies other than the one of where the designating CSD is established. The amendments focus on the limited impact of this arrangement on the risk profile of the banking CSD. The EBA is also updating the RTS to reflect recent changes in the Capital Requirements Regulation and to align references with the amended CSDR text where relevant.</p>
<h4>Consultation process</h4>
<p>Responses to the consultation can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the "send your comments" button on the consultation page. &nbsp;</p>
<p>All contributions will be published after the consultation closes, unless confidentiality is requested. The deadline for the submission of comments is 3 March 2026.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/public-hearing-draft-amending-rts-prudential-requirements-central-securities-depositories" title="Public hearing on draft amending RTS on prudential requirements for central securities depositories">public hearing</a>&nbsp;on this consultation will take place on 12 January 2026 from 14:00 to 15:00 CET. Deadline for registration is 9 January 2026 at 16:00 CET.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<p>The EBA has developed these draft RTS under Article 59(5) of CSDR, which mandates the Authority to further specify details of the frameworks and tools for the monitoring, measuring, management, reporting and public disclosure of the credit and liquidity risks, including those which occur intra-day.</p>
<p>CSDs need to be authorised to provide banking-type ancillary services, which include activities such as offering cash accounts to, and accepting deposits from, participants in a securities settlement system, and providing payment services involving cash and foreign exchange transactions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Speech</h2>
<p>It is such a pleasure to be with you today here in Newcastle. Big thanks to the North East Chamber of Commerce for hosting me.</p>
<p>I will talk about the critical link between financial stability and economic growth. And the important role the financial system plays in supporting innovation and productive finance. I&rsquo;ll be sharing the Financial Policy Committee&rsquo;s (FPC) latest recommendations &ndash; which we published just yesterday &ndash; on how the UK&rsquo;s financial sector can better support sustainable economic growth.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/december/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-womble-bond-dickinson#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>I lead the financial stability directorate at the Bank of England and serve as a member of the FPC. You might be wondering why someone from the Bank of England, whose primary objectives are monetary and financial stability, is speaking to you about growth &ndash; so let me explain.</p>
<h3>The role of financial stability in growth</h3>
<p>Financial stability is a means to an end, not an end in itself. The reason we care about it is that it is indispensable for economic welfare, of which long-term growth is an important aspect. And supporting economic welfare is the ultimate timeless mission of the Bank of England, as set out in our founding charter of 1694 and still in force to this day, which is to &ldquo;promote the good of the people of the United Kingdom&rdquo; by maintaining monetary and financial stability. Put simply, there cannot be sustainable growth over the medium-to-long term without financial stability.</p>
<p>Financial stability makes the UK an attractive place to do business for international investors. And it supports UK firms&rsquo; ability to compete abroad. Higher investment by businesses and saving by households increase the capital available for projects that improve productivity growth. Also a stable financial system supports lower risk and term premia. In turn that lowers the cost of borrowing and improves incentives to fund long-term productive investment.</p>
<p>All this contributes to a reliable and predictable economic environment, which provides companies, customers, and counterparties with reassurance that they can do business here safely and with confidence. These factors all facilitate the investment that drives long-term growth. And the benefits of a strong domestic financial system are even more pronounced when global risks and uncertainty are elevated. You can find more detail on the FPC&rsquo;s assessment of global risks in the Financial Stability Report (FSR) we published yesterday.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/december/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-womble-bond-dickinson#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[2]</a></sup>&nbsp;Against a backdrop of heightened global risks and fiscal pressures, a strong financial system becomes even more important since it can help the economy through turbulent times.</p>
<p>So those are the benefits of financial stability. The thing is when you have it you don&rsquo;t realise, people just take it for granted. But when you don&rsquo;t have it, everybody notices. And then as time goes by, memories fade and people tend to forget the costs of instability. The Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008 is a stark example of these costs. Financial crises don&rsquo;t just make us worse off in the moment. They leave deep scars on the growth potential of an economy. They tighten credit conditions, suppress investment, and distort capital allocation. The cost of the GFC was staggering, and there was a very persistent slowdown. It took 5 years for GDP to recover to its pre-crisis level. Crises disrupt essential financial services, reduce fiscal space, increase pressure on public finances, and cause significant economic hardship to many households &ndash; in ways that cast a very long shadow still lingering to this day. While pre-crisis growth may not have been fully sustainable, the scarring from the crisis played a major role in the weak growth that followed.</p>
<h3>The role of growth in financial stability</h3>
<p>We can all agree that financial instability is best avoided!</p>
<p>But conversely, equally important is the role that growth plays in supporting financial stability. Strong economic performance supports corporate earnings, employment and investment, and government finances. All of this makes actors in the real economy more resilient. And in turn low loss rates on banks&rsquo; books support their capacity to lend further to households and businesses. Conversely, evidence suggests that persistently weak economic demand may create an environment that pressures financial firms to take more risks than they would otherwise deem reasonable or sustainable, as they seek to increase returns on investment. Sometimes responding to short-term investor pressure by &ldquo;picking up pennies in front of a steamroller&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Productivity is a crucial driver of economic growth. But over the past 15 years, productivity growth in the UK had been low by historical standards and relative to some other advanced economies. Between 1997 and 2002 UK growth in GDP per hour worked averaged 3%. Between 2003 and 2007 it was 1.6%. Between 2010 and 2019 it dropped to 0.6%. And between 2020 and 2023 it hovered around 0.9%.</p>
<p>Not great.</p>
<p>The benefits of higher productivity are wide-ranging. As firms become more productive, they can expand operations, enlarge their revenue base, undertake more investment, innovate, and employ people. Improvements in overall productivity growth can also ease fiscal pressures and in turn support the resilience of government bond markets. For example, participants in these markets, many of which are increasingly prepared to dip in and out of positions, watch economic growth projections closely to judge how much they (as investors) are willing to charge governments to borrow. In turn, the cost of government borrowing affects the costs and availability of borrowing for households and businesses, and their ability to access financial services.</p>
<p>So improving productivity in the UK is essential to support economic growth, and in turn financial stability. Because it ultimately supports the resilience of systemic markets, of households, and of businesses.</p>
<h3>The financial sector&rsquo;s role</h3>
<p>Productivity growth is determined by a very broad range of factors beyond finance, such as trade conditions, scientific and technological innovation, and human capital. But the financial sector also has an important role to play. It provides services to UK households and businesses &ndash; such as lending, saving, insurance, and payments &ndash; that enable transactions, risk management, and investment. In particular, the sector provides financing solutions for investment in capital and technology that underpin innovation, technological progress, and in turn productivity improvements.</p>
<p>When these services are disrupted, for example due to frictions in the system &ndash; &lsquo;sand in the gears&rsquo; &ndash; the financial system will not be fulfilling its role of serving households and businesses as efficiently as it should. This will get in the way of productivity improvements, hold back economic growth, and ultimately be unhelpful for financial stability.</p>
<h3>The role of the FPC</h3>
<p>Given the importance of the financial system for both stability and growth, what is the FPC&rsquo;s role?</p>
<p>Our goal is to ensure that the financial system provides vital services to households and businesses in all circumstances, both good times and bad. The most important thing we can do to support growth is to ensure financial stability.</p>
<p>One way we do this is by identifying, monitoring, and addressing systemic risks. By that we mean the risks that affect the functioning of the financial system as a whole, not just individual institutions. Just as you would purchase insurance to protect your home or business from unexpected shocks, the FPC works to ensure the system as a whole has the resilience needed to withstand stress and help the economy through it.</p>
<p>For example, we run stress tests and exploratory scenario exercises to ensure banks, insurers, and key markets can withstand shocks and self-stabilise without cutting lending or amplifying stress. Our latest bank capital stress test results show that banks continue to be strong enough to do that.</p>
<p>Actions taken since the Global Financial Crisis have significantly strengthened system-wide resilience. Despite multiple shocks in recent years, UK households and corporates have been resilient so far, and the financial system has been able to continue to lend and support them during these shocks. Let me bring this to life with a couple of examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>About half of owner-occupied mortgages currently in arrears were originated before the 2008 crisis, when today&rsquo;s regulations and standards were not in place. And the yearly average number of repossessions &ndash; so people losing their homes &ndash; between 2014, when measures to control the sustainability of lending in the housing market were implemented, and 2019 were 76% lower than over the preceding 26 years.</li>
<li>During the Covid-19 pandemic, lenders offered mortgage payment holidays for up to six months. Take up of that offer peaked at nearly 1.9 million households. It&rsquo;s only because banks had become strong enough that they could afford to do that.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also review our measures and policies to build resilience to ensure they remain effective and proportionate as the financial system evolves. So that we achieve the optimal amount of resilience at minimum cost. Recent steps include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reducing the frequency of our main bank capital stress tests to every other year, thereby reducing the burden on banks considerably.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/december/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-womble-bond-dickinson#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[3]</a></sup></li>
<li>Recommending amendments to the implementation of the FPC&rsquo;s loan-to-income (LTI) flow limit to allow flexibility for individual mortgage lenders to increase their share of lending at high LTIs while ensuring the aggregate flow remains consistent with the limit of 15%.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/december/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-womble-bond-dickinson#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[4]</a></sup></li>
<li>Updating our assessment of optimal bank capital requirements. We have just cut our key benchmark for the appropriate overall level of bank Tier 1 capital requirements from 14% to 13% of risk-weighted assets. Because some banks are now less systemically important, balance sheets have changed, and risk measurement has improved (including as we implement the international bank capital standard, Basel 3.1). And we&rsquo;ll be actively considering feedback we&rsquo;ve received on interactions, proportionality, and complexity in several areas of the capital framework, including on buffer usability, the implementation of the leverage ratio, and considering how capital requirements&nbsp;related to domestic exposures interact.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/december/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-womble-bond-dickinson#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[5]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond building resilience in times of stress, the FPC is also concerned with frictions in normal times. The sand in the gears that gets in the way of the efficient flow of financial services. Frictions can be regulatory or structural factors that make it harder than it should be for firms to provide or receive credit or services. Our goal is not only to prevent disruption during shocks but also to ensure the system can allocate resources and share risks efficiently in good times.</p>
<h3>The Chancellor&rsquo;s remit letter</h3>
<p>A year ago, with the FPC&rsquo;s objectives in mind, the Chancellor of the Exchequer asked the FPC to evaluate in 2025 where the financial sector could better contribute to sustainable economic growth, without undermining financial stability.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/december/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-womble-bond-dickinson#footnote-7" id="footnote-ref-7"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>The FPC agreed that its work on growth in 2025 would focus on identifying barriers to the provision of credit and financial services to households and businesses. In particular, to companies with the greatest potential to contribute to improvements in the country&rsquo;s productivity growth. And we considered solutions to these challenges &ndash; what can be done to grease the wheels.</p>
<p>To identify these barriers and solutions, we engaged &ndash; in collaboration with the government &ndash; with over 50 financial sector, government, and academic groups to further understand the challenges that high-growth<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/december/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-womble-bond-dickinson#footnote-8" id="footnote-ref-8"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[7]</a></sup>&nbsp;firms may face in contributing to sustainable growth. We also conducted a deep dive into the existing literature to understand the financing barriers that these firms face.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/december/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-womble-bond-dickinson#footnote-9" id="footnote-ref-9"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[8]</a></sup>&nbsp;Personally, I have found my regional visits to businesses across the country, including via the local contacts of our agency networks, particularly insightful in really getting to the bottom of those challenges, and to generate ideas to address them. The engagement from businesses has been terrific, and we&rsquo;re very grateful for it.</p>
<p>Through this work, we agreed on three priority areas. We selected these as they are directly related to the FPC's remit: as we went through the range of frictions and barriers in the provision of vital services and credit to the real economy, we judged these three to be particularly material:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Barriers faced by pension funds and insurers in supporting long-term capital investment</span>&nbsp;in the UK economy. We chose this because investment by insurers and pension funds can provide stable sources of capital that are needed to improve the infrastructure that supports wider economic activity, the development of new technologies, and the expansion of the most productive firms.</li>
<li><span>Challenges for high-growth firms</span>&nbsp;in accessing finance as funding rounds scale up. That is because these firms make an outsize contribution to employment and growth, to innovation, and to the deployment of new technologies and business models.</li>
<li><span>The responsible adoption of innovative technology across the financial sector</span>. We have focused on this because responsible adoption of innovative technology &ndash; such as artificial intelligence (AI) and distributed ledger technologies (DLT) &ndash; has the potential to reshape productivity growth by bringing significantly greater efficiencies and harnessing new technological developments.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let me now outline some of the frictions or barriers in these areas, and our recommendations going forward.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/december/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-womble-bond-dickinson#footnote-10" id="footnote-ref-10"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[9]</a></sup></p>
<h3>Recommendations</h3>
<p>So, what do we recommend - and why?</p>
<p><span>Investment of long-term capital into assets which increase the productive capacity of the economy, including to high-growth firms.</span></p>
<h4>Challenge</h4>
<p>There is growing need in the UK for more long-term investment capital to tackle challenges like climate change, infrastructure improvement, the development of innovation, and the deployment of new technology. More investment from insurers and pension funds &ndash; who are natural long-term investors &ndash; would give businesses stable funding while offering better asset returns.</p>
<p>Yet, compared to their international peers, UK insurers and pension funds invest relatively little in UK productive assets such as infrastructure, property, and private equity &ndash; who themselves are key investors in larger high-growth firms. Let&rsquo;s take investment in private equity firms as an example. They are key providers of &lsquo;patient&rsquo; long term investment capital that has the potential to benefit long-run economic growth.&nbsp;Indeed, there&rsquo;s much international evidence that suggests businesses financed via private markets, including private equity, demonstrate higher levels of productivity, with investment increasing after private market involvement. But analysis by New Financial and the Purposeful Company shows that pension funds in Canada, Finland, the US, Taiwan, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Denmark, South Korea, and Australia allocate a greater proportion of assets to private equity than UK pension funds. UK funds allocate 6% to private equity, for Canada it is over 20%. The synergy between pension funds or insurers and private equity makes sense intuitively, although it needs to be exploited safely, as discussed in our FSRs. And finally in terms of international comparison, research shows that just 22% of UK workplace DC pension assets are invested domestically, compared to 44% in New Zealand and 55% in Australia.</p>
<p>A key barrier to additional investment into assets that support productivity is that UK defined contribution pension funds are often small and lack scale, limiting their ability to invest in riskier, higher-return assets. This preference for safer assets limits their ability to make long-term investments in the UK economy. Insurers also report that there are few domestic opportunities that align with their expertise and meet their risk and return requirements.</p>
<h4>Solutions</h4>
<p>One way to address these challenges is to make defined contribution (DC) pension funds larger and more sophisticated, which would help reduce costs. The Government&rsquo;s Pension Schemes Bill supports this by encouraging consolidation, merging smaller DC schemes into larger, better-managed funds. DC pension products could also be redesigned to reduce the need for daily liquidity requirements and enable greater pooling of risk through fund-of-funds or securitisation. All this enhances pension funds&rsquo; investment firepower by removing the cost inefficiencies that come with fragmentation.</p>
<p>Raising awareness among pension funds and insurers about the opportunities in venture and growth finance &ndash; including the role of public-private partnerships &ndash; could also unlock new investment. Finally, further research to understand behavioural and regulatory barriers that prevent domestic capital from flowing into high-growth firms can help ensure obstacles are addressed effectively.</p>
<p>Regulatory changes are supporting UK insurers to innovate in their investments. In the view of the insurance industry, Solvency UK reforms should support delivery of the UK insurance industry&rsquo;s commitment to invest&nbsp;at least &pound;100 billion in UK productive assets over the next decade.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/december/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-womble-bond-dickinson#footnote-11" id="footnote-ref-11"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[10]</a></sup>&nbsp;It is important that this happens. Success depends on the decisions of pension funds and insurers themselves, their investment management policies, and the availability of appropriate investment opportunities.</p>
<p>Further work is likely required to encourage the allocation of pension and insurer assets to high-growth firms. Collaboration between public and private sectors will be needed to identify barriers to that, and to develop solutions that channel investments from defined contributions pension schemes or insurers to funding vehicles for high-growth firms.</p>
<p>And we should ask ourselves the same questions about other investment opportunities which also appear to be natural matches between long-term economic priorities and the long-term focus of insurance and pension funds. For example, in the housing market, housing associations play an important role in unlocking the building of new homes &ndash; which itself has a bearing on house prices and therefore first-time buyers&rsquo; ability to access the mortgage market. A common theme we hear through our regional visits is that delays in building new homes have often been caused by lack of demand from housing associations in funding the social housing part of new buildings. Is this due to a lack of available funding, and is there a natural match between the long-term focus of insurance and pensions funds and the significant long-term investment need (followed by steady income stream) that characterises housing associations? Could any frictions or inefficiencies here be removed?</p>
<h4>The supply of debt or equity finance to high-growth firms including start-ups and scale-ups.</h4>
<h4>Challenge</h4>
<p>Let me now turn to the second area where we are highlighting frictions, which is financing for high-growth firms. When we speak with them, we hear a number of issues.</p>
<p>First, they face growing challenges in accessing domestic finance as funding rounds get larger, especially from domestic sources. While the UK has the third-largest venture capital (VC) market in the world and a growing venture debt market, the level of venture investment per capital lags behind peers. Research by the British Business Bank (BBB) finds that UK VC investment is around 0.7% of GDP, around 10% less than in the US over 2022-24 on a relative basis.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/december/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-womble-bond-dickinson#footnote-12" id="footnote-ref-12"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>These challenges are compounded by the fragmentation of the UK&rsquo;s funding ecosystem. There are multiple agencies and schemes, creating a complex, inefficient landscape that SMEs and high-growth firms struggle to navigate.</p>
<p>And whilst a number of banks have their start-up units, in practice locally SMEs often tell us that there simply isn&rsquo;t a banker for them to talk to. With the closures of bank branches, financing has moved more online and away from traditional relationship methods of local businesses having a local banker whom they view as a long-term partner who knows their business really well. In addition, traditional bank lending can also be less well suited to high-growth firms because, although these firms are either growing rapidly or have the potential to grow rapidly, they have a limited trading history, they are not yet consistently profitable, and they have low levels of the type of collateral that banks would traditionally require as security against the loans.</p>
<p>Many high-growth firms face difficulties in finding assets that lenders want as collateral on which to secure lending.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/december/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-womble-bond-dickinson#footnote-13" id="footnote-ref-13"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[12]</a></sup>&nbsp;The assets that they often do have, for example intellectual property, are not commonly accepted as collateral due to valuation difficulties, the lack of standardised frameworks for assessing IP risk, and recovery constraints that banks face in case of default.</p>
<p>Likewise, at the other end, financing firms find it hard to identify the right businesses to invest in. When we speak with private equity firms, we hear a clear appetite to invest in the UK &ndash; there is obviously capital ready to be deployed. However, many private equity firms struggle to identify effective ways to ensure funds are directed to the right opportunities.</p>
<h4>Solutions</h4>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t a single solution to these challenges. But we highlight several things that could help the financial sector provide the breadth and depth of services that high-growth firms require.</p>
<p>One solution may be greater use of public-private partnership funding initiatives to channel financing to SMEs in support of productivity improvements. We can learn from international experience here: Germany&rsquo;s KfW, provides long-term financing and co-investment to support SMEs and innovation, while U.S. programs, run by the Small Business Administration and the State Small Business Credit Initiative, offer loan guarantees and channel private capital into venture and growth funds. The British Business Bank could build on these international experiences and play an important role in this context, as could the private equity industry. Public-private partnerships are powerful because they share the load and give private investors the confidence to take on bold, long-term projects that they might otherwise shy away from in the absence of the public sector&rsquo;s involvement and endorsement.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you can detect a theme here, as solutions to support financing for high-growth firms also bear similarities with those required to support pension funds and insurers in channelling domestic capital towards long-term domestic investment &ndash; which I mentioned previously.</p>
<p>There is also space for additional research and policy work on barriers facing high-growth firms in accessing finance. This includes work to better understand impediments to lending backed by intellectual property (IP), such as a lack of information to value and assess an IP&rsquo;s value as collateral that will be increasingly needed as the intangible knowledge economy becomes an even more important part of UK growth. An important government initiative in this space is a working group exploring how best to support lending to IP-rich sectors.</p>
<p>The Bank is also working with the Treasury to explore how the ring-fencing regime could be further reformed to allow ring-fenced banks to provide more products and services to UK businesses.</p>
<p>I would also note the relevance here of the announcement in the Autumn 2025 Budget published last week of a new objective for the British Business Bank to mobilise institutional capital at scale, and of a package of measures to support entrepreneurship.</p>
<h4>Supporting the responsible adoption of innovative technology by the financial sector.</h4>
<h4>Challenge</h4>
<p>Finally, the responsible adoption of innovative technology in the financial sector is the third area where we are highlighting frictions. In particular two key challenges:</p>
<p>First, the high cost of cyber-resilience. Tech-heavy firms, especially fintechs, face significant costs in protecting themselves against cyber threats. Rising geopolitical tensions and rapid technological advances increase the risk of operational disruptions. Many cyber-attacks have targeted third-party suppliers of larger corporates as a way of penetrating their clients&rsquo; systems. As such a potential point of entry for these attacks, it is therefore important that suppliers themselves &ndash; a number of which can be fintechs &ndash; have robust cyber-defences in place. The costs and risks from cyber-attacks are particularly high for firms that rely on technology as their core business. But the costs and resources required for cyber-defence can prove a real financial and operational headwind for the profitability of small fintechs looking to grow.</p>
<p>The second key friction we highlight in relation to the adoption of innovative technology in the UK&rsquo;s economy is the need for a modernised UK payment infrastructure. Expensive payment systems are a significant barrier. The UK needs faster, seamless, frictionless, and secure payments to support economic activity. This requires coordinated action and investment to build next-generation infrastructure that drives innovation, competition, and security.</p>
<h4>Solutions</h4>
<p>Because cyber and innovation risks are complex and evolving, solutions require joint efforts between the financial sector and public authorities. Possible actions include publishing and signposting further information on cyber threats, issuing guidance targeting fintechs looking to build cyber resilience, helping them navigate through what they&rsquo;ve got to do, pointing them to the right resources, and creating innovation sandboxes to test new digital business models.</p>
<p>Important initiatives in this respect include the National Cyber Security Centre&rsquo;s work to provide advice and guidance on cyber security for SMEs, and the work of the Cross-Market Operational Resilience Group (CMORG) to develop solutions and share knowledge within the financial sector. Targeted and signposted advice and guidance for fintechs on cyber-defence would be a valuable next step for public and industry bodies.</p>
<p>The Bank is also working with UK authorities and industry to deliver innovation in money and payments through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supporting the government&rsquo;s National Payments Vision, chairing the newly established Retail Payments Infrastructure Board and expanding Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS).</li>
<li>Delivering practical advancements in the UK&rsquo;s payments infrastructure by launching the Digital Pound Lab and DLT innovation challenge.</li>
<li>Facilitating the development and adoption of new forms of digital money. This includes the development with the FCA of a regulatory regime for stablecoins. And working closely with the industry as banks develop proposals for the tokenisation of deposits. Because it offers the advantages of distributed ledger technology as well as the benefits of traditional forms of money such as the deposit insurance provided by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. Tokenised deposits offer programmability, instant settlement, and customer familiarity.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>So let me wrap up here. Growth and financial stability go hand in hand. The most important contribution the FPC can make to growth is to ensure a stable financial system. In addition, we work to implement efficiently the measures that build resilience to shocks as the financial system evolves, by reducing unnecessary regulatory burdens. And on top of that, the FPC also targets frictions that limit the efficient flow of financial services in normal times.</p>
<p>It is our job to worry. But we worry not only about risks and the impact of shocks in bad times but also about not enough risk being taken in good times.</p>
<p>This year, drawing on external engagement and research, the FPC has focused on understanding impediments and identifying opportunities for the UK financial services sector to further support sustainable economic growth.</p>
<p>Given the importance of productivity improvements for growth and in turn financial stability, we focused specifically on frictions in the system that hinder the provision of financial services to areas of the economy that are key to productivity growth: investment in long-term capital from pension funds and insurers; the financing of high-growth firms; and the responsible adoption of innovative technology.</p>
<p>The Bank of England will continue to build on this work, including by monitoring the progress against the issues identified, considering further actions that could support the supply of long-term productive finance, and delivering research on growth as part of its future research agenda.</p>
<p>The public and private sectors, as well as the academic world, all have an important role to play in working with businesses to bring to life solutions to these barriers. These solutions are within reach, and in aggregate they would help the financial sector contribute to unlock a meaningful share of the untapped potential in the UK&rsquo;s economy.</p>

<title>Vienna Stock Exchange - Stock Market Taboo 2025: The "Tariff Hammer" Has Struck</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/vienna-stock-exchange-stock-market-taboo-2025-the-tariff-hammer-has-struck-2025123/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/vienna-stock-exchange-stock-market-taboo-2025-the-tariff-hammer-has-struck-2025123/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The stock market taboo word of 2025 has been crowned: the "tariff hammer" has hit the mood of the financial community. Threats or the actual implementation of import duties, counter-tariffs and protectionist measures have caused great volatility on markets worldwide this year. The ongoing uncertainty and heavy media coverage of the issue may have been too much for domestic investors. At the same time, trade barriers run counter to the basic understanding of many stock market participants, who favour open markets and free trade.</p>
<p>"Despite the supposed tariff hammer, many international indices are at record levels, including the ATX. I consider it positive that many investors are not letting themselves be unsettled and have confidence in long-term global economic growth. Equities enable anyone to participate", says Christoph Boschan, CEO of Wiener B&ouml;rse AG.</p>
<h2>About the stock market taboo word</h2>
<p>Since 2017, the Vienna Stock Exchange has asked the domestic financial community to nominate the stock market taboo word of the year. The jury's decision is based primarily on topicality, relevance and linguistics. The "tariff hammer" is the first stock market taboo word to win the title for the second time from a thematic perspective: In 2018, during Donald Trump's first term as US president, "punitive tariffs" secured the title of stock market taboo word of the year. "Tariff hammer" follows on from last year's winner, "AI bubble". Other stock market taboos to date:</p>
<ul class="list-normal">
<li>2023: "Stagflation"</li>
<li>2022: "Excess profits tax"</li>
<li>2021: "Specter of inflation"</li>
<li>2020: "Corona-related"</li>
<li>2019: "Brexit"</li>
<li>2018: "Punitive tariffs"</li>
<li>2017: "Negative interest rates"</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li><i>Fiserv Small Business Index at 142</i></li>
<li><i style="font-family: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">Year-over-year sales grew +0.8%</i></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.fiserv.com/" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Fiserv, Inc.</a>&nbsp;(NASDAQ: FISV), a leading global provider of payments and financial services technology, has published the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fiserv.com/en/fiserv-small-business-index.html" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Fiserv Small Business Index</a>&nbsp;for November 2025, with the seasonally adjusted Index dropping a point to 142.</p>
<p>Year-over-year sales in November (+0.8%) grew slightly despite transactions (-0.7%) declining compared to 2024. Month-over-month sales (-0.6%) and transactions (-0.7%) both declined. Average ticket sizes rose (+1.5%) compared to November 2024.</p>
<p>In an otherwise slow month for growth, a strong Black Friday helped buoy small business sales &ndash; with both restaurants and retailers benefitting during the popular shopping holiday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the holiday shopping season in full swing, consumers continue to be pragmatic in their spending &ndash; opting for lower-cost options, and prioritizing the essentials over discretionary items,&rdquo; said Prasanna Dhore, Chief Data Officer, Fiserv.</p>
<p><span>Key Takeaways</span></p>
<p><span>Thanksgiving and Black Friday Boost Holiday Sales</span></p>
<p>Small business holiday sales showed solid early gains during the long Thanksgiving weekend, but lost momentum following a strong Black Friday. Thanksgiving Day saw Core Retail (which excludes volatile categories like Gasoline) sales increase (+3.9%), which helped lift overall Retail (+1.9%). Black Friday maintained strong growth across Core Retail (+3.1%) and Restaurants (+2.9%). However, Retail momentum slowed over the weekend, with small business sales falling (-2.1%) on Saturday.</p>
<p><span>Increased Foot Traffic Offsets Lower Average Tickets at Retail</span></p>
<p>Seasonally adjusted Retail sales were down (-1.1%) year over year in November, despite a +1.1% jump in foot traffic. The decline in growth was driven by a significant decrease in average ticket size (-2.3%). Compared to October, sales were down -1.4%, a result of lower foot traffic (-0.8%) and lower average ticket sizes (-0.7%). The only retail categories showing annual sales growth were General Merchandise and Sporting Goods (+2.3% and +3.3%, respectively).</p>
<p><span>Diners Continue to Seek Low-cost Options</span></p>
<p>Small business restaurant sales in November were nearly flat (-0.1%) year over year and compared to October (-0.1%). Year-over-year foot traffic fell (-1.7%) while average tickets grew (+1.6%). Compared to October, foot traffic declined (-0.7%) as average tickets nudged higher (+0.6%). Limited-Service restaurants (+0.4%) continued to outperform Full-Service establishments (-0.7%) on an annual basis.</p>
<p><span>Spending on Essentials Continues to Outperform Discretionary</span></p>
<p>Discretionary sales growth was muted (-0.1%) while spending on Essentials grew (+2.1%) year over year. Total Goods sales declined (-0.5%) year over year while Services grew (+1.4%).</p>

<title>NGX Expands Market Offerings With Introduction Of Commercial Paper Listings</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ngx-expands-market-offerings-with-introduction-of-commercial-paper-listings-2025123/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) has introduced Commercial Paper (CP) listings, following approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission, marking another significant expansion of its product suite in a year defined by accelerated innovation. This development deepens Nigeria&rsquo;s short-term debt market and reinforces NGX&rsquo;s role as a versatile hub for capital formation.<br />&nbsp;<br />The new listing window enables corporates and issuers to list and trade both conventional and non-interest commercial papers directly on the Exchange, providing investors with enhanced visibility, increased transparency and improved liquidity. It also advances NGX&rsquo;s broader strategy of diversifying its offerings and strengthening the architecture of the domestic capital market.</p>
<p>Commenting on the launch, Temi Popoola, Group Managing Director and CEO of NGX Group, commended the Securities and Exchange Commission for its commitment to enabling market advancement and fostering healthy competition across the ecosystem. He stated: &ldquo;The introduction of Commercial Paper listings is a pivotal step in our strategy to position NGX as a comprehensive capital-markets infrastructure that accelerates capital formation across Africa. As we continue strengthening the foundations of a transparent, technology-driven and inclusive marketplace, our focus remains on building a system that supports sustainable growth, enhances market resilience and unlocks new opportunities for the broader economy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Commercial Papers (CPs) are short-term, unsecured debt instruments issued by corporates to finance working capital needs and other short-term obligations. Typically maturing within 270 days, CPs are issued at a discount and redeemed at face value upon maturity offering corporates a cost-effective alternative to bank loans and providing investors with attractive short-term investment opportunities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also speaking on the development, Jude Chiemeka, CEO, Nigerian Exchange Limited, stated: &ldquo;The introduction of Commercial Paper listings represents a major advancement in our mission to provide a full spectrum of capital-raising solutions for businesses. This platform enhances transparency in the debt market and supports corporates seeking efficient access to funding outside traditional banking channels, while offering investors credible short-term investment options. NGX will continue to engage with corporates, intermediaries, and investors to deepen liquidity and participation in Nigeria&rsquo;s debt capital market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Olufemi Shobanjo, CEO of NGX Regulation Limited, added that strong oversight will remain central as the market evolves. &ldquo;Our priority is to maintain high standards of disclosure, promote accountability and safeguard investor confidence while contributing to market deepening,&rdquo; he emphasised.<br />&nbsp;<br />With the inclusion of commercial papers, NGX now offers an integrated environment spanning equities, fixed income, ETFs, derivatives and short-term debt advancing its ambition to be a one-stop marketplace for capital across asset classes.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="hero-paragraph"><span class="hero">In this speech, Phil Evans focuses on the UK&rsquo;s upcoming implementation of the market risk element of Basel 3.1. He reviews the UK&rsquo;s stated goals for this work, and also looks forward to areas for the Prudential Regulation Authority to review in the future.</span></div>

<h2>Speech</h2>
<p>Many thanks for having me along. It is great to be here at ISDA. I&rsquo;ll cover three broad things on Basel 3.1 today. First, where do we stand in our implementation in the UK. Second, a reminder of what we&rsquo;re trying to achieve with the new FRTB rules. And third, something on the areas in FRTB where we might need to look a little closer in due course. I&rsquo;ll finish by broadening a little and looking beyond FRTB, although many would say there is nothing else in life.</p>
<p>First, on where things stand. Basel 3.1 remains a key part of the post crisis reforms. Risk measurement, fundamentally, needs to be accurate. And we had lost confidence in this post GFC, including because of the variability across firms in risk weights that comes from using modelled approaches. That concern speaks to getting Basel 3.1 done as soon as possible.</p>
<p>But if Basel 3.1 feels to you like the project that comes quite close to never ending, believe me when I say that &lsquo;I sympathize&rsquo;. It is in everyone&rsquo;s interests now that its implementation is finished as soon as possible, so that we can all move on, with the benefits of the new regime safely tucked away. We have the vast majority of our rules in the UK entering force in January 2027, and for those there will not be any further substantive changes to what we have already published. For those, firms should be preparing now.</p>
<p>They will adopt legal force when the Treasury makes the SI that allows us to finalise those rules, and we will publish the final rules in Q1 next year. That will give firms a year to prepare before they need to report to us on the new regime, and allow us to undertake the necessary Pillar 2a reset that we promised, to make the Basel 3.1 approach complete and avoid any double counting with the more accurate risk weights generated by Pillar 1. As I&rsquo;ve said a few times now, this approach to avoiding double counting has been a fundamental principle for us since the start on Basel 3.1, with no need to hold capital twice against the same risk.</p>
<p>The only part of the regime in our proposals entering force after January 2027 is the modelled part of the market risk rules &ndash; the FRTB &ndash; which enters force in January 2028. That is to allow us to finalise those in light of any developments in other jurisdictions, including the US and the EU. The FRTB applies to truly global and cross border business, and so there is real value in having consistency across major jurisdictions. My sense is that both the US and EU are making good progress in their plans.</p>
<p>That brings me to my second topic of the FRTB and why we have it. The big point is FRTB was called fundamental for a reason. I would argue there were three main GFC related issues it was trying to fix:</p>
<ol>
<li>There was a trading book / banking book boundary which was too subjective, leaving the door open to an uneven treatment across firms and for risks to end up in a part of the capital framework that isn&rsquo;t designed to deal with them. That has been addressed in the FRTB with a much clearer boundary.</li>
<li>The existing internal model approach missed important risks, for example the different levels of liquidity of trading book positions, and was a bit of a smashing together of elements that have been added to the rulebook over time as and when we spotted gaps in the framework. This has been made more coherent now in the FRTB.</li>
<li>There was not a standardised approach that acts as a risk sensitive alternative to modelling, meaning big banks had little choice but to use models. And that means supervisors couldn&rsquo;t realistically challenge firms, and ultimately stop firms from using modelled approaches, even if the models weren&rsquo;t performing well. The FRTB greatly improves the standardised approach.</li>
</ol>
<p>So we wanted to fix those issues by having a better-defined boundary between the trading book and the banking book, have a new standardised approach that proves to be a credible alternative to modelling, and having built a credible SA, set a firmer and higher bar for modelling to improve standards. This includes recognising that some risks can&rsquo;t be modelled well and therefore need capital add-ons. That, of course, is an approach we have been taking with UK firms for some time now, and so is not a particularly new element for the UK, and less of a big change here.</p>
<p>All of this adds up to being an important shift. A key goal &ndash; implicit in the new framework &ndash; is that modelling should be perfectly achievable for good models, but banks should not just assume they can always use models regardless of whether those models are good, and up to scratch.</p>
<p>That brings me to my third topic of how well does the FRTB measure up to those aims?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a little difficult to fully explore this given it isn&rsquo;t in force yet. But firms do know the direction of travel, and have been working on preparing, which does give us some information.</p>
<p>But perhaps the place to start with this topic is a brief description of how we got to where we are today. Post GFC, we had identified a range of high-level issues, as I&rsquo;ve just described, that needed fixing. The Basel Committee set the appropriate working group, chaired by my excellent colleague Derek Nesbitt, to work in identifying fixes. Perhaps more so than in other parts of the rulebook, it appears quite possible in the market risk world to be able to identify changes and fixes that look good on paper and should work well, but generate a different outcome in practice. The early efforts of this Basel group were criticised for being misplaced in practice by industry, so Derek&rsquo;s group made very extensive use of industry expertise in designing the new rules. Meaning that the new FRTB had a very heavy dose of industry input in its design, and industry wisdom.</p>
<p>So it should work well. But as I said, what works on paper, even when designed with industry input, is not guaranteed to be perfect in practice, as annoying as that is.</p>
<p>What do early preparations of firms tell us how well the FRTB achieves the aims I outlined earlier. Well, I think the two of the aims are broadly in good shape. We do have a much better defined and clearer boundary established, and the new standardized approaches are more risk sensitive.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the other aim around modelling where some questions seem to be lingering.</p>
<p>To be clear, the aims for the modelling component &ndash; the new IMA &ndash; are good. And many of the most significant improvements, such as moving to a single, new type of model for the market risk component, and the improved way that liquidity is incorporated into it, seem to work well. But the question that is emerging for a small number of parts of the framework, such as the P&amp;L Attribution Test, is have we put the bar for modelling at the right level and is it too complex? As I&rsquo;ve already argued, despite much of the design of the IMA reflecting firms feedback as the standard was re-worked, that in and of itself is not a guarantee that it will work well in practice. In truth, as is often the case with changes that look good on paper, it needs some data and in practice experience to really assess that.</p>
<p>And there, the struggle has been to get good quality and convincing data. The good news is that is now starting to come through, as firms invest in getting models ready. This investment in getting ready is important, so that we can understand what can be fixed just by a bit of persistence, and what might need to be fixed through possible changes. Meaning it is looking easier to check whether the bar is where we had intended it to be.</p>
<p>And its for that reason that, in the early part of the Summer, we announced we would be implementing our entire Basel 3.1 package in January 2027, as previously announced, but we consulted on postponing the IMA modelled approach until January 2028. In the meantime, the idea is that firms can stay on their current market risk models. This would also allow time for greater clarity to emerge in other jurisdictions on their own implementation in this area as well, as consistency really matters. We will publish our final approach on that consultation with the rest of the final package in Q1 next year, meaning that we are on track for our January 2027 implementation date for the main package.</p>
<p>As with all of our Basel 3.1 package, we have tried to write the FRTB rules in as clear a way as we can. But there is no avoiding that they are quite involved. And no matter how clearly we try and write the rules, there will be aspects that firms want to clarify with us. By this, I don&rsquo;t mean re-opening. We need a strong focus on getting the package across the line now, rather than continually re-opening. But clarifying is a distinct and very legitimate need. To accommodate this, in the PRA we&rsquo;ve launched a new series of Banking Policy Roundtables. There are three per year, rotating the organization of them across UK finance, ISDA/AFME, and the building societies association. These particular roundtables have had the aim of grouping clarifying questions, and we&rsquo;ve just had a very successful one organized by ISDA and AFME covering market risk.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I have time to cover on market risk. Let me finish with the briefest of tours of the horizon.</p>
<p>The meta headline is that we remain very SCGO focused.</p>
<p>We have been doing a lot this year. Following through on Mansion House with PRA initiatives. For example, to assist firms, through the &lsquo;scale up&rsquo; unit in the PRA and the wider concierge service for firms new to the UK. We&rsquo;ve also made commitments, with KPIs, to make regulatory transactions like authorisations, SMCR applications and model approvals speedier and more agile.</p>
<p>Outside of Mansion House, we&rsquo;ve launched deeper review of SMCR and modernized a range of MREL related thresholds so the regime keeps pace with the times.</p>
<p>And all of that is on top of earlier initiatives covering Basel 3.1 where I think our implementation of the global standard is very proportionate, our strong and simple regime for small firms, securitization reform, remuneration reform, and many initiatives from my colleagues working on insurance reforms.</p>
<p>My purpose there is not to blind you with a long list. It is to get across a sense that it is a very big focus for us, that we have been and continue to take very seriously.</p>
<p>The big thing I didn&rsquo;t include in that list, but is very much a big focus right now, and so I&rsquo;ve pulled it out separately, is the capital refresh project being run by FPC and PRC. I don&rsquo;t have anything to say on that here given it is separate to our Basel 3.1 work. But we released our analysis and where we have got to in the December Financial Stability Report, today in fact. But I can say it has, and will continue given the next steps, to occupy a lot of bandwidth in the PRA as we look to do the best evidence-based job we can in order to do it justice.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for listening.</p>

<p><span>Researchers from The World Federation of Exchanges (&ldquo;WFE&rdquo;), the global industry group for exchange groups and CCPs, were awarded best paper for their new research,</span><em>&nbsp;&ldquo;Attracting New Listings: What Shapes IPO Activity Across Markets&rdquo;</em><span>, at the European Capital Markets Institute (ECMI) Annual Meeting.</span><br /><br /><span>The ECMI published a call for the submission of research papers related to capital markets and their functioning, and a committee of academics and international experts selected the WFE&rsquo;s Research Paper for the prize and the opportunity to present the findings at the 2025 ECMI Annual Conference on 4 November 2025. The three WFE Research economists who co-authored the paper jointly accepted the prize and presented the paper in Brussels.</span><br /><br /><span>The paper offers the most comprehensive analysis to date of how exchange-level, macroeconomic, and regulatory factors shape IPO activity across 79 global stock exchanges from 2002 to 2024. The research found that market liquidity and GDP growth are the most consistent and robust factors impacting the volume of IPOs, while the higher the degree of financial development in a jurisdiction is associated with larger IPOs, particularly in emerging and developing markets.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>The authors developed the new WFE Listing Stringency Index (LSI) to capture the breadth of listing requirements across exchanges and assess how regulatory frameworks shape IPO markets.</span><br /><br /><strong>Dr Ying Liu, Economist at the WFE and co-author of the paper</strong><span>, said, &ldquo;Our research found that market liquidity and economic growth are the factors most consistently associated with higher levels of IPO activity. While having a developed financial system influences the size rather than the frequency of IPOs in a jurisdiction. We also found clear differences between markets: advanced economies are more sensitive to volatility and macroeconomic conditions, whilst emerging markets gain the most from improvements in liquidity, financial development, and overall economic expansion.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><strong>Dr Ishak Demir, Economist at the WFE and co-author of the paper</strong><span>, said, &ldquo;We were delighted to receive this award and be invited to present our paper at this prestigious international conference, in front of policymakers, academics and industry representatives. One of the main objectives of this research was to provide an evidence-based view of the factors that shape IPO activity across different market environments. By analysing two decades of data across a large set of global exchanges, we aim to offer policymakers, academics, and market practitioners a clearer understanding of the factors that shape IPO activity globally. We thank the ECMI and their committee of esteemed academics for recognising our work.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><strong>Dr Erfan Ghofrani, Economist at The WFE and co-author of the paper</strong><span>, said, &ldquo;The Listing Stringency Index we developed as part of the research provides regulators with a useful tool, showing that easing overly strict listing requirements can increase market participation and capital raised, so long as transparency, market resilience, and governance standards remain intact.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><strong>Nandini Sukumar, Chief Executive Officer of the WFE</strong><span>, said, &ldquo;I am incredibly proud of the team, led by Dr Pedro Gurrola-Perez, for this achievement. At the WFE we have built an exceptional team of academics who are producing cutting-edge research on the issues shaping our industry. We look forward to building on this work, using robust empirical evidence to inform industry dialogue and support policymaking that strengthens the functioning of global markets.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>Read the full Research Paper&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://world-exchanges.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=48ddcbc11eb58f141a51219ea&amp;id=133274f236&amp;e=979576350c" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a><span>.</span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US">GLEIF's Global vLEI Hackathon saw an impressive 110 submissions from teams around the world, collectively showcasing the innovative ideas shaping the future of Digital Organizational Identity.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US">MSC Trustgate's winning solution incorporates the verifiable LEI (vLEI) into its secure document signing portal, enabling signatories to digitally verify their identity and organizational authority, and bind this verification to the electronic signatures applied to their corporate PDFs. By seamlessly linking verifiable corporate identity with legally recognized digital signatures, MSC Trustgate's vLEI-powered signing process bypasses the need for repetitive, manual Know Your Customer and Know Your Business checks which create onboarding friction and remain vulnerable to identity fraud. The result is a faster and simpler signing process, and a signed file which is recognized globally by Adobe Acrobat and other standard PDF readers, without additional plug-ins. This is achieved by linking the verified vLEI identity directly to a certificate issued under the Adobe Approved Trust List (AATL).</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.gqh-2BaxUzlo7XKIuSly0rC3XV7H6MflIaD-2Fi0HbMqdEE-3DjyDU_pIbxPfpDI69aAybPrpOfg1n6CWmKMnb3conIyNKCYgopkqlx8cS0FFNxZUe51piZ6n6okyeDMJdkH51q5lbJ1CbKrK-2FN9A2-2FZ3E0Qhk1jsCvnSIougtAdmFq1VzyVxoyymInbZvHxE2wrJGoxRw3qW0iVcoTjsY2qLbSdf3ZRkTNFEMeRcT-2F88toe4arD-2FWVwmDruZlqFNFdYkP0z9TAxW-2FpbAwKX24i64BPSZ6m4eEXWwf-2FUpDkEQIyCmJOT0Mtzxa-2F0i-2BVSynbQEB8jQ4PhrCSp2ax0A490pVMVu56WMX9WOkoUfqJHSobEjZUIlsSeZHK9kZ4IoesLHlq-2FpN-2F6A-3D-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">YourData</a><span lang="EN-US">, was named as the runner up. Its solution, Agent-Anchor, assigns vLEI identities to a company's AI agents, providing new safeguards against the growing threat of AI generated impersonation, voice spoofing, and fraudulent messaging. By introducing the vLEI's new layer of digital trust, customers interacting with a company's AI agent can verify its true origin 'live' during calls and other interactions. The solution can also integrate with international digital identity wallets, like the eIDAS 2.0 EUDI Wallet, enabling deployment in existing user environments without requiring additional applications.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US">Hazhar Ismail, Executive Director, MSC Trustgate, said: "The vLEI has enabled us to bridge the long-standing gap between emerging trust ecosystems and established global standards. We have delivered a prototype that is secure, scalable, and globally trusted - one that judges, businesses, and regulators will recognize as both practical and transformative. The signing service will be particularly valuable for high-value corporate, banking, and cross-border commerce use cases, where only the highest levels of digital trust are permissible."</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US">Jaegyeong Yeom, Co-founder, YourData, said: "As companies increasingly interact with customers via callbots, chatbots, and automated messaging systems, Agent-Anchor demonstrates how both sides can interact with AI safely and reliably. Without a verifiable trust layer, malicious actors can easily leverage AI-spoofing to impersonate these tools and conduct large-scale fraud. Synthetic voices, fake chatbots, and phishing messages highlight the urgency of solving this verification gap."</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US">Alexandre Kech, CEO of GLEIF, said: "With Industry 4.0 in full flight, companies everywhere are in dire need of global digital identity solutions, to realize operational gains, safeguard against the tidal wave of new threats, and ease the process of complying with new regulations. By embracing the vLEI as a digital trust layer, our hackathon winners have shown how quickly and effectively this can be achieved when the right solution is in place.&rdquo;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US">Ivan Mortimer-Schutts, Global Head of vLEI of GLEIF, said: &ldquo;The vLEI hackathon has been very impressive and in a constructive spirit of collaboration. We thank each and every one for their ambition and innovative drive."</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US">The winners were named at an exclusive international forum on Digital Organizational Identity, hosted by the Frankfurt School of Finance &amp; Management, in Frankfurt.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US">All entries were rigorously evaluated by the international vLEI Hackathon jury, which comprises leading figures from global organizations, industry domains, and technical disciplines, ensuring a comprehensive and forward-looking assessment of every submission.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US">The vLEI is a digital, trustworthy attestation of the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) tied to the ISO 17442 Standard. This secure digital credential links an organization's identity with a natural person and their role within it. By enabling peer-to-peer verification, the vLEI allows data, credentials, and transactions to be verified and shared without intermediaries, laying the foundation for a trusted global digital economy.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US">Since its launch in July, the vLEI Hackathon has challenged developers, entrepreneurs, and innovators worldwide to shape the future of digital trust by developing real-world solutions powered by digital organizational identity.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US">The vLEI Hackathon has enjoyed the steadfast support of leading organizations, including Affinidi, Apix, APSCA, Cardano Foundation, Chainlink, eBRAM, Cardano, EPA Asia, Esatus, Finoverse, Finternet Lab, FIWARE, Frankfurt School of Finance &amp; Management, fts.money, GFTN, Giesecke+Devrient, Hong Kong PKI Consortium, Hong Kong Web3 Standardization Association, ICC Digital Standards Initiative, INNOPAY, Key State Capital, LF Decentralized Trust, Vayana, Swift, Asia PKI Consortium, Vayana, Veriable.Trade, and more.

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority: Pause On Motor Finance Complaints Handling To Lift On 31 May 2026</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-pause-on-motor-finance-complaints-handling-to-li-2025123/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-pause-on-motor-finance-complaints-handling-to-li-2025123/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h4>UK Financial Conduct Authority Statement</h4>
<p>We are lifting the pause on the handling of motor finance complaints on 31 May 2026. This timeframe enables us to finalise and begin implementing any compensation scheme, while giving firms a reasonable period to prepare.</p>
<p>We paused the handling of some motor finance complaints in January 2024. This was to prevent disorderly, inconsistent and inefficient outcomes for consumers and knock-on effects on firms and the market while we assessed whether there had been adequate disclosure of commissions between motor finance lenders and brokers.</p>
<p>We now have legal clarity from the Supreme Court and High Court to proceed with setting out how firms should deal with very large numbers of complaints and are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/consultation-papers/cp25-27-motor-finance-consumer-redress-scheme" title="CP25/27: Motor finance consumer redress scheme">consulting on a compensation scheme</a>&nbsp;for customers who were treated unfairly. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It is important that complaints are now dealt with promptly, not least as some consumers have been waiting almost 2 years for an answer. We are clear that complaints cannot be paused indefinitely. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It is likely that we will go ahead with a scheme and complaints that fall within it will be dealt with under specific rules, which will include timeframes for them to be dealt with. We are consulting on these timeframes now and are receiving much useful feedback on what is needed to ensure a scheme runs smoothly.</p>
<p>We are consulting on a scheme with a broad scope, so the number of complaints falling out of the currently proposed scheme should be relatively low. Those who have submitted such complaints should not have to wait longer than necessary.</p>
<p>We have decided, therefore, to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/ps25-18-changes-handling-rules-motor-finance-complaints" title="PS25/18: Changes to handling rules for motor finance complaints&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">lift the pause on the handling of certain motor finance complaints</a>&nbsp;on 31 May 2026. Ending the pause on 31 May 2026, rather than 31 July 2026 as originally consulted on, reflects our commitment to ensuring consumers receive fair and timely outcomes.</p>
<p>It gives firms sufficient time to be ready to respond to complaints, whether inside or outside of a scheme, given they should already have been investigating them. It also takes account of the fact that firms will, in most cases, have up to 8 weeks after 31 May 2026 to send a response to complaints outside the scheme with the exact amount of time depending on when they received the complaint. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/dear-ceo-letters/motor-finance-commission-complaints-consultation-outcome.pdf" title="motor-finance-commission-complaints-consultation-outcome.pdf">a letter (PDF)</a>&nbsp;sent on 3 December, we have reminded firms again that they should be progressing complaints. This is to ensure firms are ready to start issuing final responses to complaints if they are not covered by any scheme. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We have said we will publish final scheme rules in February or March 2026. If we go ahead with a scheme, we will consider how the rules interact with the end of the complaint handling pause, to avoid firms having to send final responses that would otherwise be dealt with in the scheme.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our final rules, we intend to set out how firms should respond to complaints involving both scheme and non-scheme elements, recognising that it may be simpler and less confusing for consumers if firms send a final response to any scheme and non-scheme complaints at the same time.</p>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-leasing-complaints" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Leasing complaints</h2>
<p>As we proposed in our consultation, leasing complaints are excluded from this further extension as they are not in scope of the proposed compensation scheme. Firms need to start sending final responses to any motor leasing complaint from 5 December 2025 in line with normal complaint handling rules.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-record-retention" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Record retention</h2>
<p>Firms will also have to retain and preserve relevant records until 11 April 2031, supporting transparency and ongoing consumer protection in line with the proposed scheme.</p>
</div>

<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-advice-for-consumers" tabindex="-1">

<h2>Advice for consumers</h2>
<p>People who have already complained don&rsquo;t need to do anything. However, consumers worried that they were not told about commission and who think they may have paid too much for their motor finance,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/car-finance-complaints" title="Car finance claims">should complain now</a>.</p>

<title>Columbia Threadneedle Investments Joins SIX Swiss Exchange As New ETF Issuer</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>SIX welcomes Columbia Threadneedle Investments as a new issuer of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). The global asset manager is expanding investors&rsquo; access to actively managed strategies at the Swiss Exchange with the listing of two active ETFs, each tradable in two currencies.</span></p>
<div class="textimage ">
<div>
<div>
<p>These two multicurrency and actively managed ETFs aim to provide investors with long-term exposure by investing primarily in listed equities and equity-related securities, offering targeted access to Europe and the U.S., respectively. Each Fund allocates at least 80% of its assets to its core universe &ndash; European and U.S. companies, respectively &ndash; listed or traded on regulated markets, and is managed with reference to an appropriate index: MSCI Europe for the Europe ETF and Russell 1000 for the U.S. ETF.</p>
<p>With this launch, SIX now hosts 35 ETF issuers offering a total of 2,100 ETFs &ndash; making it one of Europe&rsquo;s most dynamic and diverse ETF marketplaces. So far this year, 298 new ETFs have been listed at SIX Swiss Exchange, including 111 actively managed products &ndash; the highest number of new active ETF listings in eight years.</p>
<p>Eva Maria Hintner, Country Head Switzerland, Columbia Threadneedle Investments, explains: &ldquo;The current market environment requires investment solutions that deliver attractive returns after costs, cushion downside risk and avoid the concentration risks that have become so typical of major indices. With the listing on SIX, our clients in Switzerland gain access to a solution that is more than just an index overlay &ndash; it is genuine active management in an ETF wrapper. Our European and US active equity ETFs are the first in a series of core equity solutions designed to sit at the heart of investors&rsquo; portfolios, allowing them to benefit from our proprietary research and expertise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danielle Reischuk, Senior ETFs &amp; ETPs Sales Manager, SIX Swiss Exchange, adds: &ldquo;We are delighted to welcome Columbia Threadneedle Investments as a new ETF issuer at SIX Swiss Exchange. Their launch further broadens the range of actively managed ETF products available to Swiss and international investors. The continued growth in new listings underscores the strength and diversity of our ETF marketplace and our ongoing commitment to providing issuers and investors with a robust and efficient trading venue.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.columbiathreadneedleus.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Columbia Threadneedle Investments</a>&nbsp;is a global asset manager entrusted with over $675 billion by clients seeking to grow and manage their assets for the future. The firm operates with a globally connected team of approximately 2,300 people including approximately 550 investment professionals based in North America, Europe, and Asia. The firm offers diverse expertise across nearly all asset classes and markets. Its investment approach is grounded in original, independent research designed to inform smarter decision-making, alongside a responsible investment ethos that recognizes the long-term impact of today&rsquo;s choices. Columbia Threadneedle emphasizes continuous improvement, aiming to enhance both investment outcomes and client experience.</p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority: OCR Pass Through Transparency - Delivering Transparency On The Pace At Which Financial Institutions Respond To Changes In The Official Cash Rate</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-ocr-pass-through-transparency-deliver-2025123/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-ocr-pass-through-transparency-deliver-2025123/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) sets the official cash rate (OCR) to achieve and maintain price stability (inflation). Banks and other financial institutions like credit unions, building societies and some finance companies use the level of the OCR as one of the factors when they determine interest rates offered to their customers.</p>
<p>When the RBNZ changes the OCR the financial institutions may make changes to their interest rates, but that can take time depending on the institution. The table below shows the size of interest rate changes and the time taken for the change to take effect for new and existing customers of floating rate mortgages and on call savings accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA has requested information from eight financial institutions<span>1</span>&nbsp;that provide ~98% of housing loans in New Zealand<span>2</span>. These financial institutions already provide information about the interest rates applicable to their products, and when they are moved, through a variety of channels.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Cboe To Offer Nearly 24-Hour Trading For Russell 2000 Options, Expanding Global Access To U.S. Small-Cap Equities</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cboe-to-offer-nearly-24-hour-trading-for-russell-2000-options-expanding-global-2025123/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul type="disc">
<li>Russell 2000&reg; Index (RUT) options to trade nearly 24x5 during Cboe's Global Trading Hours</li>
<li>Expansion that may allow European and Asia-Pacific traders to more easily manage U.S. small-cap exposure</li>
<li>Initiative is part of Cboe's ongoing efforts to expand global access to its proprietary U.S. equity index options</li>
</ul>
<p>Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe: CBOE), the world's leading derivatives and securities exchange network, today announced plans to extend trading hours for its Russell 2000 Index (RUT) options suite to nearly 24 hours a day, five days a week, beginning February 9, 2026.</p>
<p>RUT options are currently available for trading during regular U.S. hours, from 9:30 a.m. ET to 4:15 p.m. ET, Monday through Friday. With the planned addition of an overnight session during Cboe's Global Trading Hours (GTH), RUT options (including the RUT Weeklys options) will also trade from 8:15 p.m. ET to 9:25 a.m. ET the following morning, Monday through Friday. As investors globally increasingly seek to access U.S. equity market exposure, the ability to trade RUT options nearly around the clock is expected to help them respond to market-moving events, adjust positioning, and manage risk with greater precision in real time.</p>
<p>Cboe currently offers several flagship index options including S&amp;P 500 Index (SPX), Mini-SPX (XSP) and Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) options during its GTH session. The addition of RUT options to GTH will expand this lineup, giving investors even more tools to access U.S. equity large cap, small cap and global equity market exposure &ndash; ultimately, potentially creating more trading, hedging, and liquidity opportunities during this overnight trading session.</p>
<p>Demand for overnight trading is evident in the growth of Cboe's GTH sessions, which have experienced record volumes in 2025, up 179% year-to-date compared to full year 2022 as global appetite for U.S. markets has grown and Cboe expands its product availability to meet this demand.</p>
<p>"Extending trading hours for Cboe's Russell 2000 Index product suite will be another significant milestone in our efforts to expand access to U.S. index options for investors worldwide," said Rob Hocking, Global Head of Derivatives at Cboe. "With nearly round-the-clock availability, Cboe will help empower market participants to further diversify, manage and hedge their U.S. equity and volatility exposures&ndash;covering both small caps and large caps&ndash;at their discretion. We look forward to continuing to collaborate with FTSE Russell to deliver meaningful solutions to our growing global customer base." &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Russell 2000 Index measures the performance of U.S. small-cap equities across sectors and has long served as a barometer of small-cap performance. As of the end of November, average daily volume in Cboe's RUT options has grown to nearly 75 thousand contracts, up 66% compared to full year 2022, as more traders look to manage risk and implement daily options strategies. The Russell 2000 Index has historically been more volatile than large-cap measures and more sensitive to interest rates &ndash; making RUT options a potentially effective tool to trade small-cap volatility and secular trends.</p>
<p>To track implied volatility for the Russell 2000, Cboe publishes the&nbsp;<a href="https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4571018-1&amp;h=1116380193&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cboe.com%2Fus%2Findices%2Fdashboard%2Frvx%2F&amp;a=Cboe+Russell+2000+Volatility+Index" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Cboe Russell 2000 Volatility Index</a>&nbsp;(RVX), a VIX-style measure of 30-day expected volatility. Similar to realized volatility measures, RVX has historically been higher than the VIX Index, reflecting the unique risk profile of small-cap stocks.</p>
<p>"Cboe's decision to offer nearly 24-hour trading for Russell 2000 options is an exciting development for global investors," said Shawn Creighton, Director of Index Derivatives Solutions at FTSE Russell. "The Russell 2000 Index is a recognized benchmark for U.S. small-cap equities, and expanded access will give market participants worldwide greater flexibility to manage risk and capture opportunities as markets move."</p>
<p>Exclusively listed on Cboe Options Exchange, Russell 2000 Index (RUT) options and Russell 2000 Index Weeklys (RUTW) options are cash-settled, European-style options, meaning there is no risk of early exercise and no need to deliver or receive unwanted shares. Cboe offers a range of expirations&mdash;including every weekday, end-of-month, and quarterly&mdash;allowing investors to implement a diverse range of trading strategies.</p>
<p>In addition to offering GTH hours for RUT options, Cboe proposes to add Curb Trading Hours &ndash; an additional trading session that will run from 4:15 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. ET, Monday through Friday.</p>

<title>EU Allows Continued Use Of New Zealand Regulated Financial Benchmarks</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/eu-allows-continued-use-of-new-zealand-regulated-financial-benchmarks-2025122/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/eu-allows-continued-use-of-new-zealand-regulated-financial-benchmarks-2025122/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) - Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; has welcomed the European Commission decision to recognise New Zealand&rsquo;s legal and supervisory framework for financial benchmarks as equivalent to the European Union&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Together with the FMA&rsquo;s decision to issue New Zealand Financial Benchmark Facility Limited (NZFBF) a benchmark administrator&rsquo;s licence this week, this means that the NZ Bank Bill Rate benchmark (BKBM) can continue to be used in the EU from 1 January 2026.</p>
<p>FMA General Counsel Liam Mason said: &ldquo;This is a significant outcome for New Zealand, and for all financial institutions and businesses that trade between New Zealand and the European Union that use the BKBM in their commercial transactions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means that the more than EUR 50 billion of financial instruments currently in use in the EU that reference the New Zealand Bank Bill Rate benchmark can continue to be used without disruption from 1 January 2026.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This benchmark is used as a base interest rate in financial contracts to calculate interest as part of commercial transactions &ndash; for example by holders of interest rate swaps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without this decision, these financial instruments cannot legally reference the BKBM. It means the businesses and organisations would need to find an alternative EU-based benchmark for their transactions, which is not feasible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This step marks the close of a multi-year effort to have New Zealand&rsquo;s benchmark recognised in the European Union, including introducing a bespoke licensing regime to comply with the updated EU benchmark regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this latest phase, the FMA and MBIE worked closely with NZFBF, the sole benchmark provider in New Zealand, to provide the Commission with critical advice on the size and significance of the benchmark,&rdquo; said Mr Mason.</p>

<title>Business Trades Support Bank Capital Rule Reform To Boost Economic Growth</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>&ldquo;Now is the time to modernize our capital framework to unleash economic growth for American businesses and consumers across the country.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>A coalition of leading business trade organizations urged prudential regulators to examine and modernize large bank capital requirements to ensure they support consumers, businesses, and the U.S. economy. The organizations, which represent a wide range of stakeholders, including small businesses, manufacturers, and farmers, highlighted the negative impact of inappropriately calibrated requirements on economic growth and American competitiveness, and applauded the ongoing efforts to improve the capital framework.</p>
<p>A review of 13 economic studies&nbsp;<a href="https://fsforum.com/opinion/fixing-what-aint-broken-the-real-and-hidden-costs-of-excessive-bank-capital-regulation/">found</a>&nbsp;that increased capital requirements can cost the economy $100 billion to $150 billion per year and result in $2.3 trillion in lost economic productivity over 30 years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We greatly appreciate the work being undertaken by bank regulators to modernize capital rules to unleash economic growth and support various industries and sectors across the country. Specifically, common sense adjustments to Basel III Endgame, the GSIB Surcharge, stress testing, and leverage requirements will improve access to credit and reduce the costs of goods and services for American businesses and consumers, ensuring the U.S. economy can continue to thrive and grow,&rdquo; the trade organizations said.</p>
<p>The statement for the record was signed by the Financial Services Forum, American Bankers Association, American Cotton Shippers Association, American Farm Bureau Federation, Bank Policy Institute, Business Roundtable, Commodity Markets Council, Consumer Bankers Association, Futures Industry Association, International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Mortgage Bankers Association, National Association of Manufacturers, National Association of REALTORS&reg;, The Real Estate Roundtable, Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, and U.S. Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<title>Trading Book Capital: Basel III Implementation And Latest Industry Trends, London, December 2, 2025, Introduction And Welcoming Remarks, Mark Gheerbrant, Global Head Of Risk And Capital, ISDA</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/trading-book-capital-basel-iii-implementation-and-latest-industry-trends-londo-2025122/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good afternoon, and welcome to ISDA&rsquo;s annual Trading Book Capital event &ndash; thanks for joining us today, and thank you to Deloitte for sponsoring.</p>
<p>This event has become an annual fixture in the ISDA calendar, and you may have noticed that it nearly always takes place in early December. When the days are at their shortest, the cold is beginning to bite and the Christmas lights are turned on, thoughts are turning to 2026 &ndash; plans, hopes and dreams.</p>
<p>As I prepared these remarks, I was thinking about what we in ISDA&rsquo;s Risk and Capital team are dreaming of for next year. I&rsquo;m sure that if Mariah Carey were to remix her 1994 classic, she could think of no punchier lyrics than these: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want a lot for Christmas&hellip; I just want an appropriate, risk-sensitive capital framework&rdquo;.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m thankfully not planning a career move into festive musical remixes, I do want to talk briefly about why we&rsquo;re doubling down on our commitment to appropriate, risk-sensitive capital requirements as we move into 2026.</p>
<p>Healthy economies and successful companies rely on deep and liquid markets to access funding, hedge their risks and build resilience to withstand external shocks. If banks are hit with disproportionate capital requirements, their ability to provide liquidity will be impaired and economic growth will be constrained. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ll continue to advocate for an appropriate capital framework around the world.</p>
<p>For the major jurisdictions that have still to complete the implementation of Basel III, it&rsquo;s clear that 2026 is going to be a crunch year. In the US, regulators are revising the Basel III endgame proposal in response to industry feedback, and we expect to see a new proposal in the coming months.</p>
<p>In the EU, the European Commission launched a targeted consultation last month on changes to the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB) that would bring some short-term relief in key areas. These would include a set of temporary adjustments to the standardized and internal models approaches and the application of a multiplier, which negatively affected banks could use to limit the increase in their capital requirements for three years. As a general principle, we think long-term solutions are needed to ensure lasting risk sensitivity, rather than relying on temporary measures. The consultation closes on January 6 and we&rsquo;re working with our members to develop a response.</p>
<p>Here in the UK, the Basel 3.1 framework is due to be implemented at the start of 2027, although the Prudential Regulation Authority has proposed delaying the rollout of internal models until the following year.</p>
<p>This brings me to the reduced viability of internal models under the FRTB, which we think should be a major concern for policymakers. Last year, we undertook a survey that showed only 10 out of 26 banks plan to use internal models for a reduced scope of trading desks under the FRTB. That&rsquo;s a big change that we don&rsquo;t think is in line with what the Basel Committee originally intended. Such a big shift away from internal models could lead to herd behavior and drive concentrations in particular assets. It will mean less diversity in models and less alignment between risk and capital &ndash; a direct contradiction of Mariah&rsquo;s hopes for Christmas.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve recommended changes to improve the incentives to use internal models, which would require the recalibration of some parts of the FRTB, including the profit &amp; loss attribution test, the risk factor eligibility test and non-modellable risk factors. The good news is that we&rsquo;ve had positive engagement with policymakers on these issues, particularly in the US. There is still work to be done to ensure the viability of internal models, but we&rsquo;re hopeful that revisions to the Basel III endgame will include positive changes in this area.</p>
<p>Whether banks use standardized approaches or internal models, it is critical that those capital models are implemented accurately and consistently. That&rsquo;s why ISDA developed its Capital Models Benchmarking initiative, which has enabled firms around the world to implement and validate regulatory capital models with an unparalleled level of efficiency, accuracy and consistency. Originally designed for the standardized approach, this initiative has now been extended to support internal models and we&rsquo;ll hear more on that later this afternoon.</p>
<p>As market participants have navigated a series of unexpected shocks in recent years, they&rsquo;ve also recognized the need to prepare for future climate-related shocks. In particular, the possible impact of natural disasters or changes in climate policy on traded assets hasn&rsquo;t historically been an area where firms have been able to lean on established best practice.</p>
<p>That has now started to change, thanks to ISDA&rsquo;s conceptual framework for climate scenario analysis in the trading book and the follow-up work we&rsquo;ve done to design and model specific scenarios. This year, ISDA has produced market risk shocks associated with the short-term scenarios developed by the Network for Greening the Financial System and we&rsquo;ll publish a new paper on this early next year. Like ISDA&rsquo;s benchmarking initiative, our climate scenario analysis framework is a mutualized solution that responds to a shared industry challenge. We look forward to further advancing both services in the years ahead.</p>
<p>I hope these remarks have given a sense of why ISDA&rsquo;s hopes for next year are consistent with what we have always strived for. Risk-sensitive capital might not scan seamlessly into the lyrics of a classic festive tune, but it really is all we want for Christmas.</p>

<title>Revitalizing America’s Markets At 250, Paul S. Atkins, SEC Chairman - New York Stock Exchange, Dec. 2, 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Lynn, let me start by thanking you for your generous introduction and for hosting this event at the Exchange. My thanks as well to the market participants here today. And of course, I am grateful to see my counterparts from across the Administration. Thank you all for being here and for your understanding that the views I express today are in my capacity as Chairman and do not necessarily reflect those of the SEC as an institution or of my fellow Commissioners.</p>
<p>There are few places more fitting to consider the future of the American financial system than this one. The New York Stock Exchange is a cathedral of capital markets, replete with the rhythms and rituals that allocate resources toward socially valued uses. Listen closely, and you can hear the hum of human ingenuity that has long echoed within these walls. Echoes that ring loudly around us today.</p>
<p>Step outside these doors, meanwhile, and the neighborhood itself narrates the American story. A short walk in any direction brings you to landmarks like Federal Hall, where Washington took his oath and Congress established the Treasury; to the buttonwood tree under whose ancestor two dozen stockbrokers established the forerunner of this exchange; and to the cobblestone streets that were a cradle of commerce long before Manhattan&rsquo;s skyscrapers rose above them.</p>
<p>The square mile that surrounds us is less a place than a prologue&mdash;an opening chapter in a story that is now ours to continue.</p>
<p class="text-align-center">***</p>
<p>Of course, in seven months, that story will reach a rare milestone when our Republic marks its 250th year. A quarter millennium ago, a band of revolutionaries declared that rights are neither permissions to be earned nor privileges to be revoked. They claimed the right to govern themselves, yes, but also the right to&nbsp;<em>provide&nbsp;</em>for themselves. To work, to venture, and to prosper off of their own effort. To pursue happiness and property. Indeed, our founders sought agency as much in the halls of power as in the marketplace of ideas.</p>
<p>Anniversaries of this magnitude demand more than ceremony. They ask something of us. They invite us to reflect, of course but no less, to resolve. To ensure that the future that we shape will prove worthy of the legacy that we inherit.</p>
<p class="text-align-center">***</p>
<p>Allow me, then, to take a few moments to revisit how that legacy began.</p>
<p>Before the United States was a nation, it was an investment.</p>
<p>The first permanent English settlements in this hemisphere were financed through joint-stock enterprises that allowed people to pool together capital and share in the risk and reward of an uncertain venture. The Virginia Company, for example&mdash;the first major British securities offering aimed at the Americas&mdash;funded the Jamestown settlement through share subscriptions, investors of which anticipated returns through land, trade, and dividends.</p>
<p>Decades later, a similar structure funded the settlement that became this great city, foreshadowing New York&rsquo;s destiny as the global capital of securities markets. Indeed, what is now modern-day Manhattan originated as a corporate investment project. We have with us this morning a copy of the company&rsquo;s original stock offering&mdash;New Amsterdam&rsquo;s birth certificate&mdash;and a tangible reminder that Manhattan itself was built on the premise that prosperity flows from mobilizing capital toward its most productive uses.</p>
<p>That premise, of course&mdash;and the financial system that it engendered&mdash;is rooted in still older foundations dating back to the Glorious Revolution, when Parliament wrested arbitrary power from the Crown and established the principle that property rights would be protected, contracts enforced, and the state bound by predictable rules rather than royal whim. Britain became a financial powerhouse by creating the conditions in which markets could flourish. Our founders inherited that worldview and then forged a more perfect union&mdash;perhaps none more than Hamilton, across from whose burial site we assemble today.</p>
<p>Hamilton understood that markets, structured properly, can unleash the might of American dynamism as no monarch or government ministry possibly could. After all, a free market is a hallmark of a free people. And as Dr. Ludwig von Mises described so well, &ldquo;if history could teach us anything, it would be that private property is inextricably linked with civilization.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So in&nbsp;<em>Federalist&nbsp;</em>11, Hamilton praises the &ldquo;adventurous spirit&rdquo; which animates the &ldquo;commercial character of America&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;that unequalled spirit of enterprise, which signifies the genius of the American Merchants and Navigators, and which is in itself an inexhaustible mine of national wealth,&rdquo; and then he heralds its potential to make America the &ldquo;admiration and envy of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hamilton saw in that &ldquo;adventurous spirit&rdquo; a precocious young nation whose people could produce their own prosperity. To be sure, he believed that the government must create stable rules, maintain public credit, and reliably enforce contracts. But within that framework, the securities markets would emerge to unlock the most daring mobilization of capital in human history.</p>
<p>The canals that tied the interior to the coasts were financed by state bonds. The railroads that stitched together a continent required investment on a scale that the world had never seen, creating secondary markets, auditing standards, and the modern corporate governance structure in the process. The steel that built our cities, the oil that powered our factories, and the electricity that illuminated our homes were all made possible by domestic and foreign investors willing to stake their capital on an idea of America still in formation.</p>
<p>Of course, we must recognize with humility when we, as a country, failed to uphold some of our most basic founding principles. But by the turn of the twentieth century, millions of Americans owned securities and had a framework for the achievement of their ambitions. Indeed, the wealth accumulated through the financial markets became an accelerant of social mobility.</p>
<p>As the century unfolded, and competing ideologies sought to engineer economic strength from the top down, ours was a model that steadily proved its value on the global stage. The Soviet and communist system of central planning, coercion, mass murder, seizing private property, and suppressing private enterprise, for example, collapsed under the weight of its own contradictions, while the American approach empowered its citizens to innovate, to invest, and to build wealth within predictable and enforceable legal frameworks. To redraw boundaries of the possible by inventing the telephone and the phonograph. The assembly line and the airplane. The semiconductor that made computing ubiquitous. Internet protocols that connected the world and GPS technology that then plotted it. Social media platforms that carry information at the speed of thought. And now, the new frontier of AI that is transforming the way that we live and work.</p>
<p>Across this long sweep of innovation, a pattern emerges with clarity: the great leaps of American life were always produced by a willingness to tolerate and accept risks within a system that rewards those who take them. Our prosperity is no accident of history&mdash;nor is our primacy assured in the future. The twentieth century was a triumph of economic freedom over doctrines that sought to constrain it. But principles do not preserve themselves. Freedom is not a relic that we inherit so much as a responsibility that we assume. And in recent years, our regulatory frameworks have veered from the founding ideals that helped the United States to once stand without peer as the world&rsquo;s destination for public companies.</p>
<p class="text-align-center">***</p>
<p>For context, Congress, beginning in 1933 with the Securities Act, passed a series of legislation to address the fraudulent and manipulative activity that Wall Street engaged in prior to the crash. Congress&rsquo;s enactment of the securities laws at the federal level sought to provide more clarity in the markets in the name of rebuilding public confidence in them. After all, markets require trust, and trust requires transparency.</p>
<p>Shortly before the Securities Act became law, President Franklin Roosevelt explained his vision for this seminal statute in a message to Congress.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-120225-revitalizing-americas-markets-250?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;He rejected the idea that the federal government should be a merit regulator, which is the notion that the government approves an offering of securities as sound for public investment because it expects their value to increase. Instead, President Roosevelt sought to protect investors through a disclosure-based regulatory regime&mdash;the idea that companies offering securities to the public should provide all the important information about those securities.</p>
<p>In short, the Securities Act preserved the Hamiltonian model by incentivizing capital to flow to opportunity based on the judgment of investors. In the same message to Congress, President Roosevelt explained that &ldquo;[t]he purpose of the [Securities Act] is to protect the public with the least possible interference with honest business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as the generations passed, the federal government&rsquo;s natural tendency asserted itself. Rules have multiplied faster than the problems that they were intended to solve&mdash;and in its drift away from original congressional intent, the State has sought to substitute its discernment for that of market participants.</p>
<p class="text-align-center">***</p>
<p>Shortly after I left the SEC as a staff member in the mid-1990s, there were more than 7,000 companies listed on the U.S. exchanges, from small-cap innovators to giants of industry. Yet by the time that I returned as Chairman earlier this year, that number had fallen by roughly 40 percent.</p>
<p>What happened during those decades tells a cautionary tale of regulatory creep. A tale that tells us that the path to public ownership has become narrower, costlier, and overly burdened with rules that often create more friction than benefit.</p>
<p>These trends have eroded American competitiveness; locked average investors out of some of the most dynamic companies; and pushed entrepreneurs to seek capital elsewhere, either in the private markets or on foreign shores.</p>
<p>This decline was not inevitable&mdash;nor, is it now irreversible.&nbsp; While there are many SEC rules and practices that have amassed over the decades and are ripe for reform, perhaps none epitomize regulatory creep more so than the voluminous disclosure requirements contained in the Commission&rsquo;s rulebook today.</p>
<p class="text-align-center">***</p>
<p>Over the years, and particularly over the past two decades, special interest groups, politicians, and&mdash;at times&mdash;the SEC itself have weaponized the disclosure regime that Congress created for our marketplace, in an effort to advance social and political agendas that stray far from the SEC&rsquo;s mission of facilitating capital formation; protecting investors; and ensuring fair, orderly, and efficient markets.</p>
<p>These decades of accretive rulemakings have produced reams of paperwork that can do more to obscure than to illuminate. Today&rsquo;s lengthy annual reports and proxy statements impose substantial costs on companies because they consume significant time from boards and management, and require armies of specialized lawyers, accountants, and consultants to prepare. Despite these costs, investors sometimes do not benefit from the information because they struggle to parse and understand it&mdash;or find it so intimidating because of the volume and density that they ignore it</p>
<p>One of my priorities as Chairman is to reform the SEC&rsquo;s disclosure rules with two goals in mind. First, the SEC must root its disclosure requirements in the concept of financial materiality. Second, these requirements must scale with a company&rsquo;s size and maturity.</p>
<p>With respect to the first goal, the Supreme Court enunciated an objective standard for materiality and explained that information is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important in making an investment decision.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-120225-revitalizing-americas-markets-250?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Achieving this goal necessitates restraint and care from both the SEC when it promulgates a rule and from Congress when it directs the Commission to mandate disclosure on a particular subject. Our capital markets thrive not through the volume of disclosures, but the clarity and importance of them to investors. In writing for the Court, Justice Thurgood Marshall cautioned, &ldquo;[s]ome information is of such dubious significance that insistence on its disclosure may accomplish more harm than good...and&nbsp;if the standard of materiality is unnecessarily low&hellip;shareholders [may be buried] in an avalanche of trivial information&mdash;a result that is hardly conducive to informed decisionmaking.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-120225-revitalizing-americas-markets-250?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3">[3]</a></p>
<p>In heeding this warning to avoid information overload for investors, our disclosure regime is most effective when the SEC provides, as FDR advocated, the minimum effective dose of regulation needed to elicit the information that is material to investors, and we allow market forces to drive the disclosure of any additional aspects of their operations that may be beneficial to investors. In contrast, an ineffective disclosure regime would be one where the SEC requires that all companies provide the same information without the ability to tailor the disclosure to their specific circumstances, with the only view that such information should be &ldquo;consistent and comparable&rdquo; across companies.</p>
<p>Indeed, even with today&rsquo;s numerous disclosure requirements, companies still provide additional information, such as non-GAAP numbers or key performance metrics, that are tailored to a company&rsquo;s business or industry and are driven more by investor demand than the SEC&rsquo;s rulebook.</p>
<p>When the SEC&rsquo;s disclosure regime has been hijacked to require information unmoored from materiality, investors do not benefit. In his recent and final Thanksgiving letter to shareholders, Warren Buffett highlighted a prime example of this hazard.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-120225-revitalizing-americas-markets-250?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4">[4]</a>&nbsp;Any summary I give cannot do justice to Mr. Buffett&rsquo;s own words. So, I quote for you the following excerpt from his letter:</p>
<p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1"><em>During my lifetime, reformers sought to embarrass CEOs by requiring the disclosure of the compensation of the boss compared to what was being paid to the average employee. Proxy statements promptly ballooned to 100-plus pages compared to 20 or less earlier.</em></p>
<p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1"><em>But the good intentions didn&rsquo;t work; instead they backfired. Based on the majority of my observations &ndash; the CEO of company &ldquo;A&rdquo; looked at his competitor at company &ldquo;B&rdquo; and subtly conveyed to his board that he should be worth more. Of course, he also boosted the pay of directors and was careful who he placed on the compensation committee. The new rules produced envy, not moderation.</em></p>
<p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1"><em>The ratcheting took on a life of its own.</em></p>
<p>I share Mr. Buffett&rsquo;s observations and concerns, which is why earlier this year, the SEC held a roundtable that brought together companies, investors, law firms, and compensation consultants to discuss the current state of the agency&rsquo;s executive compensation disclosure rules and potential reforms. Somewhat to my surprise, there was universal agreement among the panelists that the length and complexity of executive compensation disclosure have limited its usefulness and insight to investors. We need a re-set of these and other SEC disclosure requirements, and this roundtable was one of the first steps to execute my goal of ensuring that materiality is the north star of the SEC&rsquo;s disclosure regime.</p>
<p>My other priority with respect to the SEC&rsquo;s disclosure rules is to scale the requirements with the company&rsquo;s size and maturity as a public company. Balancing disclosure obligations with a company&rsquo;s ability to bear the burdens of compliance is particularly important where Congress has directed the SEC to promulgate a disclosure rule whose costs may have a disproportionate impact on some companies. Of course, this approach is hardly a novel concept. The Commission first provided tailored disclosure requirements for smaller public companies in 1992, during my first tour of duty at the SEC as a staff member. Two decades later, Congress, through the bipartisan JOBS Act, gave certain newly public companies an &ldquo;IPO on-ramp&rdquo; and permitted them to comply with some of the SEC&rsquo;s disclosure requirements on a delayed basis.</p>
<p>It is time to revisit these concepts that have proven effective and merit expansion. As part of this effort, the SEC should give strong consideration to the thresholds that separate &ldquo;large&rdquo; companies, which are subject to all of the SEC disclosure rules, and &ldquo;small&rdquo; companies that are subject to only some of them. The last comprehensive reform to these thresholds took place in 2005. This dereliction of regulatory upkeep has resulted in a company with a public float of as low as $250 million being subject to the same disclosure requirements as a company that is one hundred times its size.</p>
<p>For newly public companies, the SEC should consider building upon the &ldquo;IPO on-ramp&rdquo; that Congress established in the JOBS Act. For example, allowing companies to remain on the &ldquo;on-ramp&rdquo; for a minimum number of years, rather than forcing them off as soon as the first year after the initial offering, could provide companies with greater certainty and incentivize more IPOs, especially among smaller companies.</p>
<p>American entrepreneurs built the most dynamic economy in history in part by taking their companies public&mdash;and sharing the rewards with workers, savers, and investors. That partnership is worth reviving. If we want the next generation of innovators to choose our public markets, we need disclosure that is calibrated for a company&rsquo;s size and maturity; that is driven by market demands; and to the extent mandated by the SEC, that is rooted in materiality and not whimsical social or political agendas.</p>
<p>Of course, disclosure reform is just one of three pillars of my plan to make IPOs great again. A second pillar involves de-politicizing shareholder meetings and returning their focus to voting on director elections and significant corporate matters. Finally, we must also reform the litigation landscape for securities lawsuits to eliminate frivolous complaints, while maintaining an avenue for shareholders to continue to bring forth meritorious claims. At the SEC, we have been hard at work on executing this plan, and we look forward to soon sharing the progress that is taking shape.</p>
<p>Raising capital through an IPO should not be a privilege reserved for those few &ldquo;unicorns.&rdquo; More and more, public investments are concentrated in a handful of companies that are generally in the same one or two industries. Our regulatory framework should provide companies in all stages of their growth and from all industries with the opportunity for an IPO, particularly an IPO that represents a capital raising mechanism for the company, instead of a liquidity event for insiders.</p>
<p class="text-align-center">***</p>
<p>Now, the reforms that I have just outlined are a worthwhile and necessary beginning. They will help capital flow faster and more freely to its highest and best use, which is to say toward human initiative and ingenuity. And they will help to guide the SEC back to the bedrock pecuniary fundamentals on which our mandate is based.</p>
<p>But these are only the first steps in a broader effort to realign our markets with their most fundamental purpose, which is to place the full measure of American might where it belongs: in the hands of our citizens instead of the regulatory state.</p>
<p>As we look forward to America&rsquo;s 250th year, let us remember that no nation has ever entrusted so much agency to the individual&mdash;and no nation has been so plentifully rewarded for it. And yet, even as the weight of history and evidence affirm this truth, some in our society have come to question whether the capital markets remain the most reliable engine for upward mobility. They presume that the politically prescribed allocation of capital is superior to that of free market forces. They call to &ldquo;seize the means of production.&rdquo; They contend, often through artful, alliterative slogans, that decisions made by the government are more efficient and more just than those made by the governed. They ask, &ldquo;Can capitalism propel people past the circumstances of their birth or background?&rdquo; Can it reflect our highest values?</p>
<p>I, for one, believe emphatically that it can&mdash;and history has proven it. For, at its best, capital is the instrument through which an individual can marshal the resources of a free society in pursuit of shared prosperity. It is the instrument through which we can create value in the lives of others by creating value in our own. Indeed, our markets are a deeply moral enterprise because they are a mutually beneficial one. Because every exchange holds the potential to lift both parties. Because our markets affirm the dignity of the human spirit and liberate its potential to invent, to build, to innovate, and to flourish as no other alternative can.</p>
<p>This is precisely why our work at the Securities and Exchange Commission matters. Because when our capital markets are strong, they amplify that sense of dignity on a global scale. Because no force has lifted more people from poverty, widened more paths to opportunity, or solved more of society&rsquo;s most intractable problems than capital investments through our capital markets.</p>
<p>In the coming months, we will pursue the reforms that I have discussed today, and several others, with the urgency and care that they command. We will work closely with Congress and the Administration. We will listen carefully to market participants and to investors. And we will proceed steadily with the confidence that comes from standing on sound principles and a clear mandate. But above all, we will proceed with the resolve worthy of a people ever agitating to be prosperous.</p>
<p class="text-align-center">***</p>
<p>In closing, I believe that our capital markets are more than the mechanisms of finance&mdash;they are, at their core, expressions of our national character. A character that has compelled generations of Americans to take risks and to reap the rewards. To innovate endlessly and restlessly. To believe that the future is ours to make.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So as America&rsquo;s 250th anniversary approaches, the question before us is not whether our entrepreneurs have the capacity to reinvigorate our capital markets, but whether we, as regulators, have the will.</p>
<p>In this new day at the SEC, and under President Trump&rsquo;s leadership, I am pleased to report that we do.</p>
<p>Indeed, I am confident that we will preserve the promise of our capital markets for the next quarter millennium and well beyond. I trust that we will summon anew the enterprising spirit that Hamilton divined would be the source of our strength. And I believe that we will ensure that the American story, which began in many ways just steps outside, is preserved not by memory or speeches alone, but by the courage of those who are determined to chart its next chapter.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your time today. You all have been a patient and indulgent audience. And I look forward to the work ahead of us. Thank you.</p>

<title>An Illusion Of Legality: Wildlife Laundering In Colombia And Mexico</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/an-illusion-of-legality-wildlife-laundering-in-colombia-and-mexico-2025122/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/an-illusion-of-legality-wildlife-laundering-in-colombia-and-mexico-2025122/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><b>&ldquo;Wildlife laundering poses a serious risk to national and international security, causing environmental and socioeconomic harms and creating opportunities for organised crime and conflict actors.&rdquo;</b></p>
<p>This is according to&nbsp;<b><i><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/research-papers/illusion-legality-wildlife-laundering-colombia-and-mexico" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">An Illusion of Legality: Wildlife Laundering in Colombia and Mexico</a></i>,&nbsp;</b>a new RUSI report by&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.rusi.org/people/scotland" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><b>Jennifer Scotland</b></a><b>&nbsp;</b>and&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.rusi.org/people/weeden" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><b>&nbsp;</b></a><b><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.rusi.org/people/weeden" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.rusi.org/people/weeden</a></b>&nbsp;which says rogue traders and criminal organisations &minus; including drug-trafficking cartels and armed groups &ndash; are exploiting supposedly legitimate wildlife industries to launder illicit profits and mask the illegal origins of high-value species, including big cats, caimans, sharks and poison frogs.</p>
<p>This groundbreaking analysis shows how, in Colombia and Mexico, breeding farms, wildlife sanctuaries, commercial traders and seafood companies are used to disguise the extraction, transport and export of illegally harvested species, as part of&nbsp;a global illegal wildlife market estimated to be worth US$20 billion annually.</p>
<p>The report says that big cats in Mexico &minus; including lions, tigers and jaguars &minus; face significant wildlife-laundering risks through poorly regulated wildlife sanctuaries, which can be used as fronts for illegal trade, under the guise of rescue or rehabilitation. Large shipments of big cats from Mexican sanctuaries to overseas facilities have raised international concern, underscoring vulnerabilities created by weak oversight, limited inspections, and potential collusion between operators and corrupt officials.</p>
<p>In Colombia, the report identifies how the large-scale trade in caiman skins for the fashion industry has been highly exposed to wildlife laundering, with roughly one-third of exports between 1990 and 2016 reportedly illegally wild-sourced. The report finds that strict controls on the breeding of other endangered species has driven the trade underground, causing them to be smuggled out of Colombia and integrated into &lsquo;legal&rsquo; breeding operations in other countries. Poison frogs &ndash; sourced by rural Colombian harvesters for as little as $0.50 &ndash; can fetch up to US$850 in international hobbyist markets, demonstrating how wildlife laundering benefits fraudulent breeders at the expense of vulnerable communities.</p>
<p>The report further describes how some armed groups have used illegal pirarucu fishing to launder drug-trafficking proceeds, moving fish across borders &ndash; sometimes alongside cocaine &ndash; to circumvent national controls. Similar criminal convergence is found in Mexico&rsquo;s shark fin and sea cucumber trades, where large-scale buyers and exporters with suspected cartel links have laundered illegally harvested products into legal supply chains in the US and Asia.</p>
<p>Jennifer Scotland, the lead author of the report, said: &ldquo;Our report shows how rogue actors and organised crime groups subvert the legal trade in endangered wildlife to further their own gains, harming biodiversity and undermining economic opportunities for local communities. To mitigate these harms, wildlife laundering needs to be taken much more seriously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth Helena Alves da Mota, Content Partnership Manager at LSEG Risk Intelligence, which supported RUSI&rsquo;s independent research, said:<b>&nbsp;</b>&ldquo;The findings underscore that combating wildlife laundering requires a collective effort &ndash; particularly intelligence sharing across borders, sectors, and disciplines are critical to dismantling transnational networks and ensuring that legal markets do not become safe havens for illegal trade.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Key Findings</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Organised crime groups&nbsp;</b>&ndash;&nbsp;<b>including cartel-linked actors&nbsp;</b>&ndash;&nbsp;<b>use legal businesses to launder wildlife.</b>&nbsp;The report says: &ldquo;Corporate entities&hellip; can be used by rogue traders and organised criminal groups&hellip; to exploit regulatory and enforcement gaps and launder illegally sourced species.&rdquo;</li>
<li><b>Wildlife laundering is under-detected and rarely treated as a serious crime.</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;Documented cases &ndash; let alone follow-up criminal investigations &ndash; remain few and far between.&rdquo;</li>
<li><b>Weak enforcement capacity enables criminal infiltration of supply chains.</b><br />&ldquo;Wildlife laundering&hellip; is predominantly enabled by weak enforcement capacity and limited resources.&rdquo;</li>
<li><b>Cartels exploit regulatory loopholes and cross-border asymmetries.</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;Opportunities for illicit actors to engage in wildlife laundering are facilitated by regulatory asymmetries, legal loopholes, informalities across the sector and limited enforcement of fishing regulations.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Key Recommendations</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Close loopholes used by criminal groups to disguise illegal activity.</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;Preventive reforms could target known loopholes, including those highlighted in this paper.&rdquo;</li>
<li><b>Classify wildlife trafficking as a predicate offence for money laundering.</b><br />&ldquo;By making wildlife trafficking a predicate offence for money laundering&hellip; authorities could disrupt the financial infrastructure that sustains trafficking networks.&rdquo;</li>
<li><b>Strengthen international cooperation and destination-country due diligence.</b><br />&ldquo;Greater accessibility of information around CITES permits would strengthen oversight&hellip; and make it easier&hellip; to detect fraudulent paperwork.&rdquo;</li>
<li><b>Expand the use of technological tools to expose criminal laundering methods.&nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Advances in technology offer the potential to address a number of traceability and species identification challenges that facilitate wildlife laundering.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>Wildlife laundering in Colombia and Mexico is not only a conservation issue but a security threat that enables organised crime and conflict actors to diversify their income streams, legitimise illicit proceeds and deepen their influence across rural communities and transnational markets. By revealing how legal businesses can be manipulated to conceal illegal wildlife flows, the report underscores the urgent need for a systemic shift in enforcement and regulatory strategies. Tackling wildlife laundering effectively requires authorities to target corporate structures, disrupt financial networks, strengthen international coordination and recognise wildlife laundering as a serious transnational crime.</p>
<p>Wildlife laundering cases remain rarely detected, let alone investigated as organised criminal activity. Irregularities in licensed wildlife businesses are typically handled as administrative breaches, obscuring the role of cartel financiers, corrupt officials and corporate intermediaries who profit from the trade. The authors argue that unless authorities adopt a more robust, cross-border and intelligence-led approach, wildlife laundering will continue to provide criminal groups with a lucrative, low-risk revenue stream that deepens insecurity, threatens biodiversity and undermines community livelihoods.</p>

<title>Purdue University/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer: Better Outlook For The Future Pushes Farmer Sentiment Higher In Europe</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>November brought the highest farmer sentiment reading since June, with the&nbsp;<a href="https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4570229-1&amp;h=2593938520&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fageconomybarometer%2F&amp;a=Purdue+University%2FCME+Group+Ag+Economy+Barometer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="xn-org">Purdue University</span>/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer</a>&nbsp;jumping 10 points from October to 139. The increase was driven primarily by producers' more optimistic outlook for the future, as the Future Expectations Index climbed 15 points to 144, while the Current Conditions Index dipped 2 points to 128. November's survey is the first conducted after the late-October announcement of a U.S.-<span class="xn-location">China</span>&nbsp;trade pact that includes provisions to expand U.S. agricultural exports and revealed a notable improvement in producers' confidence in future export opportunities. Sentiment also received support from a sharp rise in crop prices between mid-October and mid-November. The barometer survey took place&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">Nov. 10-14</span>.</p>
<p>Producers were more optimistic about their farms' financial performance in November, with the Farm Financial Performance Index increasing by 14 points to 92. The percentage of producers expecting better financial results this year grew to 24%, up from 16% in October. A sharp rise in crop prices from mid-October to mid-November was a key driver of the expectation for better financial performance. For example, eastern Corn Belt prices for fall delivery of corn and soybeans increased 10% and 15%, respectively, during that period. The stronger financial outlook in the crop sector compensated for a weaker outlook in the livestock sector, where declining cattle prices weighed on financial expectations. Despite the improved farm financial outlook, the Farm Capital Investment Index fell 6 points to 56, with only 16% of respondents indicating that now is a good time to make major investments in their operations.</p>
<p>"Producers became more optimistic about U.S. agricultural trade prospects in November. That coincided with a rise in crop prices, which led to farmers' improved expectations for their farms' financial performance and an improvement in farmer sentiment," said&nbsp;<a href="https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4570229-1&amp;h=300100255&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fhome%2Fteam%2Fmichael-langemeier%2F&amp;a=Michael+Langemeier" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="xn-person">Michael Langemeier</span></a>, the barometer's principal investigator and director of&nbsp;<span class="xn-org">Purdue's</span>&nbsp;<a href="https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4570229-1&amp;h=243308766&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fhome%2F&amp;a=Center+for+Commercial+Agriculture" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Center for Commercial Agriculture</a>.</p>
<p>Producers were more optimistic about future agricultural trade prospects in November. In response to a question included in every barometer survey since&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">January 2019</span>, just 7% of respondents said they expect U.S. agricultural exports to weaken over the next five years, down from 14% in October and 30% in March. In a related question, 47% of corn producers indicated they expect soybean exports to increase over the next five years, while 8% anticipate a decline. The stronger trade outlook likely contributed to the overall improvement in sentiment observed in November.</p>
<p>A majority of producers in November reported that they still expect to receive a supplementary support payment from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, similar to the 2019 Market Facilitation Program (MFP). However, confidence in receiving the payment fell sharply in November: Only 16% of respondents said an MFP payment was "very likely," down from 62% in September. Still, when combining the "likely" and "very likely" categories, just over three-fourths of producers (76%) said they expect an MFP payment, compared to 83% in September. Regarding how they plan to use an MFP payment, 58% of respondents said they would use it to "pay down debt," up from 52% in October.</p>
<p>For the second month in a row, the Short-Term Farmland Value Expectations Index increased, reaching 116 in November, which is 3 points higher than October and 10 points above September. Farmers' long-term outlook on farmland values also improved, with the Long-Term Farmland Value Expectations Index increasing by 4 points to a record high of 165. The November survey also asked corn producers about their expectations for 2026 cash rental rates. Nearly three-fourths of respondents (74%) said they expect rental rates to remain roughly the same as this year, consistent with responses from the July and August surveys. The relatively strong outlook for cash rent further supports farmland values.</p>
<p>"The record-high reading of the Long-Term Farmland Value Expectations Index indicates that farmers retain an optimistic long-run outlook for agriculture," Langemeier said. "Although rising crop prices and improved trade prospects have bolstered optimism, producers remain cautious in their investment and production decisions, reflecting the short-term uncertainty they face."</p>
<p>The November survey asked corn producers about possible changes to their production practices in 2026 due to expected weak operating margins. Among those producers planning to make adjustments, two practices were highlighted most often: switching to lower-cost seed traits or varieties and reducing phosphorus applications. Producers followed up by pointing to reductions in corn seeding rates and nitrogen application rates as potential changes. Still, a substantial portion of producers (40%) said they do not plan to make any changes to their corn production practices in 2026.</p>
<p>Recent barometer surveys have included questions on farmers' attitudes toward 2025 policy shifts. A majority of respondents in November (59%) and October (58%) said they expect U.S. tariffs to ultimately strengthen the agricultural economy. This is lower than last spring, when 70% of respondents anticipated that tariffs would have a long-term positive effect. The percentage of producers expressing uncertainty about the long-term impact of U.S. tariff policy has risen in recent months. In October, 16% of respondents said they were uncertain, rising slightly to 17% in November, roughly double the 8% reported in April and May. Meanwhile, two-thirds of farmers (67%) in the November survey said the U.S. is headed in the "right direction," down from 72% in October.</p>

<title>Euronext Signs The Armed Forces Covenant In The United Kingdom</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/euronext-signs-the-armed-forces-covenant-in-the-united-kingdom-2025122/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/euronext-signs-the-armed-forces-covenant-in-the-united-kingdom-2025122/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Euronext, the leading European capital market infrastructure, today signed the Armed Forces Covenant with the United Kingdom&rsquo;s Ministry of Defence. This is the fifth partnership signed by Euronext with local military reserves in Europe. With these partnerships, Euronext reaffirms its commitment to European resilience and strategic autonomy.</p>
<p>These partnerships extend the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.euronext.com/en/about/media/euronext-press-releases/euronext-strengthens-its-support-for-european-strategic">initiatives related to Energy, Security and Geostrategy, the &ldquo;New ESG&rdquo;</a>, launched by Euronext on 6 May 2025 to strengthen European strategic autonomy. This set of initiatives led by Euronext enhances the visibility of European companies operating in strategic sectors and provides them with unprecedented tools to meet their financing needs through improved access to capital. These solutions also address the growing demand from asset managers, institutional investors and retail investors for better exposure to high-growth segments through thematic indices.</p>
<p>As European strategic autonomy and independence rely on the ability of European citizens to take part in their country&rsquo;s own defence ecosystem, Euronext has created a support framework for its employees who are already engaged in a reservist commitment, or who wish to take up this opportunity. As of 6 May 2025, Euronext guarantees the continuation of salary and social benefits for preliminary training periods of up to 15 days for all new reservists, and up to 10 days per year for all Euronext employees engaged in a reservist commitment across all the group&rsquo;s European locations. In countries where a more beneficial local reservist support system exists, the existing framework prevails.</p>
<p>To formalise this engagement, Euronext has signed partnerships with five national military reserves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In London, Euronext signed a partnership with the UK military reserve, the UK Reserve Forces, in the form of the Armed Forces Covenant, on 2 December 2025. The Covenant was cosigned by Brigadier Sam Cates, Deputy Commander HQ London District, in a ceremony that took place in the historic Wellington Room, Horse Guards. The event reflected the deep military ties and security interests that bind the United Kingdom and the countries in which Euronext operates regulated markets.</p>
<p>In Amsterdam, Euronext signed a partnership with the Dutch military reserve, the Korps Nationale Reserve, on 12 November 2025. To mark this occasion, Gijs Tuinman, Dutch State Secretary for Defence, sounded the gong at the stock exchange, in the presence of Colonel Ruben Koopman, Head of the Department of Reservists and Society, and Lieutenant Colonel dr. Roland Slegers-Leijsten, Commander of the Korps National Reserve.</p>
<p>In Oslo, Euronext signed a partnership with the Norwegian military reserve, the Norwegian Home Guard, on 3 November 2025. The partnership was signed during the annual keynote addresses from the Norwegian Army and the Norwegian Home Guard, in the presence of his Majesty Harald V, King of Norway, Major General Lars Lervik, Chief of the Norwegian Army and Major General Frode Ommundsen, Chief of the Norwegian Home Guard.</p>
<p>In Paris, Euronext signed a partnership with the French military reserve, the Garde nationale, on 1 October 2025. General Fran&ccedil;ois-Xavier<span>&nbsp;</span>Poisbeau, General Secretary of the French National Guard, presented the main aspects of the partnership, while Baptiste Mercier, Head of Operational Performance at Allianz France, and Coralie Lecouffe, Senior Consultant at Capgemini Invent, shared personal experiences from their engagement as reservists.</p>
<p>In Copenhagen, Euronext signed a partnership with the Danish military reserve, InterForce Danmark, on 19 September 2025. Local employees had the opportunity to meet with members of the reservist forces, who shared insights about their experience and highlighted how military reservists support Denmark&rsquo;s resilience.</p>
<p><span>St&eacute;phane Boujnah, CEO and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext, said:</span>&nbsp;<em>"Since September 2025, Euronext has signed partnerships with local military reserves in Denmark, France, Norway, the Netherlands, and now the United Kingdom. Through these five local partnerships in Europe, Euronext reinforces its commitment to strengthen European resilience and strategic autonomy, at a time of rising geopolitical tensions. I am deeply proud of this citizen engagement that enables our colleagues to put their skills and abilities to the service of their countries. These initiatives demonstrate the power of cross-border collaboration and highlight Euronext&rsquo;s role as a unifying force in Europe&rsquo;s capital markets.&rdquo;</em></p>

<title>Bank Of England: Financial Policy Committee Record - December 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="section-heading">
<h2 id="chapter-0">Record of the Financial Policy Committee meetings on 25 November 2025 and 1 December</h2>
<div class="box-highlight">
<h3><a id="_Hlk193965425"></a>Headline judgements and policy actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><span>Risks to financial stability have increased during 2025.&nbsp;</span>Global risks remain elevated and material uncertainty in the global macroeconomic outlook persists. Key sources of risk include geopolitical tensions, fragmentation of trade and financial markets, and pressures on sovereign debt markets.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>In the FPC&rsquo;s judgement, many risky asset valuations remain materially stretched, particularly for technology companies focused on Artificial Intelligence (AI).&nbsp;</span>The role of debt financing in this sector is increasing quickly as AI-focused firms seek large scale infrastructure investment. Deeper links between AI firms and credit markets, and increasing interconnections between those firms, mean that, should an asset price correction occur, losses on lending could increase financial stability risks.</li>
<li><span>Credit spreads remain compressed by historical standards.&nbsp;</span>Two recent high-profile corporate defaults in the US have intensified focus on potential weaknesses in risky credit markets previously flagged by the FPC. These include high leverage, weak underwriting standards, opacity, complex structures and the degree of reliance on rating agencies. While the impact of these specific defaults has been limited, a diverse range of financial market participants were exposed. It is important that market participants have a clear understanding of their exposures, including in stress scenarios where correlations and losses can shift outside historical norms, that underwriting standards are robust, and that they do not over-rely on credit ratings as a substitute for carrying out due diligence.</li>
<li><span>Public debt-to-GDP ratios in many advanced economies have continued to rise this year.&nbsp;</span>Governments globally face spending pressures, given the context of changing demographics and geopolitical risk, potentially constraining their capacity to respond to future shocks. Significant shocks to the global economic or fiscal outlook, should they materialise, could be amplified by vulnerabilities in market-based finance (MBF), such as leveraged positions in sovereign debt markets.</li>
<li><span>As an open economy with a large financial centre, the UK is exposed to global shocks, that could transmit through multiple, interconnected channels.&nbsp;</span>Stress in one market, such as a sharp asset price correction or correlation shift, could spillover into other markets. Simultaneous&nbsp;de-risking by banks and non-banks can&nbsp;lead to fire sales, widening spreads and&nbsp;tightening financing conditions for UK households and corporates. Market participants&nbsp;should ensure their&nbsp;risk management incorporates such scenarios.</li>
<li><span>UK household and corporate aggregate indebtedness remains low. The UK banking system is well capitalised, maintains robust liquidity and funding positions, and asset quality remains strong.&nbsp;</span>The results of the 2025 Bank Capital Stress Test demonstrate that the UK banking system is able to continue to support growth even if economic and financial conditions turned out to be materially worse than expected.</li>
<li><span>As part of ensuring the UK banking sector is both resilient and able to support growth, the FPC has reviewed its assessment of the appropriate level of capital requirements for the UK banking system.&nbsp;</span>The Committee judges that the appropriate benchmark for the system-wide level of Tier 1 capital requirements is now around 13% of risk-weighted assets (RWAs) (equivalent to a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of around 11%), 1 percentage point lower than its previous benchmark of around 14%. That judgement is consistent with the evolution in the financial system since the FPC&rsquo;s first assessment in 2015, including a fall in banks&rsquo; average risk weights, a reduction in the systemic importance of some banks, and improvements in risk measurement. The Committee has also identified areas for further work, including on buffer usability, the implementation of the leverage ratio in the UK, and initiatives by the Bank to respond to feedback on interactions, proportionality, and complexity.</li>
<li><span>In response to the Chancellor&rsquo;s request on the FPC&rsquo;s November 2024 remit letter, the FPC has assessed and identified areas where the financial sector could contribute further to supporting sustainable growth.&nbsp;</span>This work has focused on: facilitating long-term investment in productive assets; fostering technological innovation; and the supply of debt or equity finance to high-growth firms (HGFs), which make an outsized contribution to economic growth and employment growth.</li>
<li><span>The FPC supports</span>:&nbsp;the changes made by the PRA to Solvency II to encourage investment in productive assets by UK insurers (noting the industry&rsquo;s commitment to invest &pound;100 billion in UK productive assets over 10 years); work to ease impediments to HGFs accessing funding; and efforts by authorities and industry to deliver practical advancements in the UK financial system&rsquo;s adoption of innovative technology.</li>
<li><span>The FPC has maintained the UK countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) rate at 2%.&nbsp;</span>Although the global risk environment remains elevated, UK household and corporate aggregate indebtedness remains low. The easing of credit conditions since the FPC's Q3 meeting has been in line with the macroeconomic outlook, with some additional easing in the mortgage market related to policy developments.</li>
<li><span>The Committee supports the Bank&rsquo;s plans for a private markets system-wide exploratory scenario (SWES).&nbsp;</span>This would deepen understanding of the private markets ecosystem, including how firms' behaviours in stress might interact and whether these interactions could amplify stress across the financial system and pose risks to UK financial stability and the provision of finance to the UK real economy.</li>
<li><span>Heightened geopolitical tensions and continued advances in technology have underlined the critical importance of operational resilience to the provision of vital services to households and businesses.&nbsp;</span>The Committee supports further actions to be taken by firms and financial market infrastructures (FMIs) to build resilience to operational disruption.</li>
<li><span>The Committee welcomes the Bank's recent consultation paper setting out its proposed regulatory regime for sterling-denominated systemic stablecoins.&nbsp;</span>The regime should aim to support responsible innovation in payments and money and avoid a disorderly transition as this new form of money is adopted.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>1: The Financial Policy Committee (FPC) seeks to ensure the UK financial system is prepared for, and resilient to, the wide range of risks it could face, so that it is able to absorb rather than amplify shocks, and serve UK households and businesses, thus supporting stability and long-term growth in the UK economy.</p>
<p>2: The Committee met on 25 November 2025 to agree its view on the outlook for UK financial stability. The FPC discussed the risks faced by the UK financial system and assessed the resilience of the system to those risks. On that basis, the Committee agreed its intended policy actions.</p>
<p>3: The Committee met subsequently on 1 December 2025, with the Prudential Regulation Committee (PRC), to confirm its response to the final results of the 2025 Bank Capital Stress Test.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-0">The overall risk environment</h3>
<p>4: The FPC discussed recent developments in financial markets; global vulnerabilities; UK household and corporate debt vulnerabilities; and the resilience of the UK banking sector and market-based finance. The FPC&rsquo;s judgements for these areas would be set out in the December 2025&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-stability-report/2025/december-2025">Financial Stability Report</a>&nbsp;(FSR).</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-1">Contributing to sustainable growth</h3>
<p>5: The Committee agreed that maintaining financial stability was a necessary foundation for sustainable economic growth. Periods of financial instability &ndash; such as the global financial crisis (GFC) &ndash; had negatively impacted the provision of vital services to households and businesses in the UK and weighed on output and productivity growth. In contrast, a stable financial system supports lower risk and term premia, lowering the cost of borrowing and improving incentives to invest in long-term productive investment.</p>
<p>6: The FPC primarily contributes to sustainable economic growth by maintaining financial stability through identifying, monitoring and addressing systemic risks to the UK financial sector, as required under its statutory objective. The Committee also has a secondary objective of supporting the Government&rsquo;s economic policy, including in relation to growth and employment. The FPC judged that these objectives were complementary over the medium to long-term: financial stability was necessary for sustainable growth, and sustainable growth supported financial stability.</p>
<p>7: The Committee noted that over the past 15 years, UK labour productivity growth had been low by historical standards and relative to some other advanced economies. The financial sector plays a role in contributing to productivity growth by providing vital services to UK households and businesses, including the provision of financing for investment in capital and technology. But there are a broader range of factors across the economy at play, such as trade conditions, scientific and technological innovation and human capital.</p>
<p>8: The Committee agreed that factors other than financial regulation had been the primary driver of low investment and so low productivity. The volume of lending to the UK real economy had not decreased as a share of GDP in the long run, and the increased diversification of the UK financial system had enhanced the supply of productive finance to the real economy.</p>
<p>9: The Committee observed that lending to UK households and corporates had in the past fluctuated due to changes in financial and macroeconomic conditions. Incentives in the financial system in the past had led to unsustainable lending growth in boom times followed by periods of deleveraging during the resulting downturn. However, post-GFC regulation had increased bank resilience. Combined with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2023/useful-usable-and-used-buffer-usability-during-the-covid-19-crisis.pdf" target="_blank">FPC&rsquo;s use of the countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) in stress<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external"></span></a><span>,</span>&nbsp;this had enabled the banking sector to continue to support households and businesses through recent shocks to the economy.</p>
<p>10: In working to advance its primary objective, the FPC would continue to take steps to ensure that its resilience-building policies were implemented efficiently in a way that supported sustainable growth as the financial system evolved.</p>
<h4>How the UK financial sector can better contribute to sustainable economic growth</h4>
<p>11: In November 2024, via the Committee&rsquo;s annual&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/remit-and-recommendations-for-the-financial-policy-committee-november-2024" target="_blank">remit letter<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external"></span></a>, the Chancellor asked the FPC to undertake work to assess and identify areas where there is potential to increase the ability of the financial system to contribute to sustainable economic growth and potential solutions to the impediments the sector might face in doing so. The Committee discussed the conclusions of this work.</p>
<p>12: The Committee had agreed in its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-policy-committee-record/2025/april-2025">April 2025 Record</a>&nbsp;that its work in response to the Chancellor&rsquo;s commission would focus on improving the long-term productive growth capacity of the economy by identifying barriers to the provision of credit and vital services to the real economy by the financial services sector. The FPC had focused on the provision of finance to high growth firms (HGFs) because they made an outsized contribution to economic and employment growth in the UK and globally.</p>
<p>13: The FPC agreed that HGFs faced growing challenges in accessing domestic finance. The FPC identified three impediments to the supply of debt or equity finance to HGFs. First, HGFs found it progressively more difficult to raise funds as funding rounds got larger, due to an underdeveloped domestic funding landscape. Second, HGF finance could be an extremely complex funding ecosystem for funders and founders to navigate. And third, many HGFs had little tangible collateral, and HGFs struggled to secure lending using intellectual property (IP) as collateral due to valuation and recovery constraints.</p>
<p>14: In addition, the FPC noted that UK pension funds and insurers faced barriers in supporting&nbsp;long-term capital investment in the UK economy.&nbsp;The Committee&nbsp;identified&nbsp;the impediments to the investment of long-term capital by pension funds and insurers. First, UK&nbsp;Defined Contribution (DC) pension schemes&nbsp;were smaller in scale and&nbsp;allocated&nbsp;less to riskier assets than international peers. Second, UK insurers reported a lack of&nbsp;opportunities to invest domestically&nbsp;that&nbsp;align with their expertise and risk and reward targets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>15: The FPC noted the package of measures announced by HM Treasury in the Budget. The Committee also underscored the importance of considering greater use of public-private partnership funding initiatives to channel financing to HGFs and the broader population of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to support productivity improvements. The FPC noted the key role the British Business Bank could play in this context, building on the experience of a number of other countries with similar organisations.</p>
<p>16: The FPC also identified&nbsp;issues in the financial sector&rsquo;s responsible adoption of innovative technology.&nbsp;First, the technology cost of building and&nbsp;maintaining&nbsp;resilience against cyber threats was&nbsp;challenging&nbsp;for&nbsp;new and&nbsp;small&nbsp;FinTechs. Many cyberattacks target third-party suppliers &ndash; which FinTechs often aspire to become &ndash; as a point of entry into larger corporates. The costs of cyberattacks could be large, and elevated geopolitical tensions and continued advances in technology had increased the potential for operational incidents to disrupt the provision of vital services (see below). Second, the UK&rsquo;s payments infrastructure needed to keep pace with innovation to support economic activity. Seamless and frictionless payments are critical to economic activity. Coordinated action and investment was needed to create the next generation of payment infrastructure that drives innovation, supports competition, and ensures security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>17: Having considered the above, the Committee concluded that it would:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support&nbsp;the changes made by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) to Solvency II to encourage investment in productive assets by UK insurers. This included reforms to the Matching Adjustment (MA)&nbsp;regime &ndash; and the investment in UK productive assets the UK insurance industry had indicated those reforms would enable &ndash; and its introduction of a Matching Adjustment Investment Accelerator (MAIA).&nbsp; As part of this, the FPC noted the UK insurance industry&rsquo;s commitment to invest &pound;100 billion in UK productive assets over 10 years.</li>
<li>Support work led by other authorities to ease impediments to HGFs accessing funding. This included the use of public-private partnership funding initiatives to channel financing to HGFs and the broader populations of SMEs, and engaging with the working group established as part of HMG's Industrial Strategy with the aim of removing barriers to IP-backed lending.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Support efforts by authorities and industry to deliver practical advancements in the UK financial system&rsquo;s adoption of innovative technology, including through the National Payments Vision, the Bank&rsquo;s AI Consortium and the Financial Conduct Authority&rsquo;s (FCA) AI Lab&rsquo;s Live Testing service.</li>
</ul>
<p>18: Given the importance of sustainable economic growth to the FPC&rsquo;s objectives, the FPC would closely monitor progress on these issues and remained committed to identifying further ways in which it could deliver on its objective to support economic growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>19: Further details on the FPC&rsquo;s findings in relation to sustainable growth would be published in the December 2025&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-stability-report/2025/december-2025">FSR</a>.</p>

<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-2">The FPC&rsquo;s assessment of bank capital requirements</h3>
<p>20: The FPC revisited its assessment of the appropriate benchmark level of capital requirements for the banking system. Details of the assessment would be published in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-stability-in-focus/2025/fsif-the-fpcs-assessment-of-bank-capital-requirements">Financial Stability in Focus</a>&nbsp;(FSIF), published alongside the December FSR. The FPC welcomed feedback and evidence from a broad range of stakeholders on it and on the issues identified for further assessment.</p>
<p>21: The Committee judged that the updated appropriate benchmark for the system-wide level of Tier 1 capital requirements was now around 13% of RWAs (equivalent to a CET1 ratio of around 11%), 1 percentage point lower than its previous benchmark of around 14%. That judgement was consistent with the evolution in the financial system since the FPC&rsquo;s first assessment in 2015, including a fall in banks&rsquo; average risk weights, a reduction in the systemic importance of some banks, and improvements in risk measurement.&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk215496340"></a>Given the reduction in the FPC&rsquo;s benchmark, banks should have greater certainty and confidence in using their capital resources to lend to UK households and businesses.</p>
<p>22: The FPC's system-wide Tier 1 benchmark excluded firm-specific PRA buffers, and requirements set by overseas authorities such as the international component of the CCyB. Within the banking system there would be a distribution of capital requirements in practice reflecting individual banks&rsquo; business models, their level of systemic importance, the degree of gaps and mismeasurement in their risk weighted assets, and the PRA&rsquo;s view of firm-specific risks.</p>
<p>23: In undertaking its review, the FPC had considered how capital requirements had evolved since previous assessments, and feedback it had received from industry and other stakeholders. The FPC noted that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Average risk-weights had fallen as banks had changed the composition and riskiness of their balance sheets.</li>
<li>Systemic buffers were lower than envisaged in 2015 as some banks had decreased in systemic importance.</li>
<li>The implementation of Basel 3.1 on 1 January 2027 would improve risk measurement, allowing the PRA to reduce Pillar 2A minimum requirements by around &frac12; percentage point.</li>
</ul>
<p>24: The FPC considered that the inbuilt responsiveness of nominal capital requirements in the UK banking system &ndash; to falls in average risks weights, decreases in UK banks&rsquo; systemic importance, and improvements in the measurement of risk weights &ndash; reflected desirable flexibility in the capital framework. Flexibility in the framework meant that capital requirements could continue to respond to developments in underlying structural and cyclical factors in future, including if risk levels were to change.</p>
<p>25: UK banks had tended to have capital headroom over regulatory minimum and buffer requirements. Such headroom varied considerably across banks and over time. Currently, banks in aggregate had CET1 capital resources of about 2% of RWAs over their requirements. While the PRA and FPC had no requirements &ndash; formal or informal &ndash; for capital headroom, banks maintain this additional capital for a number of reasons, including a perceived lack of buffer usability.</p>
<p>26: The FPC also considered how the level of capital requirements in the UK compared to international peers. Comparing capital requirements across jurisdictions was challenging given differences in how risks were captured in different regulatory frameworks &ndash; for example, the UK and EU regulatory frameworks captured some risks through Pillar 2 capital add-ons, while the US framework under law instead tended to apply higher risk weights.</p>
<p>27: The level of risk-based capital requirements for large banks in the UK was broadly similar to that in the euro area. And analysis that attempted to adjust for some key differences in the way risks were captured between the UK and US suggested that the level in the UK was lower than that in the US. That said, UK requirements appeared to be higher than in other jurisdictions for some more specific aspects and cohorts, particularly leverage ratio requirements for large domestically focused banks.</p>
<p>28: The Committee considered that the change in its benchmark was consistent with its view that the banking sector could support long-term growth in the real economy in both<span>&nbsp;</span>current and adverse economic environments. This was supported by the results of the 2025 Bank Capital Stress Test, which demonstrated that the UK banking system could continue to support the economy even if economic and financial conditions turned out materially worse than expected.</p>
<p>29: The FPC had considered updated evidence related to its previous judgements on the economic costs and benefits of capital and reviewed external academic studies that provided independent estimates of appropriate capital levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>The FPC reaffirmed that its previous judgements related to the positive impact of post-crisis reforms remained appropriate. Those judgements were related to credible and effective resolution arrangements, effective supervision, structural reform such as the implementation of ring-fencing, and the Committee&rsquo;s active use of the time-varying countercyclical capital buffer. Together, these judgements materially reduced the FPC&rsquo;s assessment of the appropriate level of capital in 2015.</li>
<li>Updated analysis suggested that the macroeconomic costs of bank capital may have declined as the spread between banks&rsquo; cost of equity and the average cost of their debt had fallen. At the same time, various developments may have impacted the macroeconomic benefits of bank capital. Global vulnerabilities, including risks associated with sovereign indebtedness, had increased. But conversely, the indebtedness of UK households and businesses had fallen, and banks&rsquo; underwriting standards had improved.</li>
<li>Analysis of the net macroeconomic impact of capital requirements suggested that the Committee&rsquo;s updated 13% benchmark was within, albeit towards the lower end of, the range of capital requirements that were likely to maximise the benefits to long-term growth. The FPC&rsquo;s updated benchmark was also at the lower end of the range of optimal capital levels estimated in the external academic literature.</li>
<li>Analysis also suggested that reducing structural capital requirements materially below the FPC&rsquo;s updated benchmark of 13% (unless due to further improvements in risk measurement that allow overlaps to be removed from Pillar 2A requirements) could be associated with significant reductions in long-run expected GDP through the costs of greater instability, especially if those reductions in capital were to undermine the credibility of the resolution regime as a result of lower overall loss-absorbing capacity. Materially lower capital levels could also lead to higher risk premia on bank funding costs, which would in turn feed through to higher borrowing costs and lower investment by businesses.</li>
</ul>
<p>30: The FPC had also considered whether the capital framework might warrant adjustment to make it more effective, efficient and proportionate in the future, and to address any unintended consequences.</p>
<p>31: Significant steps were already being taken to address feedback and improve the efficiency and proportionality of the framework.<a id="_Hlk214369419"></a>&nbsp;The FPC had approached the assessment of capital requirements proactively and had identified further broad, material categories of issues in which it supported further work to assess whether changes could make the capital framework more effective, efficient and proportionate. The FPC would expect banks to use any such changes as a means to increase their support of households and businesses in the real economy.</p>
<p>32: Working with the PRA and international authorities, the FPC would work to enhance further the usability of regulatory buffers and so reduce banks&rsquo; incentives to have capital in excess of regulatory requirements and buffers. Regulatory capital buffers made up just under half of risk-weighted capital requirements. These buffers were explicitly intended to be usable to help banks absorb losses in stress while maintaining the provision of services to the real economy in a downturn &ndash; by reducing incentives for banks to deleverage in order to defend their capital position. Experience and a range of research suggested, however, that banks were reluctant in practice to use their buffers, which might have contributed to the size of banks&rsquo; management buffers above leverage ratio requirements.</p>
<p>33: The FPC would review the implementation of the leverage ratio in the UK, to ensure that it functioned as intended. When the FPC introduced the leverage ratio as a complement to the risk-weighted framework in 2015, it was envisaged that risk-weighted requirements would form the binding constraint for a majority of UK banks most of the time. Over time however, the falls in average risk weights had meant that the leverage ratio was becoming binding &ndash; or close to binding &ndash; for a greater number of lenders.</p>
<p>34: While there were reasons for the differences in application of the leverage ratio in the UK and some other countries, including previous macroprudential decisions by the FPC to apply buffers alongside Basel minimum standards, international comparisons also pointed to some potentially important areas to consider for reform. As a result, the FPC would review how the leverage ratio had been implemented in the UK, how it was operating in practice, how it was interacting with other policies such as ring-fencing, and whether this matched the original intention of the framework. For example, the FPC would explore the extent to which the leverage ratio had become more binding as a result of underlying reductions in the riskiness of banks&rsquo; exposures. The Committee intended to prioritise reviewing the UK&rsquo;s approach to regulatory buffers in leverage ratio requirements.</p>
<p>35: The FPC supported initiatives by the Bank to respond to feedback on interactions, proportionality, and complexity in the capital framework. This included further work to consider how the capital requirements that are related to domestic exposures interact. Capital requirements that were related to domestic exposures included the UK CCyB, O-SII buffers, and Pillar 2A requirements for geographic credit concentration risk, which each served different purposes in the capital framework, but were all calibrated based on measures of domestic lending. The FPC and the PRA intended to draw on several sources of information when conducting this work including on the impact of systemic failures and credit concentration, and banks&rsquo; stress test results. Other initiatives included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Further work to develop a systematic approach for updating regulatory thresholds that define which different parts of the regulatory framework apply to firms.</li>
<li>The PRA&rsquo;s contribution to the government&rsquo;s review of ring-fencing. The government had made clear its intention to maintain the ring-fencing regime to protect financial stability and safeguard depositors, while at the same time driving meaningful reform of the regime as part of plans to focus on growth and the release capital for productive investment in the UK. The PRA would also review the application of the Basel 3.1 output floor at the ring-fenced sub-group level, based on evidence and experience of its implementation. It would do so after Basel 3.1 is implemented but before full weighting of the output floor in 2030.</li>
<li>Reviewing feedback on the capital requirements for mortgages under internal ratings-based models, to ensure the framework enables an optimal channelling of finance to creditworthy households. Industry had previously raised concerns that Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) requirements were particularly difficult to meet for smaller and newer lenders. While aimed at exploring ways to address challenges faced by medium-sized firms, some policy changes would also affect larger lenders.</li>
</ul>
<p><a id="_Hlk215499855"></a>36: The FPC had previously judged that the introduction of International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 9 should not lead to an unwarranted increase in capital requirements. In response, and following engagement with industry, the Bank had made changes to the stress test relative to previous concurrent stress tests that were appropriate to make alongside the earlier provisioning under the IFRS 9 accounting standard. The FPC judged these changes had been effective in avoiding an unwarranted increase in capital arising from the interaction of IFRS 9 and the stress test, and made the test simpler and aligned with the accounting standard that would apply in an actual stress. The Bank therefore intended to maintain these changes for future tests (see below).</p>
<p>37: The FPC, along with the PRA, was interested in the views of a broad range of stakeholders &ndash; including UK lenders, think-tanks, industry groups, investors and academics &ndash; on the material covered in the accompanying FSIF on the FPC&rsquo;s assessment of bank capital requirements, and welcomed feedback and evidence on the issues identified for further assessment. The Bank would engage in structured evidence gathering sessions in early 2026.</p>
<p>38: Further details of the FPC&rsquo;s assessment would be published in an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-stability-in-focus/2025/fsif-the-fpcs-assessment-of-bank-capital-requirements">FSIF</a>, alongside the December 2025&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-stability-report/2025/december-2025">FSR</a>.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-0-3">Results of the 2025 Bank Capital Stress Test</h3>
<p>39: The Committee discussed the results of the 2025 Bank Capital Stress Test, which indicated that the major UK banks had the capacity to continue to support the economy through a stress scenario that incorporated a severe global aggregate supply shock, high advanced-economy inflation, higher global interest rates, deep and simultaneous recessions in the UK and global economies, with materially higher unemployment, and sharp falls in asset prices.</p>
<p>40: The stress test was not a forecast of macroeconomic and financial conditions in the UK or abroad. Rather, it was intended to be a coherent &lsquo;tail risk&rsquo; scenario designed to be severe and broad enough to allow the FPC and PRC to assess the resilience of UK banks to a range of adverse shocks. The results of the stress test are used to form a view of the resilience of the banking sector and individual banks in it as part of the FPC and PRC&rsquo;s broader framework for financial stability and safety and soundness.</p>
<p>41: The stress test results showed that the aggregate CET1 ratio reduced by 3.5 percentage points to the low point of the test. That left aggregate headroom to regulatory minima and systemic buffers at the low point of the stress of 3.2 percentage points CET1 (the equivalent of around &pound;60 billion). Most of this headroom arose from banks beginning the test with capital in excess of regulatory minima and buffer requirements.</p>
<p>42: However, the FPC had noted as part of its capital review that there were impediments to banks using their buffers in practice, which could have been contributing to bank&rsquo; incentives to maintain capital in excess of regulatory requirements. The FPC and PRC did not oblige firms to maintain buffers in excess of regulatory requirements. All elements of capital buffers that had been built up by banks existed to be used to support households and businesses during stress. The existence of usable buffers allowed banks to absorb losses without breaching minimum requirements, enabling them to meet the demand for credit from creditworthy households and businesses in the face of severe adverse shocks. As part of the next phase of its capital review (see above) the FPC would explore further steps that could be taken to enhance the usability of buffers.</p>
<p>43: At the individual firm level, all participating banks and building societies remained above their CET1 risk-weighted and Tier 1 leverage minimum regulatory requirements, and no bank was required to strengthen its capital position as a result of the test.</p>
<p>44: The results of the test supported the FPC&rsquo;s judgement that banks&rsquo; current levels of capital were sufficient to support the real economy. They showed that the UK banking system had the capacity to support UK households and businesses, even if economic, financial and business conditions became substantially worse than expected.</p>
<p>45: As in previous stress tests, banks&rsquo; resilience relied in part on their ability in stress to cut dividend payments, employee variable remuneration, and coupon payments on additional Tier 1 instruments, as well as other management actions taken in response to the stress. The FPC judged it important for investors to be aware that banks would take such actions as necessary if such a stress were to materialise.</p>
<p>46: The 2025 Bank Capital Stress Test was the first stress test since the end of transitional arrangements for the IFRS 9 accounting standard, introduced in 2018. In 2018, the FPC had stated that it would seek an enduring treatment for IFRS 9 in the stress test that avoided an unwarranted increase in capital requirements. Reflecting the increased resilience for a given level of capital provided by the earlier recognition of losses under IFRS 9, and following a review of the calibration of the stress tests, the Bank had implemented a number of changes relative to previous stress tests. These changes were designed to be consistent with an unchanged FPC and PRC risk tolerance for the resilience of the UK banking system.</p>
<p>47: In March, the Bank committed to using this year&rsquo;s test to assess the impact of these changes. The FPC judged that the changes had avoided an unwarranted increase in capital requirements and made the test simpler and more aligned with historical advanced economy stresses in terms of the size and timing of the shocks. It intended to maintain these changes for future stress tests and expected to return to assessing resilience against the benchmark of minimum capital requirements and systemic risk buffers.&nbsp; Further details would be set out in Box E of the FSR.</p>
<p>48: Further details of the 2025 Bank Capital Stress Test and the approach to IFRS 9 would be published in the December 2025&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-stability-report/2025/december-2025">FSR</a>.</p>
<p>49: Alongside the results of the Bank Capital Stress Test the FPC also welcomed the results of the Life Insurance Stress Test, published on 17 and 24 November.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-policy-committee-record/2025/december-2025#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;The results of the test indicated that the sector was resilient to a severe financial market stress scenario that incorporated a decline in risk-free interest rates, falls in equity and property prices, along with widening spreads and subsequent defaults and downgrades.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-4">The UK countercyclical capital buffer rate</h3>
<p>50: The FPC discussed its setting of the UK CCyB rate. The Committee&rsquo;s principal aim in setting the UK CCyB rate was to help ensure that the UK banking system was able to absorb severe but plausible shocks without an unwarranted restriction in essential services, such as the supply of credit, to the UK real economy. Setting the UK CCyB rate enabled the FPC to adjust the capital requirements of the UK banking system to the changing scale of risk of losses on banks&rsquo; UK exposures over the course of the financial cycle. The approach therefore included an assessment of financial vulnerabilities and banks&rsquo; capacity to absorb such losses, including the potential impact of shocks.</p>
<p>51: In considering the appropriate setting of the UK CCyB rate, the FPC discussed its judgements around underlying vulnerabilities that could amplify economic shocks. While the global risk environment remained elevated,<span>&nbsp;</span>UK household and corporate aggregate indebtedness remains low. The easing of credit conditions since the FPC's October meeting had been in line with the macroeconomic outlook, with some additional easing in the mortgage market related to policy developments.</p>
<p>52: The FPC observed that UK banks&rsquo; resilience to these risks continued to be supported by strong asset quality and strong capital positions. There was no evidence that banks were restricting lending to protect their capital positions.&nbsp;As noted above, the results of the 2025 Bank Capital Stress Test suggested that the major UK banks could continue to support UK households and businesses even if economic, financial and business conditions became substantially worse than expected.</p>
<p>53. In view of these considerations, the FPC decided to maintain the UK CCyB rate at 2%. Maintaining a neutral setting of the UK CCyB rate in the region of 2% would help to ensure that banks continued to have capacity to absorb unexpected future shocks without an unwarranted restriction in essential services, such as the supply of credit, to the UK real economy. In considering the appropriate setting of the UK CCyB rate the Committee had taken account of its latest assessment of bank capital requirements (see above).</p>
<p>54: The Committee would continue to monitor the evolution of financial conditions closely to ensure the setting of the CCyB remained appropriate.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-5">Private markets</h3>
<p>55: The Committee discussed how the role and size of private markets had grown significantly over the past decade, including in the UK, and continued to evolve. The FPC noted the benefits of growth in private markets for the UK real economy, including via diversifying sources of funding for UK businesses and supporting their growth. While resilient to date, the private market ecosystem had not been tested through a broad-based macroeconomic stress at its current size. As previously set out by the FPC, key vulnerabilities associated with private markets could arise from the widespread use of leverage (both by private market funds and their portfolio companies), opacity in valuations, complexity of structures, the extent of reliance on rating agencies, and the interconnection with other risky credit markets. The rapid growth of private markets, increasing interconnections with banks and insurers, and significant data gaps made it difficult to assess fully the potential for systemic risks.</p>
<p>56: The FPC supported the Bank&rsquo;s plans for a system-wide exploratory scenario (SWES) exercise focused on the private markets ecosystem that would be run in collaboration with a group of banks and non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) active in these markets. The exercise would explore potential risks and dynamics associated with private markets and related risky public credit markets through understanding the actions taken by banks and NBFIs active in private markets in response to a shock, and how these actions might interact at a system level. It would also aim to understand better whether these interactions could amplify stress across the financial system and pose risks to UK financial stability and the provision of finance to the UK real economy.</p>
<p>57: The Committee noted that the exercise was not a test of the resilience of the individual firms that would participate in the exercise. Its focus would be system-wide, exploring the resilience of the provision of private market and related public market finance to the UK corporate sector. Enhancing the transparency of any system-wide dynamics in a stress should help private market participants to better manage the risks they face and allow the Bank, FCA, The Pensions Regulator (TPR) and international authorities to make better-informed judgements about the risks in that ecosystem.</p>
<p>58: The Bank would conduct this exploratory exercise under the guidance of the FPC and the PRC, working closely with, and with the full support of, the PRA, the FCA and TPR.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-6">Operational resilience</h3>
<p>59: The FPC had previously discussed how heightened geopolitical tensions and continued advances in technology had underlined the critical importance of operational resilience to the provision of vital services to households and businesses. This supported the need for firms and financial market infrastructures (FMIs) to&nbsp;continue to&nbsp;build resilience to operational disruption.&nbsp;The FPC met jointly with the PRC, the Financial Markets Infrastructure Committee and the FCA to discuss the UK&rsquo;s approach to enhancing the operational resilience of the UK financial system given the heightened threat landscape, and the increasing pace of technological change. They agreed the importance of continued co-ordination on these issues.</p>
<p>60: The FPC judged that geopolitical and technological developments further increased the likelihood that operational incidents could affect the provision of vital services such as wholesale and retail payments, clearing and settlement, and other activity such as custody services. Not only could disruption to vital service provision affect the ability of financial sector participants,&nbsp;households&nbsp;and businesses to manage risk, transact or access financing, it could also undermine confidence in the financial system, and therefore negatively affect saving, investment, and economic growth.&nbsp;Cyberattacks and severe operational disruption also had the potential to impact firms&rsquo; own revenues and valuations.</p>
<p>61: Therefore, the FPC supported further actions to be taken by firms and FMIs to build resilience to operational disruption, including to emerging&nbsp;risks from AI, quantum computing,&nbsp;and more broadly as the risk environment continued to evolve.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>62: The Committee agreed that the&nbsp;appropriate management&nbsp;of high-impact operational risks by critical firms and FMIs was essential for system-wide operational resilience. Therefore, the FPC welcomed work by&nbsp;microprudential&nbsp;regulators to continue to strengthen the regulatory framework for operational resilience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>63: In taking steps to build resilience, firms and FMIs should recognise the role they play in supporting confidence in the financial system, and how disruption to vital services could negatively affect saving, investment and economic growth. For example, FMIs and the largest firms were required to take account of risks to UK financial stability when identifying their important business services. To support this, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation/letter/2024/thematic-findings-2024-cyber-stress-test" target="_blank">Thematic findings from the 2024 Cyber Stress Test<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external"></span></a>&nbsp;provided tools to&nbsp;facilitate&nbsp;discussion of financial stability between subject matter experts from a range of disciplines, as well as illustrative examples of mitigation actions firms and FMIs could take.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>64: Boards of firms and FMIs should work with authorities to use the findings of sector-wide exercises and stress tests such as SIMEX and the Cyber and Operational Resilience Stress Test to improve their understanding of actions they can take to mitigate impacts on financial stability. Given the interconnected nature of the global financial system, the FPC supported further international engagement on operational resilience.</p>
<p>65. As part of its broader framework on operational resilience, the Committee would also continue to monitor the implementation and outcomes of the critical third parties (CTPs) regime and looked forward to further progress in this area.</p>
<p>66: Further details of the Bank&rsquo;s approach to operational resilience would be set out in the structural changes in the UK financial system chapter of the December 2025&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-stability-report/2025/december-2025">FSR</a>.</p>

<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-7">Stablecoins</h3>
<p>67: The FPC welcomed the publication of the Bank&rsquo;s recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/paper/2025/cp/proposed-regulatory-regime-for-sterling-denominated-systemic-stablecoins">consultation paper</a>&nbsp;setting out its proposed regulatory regime for sterling-denominated systemic stablecoins. In its 2025 Q2 Record the FPC had noted the financial stability benefits of having a regulatory framework that was proportionate to risks, allowed for some degree of alignment with other jurisdictions and supported firms setting up in the UK.</p>
<p>68: The Committee noted that the proposals were built on feedback received to the November 2023 Discussion Paper and reflected the Bank&rsquo;s role in maintaining public trust in money as innovation in payments accelerated. The FPC supported the outcomes the Bank wanted to achieve in this space: avoiding a disorderly transition to widespread adoption of systemic stablecoins that undermined financial and monetary stability as well as access to credit, while at the same time, promoting innovation in payments and money.</p>

<title>FNZ Unveils Global AI Playbook For The Wealth Management Industry - Based On A Study Of 500+ Firms Representing US$74.2 Trillion In Assets, The Research Identifies AI Leaders And A Roadmap For The Next Age Of Wealth And Asset Management</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fnz-unveils-global-ai-playbook-for-the-wealth-management-industry-based-on-a-s-2025122/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fnz-unveils-global-ai-playbook-for-the-wealth-management-industry-based-on-a-s-2025122/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>FNZ, the global wealth management platform, today announced the launch of a landmark global study, <i>The AI-Powered Investment Firm</i>, revealing the scale and speed at which artificial intelligence is transforming the global wealth and asset management industry.</p>
<p>Developed in partnership with leading research firm ThoughtLab, the study draws on insights from over 500 financial institutions representing US$74.2 trillion in assets under management (AuM) across 16 international markets, equivalent to 44% of total AuM held among financial institutions worldwide. This breadth makes it one of the most comprehensive AI analyses in the sector to date.</p>
<p><b>Key highlights</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>AI      now mission-critical:</b> 73% of financial executives say AI      is critical to the future of their business, with 63% agreeing it will      revolutionize the wealth and asset management sector.</li>
<li><b>Vast      majority of firms seeing positive returns on investment:</b> 88%      of executives report positive returns on their AI investments, with almost      one in five (19%) recording large positive returns of over 7%, through      growth, efficiency and risk reduction. Most companies (62%) say they recouped      the value of their investment within two years. </li>
<li><b>Platform      and governance as core differentiators:</b> 87% of AI leaders      have made moderate or significant progress on integrated, cloud-enabled IT      platforms, while 81% have implemented AI governance frameworks and      policies and 62% say clearer risk guidelines will further accelerate      adoption.</li>
<li><b>Advisers      augmented, not replaced:</b> 73% of firms believe AI      will drive a step-change in human productivity, freeing advisers to focus      on relationships, strategy and complex judgment while AI handles routine      and administrative tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>A practical AI playbook, not just another report</b></p>
<p>The study goes beyond high-level commentary to offer an actionable roadmap for firms that want to lead in the next age of AI. It identifies a group of &ldquo;AI leaders&rdquo; already realizing outsized returns from their investments and distils the practices that set them apart.</p>
<p>The analysis highlights four critical strategies for firms looking to excel in the agentic AI era:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li><b>Adopt      AI early to unlock ROI: </b>Early adopters are      already seeing measurable performance benefits. Firms moving decisively on      AI achieve stronger outcomes in revenue growth, operational efficiency and      risk reduction than slower-moving peers. Committing early, investing at      scale and embedding AI into business strategy and culture are central to      success.</li>
<li><b>Build      an AI-ready IT and data foundation: </b>The research      underscores that &ldquo;no platform, no payoff&rdquo;. Without the right      infrastructure, AI initiatives struggle to scale beyond pilots. Among AI      leaders, 87% have made moderate or significant progress in building      integrated, cloud-enabled IT platforms that connect data, strengthen      governance and provide the flexibility needed to automate workflows, power      real-time insights and deliver better outcomes for clients.</li>
<li><b>Embrace      governance to shape the future of AI: </b>Firms recognize      that effective governance is essential to unlocking AI at scale. 62%      believe clearer risk-management guidelines will enable greater use of AI      over the next three years. The study finds that 81% of AI leaders have      already implemented formal AI governance frameworks and policies, turning      compliance into a source of competitive advantage by demonstrating      fairness, reliability and regulatory alignment.</li>
<li><b>Enhance,      not replace, the adviser: </b>The findings confirm that      AI is fundamentally about augmenting, not replacing, human expertise. As      AI capabilities mature, firms expect advisers to spend more time on      high-value client engagement and complex decision-making, while AI      increasingly takes the lead in operational areas such as trade and      transaction execution (40%), client onboarding (36%) and performance      monitoring (35%).</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Extending FNZ&rsquo;s AI leadership journey</b></p>
<p>The global study is the latest milestone in FNZ&rsquo;s broader AI journey and its mission to open up wealth through technology.</p>
<p>The study complements FNZ&rsquo;s strategic partnership with Microsoft and the launch of FNZ Advisor AI, a next-generation artificial intelligence solution that enables advisers to work more efficiently, engage clients more effectively and rapidly scale the delivery of personalized advice.</p>
<p>By combining its end-to-end platform with Microsoft&rsquo;s cloud and AI capabilities, and deploying solutions such as FNZ Advisor AI, FNZ is helping financial institutions move from experimentation to industrial-scale AI adoption across the entire value chain.</p>
<p><b>Roman Regelman, Group President at FNZ,</b> said: &ldquo;AI is no longer a side project for the wealth and asset management industry, it is rapidly redefining the economics of advice. What this study shows, with real data, is just how far the leaders have already moved. They are building modern platforms, industrializing data and governance, and using AI to free advisers to do what only humans can do: understand goals, build trust and provide holistic guidance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At FNZ, we see this as a once-in-a-generation opportunity to open up wealth. Our partnership with Microsoft and the launch of FNZ Advisor AI are about turning this roadmap into reality for our clients, helping them move from experimentation to scaled, responsible deployment of AI across the entire value chain. The firms that act now will set the standard for the next decade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This year&rsquo;s edition shows progress in electrolysers build-out and in advancing the EU&rsquo;s regulatory framework. Yet, renewable hydrogen costs in 2024 remained four times higher than those of conventional hydrogen. This cost gap, together with incomplete national transposition of EU rules, is hindering market development. To overcome this, lower regulatory risks and more targeted funding are needed.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the key findings?</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Market growth remains insufficient to meet EU and national targets.</strong>&nbsp;Despite a 51% increase in electrolyser capacity to 308 MW in 2024, deployment remains way behind the 6 GW target for 2024 and 40 GW for 2030.</li>
<li><strong>Renewable hydrogen remains costly</strong>&nbsp;(four times higher than hydrogen from fossil fuels), with uncertain near&nbsp;to mid term cost reduction prospects.</li>
<li><strong>Delays in transposing EU rules at national level persist.&nbsp;</strong>Only 2 Member States have transposed the amended&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsDV1NQB1JVVEwOBQICHVZdAgMdUApTBBoGV1EEAlAFAQMAAwgdBFxXUwhVBlodBlwGUh0GAQNXGg1UVVMZAABTUggHVFFUU1BWRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Renewable Energy Directive</a>.</li>
<li><strong>A decarbonised electricity sector is key to renewable hydrogen.</strong>&nbsp;Electricity supply costs (excluding grid tariffs) may account for up to 50% of renewable hydrogen&rsquo;s production costs.</li>
<li><strong>Rising electricity network tariffs may add pressure on costs.</strong>&nbsp;ACER&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsPCVIEBAJRVUwNA1YBHVYJDQYdCgFUAhoBUVUHUQNRUwcIBwIdBFxXUwhVBlodBlwGUh0GAQNXGg1UVVMZAABTUggHVFFUU1BWRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2024 Monitoring Report on electricity infrastructure development</a>&nbsp;shows that electricity network costs could rise by 50-100% by 2050, also depending on how investments will align with evolving electricity grid demand. As electricity tariffs represent a significant share of renewable hydrogen&rsquo;s production costs, this trend poses a substantial risk.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Network development should align with</strong><strong>&nbsp;evolving demand to reduce forecasted risks.</strong>&nbsp;Hydrogen networks are key to expanding the market, but infrastructure should be built gradually to match actual demand development.</li>
<li><strong>Low-carbon hydrogen could support market development</strong>, yet cost and technical uncertainties should be carefully assessed.</li>
<li><strong>The European Commission has already allocated over &euro;20 billion to hydrogen</strong>&nbsp;through various programmes, and Member States have announced numerous additional support schemes. Accelerating the allocation of funding to advanced projects is key to increasing scale-up.</li>

<title>Standard Chartered Goes Live On CLSNet</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>CLS, a financial market infrastructure group delivering settlement, processing and data solutions across the global FX ecosystem, announced today that Standard Chartered, a leading international cross-border bank, has gone live on CLSNet, its automated bilateral payment netting calculation service for over 120 currencies.</p>
<p>CLSNet standardizes and automates post-trade matching and netting processes, delivering risk mitigation, liquidity optimization and operational efficiencies for currency flows outside of CLSSettlement, including emerging market and developing economy (EMDE) currencies and same-day trades.</p>
<p>Adoption of CLSNet has continued to grow significantly, with the service recording an average daily netted value<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;of USD169 billion in the first half of 2025, up 18% compared to the same period in 2024. The CLSNet community now includes the top 12 global banks, alongside a growing roster of regional banks, funds, corporates and non-bank financial institutions.</p>
<p>As settlement risk in the FX market remains a focus, particularly in EMDE currencies and other growing segments, market participants are looking for ways to mitigate risk effectively via automated post-trade services such as CLSNet. The service reduces payments exposed to settlement risk by centralizing, standardizing and automating the netting calculation process. Demand for CLSNet continues to grow, particularly among financial institutions seeking to align with the best practices outlined in Principle 35 of the FX Global Code.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Alongside Standard Chartered, several Asian banks are joining the service. CTBC, the Hong Kong branch of a Taiwanese commercial bank, has gone live on CLSNet, meanwhile Maybank, a Malaysian bank, and Taishin, one of the largest commercial banks in Taiwan, have also committed to joining the CLSNet network to mitigate settlement risk within Asian currencies, particularly USD/CNH.</p>
<p><b>Lisa Dani</b><b>no-Lewis, Chief Growth Officer, CLS commented:</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;We are delighted to welcome Standard Chartered, CTBC, Maybank and Taishin to the CLSNet community. We are seeing increased demand for proven solutions to address the challenges facing the FX market. As more participants join CLSNet, the resulting network effect will deliver even greater risk reduction and efficiency benefits for all users.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Tony Hall, Global Head, Markets Trading and XVA, Standard Chartered commented:</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;Standard Chartered is proud to join CLSNet, reaffirming our commitment to strong risk management, liquidity efficiency and operational excellence in FX. This step aligns with our role as a signatory to the Global FX Code and our ambition to be the leading Emerging Markets FX house. By leveraging CLSNet capabilities, we&rsquo;ll deliver safer, faster and more efficient post-trade processing&mdash;freeing up intraday liquidity and reducing settlement risk for our clients. Another stride towards world-class infrastructure, smarter execution, and market leadership.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;<span>Netted value refers to bilateral net payment amounts calculated by CLSNet.</span></li>
<li>Principle 35 states,&nbsp;<i style="font-family: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">inter alia</i><span>:</span>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;<span>Where practicable, Market Participants should eliminate Settlement Risk, for example by using settlement services that provide PvP settlement.</span></li>
<li>Where Settlement Risk cannot be eliminated, Market Participants should reduce the size and duration of their Settlement Risk as much as practicable. The netting of FX settlement obligations (in&nbsp;particular the use of automated netting systems) is encouraged.</li>

<title>Minimising The Risk Of Investor Harm Is A Shared Responsibility - Keynote Address By ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland At The Professional Planner Researcher Forum In The Blue Mountains On 2 December 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul>
<li>Australian investors rely on the expertise and integrity of everyone in the investment chain to secure their financial future.</li>
<li>ASIC&rsquo;s primary concern is minimising the risk of harm for Australian investors and consumers.</li>
<li>To ensure better outcomes for investors, ASIC has prioritised tackling poor practices in private credit and holding those responsible for Shield and First Guardian to account.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good afternoon.</p>
<p>I'd like to acknowledge the Traditional Owners of the land on which we meet today, the Dharug and Gundungurra people and pay my respects to Elders past and present.</p>
<p>I extend that respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people here today.</p>
<p>Thank you to Conexus for the invitation to speak today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great to be back at the Researcher Forum and to have the opportunity to update you on ASIC&rsquo;s priorities.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I spoke to a room of financial literacy educators about the importance of equipping Australians with the knowledge they need to confidently navigate the financial system.</p>
<p>I made the point that when it comes to financial decisions, people can sometimes be vulnerable to exploitation, because for many of the decisions they make, they have less financial knowledge or experience than the person or firm on the other side of the transaction.</p>
<p>And when it comes to investment decisions, that knowledge imbalance is even greater, with bigger consequences if something goes wrong.</p>
<p>Even the most sophisticated investors are reliant on the expertise &ndash; and the integrity - of others when making major investment decisions.</p>
<p>Financial advisers, fund managers, research houses &ndash; all of you here today &ndash; all play a role, either directly or indirectly, in influencing how investors choose to invest their money.</p>
<p>And so, it&rsquo;s important, as the theme of today&rsquo;s forum suggests, that we have &lsquo;<strong>world-class</strong>&nbsp;investment governance and research&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what Australian investors want and deserve, and it&rsquo;s what ASIC expects.</p>
<p>In pursuing this expectation, our primary concern is to minimise the risk of harm to consumers and investors.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see this reflected across our regulatory and enforcement priorities.</p>
<p>There are two enforcement priorities I want to talk about today, both of which relate directly to the work many of you do.</p>
<p>The first is holding those responsible for the Shield and First Guardian collapses to account.</p>
<p>And the second &ndash; to crack down on poor practice in private credit.</p>
<h2>Pursuing accountability for Shield and First Guardian</h2>
<p>Let me start with Shield and First Guardian &ndash; partly because those matters combined represent one of our biggest priorities at the moment &ndash; and partly because they have implications for everybody working in the advice and investment ecosystem.</p>
<p>If you wonder why this is relevant to you, the numbers should make it clear.</p>
<p>With more than 11,000 investors impacted and close to $1 billion of retirement savings put at risk, this is the most egregious example of consumer harm that I have seen in my time at ASIC.</p>
<p>And the people affected are Australians who were trying to do the right thing to boost their retirement savings and were instead lured into switching their super into high-risk investments.</p>
<p>These weren&rsquo;t people rolling the dice in some get-rich-quick gamble. These were people making considered decisions which they believed to be in their financial interests.</p>
<p>People like Gary, in his early 60s and looking forward to retirement<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/minimising-the-risk-of-investor-harm-is-a-shared-responsibility/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Gary was aware that his existing super fund wasn&rsquo;t performing as well as it had been.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He was contacted by a comparison site, which put him on to financial advisers who set him up with a self-managed super fund and invested all his funds into First Guardian.</p>
<p>He stands to lose almost $700,000.</p>
<p>Or Juan<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/minimising-the-risk-of-investor-harm-is-a-shared-responsibility/#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>, a 41-year old at risk of losing his entire super, after being convinced to roll all his savings into First Guardian.</p>
<p>These are shocking stories, and there are&nbsp;<strong>thousands</strong>&nbsp;like them.</p>
<p>Each of them involving financial losses with a very human cost.</p>
<p>And there is a long chain of participants involved.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lead generators, including data brokers and telemarketers</li>
<li>Financial advisers, and financial advice firms</li>
<li>Superannuation trustees, like Macquarie, Equity Trustees, Diversa and Netwealth</li>
<li>Research houses</li>
<li>Auditors</li>
<li>And of course, the fund operators themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p>We believe all hold some degree of culpability.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s first priority in both the Shield and First Guardian matters has been to preserve assets so that they can be recovered for investors while our investigations are continuing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve:</p>
<ul>
<li>issued stop orders to prevent ongoing harm</li>
<li>obtained asset-freezing orders</li>
<li>sought the appointment of receivers and liquidators</li>
<li>obtained travel restraints</li>
<li>cancelled financial services licenses; and</li>
<li>banned financial advisers.</li>
</ul>
<p>We&rsquo;ve instituted proceedings against&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-215mr-macquarie-admits-to-shield-contraventions-and-commits-to-pay-affected-members/" title="25-215MR Macquarie admits to Shield contraventions and commits to pay affected members">Macquarie</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-176mr-asic-sues-equity-trustees-alleging-due-diligence-failures-relating-to-shield/" title="25-176MR ASIC sues Equity Trustees alleging due diligence failures relating to Shield">Equity Trustees</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-274mr-asic-sues-interprac-over-alleged-shield-and-first-guardian-licensee-failures/" title="25-274MR ASIC sues Interprac over alleged Shield and First Guardian licensee failures">Interprac&nbsp;</a><a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-274mr-asic-sues-interprac-over-alleged-shield-and-first-guardian-licensee-failures/">Financial Planning</a><a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-274mr-asic-sues-interprac-over-alleged-shield-and-first-guardian-licensee-failures/" title="25-274MR ASIC sues Interprac over alleged Shield and First Guardian licensee failures"></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-275mr-asic-sues-sqm-research-alleging-misleading-reports-related-to-shield/" title="25-275MR ASIC sues SQM Research alleging misleading reports related to Shield">SQM Research</a>.</p>
<p>In a significant win for some investors,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-215mr-macquarie-admits-to-shield-contraventions-and-commits-to-pay-affected-members/" title="25-215MR Macquarie admits to Shield contraventions and commits to pay affected members">Macquarie has committed to repaying investors</a>&nbsp;100% of the net cash they invested in Shield through Macquarie&rsquo;s wrap platform.</p>
<p>Importantly for those in the room today, our action against SQM Research is the first we have taken against a research house.</p>
<p>It is our view that SQM Research prepared reports containing misleading representations and its processes fell short of expected standards when it published &ldquo;Favourable&rdquo; ratings for Shield.</p>
<p>More generally, it is our view that research houses should serve as gatekeepers against poor quality investments or unsuitable products.</p>
<p>They need to do all things necessary to ensure that they go about their work efficiently, honestly and fairly. And they need to avoid issuing ratings or commentary that can&rsquo;t be justified by evidence.</p>
<p>In addition to the proceedings I have already mentioned, we are also seeking leave to commence proceedings against&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-276mr-asic-takes-action-against-mwl-financial-services-former-director-nicholas-maikousis-and-imperial-capital-group-australia-over-alleged-shield-advice-failures/" title="25-276MR ASIC takes action against MWL Financial Services, former director Nicholas Maikousis, and Imperial Capital Group Australia over alleged Shield advice failures">MWL Financial Services</a>, a former MWL director and Imperial Capital Group &ndash; a lead generator &ndash; for allegedly operating a scheme resulting in hundreds of clients investing superannuation into Shield.</p>
<p>At this point in time, we have 10 separate Federal Court proceedings against 18 defendants, and there is more to come.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, holding those responsible for the collapse of the Shield and First Guardian Master Funds to account is one of our enforcement priorities - and our investigations are ongoing.</p>
<p>While this has some time to play out, there are lessons to be learned now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I mentioned at the outset, Australian investors are reliant on the chain of financial experts behind their investments - financial advisers, research houses, investment platforms, superannuation trustees, advice licensees.</p>
<p>When every part of that chain fulfils its role &ndash; with its multiple layers of knowledge, expertise, duties and obligations &ndash; the system works as it should.</p>
<p>Investors can be confident that they will be offered products that are safe, and appropriate for them and their financial goals.</p>
<p>But when there are failures in that chain &ndash; far too often it is investors who pay the price.</p>
<p>The failures involved in Shield and First Guardian have highlighted some potential regulatory gaps.</p>
<p>These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the regulation of lead generators, whose activities may not be adequately captured by the anti-hawking provisions</li>
<li>the super switching process</li>
<li>the obligations of super trustees who provide platform products; and</li>
<li>the regulation of managed investment schemes, which ASIC has previously identified as a priority for reform.</li>
</ul>
<p>We welcome the Government&rsquo;s commitment to exploring sensible reforms that can better protect consumers in the future, and we are committed to working with the Government to identify what would be most effective, based on what we have uncovered through our investigations.</p>
<h2>Improving practices in private credit</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;d now like to turn to private credit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>ASIC recognises that private credit &ndash; done well &ndash; plays an important role in Australia&rsquo;s financial system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an important source of funding for sectors that are under-served by the traditional banking sector, and it provides diversification and choice for borrowers and investors alike.</p>
<p>According to one estimate, private credit in Australia is now valued at more than $200 billion<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/minimising-the-risk-of-investor-harm-is-a-shared-responsibility/#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>While this amount is not systemically important, the same source estimates that private credit has grown&nbsp;<strong>500 per cent</strong><a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/minimising-the-risk-of-investor-harm-is-a-shared-responsibility/#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><span>[4]</span></a>&nbsp;over the past 10 years. And with increasing investment in private credit via superannuation, that growth seems likely to continue.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important that we are alert to the potential risks.</p>
<p>Here in Australia, we have a higher concentration of private credit lending to the property sector, including loans to higher risk development and construction.</p>
<p>Over time, this could amplify the system-wide vulnerability related to residential property identified by APRA in last month&rsquo;s system-wide stress test.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private credit at current volumes is untested in a stress scenario and we are already seeing a wide variance in practices across the sector.</p>
<p>A lack of transparency across the sector is a particular concern.</p>
<p>Australia lags behind our international peers in terms of the data that we as a regulator have access to.</p>
<p>We have neither the breadth, depth, or frequency of data needed to monitor and supervise retail and wholesale funds confidently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Countries like Singapore, Canada, and the UK with similar regulatory frameworks have greater access to more reliable and recurrent data on private markets.</p>
<p>Given that our domestic private credit growth outstrips that seen in many of these countries, we would like to see this data gap addressed to enable ASIC to more confidently supervise funds.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, we undertook a surveillance of 28 retail and wholesale private credit funds to assess how fund managers are managing the risks that underpin investor confidence and market operation.</p>
<p>We released the findings of that surveillance a few weeks ago in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-820-private-credit-surveillance-report-retail-and-wholesale-surveillance/" title="REP 820 Private credit surveillance report: Retail and wholesale surveillance">Report 820</a>.</p>
<p>We observed some better practices, but we also identified areas that fell short of expectations, including practices that are potentially in breach of the law.</p>
<p>Areas for improvement include governance and transparency; fees and interest rates; valuation methodologies; liquidity; and credit management.</p>
<p>Today, I&rsquo;ll focus on three areas that will be relevant to many in the room because they are key to how researchers understand and evaluate private credit funds:</p>
<ul>
<li>The use of terminology</li>
<li>Fee and interest disclosure; and</li>
<li>Valuations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Terminology</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start with the use of terminology.</p>
<p>In our review, we found market-wide inconsistencies in terminology that make it difficult for investors to compare the nature and risks of private credit funds.</p>
<p>Fund operators and investment managers defined and applied terms such as &lsquo;default&rsquo; and &lsquo;investment grade&rsquo; differently.</p>
<p>Such inconsistent use of terms makes it difficult for investors to meaningfully compare loan default or arrears levels across funds.</p>
<p>There were also variabilities in how funds described their underlying assets.</p>
<p>Some funds primarily categorised their assets using terms that describe the&nbsp;<strong>ranking&nbsp;</strong>or&nbsp;<strong>seniority</strong>&nbsp;of the security &ndash; for example &lsquo;first mortgage&rsquo; and &lsquo;mezzanine&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Other funds categorised their&nbsp;<strong>assets</strong>&nbsp;with reference to direct lending, securitised loans or the use of funding &ndash; for example &lsquo;commercial real estate development&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Concerningly, we found that asset descriptions sometimes failed to include clear information that would help investors understand the risks of the assets held by a fund.</p>
<p>For example, a failure to disclose that loans will fund higher-risk real estate construction and development. Or that the fund primarily invests in unsecured loans.</p>
<p>Again, this inconsistency makes it difficult for investors and advisers to accurately compare funds and make informed choices about what products they are investing in and the risks associated with them.</p>
<p>The adoption of consistent industry terminology &ndash; or at least a clear explanation of key terms &ndash; would be an important step towards greater transparency for investors.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Fee and interest disclosure</h2>
<p>Transparency was also an issue when it came to fee and interest disclosure.</p>
<p>Of the 28 funds we reviewed,&nbsp;<strong>only four</strong>&nbsp;published information about the interest rates or range of interest rates charged to borrowers.</p>
<p>If these rates are accurately disclosed, investors are better able to judge the riskiness of the investment.</p>
<p>Conversely, where borrowers pay fees on top of interest that are not disclosed, this masks a clear signal about the level of risk involved in the lending.</p>
<p><strong>Only two</strong>&nbsp;retail funds quantified the interest earned from their assets and borrower fees and disclosed the retained amounts as part of their wider management fee in the product disclosure statement.</p>
<p><strong>Only one</strong>&nbsp;<strong>wholesale fund</strong>&nbsp;passed on to investors the full economic benefits of interest earned from its assets and income earned from borrower fees.</p>
<p>To enable investors to better assess the true cost of investing in a fund, fund managers and trustees should disclose&nbsp;<strong>ALL</strong>&nbsp;revenue they earn in connection with their funds.</p>
<p>Clear and accurate disclosure enables investors to understand what they are paying for, directly and indirectly, and to better judge whether they are being appropriately compensated for the associated risk.</p>
<h2>Valuations</h2>
<p>The final area that I wanted to touch on is valuations.</p>
<p>Investors rely on fair valuations to assess performance and make informed investment decisions.</p>
<p>Private assets in particular are subject to heightened valuation risks, due to infrequent trading and limited price discovery.</p>
<p>Many of the private credit funds we reviewed were open-ended funds, with regular monthly or quarterly redemption periods.</p>
<p>For open-ended funds in times of stress, failure to adjust valuations in a timely manner could allow some fund members to exit at a higher price, at the expense of the remaining investors.</p>
<p>Some of the poorer valuation practices we observed involved infrequent valuations, incomplete or absent valuation policies, insufficient independence and inconsistent approaches to valuing collateral.</p>
<p>Where valuations are not accurate, reliable, timely or comparable, this raises serious questions about the ability of investors &ndash; and indeed researchers &ndash; to assess the performance of a fund.</p>
<p>To guide fund managers in uplifting their practices, our report outlines ten guiding principles for private credit &lsquo;done well&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The principles provide guidance on the three areas that I&rsquo;ve mentioned - terminology, fee disclosure and valuations - as well as other areas like design and distribution, organisational capability, liquidity and governance.</p>
<p>Each of these principles is grounded in the law. And we will be monitoring how well private credit funds adhere to them.</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier that poor private credit practices are an enforcement priority for ASIC in 2026.</p>
<p>We have already issued stop orders on several target market determinations and one PDS due to poor disclosure and distribution.</p>
<p>And in instances of more egregious conduct, we have commenced enforcement investigations.</p>
<p>We have also announced the&nbsp;<strong>second phase of our private credit surveillance</strong>.</p>
<p>On the&nbsp;<strong>retail</strong>&nbsp;side, this surveillance will look at disclosures of fees and margins, and the distribution practices of private credit funds to retail investors, with a specific focus on the adviser channel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to understand how retail private credit funds are distributed and, when distributed through advisers, test the quality of their advice.</p>
<p>On the&nbsp;<strong>wholesale</strong>&nbsp;side, there are plans to look at fees, margin structures and conflicts of interest in the management of wholesale private credit funds, with a particular focus on real estate lending.</p>
<p>Through this ongoing program of work, which will hopefully be complemented by industry efforts to lift standards, we hope that private credit will increasingly be done well in Australia, with benefits to individual investors and the broader economy.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I mentioned at the start that ASIC is focussed on minimising harm to consumers and investors. That&rsquo;s a responsibility we all share.</p>
<p>Whatever role you play in the investment ecosystem, you can help to ensure that consumers who engage in investing, within or outside superannuation, are presented with products that are safe, appropriate, and aligned with their best interests.</p>
<p>When that occurs, it not only means better outcomes for individuals, it is also fundamental to building and maintaining trust in the system.</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today. I&rsquo;m now happy to take some questions.</p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority Cancels HGL’s Financial Advice Provider Licence</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-cancels-hgls-financial-advice-provider-2025122/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) - Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; has cancelled the Financial Advice Provider licence of Christchurch-based Hope Group Limited (HGL).</p>
<p>HGL has held a full financial advice provider licence and provided personal risk insurance advice (life and health insurance, income protection insurance, trauma and disability insurance) to retail clients.   &nbsp;</p>
<p>Louise Unger, FMA Executive Director, Response and Enforcement, said HGL&rsquo;s cancellation followed the termination of its distribution agreement with the impacted insurer, and the FMA&rsquo;s subsequent inquiry into its affairs.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the notification from the impacted insurer, the FMA reviewed 14 insurance policy applications submitted by HGL&rsquo;s sole director and financial adviser, Mr Junpu Wang, on behalf of 13 customers. The inquiries identified serious conduct issues resulting in material breaches of obligations. Specifically, the conduct included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Submitting second policy applications for existing clients using incorrect or false customer information to conceal that the policies were duplicates&nbsp;</li>
<li>Completing an authority to accept a direct debit form on behalf of a client without obtaining the client&rsquo;s authentic signature&nbsp;</li>
<li>Failing to obtain client consent for both first and second policies (with the same or similar cover) to remain active during a significant period, causing clients to pay two premiums. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Misleading clients by recommending second policies to benefit from lower premiums under a promotional offer, despite clients being ineligible (e.g., already existing policyholders) </li>
<li>Failing to ensure clients understood the advice provided. In some cases, clients were incorrectly advised that a new policy was needed because their existing policy would become more expensive after 24 months; in two cases, clients were told to take out a new policy to obtain a second luxury item &ndash; despite being ineligible for that benefit.  &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Mr Wang deliberately misled impacted clients to take out second policies after the 24-month clawback period for the sole purpose to obtain commission payments from the insurer,&rdquo; said Ms Unger.</p>
<p>In doing so, HGL and Mr Wang obtained $37,374 in upfront commissions. In addition, clients paid two premiums for the same or similar cover while both policies remained active for up to 27 weeks, resulting in overpayments totalling $5,342.34.</p>
<p>&ldquo;HGL and Mr Wang&rsquo;s actions represent a serious and deliberate departure from the standards expected of a licensed financial advice provider.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr Wang has not accepted his conduct, all allegations have been denied and attempts made to blame another financial adviser who was never engaged by HGL at the time the applications were submitted,&rdquo; said Ms Unger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cancellation of HGL&rsquo;s licence is critical to ensuring we protect consumers and the integrity of the market. A key function of the FMA is to ensure the quality of financial advice and financial advice services &ndash; which is clearly missing here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A public notification helps the FMA to raise awareness about standards we expect, deter future contraventions by other market participants, and publicly express disapproval for contraventions under the FMC Act and the relevant regulations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The insurer has contacted all impacted clients and made arrangements to ensure they are supported. In addition, HGL and Mr. Wang have been deregistered from the Financial Service Providers Register (FSPR), and the matter had been reported to the Police.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC has released updated regulatory guidance on industry codes of conduct in the financial services and credit sectors.<br /><br />The updates to Regulatory Guide 183&nbsp;<em>Codes of conduct for the financial services and credit sectors</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/regulatory-guides/rg-183-codes-of-conduct-for-the-financial-services-and-credit-sectors/" title="RG 183 Approval of financial services sector codes of conduct">RG 183</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>reflect legislative reform since the guidance was last updated in 2013,</li>
<li>clarify ASIC&rsquo;s role in relation to industry codes, and the criteria and process for code approval, and</li>
<li>simplify and streamline the guidance.</li>
</ul>
<p>These updates follow consultation with stakeholders through Consultation Statement 26&nbsp;<em>Proposed update to RG 183</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/consultations/cs-26-proposed-update-to-rg-183/" title="CS 26 Proposed update to RG 183">CS 26</a>). Stakeholders were broadly supportive of the proposed updates.<br /><br />A copy of the non-confidential submissions made to ASIC and an outline of our response is available below.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>It is not mandatory for any industry in the financial services or credit sectors to develop a code. Where a code exists, it does not require ASIC&rsquo;s approval. However, seeking and obtaining ASIC&rsquo;s approval is a signal that the code is one that consumers can have confidence in and rely on.</p>
<p>RG 183 provides guidance on ASIC&rsquo;s role in relation to codes, the criteria for code approval by ASIC, and the process for obtaining (and retaining) ASIC&rsquo;s approval for a code.</p>

<title>Universiti Utara Malaysia (UUM) Takes Top Three Spots At Bursa Inter-Varsity Stock Challenge 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/universiti-utara-malaysia-uum-takes-top-three-spots-at-bursa-inter-varsity-sto-2025122/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Universiti Utara Malaysia (&ldquo;UUM&rdquo;) made a clean sweep of the top three spots at the recent Bursa Inter-Varsity Stock Challenge (&ldquo;BISC&rdquo;) 2025 Grand Finale.</p>
<p>After a tightly contested final round, Chong Jia Hong emerged as Champion while Ponny Ling Hsing Yu and Bryan Lim Wei Chin were named first and second runners-up, respectively.</p>
<p>The nationwide challenge, which ran from August to November 2025, attracted 850 teams and nearly 1,300 students from 10 universities<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;in an immersive stock trading competition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organised by Bursa Malaysia since 2022, the annual BISC aims to cultivate informed, confident and responsible future investors. By simulating real-world investing in a riskfree environment, participants gain early hands-on experience whilst sharpening their analytical skills.</p>
<p>Dato&rsquo; Fad&rsquo;l Mohamed, Chief Executive Officer of Bursa Malaysia, said: &ldquo;This year&rsquo;s strong participation reflects not only rising interest in the stock market among the youth, but also their determination to challenge themselves, master financial knowledge and apply investing concepts. Such enthusiasm reinforces the importance of BISC as part of Bursa Malaysia&rsquo;s ongoing efforts to educate and empower the next generation of informed investors in an engaging yet structured approach.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Three-phase Competition Structure and Mentorship</h4>
<p>To maximise learning outcomes, BISC 2025 featured three phases, with each phase building on the previous to simulate the full cycle of investing.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I am deeply honored to have been asked to speak here today about the remarkable legacy of George Shultz. Just to be clear, I will not address current economic conditions or monetary policy.</p>
<p>I have been an admirer of George Shultz since my college years. I saw him then and now as a great role model, as I mentioned a few months ago when delivering the Baccalaureate address to Princeton's class of 2025, 50 years after my own graduation.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20251201a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>As I told the graduates, when I faced the world after college, I had no real plan, but knew that I wanted to combine a private-sector career with public service. I had in mind a few well-known public figures of the era, especially George Shultz, whose picture was on the wall of the Princeton eating club of which both of us were members. George may also have caught my attention because my dad was a labor lawyer who represented one of the major steel companies in collective bargaining. Like George, my father had both a belief in the collective bargaining process and a deep respect for workers.</p>
<p>I followed George's career with interest through the years. It didn't occur to me that I would ever have the honor of meeting him. But I did meet him after I joined the Fed in 2012, as I visited Stanford from time to time. I remember energetic economic discussions at group lunches in his conference room at Hoover. George was also kind enough to host John Taylor, Michael, and me for a chilly round of golf on a rainy March day.</p>
<p>Today, our focus is on George's extraordinarily broad economic accomplishments. I also want to celebrate the remarkable man and policymaker that he was. Several things stand out for me.</p>
<p>He was a man who combined strong principles and unshakeable integrity with common sense and a practical, problem-solving approach to policy. He had a deep belief in the wisdom of markets and a desire to let them work whenever possible without government direction. That theme runs through many issues we will discuss, including collective bargaining, wage and price controls, and exchange rates.</p>
<p>But he was not an absolutist and saw that there are sometimes market failures that should be addressed by public policy. As one of the most successful policymakers of his era, George brought the intellectual rigor of an academic to the practical, constrained, messy work of policymaking. Through four cabinet appointments, he dealt with many of the great issues of his day, with remarkable success. And he kept at it long after leaving public office, making important contributions on health care reform, climate change and nuclear disarmament.</p>
<p>He may be less well known for this, but George Shultz was deeply concerned about racial discrimination in the workplace and our society more broadly. He consistently and effectively used his positions of authority to increase opportunities for minorities. He later noted that there was both a moral and an economic basis for this.</p>
<p>He stuck to his principles while also treating people with honesty and respect, including those with whom he had policy disagreements.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20251201a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;Labor leaders welcomed his appointment as Secretary of Labor. As many of his contemporaries remarked, faced with divergent views and difficult issues, he was extraordinarily good at steering people toward agreement. A key part of that strategy was to let the parties reach the final agreement themselves. That way, they owned the agreement and were more likely to honor it. His friendships and collaborations were beyond number, and knew no partisan bounds.</p>
<p>He often said that trust is the coin of the realm, and that good things were only possible where there was mutual trust.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20251201a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;His integrity provided the basis for that trust. All of those who aspire to serve the public can learn from his example.</p>

Shultz's background as a mediator served him well in economic policymaking, and Paul Volcker would later say of Shultz, "Time and again he would work with almost inhuman patience to bring a group to agreement upon a decision all could support, at times submerging his own preferences"; see Philip Taubman (2023),&nbsp;<em>In the Nation's Service: The Life and Times of George P. Shultz</em>&nbsp;(Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press), p. 23.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn3"></a>3. Shultz summed up his views in this area in the mottoes "Trust is the coin of the realm" and "Respect your adversaries"; see George P. Shultz (2016),&nbsp;<em>Learning from Experience</em>&nbsp;(Stanford, Calif.: Hoover Institution Press).&nbsp;</p>
