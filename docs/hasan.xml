<div> consultation paper, financial institutions, insurance policies, Basic Financial Planning Guide, protection needs <br />
<br />
The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is seeking feedback on proposals to reduce the amount of information collected by financial institutions for selected insurance policies based on the Basic Financial Planning Guide. The proposals aim to simplify the process for consumers, encourage cost-effective products, and set limits to protect consumers' interests. <br />
Summary: The MAS is seeking feedback on proposals to reduce information collection by financial institutions for specific insurance policies based on the Basic Financial Planning Guide. The aim is to simplify the process for consumers, encourage cost-effective products, and set limits to protect consumers' interests. <div>
<p><span>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) today published a consultation paper to seek feedback on proposals to reduce the amount of information collected by financial institutions from their clients for selected insurance policies, when recommendations are made based on the Basic Financial Planning Guide (Guide). The proposals will enable consumers to meet their protection needs more easily through the purchase of simple and cost-effective insurance policies.</span><br /><br /><span>2&nbsp;</span><span> </span><span>MAS and MoneySense, in collaboration with CPF Board and finance industry associations, launched the Guide in October 2023 to help Singaporeans take steps to enhance their financial well-being. The Guide outlines a few rules of thumb for individuals to start taking proactive steps to address their savings, insurance and investment needs. In particular, the Guide encourages Singaporeans to allocate up to 15% of their take-home pay on insurance protection. Consumers are also advised to obtain insurance coverage of 9 times&rsquo; their annual income for death and total permanent disability, and 4 times&rsquo; their annual income for critical illness. Six customised variations of the Guide were issued on 31 January 2024 to illustrate the financial planning needs of individuals at different life stages. More information on the Guide can be found on the&nbsp;</span><a class="mas-link" href="http://www.go.gov.sg/financialplanningguide" target="_blank"><span class="mas-link__text">MoneySense website</span>&nbsp;<span class="mas-icon mas-glyphs-external--link"></span></a><span>.</span><br /><br /><span>3&nbsp;</span><span> </span><span>MAS is now proposing to reduce the amount of information which financial institutions are required to collect from clients, when they make recommendations on term life insurance and standard critical illness policies that are based on the rules of thumb in the Guide. This will simplify the process for consumers, and encourage the offer of simple and cost-effective products to help consumers meet their protection needs, subject to the limits in the Guide.</span><br /><br /><span>4&nbsp;</span><span> </span><span>Mr Lim Tuang Lee, Assistant Managing Director (Capital Markets), MAS, said, &ldquo;The proposals seek to simplify the financial advisory process through which Singaporeans can obtain cost-effective insurance coverage. At the same time, the upper limits stipulated in the Basic Financial Planning Guide on insurance coverage and spending serve as safeguards to protect consumers&rsquo; interests.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>5&nbsp;</span><span> </span><span>For more details, please refer to the consultation paper&nbsp;</span><a class="mas-link" href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/publications/consultations/CMI/2024/cp-on-proposals-to-simplify-requirements-and-facilitate-access-to-insurance-products" target="_blank"><span class="mas-link__text">here</span>&nbsp;<span class="mas-icon mas-glyphs-external--link"></span></a><span>. MAS invites financial institutions, consumers, and other interested parties to submit their comments on the proposals by 15 March 2024.</span></p>

<title>SIFMA Statement On Introduction Of Resolution To Address SAB 121</title>

<div> SEC, SIFMA, SAB 121, digital assets, regulatory oversight
Summary:
SIFMA thanked Senator Lummis, Congressman Flood, and Representative Nickel for addressing the issues with SAB 121, which had been issued without stakeholder engagement and impacted bank capital and liquidity ratios by disincentivizing custodial services for digital assets. They emphasized the need for comprehensive and deliberate regulatory oversight. <div>
<p>SIFMA &nbsp;issued the following statement from president and CEO Kenneth E. Bentsen, Jr. regarding a&nbsp;<em>Congressional Review Act</em>&nbsp;resolution introduced today related to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121):</p>
<p>&ldquo;SIFMA thanks Senator Lummis, Congressman Flood and Representative Nickel for their efforts to address Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (&ldquo;SAB 121&rdquo;), which the SEC issued without stakeholder engagement or consultation with the prudential regulators to fundamentally change the way financial institutions are expected to account for the custody of digital assets. SAB 121&rsquo;s requirement for balance sheet recognition deviates from current accounting treatment for traditional assets held in custody, which are not required to be recorded on a firm&rsquo;s balance sheet. Because of its impact on bank capital and liquidity ratios, SAB 121 has disincentivized banks from providing custodial services for digital assets. We do not disagree with the need for&nbsp;regulatory oversight, but the process should be deliberate and comprehensive&nbsp;to avoid unintended knock-on effects. Banks are already subject to extensive prudential rules and oversight and have deep expertise in providing safe custody of a wide variety of assets. SIFMA has consistently supported congressional action to bring attention to this issue and restore the ability for banks to provide such services for their clients, and we thank Senator Lummis and Congressmen Flood and Nickel for their leadership today.&rdquo;</p>

<title>B.C. Securities Commission: Blockchain Company Commits Misrepresentation About Consultant Spending</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bc-securities-commission-blockchain-company-commits-misrepresentation-about-c/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The B.C. Securities Commission (BCSC)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/hearings/decisions/2024/blok-technologies-inc-and-james-joseph-hyland-findings" target="_blank">has found</a>&nbsp;that a Vancouver-based blockchain technology investment company made misrepresentations when it failed to disclose it had spent, or planned to spend, most of the proceeds from a private placement on consultants.</p>
<p>A panel found that BLOK Technologies Inc., previously known as Aida Minerals Corp., published a false or misleading news release which said the company had raised approximately $5.4 million, but did not disclose that nearly $4.4 million would go toward consulting fees. The company retained approximately $950,000 &ndash; less than 18 per cent of the amount raised.</p>
<p>The news release indicated that the proceeds of the private placement would be spent on advancing the company&rsquo;s blockchain investment projects, evaluating new blockchain opportunities and working capital. It also stated that the financing will take &ldquo;our company to the next level in the execution of its business model &hellip; and we look forward to advancing our worldwide investment projects with top-level strategic partners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Given these claims, the panel concluded that reasonable investors would not have expected that BLOK would retain less than 18 per cent of what it had raised to execute its business model and pay expenses.</p>
<p>The panel found that the company&rsquo;s failure to disclose this information to investors was misleading and a misrepresentation.</p>
<p>The panel dismissed allegations that BLOK&rsquo;s vice-president and director, James Joseph Hyland, authorized, permitted or acquiesced in BLOK&rsquo;s contravention and therefore committed the same offence. In making this determination, the panel concluded that the &ldquo;Executive Director has failed to establish that Hyland had actual knowledge of the consulting agreements when the June 8 news release was issued.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Last year BLOK&rsquo;s former CEO, Robert Earle Dawson and its former CFO, David Malcolm Alexander, were&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/about/media-room/news-releases/2023/47-ceo-and-cfo-suspended-from-investment-market-for-misrepresentation">prohibited</a>&nbsp;from participating in the investment market for their part in the misrepresentation. Alexander also paid $25,000 for his misconduct.</p>
<p>The company, which is in the process of being dissolved, used to trade on the Canadian Securities Exchange.</p>
<p>The panel will next consider what sanctions to impose, which could include monetary penalties or bans from market participation</p>

<div> SEC, Investor Advocacy Coalition, Forced Arbitration Clauses, RIA, Investment Fraud Victims
Summary:<br />Investor advocacy groups form coalition to reform SEC rules. Concerns include forced arbitration clauses used by RIAs, violation of fiduciary duty, and cost-prohibitive forum fees. Victims struggle to recover losses and face financial hurdles to arbitration. SEC urged to act or Congress to pass laws to protect investors. <div>
<p><span><span><span>A coalition of investor advocacy groups, including the Public Investors Advocate Bar Association (PIABA), the American Association for Justice (AAJ), Americans for Financial Reform (AFR), Better Markets, Consumer Federation of America (CFA), the National Association of Consumer Advocates (NACA), and Public Citizen, formally announced a new campaign aimed at reforming Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC) rules for registered investor advisers (RIA)&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=4tNED-2FM8iDZJQyQ53jATUWgRE384tHgp8wdcDkAUwQ8a9GKZkbzpUNBTssR2HpnsEnNT5kAR-2BjIMAWXUXNrl5Q-3D-3DirEW_dOZemr-2FgfCF7mCOtP6PwaQNIgduZQ7bQ177Ra6lERxzr1nz8fftCyEChkv6xi4cWEY6V4bZTsEJG7L17SaUrVefdJd-2FinBmqS0tKJl87e06dc6UzwbqbJJiaf2NBPSTnzR90fcndLCTi2fDQaXKxGxQgTJ9eiZBjR11D1te0zQpjmMkE9geXvFc1V9-2FVDilXQZX37F8Jx2quDCXcU1E6VF-2Be-2FXyG1OLmFixvHCLcJkcAk6R90MyAJGpncSwsA-2FKyCM6YSPkgbcUenqB46gCOLivwyK5-2FW-2ByZlSYae0Y4tV8PIfC072WfE600I98tmMsTlfWaepMo7QLBoGauAymv2zZ2JtPlZEL0-2BEhupOWRYPQ-3D" target="_blank"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>during a press conference</span></span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;held at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Speaking at the press event, PIABA President Joe Peiffer, said:&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;PIABA will continue to fight forced arbitration clauses inserted into investor contracts by unscrupulous RIAs. These fake fiduciaries use their boilerplate agreements to stack the deck against investors. It&rsquo;s time that either the SEC or Congress put an end to this nonsense.&rdquo;</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The formation of the investor advocacy coalition follows&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=4tNED-2FM8iDZJQyQ53jATUfzEOx6X3y4gRpsybVDazMtLWhMrMRVbU9QT4as-2BBrimbN1mAJmpo6QxS7JBcTTQxQ-3D-3D1_R-_dOZemr-2FgfCF7mCOtP6PwaQNIgduZQ7bQ177Ra6lERxzr1nz8fftCyEChkv6xi4cWEY6V4bZTsEJG7L17SaUrVefdJd-2FinBmqS0tKJl87e06dc6UzwbqbJJiaf2NBPSTnzR90fcndLCTi2fDQaXKxGxQgTJ9eiZBjR11D1te0zQpjmMkE9geXvFc1V9-2FVDilXQZX37F8Jx2quDCXcU1E6VEVRHYQUukkqe1dyClB1V-2B-2BAfPGB5YwzjReGOMd7UI2rQLkgttnOQFq1-2BvzSL34moWVg0GJKwxUJlNgMsaFNnk4IGAohbKdlCQEqHwbO3vRylUzSvfqeEVpiteIDsJNU-2FCqS0SG-2BGRf5FrmapW7h7-2FM-3D" target="_blank"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>a December report by the SEC&rsquo;s Office of the Investor Advocate (OIA)</span></span></span></a><span><span>, which found many RIA forced arbitration agreements may be in &ldquo;violation of the [advisers&rsquo;] fiduciary duty.&rdquo; The report also found that approximately 61% of SEC-registered advisers serving retail investor clients incorporated forced arbitration clauses into their investment advisory agreements. The OIA report echoed what PIABA previously had described as an &ldquo;untenable&rdquo; system for aggrieved investors who seek restitution for improper investment practices by their RIA, which can often dissuade wronged investors from seeking compensatory damages for losses they&rsquo;ve suffered.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Micah Hauptman, director of Investor Protection at the Consumer Federation of America, said: &ldquo;<strong>Advisers should not be able to use forced arbitration clauses to immunize themselves from accountability for their misconduct. If an adviser uses forced arbitrations in ways that effectively deny a client&rsquo;s ability to pursue justice and recover for losses they&rsquo;ve suffered, the adviser is placing their interests ahead of the client&rsquo;s, in violation of the adviser&rsquo;s fiduciary duty. No reasonable investor would consent to the use of such a clause.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Martha Perez-Pedemonti,&nbsp;civil justice &amp; consumer rights Counsel at&nbsp;Public Citizen, said:&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;This is an issue affecting a diverse group of investors, not just the wealthy investors. Middle-class investors, who&rsquo;ve worked their entire lives saving bit by bit so that one day they can finally retire, find themselves in an untenable situation where there is little to no recourse if they fall victim to fraud or mismanagement by their &lsquo;trusted&rsquo; investment advisors. We support those investors &ndash; and that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re calling on the SEC and Congress to fix this.&rdquo;</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;<strong>We agree with our colleagues that the use of forced arbitration directly conflicts with prohibitions on advisor self-dealing and self-serving misconduct that risks harm to investors,&rdquo;&nbsp;</strong>said<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Christine Hines, legislative director for the National Association of Consumer Advocates (NACA). &ldquo;<strong>The SEC must act or Congress must pass a law to ensure that arbitration is truly voluntary and chosen after the dispute arises, not tucked away in an obscure provision of the initial contract.&rdquo;</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Brady Williams, legal counsel at Better Markets, said:<strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;Better Markets and others believe that the financial services industry should simply not be allowed to force their clients into arbitration. But at a minimum, the SEC should have more information about the use of these clauses in the world of investment advisers, where the abuses appear to be most egregious.&rdquo;&nbsp;</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The concerns of the newly formed investor advocacy coalition strongly echo complaints made by investment fraud victims, represented by PIABA member attorneys, during a&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=4tNED-2FM8iDZJQyQ53jATUWgRE384tHgp8wdcDkAUwQ-2BtzJEucQAHN-2B90L0m23vhxXJcXuqLnyASXzd208YsqdA-3D-3Drkm7_dOZemr-2FgfCF7mCOtP6PwaQNIgduZQ7bQ177Ra6lERxzr1nz8fftCyEChkv6xi4cWEY6V4bZTsEJG7L17SaUrVefdJd-2FinBmqS0tKJl87e06dc6UzwbqbJJiaf2NBPSTnzR90fcndLCTi2fDQaXKxGxQgTJ9eiZBjR11D1te0zQpjmMkE9geXvFc1V9-2FVDilXQZX37F8Jx2quDCXcU1E6VP5mlGyN9efQRuyYYsvzP6ePu2RncH9L4XnTCf-2BN6JBh4YYJEW46weaoRGEHA8V2v64Wa-2FkZypFQMQJdGbQJyOZ-2F3isBkeb2uoqFhgOAPj-2BQiYW29tiuEeSNQXFsnCcCSJA85x2MvtOZplxY48HKW4o-3D" target="_blank"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>press conference held in July.</span></span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;The investor fraud victims described two primary issues that were confirmed in recent SEC report: fiduciary RIAs using arbitration provisions as a shield against liability; and RIAs failing to pay the awards issued against them.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Marykay Dragovich, the conservator for her cousin Rita Berardelli, described the process of forced arbitration after their trusted RIA lost over $228,000 in principal investments, money that Berardelli had saved as a registered nurse before suffering two life-altering brain aneurisms that left her incapacitated. When Dragovich investigated recovering the losses for her cousin, she learned it would cost up to $202,000 to pay the upfront costs of an arbitration hearing. So even if Berardelli got all her money back, she would have to pay as much as 90% of it to the arbitrators as prescribed by the overlooked forced arbitration clause in the agreement with her RIA.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A second investment fraud victim, Michael Phillips recounted what he described as a &ldquo;cruel lesson&rdquo; after he was awarded over $4 million in a FINRA arbitration dispute against an investment management firm but has yet to receive the funds. The investment management firm, Asia Pacific, instead of paying their owed restitution to Mr. Phillips, filed bankruptcy in bad faith to escape the financial responsibility of paying the award &ndash; a surprisingly legal evasion tactic that was also spelled out as one of the primary issues identified in the December SEC OIA report.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Unlike brokerage firms, which must designate FINRA as the arbitration forum, RIAs most commonly require clients to file arbitration claims with privately run dispute resolution forums such as the American Arbitration Association or JAMS, where arbitrators set their own fees &ndash; unlike the FINRA forum, where FINRA sets the arbitrators&rsquo; rates. According to arbitration attorneys, it is not uncommon for an AAA or JAMS arbitrator to charge $8,000 or more for a day&rsquo;s work. Total arbitration costs can easily exceed $64,000 for five days of hearings and three days of pre-hearing and post-hearing work. The costs can triple if there are three arbitrators hearing the dispute.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Under many RIA-investor agreements, the privately run forums require the expected fees to be deposited prior to the case proceeding. This means that an investor may have to deposit tens of thousands of dollars just to have their claim move forward. RIAs, knowing the forum fees are cost-prohibitive for most clients, use these types of forced arbitration clauses to shield themselves from liability for their misconduct.</span></span></p>

<div> indictment, money laundering, cryptocurrency, BTC-e, arrest
Summary:<br />Belarusian and Cypriot nationals indicted for operating BTC-e, a digital currency exchange involved in cybercrime and money laundering. Klimenka was arrested in Latvia and faces 25 years in prison if convicted. The National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team is leading the investigation and prosecution, collaborating with government agencies and the private sector to combat illicit use of cryptocurrencies. <div>
<p>An indictment was unsealed on Tuesday charging a Belarusian and Cypriot national with money laundering conspiracy and operation of an unlicensed money services business.</p>
<p>According to the indictment, between 2011 and July 2017, Aliaksandr Klimenka, 42, allegedly controlled BTC-e, a digital currency exchange, with Alexander Vinnik and others. Klimenka also allegedly controlled Soft-FX, a technology services company, and FX Open, a financial company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The indictment alleges BTC-e was a significant cybercrime and online money laundering entity that allowed its users to trade in bitcoin with high levels of anonymity and developed a customer base heavily reliant on criminal activity. BTC-e allegedly facilitated transactions for cybercriminals worldwide and received criminal proceeds from numerous computer intrusions and hacking incidents, ransomware scams, identity theft schemes, corrupt public officials, and narcotics distribution rings, and allegedly was used to facilitate crimes ranging from computer hacking to fraud, identity theft, tax refund fraud schemes, public corruption, and drug trafficking. BTC-e&rsquo;s servers, maintained in the United States, were allegedly one of the primary ways in which BTC-e and its operators effectuated their scheme. Those servers were allegedly leased to and maintained by Klimenka and Soft-FX.</p>
<p>Despite doing substantial business in the United States, BTC-e allegedly was not registered as a money services business with the U.S. Department of Treasury, had no anti-money laundering process, no system for appropriate &ldquo;know your customer&rdquo; or &ldquo;KYC&rdquo; verification, and no anti-money laundering program as required by federal law.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Klimenka was arrested in Latvia on Dec. 21, 2023, at the request of the United States and made his initial appearance in San Francisco yesterday. He is currently being held in custody.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If convicted, Klimenka faces a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri of the Justice Department&rsquo;s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Ismail J. Ramsey for the Northern District of California, Special Agent in Charge William Mancino of the U.S. Secret Service (USSS) Criminal Investigative Division, Assistant Director Michael D. Nordwall of the FBI&rsquo;s Criminal Investigative Division, Chief Jim Lee of IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS:CI), and Special Agent in Charge Tatum King of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) San Francisco made the announcement.</p>
<p>The USSS; FBI; IRS:CI Oakland Field Office and Cyber Crime Unit in Washington, D.C.; and HSI are investigating the case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trial Attorney C. Alden Pelker of the Criminal Division&rsquo;s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Claudia Quiroz for the Northern District of California, both members of the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET), and Assistant U.S. Attorney Katherine Lloyd-Lovett for the Northern District of California are prosecuting the case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Justice Department&rsquo;s Office of International Affairs worked with the Latvian government to secure the arrest of Klimenka.</p>
<p>The NCET was established to combat the growing illicit use of cryptocurrencies and digital assets. Within the Criminal Division&rsquo;s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, the NCET conducts and supports investigations into individuals and entities that are enabling the use of digital assets to commit and facilitate a variety of crimes, with a particular focus on virtual currency exchanges, mixing and tumbling services, and infrastructure providers. The NCET also works to set strategic priorities regarding digital asset technologies, identify areas for increased investigative and prosecutorial focus, and lead the department&rsquo;s efforts to collaborate with domestic and foreign government agencies as well as the private sector to aggressively investigate and prosecute crimes involving cryptocurrency and digital assets.</p>
<p><em>An indictment is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</em></p>

<title>The EBA Consults On Draft Technical Standards On Residual Risk Add-On Hedges Under The Fundamental Review Of The Trading Book</title>

<div> draft technical standards, residual risk add-on hedges, Fundamental Review of the Trading Book, public consultation, Capital Requirements Regulation

Summary:
The EBA is consulting on draft RTS for determining if an instrument acts as a hedge under the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book. The consultation focuses on the conditions for exempting instruments from the residual risk add-on charge and includes a public hearing on 6 March 2024. The draft RTS have been developed in accordance with the CRR3. <div>
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The EBA consults on draft technical standards on residual risk add-on hedges under the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book&nbsp;</span><br /><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today launched a public consultation on its draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on the conditions for determining whether an instrument attracting residual risk acts as a hedge. These RTS are part of the Phase 1 deliverables of the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-publishes-roadmap-implementation-eu-banking-package" title="The EBA publishes roadmap on the implementation of the EU Banking Package"><span>EBA roadmap on the implementation of the EU banking package in the area of market risk</span></a><span>. The consultation runs until 3 May 2024.</span></p>
<p>One of the pillars of the standardised approach (SA) under the new fundamental review of the trading book (FRTB) framework is the residual risk add-on (RRAO).</p>
<p>The Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR3) introduces a provision in the RRAO framework allowing the exemption from the RRAO charge for instruments bearing residual risks that are taken to hedge instruments bearing residual risks too. The CRR3 also includes a mandate for the EBA to develop RTS specifying when an instrument qualifies as a hedge for the purpose of the exemption and when not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The RTS proposed for consultation require institutions to identify whether the RRAO charge for which the institution seeks the exemption relates to a risk factor that is not shocked in the SbM (i.e. non-SbM risk factor), or if it is down to other reasons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the RRAO relates exclusively to a non-SbM risk factor, the RTS envisage conditions to verify that, as a result of the hedge, the sensitivity towards the non-SbM risk factor is significantly reduced.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, where the RRAO charge is due to other reasons than the presence of a non-SbM risk factor, the RTS allow the hedging instrument to be recognised as hedge, and as such, exempted from the RRAO charge, only if it completely offsets the RRAO risk stemming from the hedged instruments.</p>
<h4>Consultation process</h4>
<p>Comments to this consultation can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the "send your comments" button on the consultation page. Please note that the deadline for the submission of comments is 3 May 2024.</p>
<p>The public hearing on these draft RTS will take place via conference call on 6 March 2024 from 15.00 to 16.00 CET. The EBA invites interested stakeholders to register using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/public-hearing-rrao-hedge-under-frtb-rules" title="Public hearing on RRAO hedge under FRTB rules ">this link</a>&nbsp;by 4 March 2024 at 16:00 CET.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<p>The draft RTS on the FRTB have been developed according to Article 325(u)(6) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR), as amended by the CRR3, which mandates the EBA to specify criteria to identify positions attracting residual risk that act as a hedge.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>CFTC&nbsp;</span>Commissioner Caroline D. Pham today announced new executive staff appointments in her Washington, D.C. office. Taylor Foy joins Commissioner Pham&rsquo;s team as a Senior Advisor and Nicholas Elliot has joined as a Confidential Assistant and Policy Advisor.</p>

<p><span>Taylor Foy, Senior Advisor</span></p>
<p><span>Taylor Foy joins Commissioner Pham&rsquo;s office after nearly 14 years on Capitol Hill, where he served as the Communications Director for the influential Senate Judiciary, Senate Finance, and Senate Budget Committees.

<h2>Monetary Policy Summary, February 2024</h2>
<p>The Bank of England&rsquo;s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. At its meeting ending on 31 January 2024, the MPC voted by a majority of 6&ndash;3 to maintain Bank Rate at 5.25%. Two members preferred to increase Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 5.5%. One member preferred to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 5%.</p>
<p>The Committee&rsquo;s updated projections for activity and inflation are set out in the accompanying February Monetary Policy Report. These are conditioned on a market-implied path for Bank Rate that declines from 5&frac14;% to around 3&frac14;% by the end of the forecast period, almost 1 percentage point lower on average than in the November Report.</p>
<p>Since the MPC&rsquo;s previous meeting, global GDP growth has remained subdued, although activity continues to be stronger in the United States. Inflationary pressures are abating across the euro area and United States. Wholesale energy prices have fallen significantly. Material risks remain from developments in the Middle East and from disruption to shipping through the Red Sea.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk157533109"></a>Following recent weakness, GDP growth is expected to pick up gradually during the forecast period, in large part reflecting a waning drag on the rate of growth from past increases in Bank Rate. Business surveys are consistent with an improving outlook for activity in the near term.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk157445313"></a>The labour market has continued to ease, but remains tight by historical standards. In the February Report projections, the continuing relative weakness of demand, despite subdued supply growth by historical standards, leads a margin of economic slack to emerge during the first half of the forecast period. Unemployment is expected to rise somewhat further.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk157533248"></a>Twelve-month CPI inflation fell to 4.0% in December 2023, below expectations in the November Report. This downside news has been broad-based,&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk157443762"></a>reflecting lower fuel, core goods and services price inflation. Although still elevated, wage growth has eased across a number of measures and is projected to decline further in coming quarters.</p>
<p>CPI inflation is projected to fall temporarily to the 2% target in 2024 Q2 before increasing again in Q3 and Q4. This profile of inflation over the second half of the year is&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk157533352"></a>accounted for by developments in the direct energy price contribution to 12-month inflation, which becomes less negative. In the MPC&rsquo;s latest most likely, or modal, projection conditioned on the lower market-implied path for Bank Rate, CPI inflation is around 2&frac34;% by the end of this year. It then remains above target over nearly all of the remainder of the forecast period. This reflects the persistence of domestic inflationary pressures, despite an increasing degree of slack in the economy. CPI inflation is projected to be 2.3% in two years&rsquo; time and 1.9% in three years.</p>
<p>The Committee judges that the risks around its modal CPI inflation projection are skewed to the upside over the first half of the forecast period, stemming from geopolitical factors. It now judges that the risks from domestic price and wage pressures are more evenly balanced, meaning that, unlike in previous forecasts, there is no difference between the MPC&rsquo;s modal and mean projections at the two and three-year horizons.</p>
<p>Conditioned on the alternative assumption of constant interest rates at 5.25%, the path for CPI inflation is significantly lower than in the Committee&rsquo;s modal projection conditioned on the declining path of market rates, falling below the 2% target from 2025 Q4 onwards.</p>
<p>The MPC&rsquo;s remit is clear that the inflation target applies at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework recognises that there will be occasions when inflation will depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. Monetary policy will ensure that CPI inflation returns to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term.</p>
<p>At this meeting, the Committee voted to maintain Bank Rate at 5.25%. Headline CPI inflation has fallen back relatively sharply. The restrictive stance of monetary policy is weighing on activity in the real economy and is leading to a looser labour market.&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk157447553"></a>In the Committee&rsquo;s February forecast, the risks to inflation are more balanced. Although services price inflation and wage growth have fallen by somewhat more than expected, key indicators of inflation persistence remain elevated.</p>
<p>As a result, monetary policy will need to remain restrictive for sufficiently long to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term in line with the MPC&rsquo;s remit. The Committee has judged since last autumn that monetary policy needs to be restrictive for an extended period of time until the risk of inflation becoming embedded above the 2% target dissipates.</p>
<p>The MPC remains prepared to adjust monetary policy as warranted by economic data to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably. It will therefore continue to monitor closely indications of persistent inflationary pressures and resilience in the economy as a whole, including a range of measures of the underlying tightness of labour market conditions, wage growth and services price inflation. On that basis, the Committee will keep under review for how long Bank Rate should be maintained at its current level.</p>

<h2>Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 31 January 2024</h2>
<p>1: Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. The latest data on these topics were set out in the accompanying&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy-report/2024/february-2024">February 2024 Monetary Policy Report</a>.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk157536174"></a>2: Consumer price inflation across major advanced economies had declined by more than had been expected in the November Report, with continued easing of both goods and services price inflation. The Committee compared features of the disinflation seen across the United States, the euro area and the United Kingdom, and the risks around the inflation outlook. The Committee judged that the divergence seen across economies reflected differences in energy price dynamics and variation in the impact and timing of recent global shocks and their subsequent dissipation, alongside distinct profiles for spare capacity. Disinflation in core goods prices had been comparatively more pronounced so far in the United States because in the euro area and the United Kingdom the lag between falls in producer output price inflation and core consumer goods inflation had shown signs that it might have been longer than in previous cycles.</p>
<p>3: There had also been some differences, as well as commonalities, in the development of services price inflation and wage growth across these economies. Bank staff analysis suggested that the recent falls in services inflation across the three economies had been accounted for largely by declining non-labour input costs, including energy. Labour costs, by contrast, had remained elevated across countries, although there were some signs of easing emerging, particularly in the United States. To the extent that they were broadly comparable, measures of wage inflation had remained considerably higher in the United Kingdom than elsewhere.</p>
<p>4: In the United Kingdom, all of the respondents to the Bank&rsquo;s latest Market Participants Survey (MaPS) expected Bank Rate to be left unchanged at this MPC meeting. They also all expected the next move in the Bank Rate to be downward. The median expected profile for Bank Rate from the MaPS implied a cumulative 100 basis point reduction in Bank Rate this year starting from June 2024, broadly in line with market pricing. Market contacts had suggested that disinflationary news in recent economic data outturns both in other jurisdictions and in the United Kingdom had been a significant factor in the downward moves in UK short-term rates in recent months. Similar downward moves in short-term rates had also occurred in other advanced economies over this period.</p>
<p>5: UK GDP growth had weakened in 2023, with this weakness particularly pronounced in market sector output. This reflected the significant tightening of monetary policy implemented since the end of 2021 to contain the persistence of second-round effects on inflation as well as continued weakness in potential supply growth. Cumulative GDP growth over 2023 as a whole had been materially weaker than expected at the time of the November Report, with the path for household consumption notably below expectations. Timelier indicators suggested that activity would edge up in 2024 Q1.</p>
<p>6: The Committee had completed its annual supply stocktake, as set out in Section 3 of the February Report, and judged that potential supply growth remained weak by historical standards. The MPC also now judged that the degree of excess demand had been a little higher over the recent past than had been assumed in the November Report, implying weaker supply growth in the past. At the same time, it had revised up slightly its view of potential supply growth in the future, although this was still expected to be weaker than the rates seen pre-Covid.</p>
<p>7: The Committee discussed the degree of persistence in wage growth and domestic price inflation. There had been downside news in headline CPI inflation relative to the November Report, accounted for by a combination of fuel, core goods and services prices. In absolute terms, services price inflation remained significantly elevated. There had been a common signal from a range of indicators that wage growth had eased somewhat recently, although it had remained significantly elevated overall. This downward trend had been most pronounced in the annual rate of growth of private sector regular average weekly earnings (AWE), although that had brought the AWE series more into line with other indicators.</p>
<p>8: The majority of this year&rsquo;s wage setting processes would conclude in the next few months. A survey of firms conducted by the Bank&rsquo;s Agents suggested that the average pay settlement in 2024 would be for a rise only slightly lower than in 2023, at 5.4%. It remained to be seen to what degree the falls in CPI inflation and short-term inflation expectations would influence this year&rsquo;s wage setting, although this could also be influenced by a catch-up effect following the high rates of CPI inflation seen over the past couple of years. Evidence from the Agents suggested some possible upward pressures on wages from indirect effects of the increase in the National Living Wage. Intelligence from the Agents, however, also suggested that companies would not be able to pass on increased costs into prices as much as they had done in 2023.</p>
<h3>The immediate policy decision</h3>
<p>9: The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment.</p>
<p>10: In the MPC&rsquo;s February Monetary Policy Report projections, UK GDP was expected to have been flat in 2023 Q4. Growth was expected to pick up gradually during the forecast period, in large part reflecting a waning drag from past increases in Bank Rate. In the medium term, the lower market-implied interest rate path, on which the forecast was conditioned, pushed up on GDP materially compared with the November projection.</p>
<p>11: The labour market had continued to ease, but had remained tight. In the February Report projections, the continuing relative weakness of demand, despite subdued supply growth by historical standards, led to a margin of economic slack emerging during the first half of the forecast period. Relative to November, the output gap projection had been pushed up by the boost to demand from the lower market path of interest rates. Equivalently, this implied&nbsp;that, if monetary policy were to follow the yield curve, then the stance of policy would be less restrictive than at the time of the November Report.</p>
<p>12: Twelve-month CPI inflation had remained above the 2% target. Inflation had fallen to 4.0% in December, below expectations in the November Report. The downside news had been broad-based, reflecting lower fuel, core goods and services price inflation. Although still elevated, wage growth had eased across a number of measures and was projected to decline further in coming quarters.</p>
<p>13: In the MPC&rsquo;s latest most likely, or modal, projections, CPI inflation was expected to fall temporarily to the 2% target in 2024 Q2 before increasing again in Q3 and Q4. This profile of inflation over the second half of the year was accounted for by developments in the direct energy price contribution to 12-month inflation, which becomes less negative. Conditioned on a lower market-implied path for Bank Rate than had underpinned the November Report, CPI inflation was then projected to remain above the 2% target over nearly all of the remainder of the forecast period, owing to persistence in domestic inflationary pressures.</p>
<p>14: The Committee judged that the risks around the modal inflation projection were skewed to the upside over the first half of the forecast period, stemming from geopolitical factors. Risks from domestic price and wage pressures were now more evenly balanced, however. Taken together, this meant there was no difference between the MPC&rsquo;s modal and mean projections at the two and three-year horizons.</p>
<p>15: The MPC judged that monetary policy would need to remain restrictive for sufficiently long to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, in line with the MPC&rsquo;s remit. The Committee had judged since last autumn that monetary policy needed to be restrictive for an extended period of time until the risk of inflation becoming embedded above the 2% target dissipated.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk157608350"></a>16: Six members judged that maintaining Bank Rate at 5.25% was warranted at this meeting. Headline CPI inflation had fallen back relatively sharply. The restrictive stance of monetary policy was weighing on activity and was leading to a looser labour market. In the Committee&rsquo;s February forecast, the risks to inflation were more balanced. Although services price inflation and wage growth had fallen by somewhat more than had been expected, key indicators of inflation persistence remained elevated. There were questions, on which further evidence would be required, about how entrenched this persistence would be, and therefore about how long the current level of Bank Rate would need to be maintained.</p>
<p>17: Two members preferred a 0.25 percentage point increase in Bank Rate, to 5.5%, at this meeting. Although headline inflation had fallen by more than had been expected, this was not necessarily informative about inflation persistence. Current indicators of economic activity had remained subdued, but real household incomes had continued to edge up, and forward-looking indicators of output had remained positive. The labour market was still relatively tight, consistent with a rise in the medium-term equilibrium rate of unemployment, and a range of indicators suggested that the pace of loosening had been slow. Measures of wage growth had moderated further but remained at rates above those consistent with the inflation target. Underlying services price inflation had slowed but remained elevated. These members continued to judge that there was evidence of more persistent inflationary pressures than included within the forecast. Financial conditions had eased since the MPC&rsquo;s December meeting. An increase in Bank Rate at this meeting was necessary to address the risks of more deeply embedded inflation persistence and to return inflation to target sustainably in the medium term.</p>
<p>18: One member preferred a 0.25 percentage point reduction in Bank Rate at this meeting. For this member, the increments applied on the way up, together with lags in transmission, meant that Bank Rate needed to become less restrictive now. Waiting for lagging indicators of domestic relative price growth to fall sharply before reducing rates would come with a risk of overtightening. There might be potential upside risks from geopolitics. That said, consumer price inflation was already, and had been for some time, on a firm downward trajectory. Moreover, leading indicators, such as those from granular producer prices data, pointed to an easing in consumer prices. The outlook for demand remained weak, and less resilient than previously assumed, with vacancies falling more sharply than in some other advanced economies and consumption not having recovered to pre-pandemic levels. This further reduced the prospects of embedded persistence, shown in forward-looking indicators of domestic relative prices, such as monthly annualised rates of nominal pay growth and the Bank&rsquo;s Agents&rsquo; surveys, and suggested lower pass-through of costs to prices.</p>
<p>19: The MPC remained prepared to adjust monetary policy as warranted by economic data to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably. It would, therefore, continue to monitor closely indications of persistent inflationary pressures and resilience in the economy as a whole, including a range of measures of the underlying tightness of labour market conditions, wage growth and services price inflation. On that basis, the Committee would keep under review for how long Bank Rate should be maintained at its current level.</p>
<p>20: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bank Rate should be maintained at 5.25%.</li>
</ul>
<p>21: Six members (Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Ben Broadbent, Megan Greene, Huw Pill and Dave Ramsden) voted in favour of the proposition. Three members voted against the proposition. Two members (Jonathan Haskel and Catherine L Mann) preferred to increase Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 5.5%. One member (Swati Dhingra) preferred to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 5%.</p>
<h3>Operational considerations</h3>
<p>22: On 31 January, the total stock of assets held for monetary policy purposes was &pound;738.0 billion, comprising &pound;737.6 billion of UK government bond purchases and &pound;0.4 billion of sterling non‐financial investment‐grade corporate bond purchases.</p>
<p>23: The following members of the Committee were present:</p>

<div> cooperation, virtual assets, supervisory experience, legislative procedure, declaration of cooperation
Summary:
The Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) and the Ukrainian National Securities and Stock Market Commission (NSSMC) have agreed to collaborate closely on the regulation of virtual assets. They held a joint online workshop focusing on operational supervisory experience and plan to continue their long-term partnership through a declaration of cooperation. This collaboration is a result of a Joint Declaration of Intent between the finance ministries of Germany and Ukraine. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<div class="abstract">
<p>The Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (<abbr lang="de" title="Bundesanstalt f&uuml;r Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht" xml:lang="de">BaFin</abbr>) and the Ukrainian National Securities and Stock Market Commission (NSSMC) plan to work together closely in future. A joint online workshop on the topic of virtual assets on 30 January marked an important milestone in their cooperation.</p>
</div>
<div class="wrapBodytext">
<p>&ldquo;We are looking forward to cooperating closely with our partner authority in Ukraine,&rdquo; explained Rupert Schaefer, Chief Executive Director of Strategy, Policy and Control at&nbsp;<abbr lang="de" title="Bundesanstalt f&uuml;r Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht" xml:lang="de">BaFin</abbr>. &ldquo;We want to give the Ukrainian supervisors the best support possible and share our supervisory experience of the&nbsp;<abbr title="Europ&auml;ische Union">EU</abbr>&nbsp;legal framework. It is also just as important for us to learn from our colleagues there&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The agenda for the first joint workshop focussed on fundamental questions about virtual assets with an emphasis on operational supervisory experience. A legislative procedure regarding the treatment of investments in cryptoassets is currently underway in Ukraine.

<div> FXFlat Bank GmbH, BaFin, investigation, unauthorized financial services, identity theft
Summary:
BaFin is investigating the operator of fx-flat.com for offering unauthorized financial services in Germany. The operator falsely claims to be FXFlat Bank GmbH and lists incorrect licensing information. Consumers are advised to exercise caution and conduct thorough research before investing money online to avoid fraud. <div>
<div class="abstract">
<p>The Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt f&uuml;r Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht &ndash;&nbsp;<abbr lang="de" title="Bundesanstalt f&uuml;r Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht" xml:lang="de">BaFin</abbr>) is currently investigating the unknown operator of the website fx-flat.com. The operator uses this website to offer banking business and financial services without the necessary authorisation. The website is not operated by FXFlat Bank&nbsp;<abbr title="Gesellschaft mit beschr&auml;nkter Haftung">GmbH</abbr>. This is a case of identity theft against FXFlat Bank&nbsp;<abbr title="Gesellschaft mit beschr&auml;nkter Haftung">GmbH</abbr>, which is supervised by&nbsp;<abbr lang="de" title="Bundesanstalt f&uuml;r Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht" xml:lang="de">BaFin</abbr>.</p>
</div>
<div class="wrapBodytext">
<p>The operator claims to be based in Ratingen, Germany, and uses the website, which is available only in Italian, to try to convince consumers to open a trading account. The website lists the former headquarters (Josef-Schappe-Stra&szlig;e 21, Ratingen) and telephone number of FXFlat Bank&nbsp;<abbr title="Gesellschaft mit beschr&auml;nkter Haftung">GmbH</abbr>. The operator also falsely claims to be licensed by&nbsp;<abbr lang="de" title="Bundesanstalt f&uuml;r Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht" xml:lang="de">BaFin</abbr>&nbsp;and lists the registration number assigned by&nbsp;<abbr lang="de" title="Bundesanstalt f&uuml;r Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht" xml:lang="de">BaFin</abbr>&nbsp;to FXFlat Bank&nbsp;<abbr title="Gesellschaft mit beschr&auml;nkter Haftung">GmbH</abbr>.</p>
<p>Anyone providing financial or investment services in Germany may do so only with authorisation from&nbsp;<abbr lang="de" title="Bundesanstalt f&uuml;r Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht" xml:lang="de">BaFin</abbr>. However, some companies offer these services without the necessary authorisation. Information on whether particular companies have been authorised by&nbsp;<abbr lang="de" title="Bundesanstalt f&uuml;r Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht" xml:lang="de">BaFin</abbr>&nbsp;can be found in&nbsp;<abbr lang="de" title="Bundesanstalt f&uuml;r Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht" xml:lang="de">BaFin</abbr>&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a class="RichTextIntLink NavNode" href="https://www.bafin.de/EN/PublikationenDaten/Datenbanken/Unternehmenssuche/unternehmenssuche_node_en.html;jsessionid=73FAFB5477FF7E8B27F4AEE6A21C8987.internet952" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Search companies (Opens&nbsp;new&nbsp;window)">database of companies</a>.</p>

<p>Today, FinTech Scotland, working with professional services supporter Deloitte, and with Tesco Bank, Morgan Stanley and abrdn, launched a first-of-its-kind innovation challenge. The industry-led call to action will encourage financial institutions and innovators from across the Fintech community and beyond to learn collaboratively and facilitate industry forums to collectively share best practices for companies to develop new solutions to key financial regulatory challenges.</p>
<p>The inaugural innovation challenge, spearheaded by the newly established Financial Regulation Innovation Lab (FRIL), and funded through the UK Governments&rsquo; Innovation Accelerator programme, delivered by Innovate UK, focuses on 'Simplifying Compliance through the Application of AI and Emerging Technologies'.</p>
<p>The first in a series of industry-led innovation calls, the initiative is dedicated to fostering confidence in the adoption of emerging technologies into financial services. Notably, this call aims to demonstrate the ability technology could have in meeting global regulatory requirements, setting a new standard for future advancements in the industry.</p>
<p>FinTech Scotland and the financial services firms, in conjunction with professional services leader Deloitte, are inviting entrepreneurs and innovators to identify and use technologies to address industry compliance challenges. Launched under the principle of responsible innovation, these calls set the stage for exploration and development of effective solutions that will yield positive outcomes for the pressing needs of consumers and businesses alike, resulting in an overall economic contribution.</p>
<p><strong>Nicola Anderson, CEO of FinTech Scotland, said:</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;We are extremely excited to kick off this inaugural industry innovation challenge. Demand-led innovation calls are an important part of the toolkit that the Financial Regulation Innovation Lab will employ to drive positive outcomes. It is also an opportunity to bring together financial institutions and innovators, enabling financial institutions to learn collaboratively about ways to improve compliance processes to drive efficiency for the sector and, ultimately, increase consumer protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In partnership with the University of Strathclyde and the University of Glasgow, the Lab aims to leverage expertise in financial services risk and compliance and combine this with emerging technologies to build capabilities that maintain and grow both Scotland and the UK&rsquo;s position as a global leader in financial services regulatory innovation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Kent Mackenzie, Fintech Lead for Scotland at Deloitte said:</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;Deloitte is excited to be one of the challenge supporters of the Financial Regulation Innovation Lab&rsquo;s first innovation call.

The Lab provides a unique environment to support collaboration, and this groundbreaking initiative will further support how financial services firms are innovating to meet their regulatory obligations.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Joanne Seagrave, Head of Regulatory Affairs</strong><strong>&nbsp;at Tesco Bank:</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;At Tesco Bank we embrace the opportunity that the Financial Regulation Innovation Lab&rsquo;s innovation call series offers to collaborate with innovators.

<title>Euroclear Delivers Strong Performance In 2023</title>

<p>Euroclear continues to separate Russian sanction-related earnings from the underlying financial results and retain these profits until further guidance is provided on the distribution or management of such profits.</p>
<ul>
<li>Underlying business income reached a record EUR 1,658 million, an increase of 3% year-on-year.</li>
<li>Underlying net profit increased by 63% to almost EUR 1 billion, driven by a robust business performance and a high interest rates environment.</li>
<li>Underlying operating expenses increased by 14% to EUR 1,290 million, on higher inflation and increased investments in line with our strategic ambition to develop digital capabilities and IT infrastructure. The impact of inflation on the group&rsquo;s workforce and non-payroll related costs accounted for an increase of around 5% compared to 2022.</li>
<li>Net interest earnings amounted to EUR 5.5 billion, of which EUR 4.4 billion relate to interests linked to Russian sanctions.</li>
<li>The Russian sanctions and countermeasures resulted in direct costs of EUR 62 million and a loss of business income of EUR 24 million.</li>
<li>Group impairments were recorded in 2023 totalling EUR 125 million, principally related to the impairment of part of the goodwill of our Swedish CSD. The harsher economic conditions and reduced volumes combined with an increase in costs are expected to persist, leading to reduced long-term projections. This has resulted in an impairment of EUR 100 million of the goodwill of the group&rsquo;s Swedish CSD.</li>
<li>Euroclear achieved an underlying EBITDA margin of 57.4%, an increase of 9.7 percentage points compared to 2022.</li>
<li>Underlying earnings per share rose by 63% to EUR 312.1 per share, reflecting the continued increase in net profit.</li>
<li>The Board proposes to pay a dividend per share of EUR 210 in the third quarter of 2024. This represents an increase of 82% and maintains the pay-out ratio at 60% of the underlying earnings.</li>

<p><span>Lieve Mostrey, Chief Executive Officer of Euroclear group, commented:</span></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;2023 was another turbulent year, with geopolitical tensions impacting our macro-economic reality and the global capital markets. In times of complexity and market uncertainty, it is rewarding to know that our diverse client base continues to rely on us for safety and efficiency in processing and safeguarding their assets.</i></p>
<p><i>In 2023, we reached a record underlying business income of EUR 1,658 million and an underlying net profit of almost EUR 1 billion, driven by a robust business performance and a high interest rates environment. We also made solid progress in delivering on our strategic objectives, maintaining our focus on clients, while further developing ESG, data and digital capabilities, and continuing to grow our business internationally. Key achievements include the launch of the Digital Securities Issuance (D-SI) service, the successful connection of Euroclear Bank and Euroclear Finland to the European Central Bank&rsquo;s T2S settlement system and the opening of a new Tech Hub in Krakow, allowing us to create 400 new jobs.</i><br /><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><i>As we recently announced a leadership transition and the selection of Val&eacute;rie Urbain as my successor, this is my last set of full-year results as CEO of Euroclear. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our colleagues across the entire group for their commitment and dedication in delivering another robust performance, servicing our clients and contributing to preserve the certainty, fluidity, and safety of our markets.&rdquo;</i></p>

<p>With a record underlying business income of EUR 1,658 million (+ 3% year-on-year), Euroclear continues to deliver growth despite subdued market conditions. In contrast with 2022, which was characterised by volatile markets following the invasion of Ukraine, 2023 saw market activity slightly decrease while equities valuations recovered. Fixed-income issuance performed well. The diversification of Euroclear&rsquo;s business continues to provide resilience thanks to its subscription-like model as approximately three quarters of the group&rsquo;s business income is decoupled from financial market valuation.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Eurobond and European assets performance resulted from solid issuance and partial recovery of equities valuations, in spite of lower levels of trading compared to last year in most markets.</li>
<li>The investment funds business also suffered from lower activity mainly impacting mutual funds. ETF investment remained strong.</li>
<li>Revenue emanating from the Collateral Highway increased despite reduced volumes for lending and borrowing.</li>
<li>Global and Emerging Markets performance remained solid amid interest in new, emerging markets.</li>

<p>In line with Euroclear&rsquo;s aspiration to become a digital and data-enabled financial market infrastructure, a D&sup2;-FMI, it launched its&nbsp;<i>new Digital Securities Issuance (D-SI) service</i>&nbsp;in September 2023.<i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>The service enables the issuance, distribution and settlement of fully digital international securities - Digitally Native Notes (DNN) - on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). The inaugural DNN was issued by the World Bank, raising EUR 100 million to support its sustainable development activities. The DNN is automatically linked to the traditional settlement platform of Euroclear for secondary market operations, ensuring investors full access to liquidity.</p>
<p>Separately, in December 2023,<i>&nbsp;</i>Fnality, an international consortium of banks and financial institutions, including Euroclear, announced it had completed the first blockchain payments at the Bank of England.&nbsp;Fnality aims to bring central bank money in a digital tokenised form with near-real-time 24/7 settlement capability to allow banks to significantly reduce their intraday liquidity requirements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Building on its acquisitions of MFEX and Goji, Euroclear has continued to enhance its service offering in investment funds with the launch of a new service targeting private market funds. Leveraging Goji&rsquo;s capabilities and the FundSettle platform, the new service complements Euroclear&rsquo;s existing money market, mutual and alternative fund offerings. The launch of the new service also follows the gradual inclusion of MFEX&rsquo;s distribution and data services into the FundSettle platform.</p>
<p>To further streamline Euroclear&rsquo;s funds offering and reflect its ambition to create a true one-stop-shop offering to clients across the full spectrum of funds products, Euroclear&rsquo;s funds offering transitioned to a new brand name, Euroclear FundsPlace.</p>
<p>Euroclear also continued to deploy innovative services for fund distributors globally. In 2023, several clients from Europe and Asia chose Euroclear&rsquo;s fund platform for the onboarding of their investment funds. Euroclear provides a one-stop-shop solution for fund distribution and execution services via its extensive network, allowing these clients to have access to more than 100,000 funds.</p>

<p>Euroclear fully supports the need for integrated, deep and liquid capital markets within the European Union. As a common settlement platform for Europe, the European Central Bank&rsquo;s TARGET2-Securities (T2S) system underpins this harmonised environment.</p>
<p>Euroclear Bank and Euroclear Finland successfully completed the connection to the European Central Bank&rsquo;s T2S settlement system in late 2023. By joining this common infrastructure, the Finnish CSD can offer its users delivery-versus-payment settlement of securities and cash in euro and Danish krone central bank money.</p>
<p>Euroclear also continues to grow its international ecosystem in Asia. Euroclear Bank and the Korea Securities Depository took further step in making the Korean market 'Euroclearable' by signing an agreement to open an omnibus account structure in August 2023. The link will allow international investors efficient post-trade access to KTBs.</p>

<p>In 2023, Euroclear continued to build on its strong ESG foundations established in previous years. It has started work on implementing the principles laid out in its ESG Board policy and begun to measure progress against the ESG KPIs which were approved in early 2023. Euroclear has made progress against its commitments in many areas, meeting its supply-chain screening targets, receiving approval for its targets from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and broadening its training offer. Actions are ongoing to integrate ESG into its current service offering, together with its business partners Impact Cubed and Greenomy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />Within its workplace, Euroclear aims to foster a healthy, performant and learning-orientated corporate culture. Last year, Euroclear onboarded 800 new employees and started to work with the World Economic Forum as one of its partners for &lsquo;The Good Work Alliance&rsquo; which commits to building a more resilient, equitable, inclusive and just future of work.</p>

<div class="text    ">
<p>In recent years, Euroclear&rsquo;s shareholder base has evolved from its traditional 'user-owned' model to include a greater proportion of longer-term institutional investors. In 2023, the group welcomed two new shareholders: New Zealand Super Fund and Novo Holdings, each holding 4.99% and 3.22% respectively.</p>
<p>Furthermore, two of Euroclear&rsquo;s main shareholders reinforced their holding last year. Soci&eacute;t&eacute; F&eacute;d&eacute;rale de Participations et d'Investissement (SFPI/FPIM) acquired 1.79% from various sellers, and now holds 12.92%, while Caisse des D&eacute;p&ocirc;ts et Consignations (CDC) increased its holding by 4.19%, and now holds 10.91%.</p>
<p>The long-term investment vision and commitment of this increasingly diversified shareholder base strengthens Euroclear&rsquo;s position as a neutral and open financial market infrastructure.</p>

<p>As announced on 15 January 2024,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.euroclear.com/campaigns/en/biographies/Valerie-Urbain.html" target="_blank">Val&eacute;rie Urbain</a>&nbsp;has been chosen by the Board as the successor to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.euroclear.com/campaigns/en/biographies/mostrey-lieve.html" target="_blank">Lieve Mostrey</a>&nbsp;as Chief Executive Officer of the Euroclear group. Having received the relevant regulatory approvals, Lieve Mostrey and Val&eacute;rie Urbain will ensure a smooth and orderly transition period until the renewal of the Euroclear Board member mandates at the General Meeting on 3 May 2024.</p>
<p>Lieve Mostrey has led Euroclear as group CEO since January 2017. Under her tenure, Euroclear grew its business, expanded its global footprint, enriched its funds offering notably through the acquisitions of MFEX and Goji and accelerated value creation for shareholders, while at the same time securing CSDR licenses for each of its operating entities.</p>
<p>With over 30 years of experience at Euroclear in a variety of senior roles, including as Head of Human Resources of Euroclear group, CEO of Euroclear Bank and most recently as Chief Business Officer, Val&eacute;rie brings unparalleled knowledge of Euroclear, clients and market trends. She has been a key architect of its successful business strategy.</p>

<h2 class="h2  ">Update on Russian sanctions and countermeasures</h2>
</div>
<div class="text"><a class="anchorID" id="content_text_1351730653" name="content_text_1351730653"></a>
<div class="text    ">
<p>The number of sanctions and countersanctions that have been introduced since February 2022 are unprecedented and continue to have a significant impact on the daily operations of Euroclear. While new sanctions were issued at a declining pace in 2023, these still resulted in more breakage of straight-through process and increased manual interventions.</p>
<p>Well-established processes are in place which allow the group to implement the sanctions, while maintaining the normal course of business. However, one consequence of the sanctions is that blocked coupon payments and redemptions owed to sanctioned entities results in an accumulation of cash on Euroclear Bank&rsquo;s balance sheet. At the end of 2023, Euroclear Bank&rsquo;s balance sheet had increased by EUR 38 billion year-on-year to a total of EUR 162 billion.</p>
<p>Euroclear&rsquo;s priority has been to manage the sanctions according to the spirit and letter of the law. As per Euroclear&rsquo;s standard procedures, Euroclear does not remunerate cash balances and such cash balances are re-invested to minimise risk and capital requirements. Prudent management of such risks is a requirement under Euroclear&rsquo;s Risk Appetite and Policies and expected by the EU Capital Requirements Regulation. The interest received on the reinvestment of cash balances is net interest income earned by Euroclear.</p>
<p>In 2023, interest arising on cash balances from Russia-sanctioned assets was approx. EUR 4.4 billion. Such interest earnings are driven by two factors: (i) the prevailing interest rates and (ii) the amount of cash balances that Euroclear is required to invest. Subject to Belgian corporate tax, these earnings will generate EUR 1,085 million tax revenue for the Belgian State in 2023. As such, future earnings will be influenced by the evolving interest rate environment and the size of cash balances as the sanctions evolve.</p>
<p>Since considerable uncertainties persist,&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk140225743" name="_Hlk140225743"></a>Euroclear considers it necessary to separate the estimated sanction-related earnings from the underlying financial results when assessing the company&rsquo;s performance and resources.</p>
<p>Euroclear is faced with a high level of complexity in managing both the wide-ranging package of sanctions and a set of countermeasures, which Russia has implemented to try to mitigate the impact of the sanctions. Euroclear allocates considerable time, resources and capital to manage market issues, potential risks and implications of these countermeasures, while maintaining regular dialogue with clients and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>Overall, Euroclear incurred additional direct costs from the management of Russian sanctions of EUR 62 million in 2023, with considerable senior management and Board focus on the topic. Additionally, the international sanctions and Russian countermeasures have resulted in a loss of activities from sanctioned clients and Russian securities, which negatively impacted business income by EUR 24 million.</p>
<p>2023 also saw various parties contest the consequences of the application of sanctions, with a significant number of legal proceedings ongoing, almost exclusively in Russian courts. Claimants have initiated legal proceeding aiming mainly to access the assets blocked in Euroclear&rsquo;s books. Despite all legal actions taken by Euroclear and the considerable resources mobilised, the probability of unfavourable rulings in Russian courts is high since Russia does not recognise the international sanctions. Euroclear will continue to defend itself against all legal claims.</p>
<p>In parallel, the Board notes that the European Commission is contemplating various options to use the profits generated by the reinvestment of sanctioned amounts held by financial institutions, including Euroclear, for the financing of Ukraine&rsquo;s reconstruction.</p>
<p>Euroclear is focused on minimising potential legal and operational risks that may arise for itself and its clients from the implementation of any proposals from the European Commission. The company continues to act in a transparent manner with all authorities involved and to retain profits related to the international sanctions applicable on Russian assets until further guidance is provided on the distribution or management of such profits.</p>
<p>Euroclear continues to monitor and assess the potential impact of post balance sheet events on its 2023 financial statements.&nbsp;</p>

<br /><br />Summary: The article emphasizes the traditional and enhanced roles of company secretaries in Singapore, focusing on the importance of good corporate governance and the evolving nature of the role in the face of disruption and multidisciplinary expectations. <div>
<p>Mr Raymond Lam, Chairman, CSIS,</p>
<p>Friends and Colleagues,</p>
<p>Good morning,</p>
<p>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for inviting me here today. I am honoured to have the opportunity to share my views on the role of company secretaries in Singapore, and how it is evolving.</p>
<p>Traditional Roles of the Company Secretary &ndash; &ldquo;What People Think You Do&rdquo;</p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The company secretary is a key officer of any company, who (often together with General Counsel) is responsible for ensuring that the company complies with relevant laws and regulations. The company secretary also acts as a bridge between the board of directors, the management, and the shareholders, facilitating effective communication and collaboration among them.</p>
<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Singapore, in addition to the Companies Act which sets out the statutory duties of all company secretaries, the duties of a company secretary are also governed by the specific constitution of the company and for listed companies, the listing rules of SGX and the Code of Corporate Governance.</p>
<p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Traditionally, the company secretary has had to perform various administrative and operational tasks, such as maintaining the statutory registers and records, arranging for, and attending shareholder and board meetings, preparing and filing the necessary documents, issuing share certificates, and so on. These tasks may seem mundane, but they are essential for the smooth running of the company and the protection of its interests.</p>
<p>Company Secretary as the Chief Governance Officer &ndash; What you Also Do</p>
<p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the role of the company secretary is not limited to these compliance and administrative functions. In fact, the company secretary can &ndash; and in my view should &ndash; play a more strategic and value-adding role, acting as the chief governance officer of the company.</p>
<p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is a chief governance officer, you may ask? Just like any other member of the C-Suite, the chief governance officer in an institution is a senior executive who is tasked with the overall direction and marshalling of people, processes, systems, and other resources in a particular area &ndash; and in this case, to deliver good corporate governance.</p>
<p>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practically, what this means is that the company secretary can help the board and the management to develop and implement a robust and effective governance framework, one that aligns with the vision, mission, values, and objectives of the company. The company secretary can also help to foster a culture of integrity, accountability, transparency, and sustainability within the company, and promote stakeholder engagement and trust.</p>
<p>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, as the chief governance officer, the company secretary can leverage on his or her expertise, experience, and pivotal role in interactions with the board to provide strategic advice and guidance to both the board and management on various matters, such as risk management, business ethics, corporate social responsibility, digital transformation, and innovation. The company secretary can also help to identify and establish partnerships with key stakeholders, industry associations, and regulators, to enhance the reputation and competitiveness of the company. In short, as the chief governance officer, the company secretary can be a catalyst for change and improvement, and a driver for growth and value creation, for the company.</p>
<p>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To varying degrees, some of the above roles are taken on by company secretaries but such an enhanced identity for company secretaries is not widely perceived and understood.</p>
<p>Why Does this Matter?</p>
<p>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to some possible questions that you may have.</p>
<p>11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, does governance matter? Do investors care? Do they reward good governance? The answer is yes, yes, and yes. Governance is not just a matter of compliance, but a matter of performance. Good governance can enhance the efficiency, effectiveness, and sustainability of the company, and create long-term value for shareholders and other stakeholders. Investors are increasingly demanding more transparency, accountability, and engagement from the companies they invest in; one study for instance found that governance-related demands by activist investors increased 50-fold between 2009 to 2019.<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp; And a number of other studies have also found correlations between good governance and higher valuations, and lower cost of capital.</p>
<p>12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are other practical benefits for companies as well. For instance, SGX maintains a Fast Track programme which recognises and rewards companies with high corporate governance standards and good compliance track records. These companies enjoy faster clearance for submissions, including for corporate actions such as share issuances, and requests for waivers. They also benefit from greater visibility and recognition among investors and the public.</p>
<p>13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another example is the Singapore Governance and Transparency Index, which assesses the corporate governance practices of Singapore-listed companies. The index is based on various indicators, such as board structure, board processes, disclosure and communication, stakeholder engagement, and sustainability. The index provides a benchmark for companies to measure and improve their governance standards, and serves as a reference for investors and analysts to evaluate the governance quality of companies. Good corporate governance provides reputational benefits.</p>
<p>14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As company secretaries, you have a vital role to play in ensuring and enhancing the governance of your companies, and in communicating and demonstrating the value of good governance to your investors and other stakeholders. By creating more trust with investors, it increases the prospects of them becoming and remaining shareholders for the longer term, both for listed and non-listed companies. In the case of non-listed companies, failures in governance are often the reason for minority suits against controlling shareholders.</p>
<p>15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, company secretaries play an enhanced role in public or listed companies. Part of the fundamental bargain that underpins public markets is that in exchange for the ability to raise funds from the general public, listed companies commit to higher standards of transparency, disclosure, and corporate governance than apply to non-listed companies. In turn, this means that company secretaries have a more complex and dynamic regulatory environment to deal with, and to keep abreast of. Stakeholder expectations are also more diverse and demanding. Some of the ways that you can be adding value would be as a strategic partner to your boards and your management, and a trusted advisor to your stakeholders by providing insights, guidance, and solutions on various governance and business issues, and by facilitating effective governance processes and practices.</p>
<p>16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the chief governance officer, you are responsible for overseeing and coordinating the governance activities and initiatives of your companies. You are also responsible for ensuring that your companies prepare for and comply with the relevant governance standards and requirements, even as they evolve and change.</p>
<p>17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One live example that highlights the role that the company secretaries should be playing is in the context of the relatively new rules that SGX RegCo has recently introduced such as the 9-year hard cap on the tenure of independent directors and the requirements to disclose a board diversity policy. These rules aim to promote board renewal and diversity, which are essential for enhancing the quality and effectiveness of the board. As the chief governance officer, you have a key responsibility in ensuring that the board agenda includes these matters, and to plan ahead given the deadlines and the expectations of the regulators and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus far, compliance with these new rules has not been uniform. According to a recently released joint study by SGX RegCo and the Council for Board Diversity, while 89% of SGX-listed issuers have disclosed a board diversity policy with &ldquo;objectives, targets, plans, timelines, and progress&rdquo;, the level of detail in disclosures varied significantly. Clearly room for disclosures to improve exists, and we will be looking to the people in this room to help us achieve this. While the buck stops with the board, your role as the chief governance officer should be to advise your boards on developing and disclosing a clear and comprehensive board diversity policy that reflects the circumstances and requirements of your companies and stakeholders. What this requires is some level of education and upskilling on your part. To this end, SGX RegCo has tried as much as possible to aid by providing best practice examples in many of our reviews of listed company disclosures, and where necessary, one-on-one engagements with listed companies that have fallen far short of the average.</p>
<p>19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These case studies and engagements can, I think, serve as springboards for deeper conversations with your boards on how to improve. Conversely, we are open to your feedback on how we can help you do your job better. So, let&rsquo;s have a two-way conversation so we can all lift corporate governance standards to a higher level.</p>
<p>20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, and relatedly, how can company secretaries cope with disruption and their increasingly multidisciplinary role? In recent years, company secretaries have had to deal with changes coming from all sides. The expectations are no longer just about compliance, and other traditional matters. Issues such as sustainability, the environment, climate change, diversity, digitalisation, and cybersecurity have come into the spotlight. The recent release of the International Sustainability Standards Board&rsquo;s disclosure standards is one case in point, with assurance standards for sustainability reporting also targeted to be finalised by end-2024. All these have implications for how companies organise and govern themselves and serve their stakeholders.</p>
<p>21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How can company secretaries work with their boards in navigating these changes? Here I have three suggestions. First, maintain an active curiosity about the state of the world, keep yourself informed on current affairs, think deeply about the drivers of change, and try to anticipate future trends and expectations. Second, develop a good support network of sources of helpful advice and input. This can include colleagues within your teams and companies, as well as the use of tools including information aggregators. But just as important is maintaining links and networks with others who are in the same situation as you. Here I would like to congratulate Raymond and the rest of the CSIS team, for organising today&rsquo;s forum, and providing us with an opportunity to engage in dialogue and mutual learning. I encourage CSIS to keep up your efforts in this regard. CSIS is a professional body that has a valuable role to play in equipping company secretaries with the skills and knowledge required in a fast-changing corporate landscape. Third, be bold. Provide advice when you see risks and opportunities, where you observe instances where the letter of the rules is being observed, but not their spirit.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me conclude. Company secretaries today have a much more expanded role than in the past. And there is no going back. I urge you then to embrace the disruption and the multidisciplinary role that you face, leverage on your existing skills and knowledge, and upskill yourselves and your networks, to add value to your companies and your stakeholders. While it is correct that company secretaries play an important administrative role, company secretaries can be much more than this. At a time of rapid change, company secretaries should seize the opportunity to become knowledgeable about matters such as sustainability, the environment, digitalisation, and diversity to become even more indispensable advisors to their companies.</p>
<p>23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, it is also important to highlight the importance of the board and other members of senior management in supporting the role of the company secretary as chief governance officer. Tone and culture at the top are important to create the right environment for company secretaries to perform their role fully.</p>
<p>24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for your time and attention, and I wish you all the best for the rest of your discussions today.</p>

<title>ASIC’s 2024 Enforcement Priorities In The Superannuation Sector - Keynote Address By ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court At The Connexus Super Chair Forum, 1 February 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>KEY POINTS</h2>
<ul>
<li>ASIC&rsquo;s enforcement priorities in the superannuation sector in the coming year run along three key themes: member services failures; misleading conduct, including greenwashing; and failures to protect superannuation balances.</li>
<li>These reflect areas of genuine harm ASIC is seeing through intelligence and surveillance and should serve as fair warning to the sector as to where it needs to lift performance.</li>
<li>Superannuation fund board chairs are in a powerful position to impact outcomes for members and ASIC is calling on them to be proactive in placing members at the heart of day-to-day operations or face possible regulatory attention.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good morning to you all.</p>
<p>Thank you for the invitation to be here today. This is an important audience for ASIC to engage with about our enforcement priorities in the superannuation sector for the year ahead.</p>
<p>Before I turn to those priorities, I should acknowledge that this month marks the five- year anniversary of the handing down of the Financial Services Royal Commission report. That was, of course, a seminal time for those involved in the financial services sector, for both the regulated and regulators alike.</p>
<p>ASIC is a very different regulator now than we were a decade ago. ASIC&rsquo;s remit has substantially increased since that time &ndash; we have new laws and new powers, and we are determined to use them to ensure that we do not see a repeat of the misconduct that emerged in the course of the Royal Commission.</p>
<p>Many of those new laws and powers are relevant, of course, to our conduct role in the superannuation sector. We see our role in the sector in broad terms being to drive trustees to improve member outcomes and hold trustees to account where there is misconduct or poor governance.</p>
<p>We have been, and will continue to be, an active conduct regulator in the superannuation sector.</p>
<p>Last year alone we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Undertook 219 surveillances of superannuation entities (2023 CY);</li>
<li>Took legal action in the courts against four superannuation trustees, being Mercer, Active Super, TelstraSuper and AustralianSuper (2023 CY); and</li>
<li>The courts imposed $29 million in penalties in relation to misconduct in the superannuation sector (2023 CY).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the coming year, we intend to build on this strong record.</p>
<h2>2024 enforcement priorities</h2>
<p>We publicly announced our enforcement priorities late last year. We do this for a number of reasons: it provides transparency to our regulated community, it holds us to account for delivering against those priorities, and we have found that the announcement by ASIC of areas of interest to us tends to have an immediate compliance effect.</p>
<p>Our enforcement priorities in the superannuation sector in the coming year run along three key themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Member services failures;</li>
<li>Misleading conduct, including greenwashing; and</li>
<li>Failures to protect superannuation balances.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The people in this room, as stewards of Australia&rsquo;s $2.5 trillion superannuation pool, are in a powerful position to impact outcomes for members.</p>
<p>These themes could be regarded as a call to action &ndash; they reflect areas of genuine harm we are still seeing through intelligence and surveillance and should serve as fair warning to the sector as to where it needs to lift performance.</p>
<h3>Member service failures</h3>
<p>First to member service failures.</p>
<p>Australians have a right to expect to be dealt with efficiently, honestly and fairly by their superannuation fund.</p>
<p>ASIC expects trustees to communicate proactively with members, deal responsibly with members&rsquo; money, and deliver good value for money. This is regardless of the phase of membership of the member.</p>
<p>From early accumulation through to retirement and draw-down phase, services and member needs may change across the &lsquo;life&rsquo; of the membership, but these core expectations remain. They must be met consistently, which requires operational soundness.</p>
<p>Through our surveillance and enforcement work over recent years it has become increasingly clear that in many cases member services provided by superannuation funds are falling short of these expectations. In particular, we have observed that services are too often slow, unresponsive, and not member focused.</p>
<h4>TelstraSuper</h4>
<p>In an example of our concerns in this regard, in November of last year we commenced civil penalty proceedings against TelstraSuper for alleged failures to comply with the internal dispute resolution requirements that came into effect in October 2021.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/asic-s-2024-enforcement-priorities-in-the-superannuation-sector/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>[1]</span></a>&nbsp;These are the first proceedings we have commenced under this regime.</p>
<p>We allege TelstraSuper failed to respond adequately to two in five complaints within the relevant time period, and failed to operate efficiently, honestly and fairly.</p>
<p>One year before we took this matter to court, we warned superannuation trustees to improve their internal dispute resolution systems, after a review that uncovered sub-standard complaints handling arrangements across the industry.</p>
<p>That we now have a specific enforcement priority for member service failures should serve as a further warning to trustees to improve efforts in this area.</p>
<h4>Death benefit claims handling</h4>
<p>When individuals have bad experiences with a fund, their confidence in the superannuation system is likely to be undermined.</p>
<p>Nowhere is this more evident than in relation to death benefit claims handling.</p>
<p>We are aware of a significant increase in complaints to the Australian Financial Complaints Authority about extreme processing delays for death benefit claims, among other issues, leading to additional distress for members&rsquo; families.</p>
<p>We are undertaking an industry review focused on improving the delivery of superannuation fund member services, looking initially at trustee compliance with obligations related to the handling of death benefit claims.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I will not comment specifically on investigations underway, we are actively considering these issues and whether they amount to an industry-wide problem.</p>
<p>I note some commentary from funds attributing these delays to administrative outsourcing. But this is not an answer to the issue. It is the trustee that has the legal responsibility to ensure it can meet the legal obligations owed to members, irrespective of the administrative arrangements the fund chooses to adopt. The legal obligations on trustees cannot be outsourced. I will return to this theme when I talk about greenwashing.</p>
<h3>Greenwashing</h3>
<p>There has been much written and reported in recent times about the phenomenon of greenwashing, and ASIC has been very active in this area in recent times.</p>
<p>It is important to recognise that greenwashing, of course, is not new. Despite the significant current interest in the issue, what is now referred to as 'greenwashing' is of course just misleading and deceptive conduct by another name.</p>
<p>All the actions ASIC has taken to date in this area fall within that general descriptor &ndash; that is, all are allegations about firms engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct. This is not to say that our future greenwashing work will be confined to misleading and deceptive cases. It may be that licence obligations, directors&rsquo; and officers&rsquo; duties and a range of other obligations can be applied here. Again, all existing laws which people are familiar with.</p>
<p>There is of course new law on the horizon, which will entail significant additional and new compliance obligations. But our current focus is on existing laws, which should be familiar to everyone, and ensuring that we maximise their availability to protect potential investors and ensure that investors are getting what they bargained for.</p>
<p>Greenwashing remains a key focus for ASIC in 2024.</p>
<p>With proceedings underway against Mercer Super and Active Super, trustees will be aware that we will use every lever legislation affords us to eliminate this practice, and we will continue to monitor the superannuation sector for misleading greenwashing claims.</p>
<p>Going forward our focus will be on net zero statements and targets made without merit; the use of terms like &lsquo;carbon neutral&rsquo;, &lsquo;clean&rsquo; or &lsquo;green&rsquo; that are not founded on reasonable grounds; and the use of inaccurate labelling or vague terms in sustainability-related funds.</p>
<p>We expect boards to engage directly on sustainability claims &ndash; whether they are aspirational statements, targets, active stewardship commitments or investment descriptions.</p>
<p>If trustees are making environmental, social or ethical claims to attract potential members, those claims need to be backed with evidence and transparent about their basis.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Failure to protect superannuation balances</h3>
<p>Finally, to failures by trustees to protect members&rsquo; superannuation balances.</p>
<p>We know that with the increased cost of living, Australians are more worried than ever about having enough money in retirement.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/asic-s-2024-enforcement-priorities-in-the-superannuation-sector/#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span>[2]</span></a></p>
<p>Members should be able to have confidence that their superannuation savings are not being eroded by unnecessary or inappropriate fees and charges, and that the products in which they are investing are designed to maximise retirement outcomes and sufficiently balance risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, some of our recent enforcement actions demonstrate the sector is falling short in this regard.</p>
<h4>AustralianSuper</h4>
<p>Last year we commenced civil penalty proceedings against the trustee of Australia&rsquo;s largest superannuation fund, AustralianSuper, alleging failures to address multiple member accounts.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/asic-s-2024-enforcement-priorities-in-the-superannuation-sector/#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><span>[3]</span></a></p>
<p>We allege around 90,000 AustralianSuper members were affected, costing members approximately $69 million in multiple sets of fees and insurance premiums and lost investment earnings on those amounts.</p>
<p>This was the first case we have brought alleging contraventions of section 52 of the&nbsp;<em>Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993</em>&nbsp;relating to the conduct of trustee&rsquo;s duties.</p>
<p>Unintended multiple accounts remain a significant issue for Australian consumers despite reforms designed to reduce their frequency.</p>
<p>It is in the interest of all superannuation funds to proactively identify and consolidate multiple accounts within the fund, where it is in the members&rsquo; interest to help their members avoid extra fees&nbsp;and to ensure their funds avoid costly remediation.</p>
<h4>OnePath</h4>
<p>We also secured a $5 million penalty against superannuation trustee OnePath for deducting fees from members of Integra Super for advice services they did not receive and misleading consumers.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/asic-s-2024-enforcement-priorities-in-the-superannuation-sector/#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><span>[4]</span></a></p>
<p>The court found that between December 2015 and November 2021, OnePath deducted $3.8 million in fees from members for advice services they did not receive.</p>
<p>OnePath told members they had to pay a fee for advice from a &lsquo;plan adviser&rsquo; even after the member had been transferred to a division of Integra Super, where they were not entitled to receive advice services.</p>
<h4>The role of the trustee</h4>
<p>What these cases demonstrate is the important role of the trustee in safeguarding members&rsquo; super balances by eliminating poor practices.</p>
<p>Boards that are engaged in their businesses and exercise appropriate oversight are well positioned to identify, address and remediate harms to members before they come to the attention of ASIC. This requires asking tough questions, and prioritising members in decision-making.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Following the Royal Commission, we sought &ndash; and received from Parliament &ndash; significantly higher financial penalties to provide the strongest possible deterrent to financial services misconduct.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Misconduct post-dating March 2019 now attracts maximum penalties more than tenfold those that existed before &ndash; and we are committed to pursuing these penalties through the courts, so the cost of breaking the law well exceeds the cost of doing business.</p>
<p>We have also indicated publicly that we will take on cases where the outcome is not guaranteed, and we will test the bounds of the law where it is uncertain or open to interpretation.</p>
<p>Given these commitments, the themes I have outlined today should provide clear guidance as to where you might focus your attention this year to avoid attracting ours.</p>
<p>Thank you for your attention today. I look forward to the Q&amp;A discussion.</p>

<p><em>* Adjusted EBITDA, NPAT and EPS exclude certain non-cash and non-recurring items that have less bearing on SGX&rsquo;s operating performance.

<p><em>The presentation of revenue in our 1H FY2024 income statement has been revised to the following four operating segments &ndash; Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities; Equities &ndash; Cash; Equities &ndash; Derivatives; and Platform and Others</em><a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn1"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a><em>. 1H FY2023 revenue has been reclassified to the four operating segments for a like-for-like comparison against 1H FY2024.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Singapore Exchange (SGX Group) today reported 1H FY2024 adjusted net profit of S$251.4 million (S$236.8 million). Adjusted EBITDA rose to S$344.6 million (S$334.1 million), while adjusted earnings per share increased to 23.5 cents (22.2 cents).</p>
<p>Revenue increased 3.6% to S$592.2 million (S$571.4 million), mainly driven by higher revenues from Currencies and Commodities<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn2"><sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup></a>&nbsp;and Platform and Others, partially offset by lower Equities &ndash; Cash<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;and Equities &ndash; Derivatives<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;revenue.</p>
<p>The Board of Directors has declared an interim quarterly dividend of 8.5 cents (8.0 cents) per share, payable on 20 February 2024. This brings total dividends in 1H FY2024 to 17.0 cents (16.0 cents) per share.</p>
<p>Loh Boon Chye, Chief Executive Officer of SGX Group, said, &ldquo;Our multi-asset offering continued to serve our customers well in a persistently challenging macro environment. Our currency and commodity derivatives business has been a growing contributor to revenue, and our OTC FX franchise is making good progress with average daily volume consistently reaching US$100 billion in recent months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The year ahead could see muted global economic growth and geopolitical concerns that may affect market sentiment and risk appetite. Nonetheless, the resilience of our multi-asset strategy as well as healthy financial position and discipline will enable us to capitalise on conditions across cycles. To drive growth, we will focus on expanding our solutions to capture opportunities in Asia, grow our emerging products and further strengthen our global distribution and network,&rdquo; added Mr. Loh.</p>
<p>Results Summary</p>
<p>Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC)</p>
<p>FICC revenue increased 28.1% to S$151.9 million (S$118.5 million) and accounted for 25.6% (20.7%) of total revenue<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn3"><sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup></a>.</p>
<p>FICC &ndash; Fixed Income</p>
<p>Fixed Income revenue decreased 8.4% to S$3.9 million (S$4.3 million).</p>
<ul>
<li>Listing revenue: S$2.5 million, down 1.4% from S$2.6 million</li>
<li>Corporate actions and other revenue: S$1.4 million, down 19.1% from S$1.7 million</li>
</ul>
<p>There were 489 bond listings raising S$131.7 billion, compared with 449 bond listings raising S$104.3 billion a year earlier.</p>
<p>FICC &ndash; Currencies and Commodities</p>
<p>Currencies and Commodities revenue increased 29.5% to S$148.0 million (S$114.3 million). OTC FX revenue was S$40.9 million (S$36.2 million) and accounted for 27.7% (31.7%) of Currencies and Commodities revenue.</p>
<ul>
<li>Trading and clearing revenue: S$111.3 million, up 25.3% from S$88.8 million</li>
<li>Treasury and other revenue: S$36.7 million, up 44.3% from S$25.4 million</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trading and clearing revenue grew by S$22.4 million, mainly from increased volumes in commodity derivatives and OTC FX transactions.</p>
<p>Commodity derivatives volumes increased 48.3% to 28.7 million contracts (19.4 million contracts), primarily due to higher volumes in iron ore derivatives.</p>
<p>Currency derivatives volumes increased 23.8% to 23.0 million contracts (18.6 million contracts) mainly from higher volumes in our USD/CNH FX futures.</p>
<p>OTC FX average daily volume (ADV) increased 46.4% to US$100.1 billion (US$68.4 billion).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Treasury and other revenue increased mainly due to higher average yields on margin deposits, partially offset by a decrease in margin balances.</p>
<p>Equities &ndash; Cash</p>
<p>Equities &ndash; Cash revenue declined by 5.6% to S$159.6 million (S$169.1 million) and accounted for 26.9% (29.6%) of total revenue.</p>
<ul>
<li>Listing revenue: S$14.6 million, down 3.3% from S$15.1 million</li>
<li>Trading and clearing revenue: S$77.2 million, down 13.9% from S$89.6 million</li>
<li>Securities settlement, depository management, corporate actions and other revenue: S$67.9 million, up 5.3% from S$64.5 million</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recorded 4 (4) new equity listings, which raised S$19.0 million (S$9.7 million). Secondary equity funds raised were S$0.6 billion (S$2.4 billion).</p>
<p>Daily average traded value (DAV) and total traded value declined 11.5% and 12.2% to S$1.0 billion (S$1.1 billion) and S$121.2 billion (S$138.1 billion) respectively. This was made up of Cash Equities<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn4"><sup><sup>[4]</sup></sup></a>, where total traded value decreased by 11.9% to S$116.0 billion (S$131.6 billion), and Other Products<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn5"><sup><sup>[5]</sup></sup></a>, where traded value decreased 19.5% to S$5.2 billion (S$6.5 billion). There were 126 (127) trading days in the first half of FY2024.</p>
<p>Overall average clearing fees decreased 2.1% to 2.47 basis points (2.53 basis points). Average clearing fees for Cash Equities decreased 2.3% to 2.55 basis points (2.61 basis points) due to a higher proportion of market maker participation. Average clearing fee for Other Products decreased 3.6% to 0.79 basis points (0.82 basis points) due to a higher proportion of lower yielding daily leverage certificates in 1H FY24. Overall turnover velocity for the first half of FY2024 was 34% (37%).</p>
<p>The increase in securities settlement, depository management, corporate action and other revenue was mainly due to higher interest income from handling of corporate actions, partially offset by lower number of settlement instructions.</p>
<p>Equities &ndash; Derivatives</p>
<p>Equities &ndash; Derivatives revenue declined 6.9% to S$160.7 million (S$172.6 million) and accounted for 27.1% (30.2%) of total revenue.</p>
<ul>
<li>Trading and clearing revenue: S$123.2 million, down 15.3% from S$145.4 million</li>
<li>Treasury and other revenue: S$37.5 million, up 37.7% from S$27.2 million</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The decline in trading and clearing revenue was due to a 14.0% decline in total equity derivatives volumes, mainly from declines in volumes of GIFT Nifty and FTSE China A50 index futures contracts. Excluding Nifty, trading and clearing revenue decreased 5.1%.</p>
<p>Treasury and other revenue increased mainly due to higher average yields on margin deposits, partially offset by a decrease in margin balances.</p>
<p>Average fee per contract for Equity, Currency and Commodity derivatives was lower at S$1.54 (S$1.58) mainly driven by a decline in the average fee of Nifty 50 index futures, due to reclass of NSE fee arrangement from expense to revenue as part of GIFT Connect. On a pro forma basis<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn6"><sup><sup>[6]</sup></sup></a>, 1H FY2024 average fee per contract remained comparable at S$1.54 (S$1.53) from a year ago.</p>
<p>Platform and Others</p>
<p>Platform and Others revenue increased 8.0% to S$120.1 million (S$111.2 million) and accounted for 20.3% (19.5%) of total revenue.</p>
<ul>
<li>Market data revenue: S$24.2 million, up 9.9% from S$22.0 million</li>
<li>Connectivity revenue: S$38.5 million, up 8.7% from S$35.4 million</li>
<li>Indices and other revenue<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn7"><sup><sup>[7]</sup></sup></a>: S$57.4 million, up 6.8% from S$53.8 million</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The increase in Market data revenue was driven by higher revenue realised from Securities and Derivatives Market Direct Feed subscribers, as well as growth in distribution of Commodities data.</p>
<p>The increase in Connectivity revenue was mainly due to higher revenue from co-location subscribers.</p>
<p>Indices and other revenue increased mainly from higher revenue contribution from EMC and Indices.</p>
<p>Expenses Overview</p>
<p>Total expenses increased 3.0% to S$296.1 million (S$287.4 million), mainly from higher staff costs and technology costs, offset by lower royalties and professional fees.</p>
<p>Adjusted total expenses increased 3.5% to S$289.7 million (S$279.9 million), which excludes amortisation of purchased intangible assets.</p>
<p>Total capital expenditure was S$18.5 million (S$17.8 million). These investments include upgrades to our Titan OTC trade reporting system, modernisation of our technology infrastructure and consolidation of our office spaces.</p>
<p>We are cautious on the near-term outlook as prospects for global growth appear muted. Rising geopolitical tensions and divergence in economic performance are likely to add to the headwinds and uncertainties that we are facing. As such, we will remain prudent in managing our expenses and capital expenditure.</p>
<p>Expense growth in FY2024 is likely to be similar to the 3% year-on-year expense growth rate observed in the first half of FY2024, lower than the previously guided mid-single digit percentage range. Our projected capital expenditure for FY2024 is anticipated to be within S$70-75 million, lower than our previously guided S$75-80 million range.</p>

<title>ASIC’s Guidance For Market Intermediaries On Pre-Hedging</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asics-guidance-for-market-intermediaries-on-pre-hedging/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asics-guidance-for-market-intermediaries-on-pre-hedging/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>KEY POINTS</h2>
<ul>
<li>ASIC has published a letter to market intermediary CEOs setting out its guidance regarding pre-hedging practices in Australia.</li>
<li>ASIC is concerned with how differences in market intermediaries&rsquo; approach to pre-hedging can disrupt fair competition and the effective functioning of markets.</li>
<li>Market intermediaries should always carefully consider their obligations under Australian law and applicable international codes and standards when undertaking pre-hedging.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Pre-hedging practices in Australia</h2>
<p>Pre-hedging is a practice that occurs in financial markets and can help the effective functioning of markets by facilitating trades that could otherwise significantly impact market pricing.</p>
<p>ASIC acknowledges that pre-hedging has a role in markets, including in the management of market intermediaries&rsquo; risk associated with anticipated client orders and may assist in liquidity provision and execution for clients. However, it can also create significant conflicts of interest between a client and the market intermediary which actively trades in possession of confidential information about the client&rsquo;s anticipated order or trade.</p>
<p>Market intermediaries need to manage confidential client information very carefully and have robust, closely monitored and frequently tested arrangements for ensuring conflicts of interest are appropriately managed and in compliance with the&nbsp;<em>Corporations Act 2001.</em></p>
<p>ASIC has also observed a wide range of pre-hedging practices in the Australian market, with some falling significantly short of its expectations. Differences in pre-hedging practices can disrupt fair competition and the effective functioning of markets.</p>
<p>Raising and harmonising minimum standards of conduct is a key focus of ASIC and an increasing focus among international regulators and standard setters, including the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the Financial Markets Standards Board (FMSB), and the FX Global Code.</p>
<p>If pre-hedging is not carried out in an appropriate manner it can be unfair, unconscionable and result in poor client outcomes. This may adversely impact investor confidence and undermine market integrity.</p>
<p>ASIC encourages market intermediaries to carefully consider the guidance set out in the letter below.</p>

<div> expanding pace, job gains, low unemployment, inflation, monetary policy  
Summary: Recent indicators show solid economic expansion with moderated job gains and low unemployment. Inflation remains elevated, and the Committee maintains the federal funds rate target range at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent. They aim for maximum employment and 2 percent inflation, closely monitoring incoming data for adjustments in the monetary policy stance. Voting members include Chair Jerome H. Powell. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace. Job gains have moderated since early last year but remain strong, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation has eased over the past year but remains elevated.</p>
<p>The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee remains highly attentive to inflation risks.</p>
<p>In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in its previously announced plans. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.</p>
<p>In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.</p>
<p>Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Thomas I. Barkin; Michael S. Barr; Raphael W. Bostic; Michelle W. Bowman; Lisa D. Cook; Mary C. Daly; Philip N. Jefferson; Adriana D. Kugler; Loretta J. Mester; and Christopher J. Waller.</p>

<div> updates, Federal Open Market Committee, investment, trading, policy
The Federal Open Market Committee has announced updates to its investment and trading policy to ensure impartiality and integrity. The updates include stricter restrictions on staff investment and trading activities, increased coverage of staff, and a new compliance regime for those with access to sensitive information. These changes will take effect on June 30, 2024.

Summary:<br />The Federal Open Market Committee has updated its policy on investment and trading to enhance impartiality and integrity. The updates include stricter restrictions on staff, increased coverage, and a new compliance regime for those with access to sensitive information. These changes will be effective on June 30, 2024. <div>

<div id="article">
<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-8">
<p>The Federal Open Market Committee on Wednesday announced updates that further enhance its policy on investment and trading. The policy, which was first adopted in 2022, aims to support public confidence in the impartiality and integrity of the Committee's work by guarding against even the appearance of any conflict of interest.</p>
<p>The updates will increase the number of Federal Reserve System staff who will be covered by the most stringent restrictions on investment and trading activities and will tighten restrictions on all staff with access to confidential FOMC information. Additionally, the updated policy supports a new compliance regime where staff with access to the most sensitive FOMC information may be directed to submit brokerage statements or other securities transaction statements to verify the accuracy of their financial disclosures.</p>
<p>The existing policy already prohibits senior Federal Reserve officials involved in monetary policy decision-making from purchasing individual stocks or sector funds; holding investments in individual bonds, agency securities, cryptocurrencies, commodities, or foreign currencies; entering into derivatives contracts; and engaging in short sales or purchasing securities on margin. The policy also requires those officials to provide 45-days' non-retractable notice for securities transactions and receive prior approval.</p>
<p>The new restrictions in the policy are effective on June 30, 2024.</p>

<title>Moa Langemark Is Finansinspektionen’s New Consumer Protection Economist</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>A clear and independent voice is needed to help consumers on the financial market. Moa Langemark will now take on the role of consumer protection economist at Finansinspektionen. She will undertake overall responsibility for supporting and developing our consumer protection work. Together with Director General Daniel Barr, Moa will also be FI&rsquo;s spokesperson in consumer protection-related matters.</span></p>
<div class="editor-content">
<p>Every day many people in Sweden must make major &ndash; and often difficult &ndash; financial decisions, for example saving for their pension or borrowing money to buy a home. At the same time, it can be difficult to understand how the financial market works or know where to turn for information. Consumers receive a deluge of financial tips and advice, often from financial companies.</p>
<p>"Consumer protection is a focus area at FI. It is related to both how we conduct our supervision of financial firms and the communication that directly targets consumers. As our new consumer protection economist, Moa Langemark will be able to contribute independent guidance that is not linked to commercial interests," says Finansinspektionen's Director General Daniel Barr.</p>
<p>Moa Langemark has extensive experience in consumer protection, most recently as a senior advisor on consumer protection at FI and from previous positions at the Department of Finance and as a savings analyst at Avanza Bank.</p>
<p>"We know that many consumers find their personal finances a bit complicated and boring. I want more people to understand how they can gain control over their wallets, often by following a few simple steps. With FI's expert knowledge behind me, I hope to be able to help more consumers find the right products and avoid traps in the financial market," says Moa Langemark, consumer protection economist at FI.</p>

<p>The Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (<abbr lang="de" title="Bundesanstalt f&uuml;r Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht" xml:lang="de">BaFin</abbr>) is currently investigating the unknown operator of the website heptagoninvestments.com. The operator uses this website to offer financial and investment services without the required authorisation. The website is not operated by the British firm Heptagon Capital LLP. This is a case of identity theft targeting the aforementioned firm, which is registered with the British Financial Conduct Authority (<abbr title="Financial Conduct Authority">FCA</abbr>).</p>
</div>
<div class="wrapBodytext">
<p>The&nbsp;<abbr title="Financial Conduct Authority">FCA</abbr>&nbsp;has issued a warning on its website stating that a fraudulent &ldquo;clone firm&rdquo; is operating under the name Heptagon Capital LLP.

<title>MNI Indicators: Chicago Business Barometer™ - January 2024 Chicago Report™ Tempered to 46.0</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li>The Chicago Business Barometer&trade;, produced  with MNI, tempered by -1.2 points to 46.0 from  December&rsquo;s revised figure of 47.2. This is the  second consecutive monthly fall, keeping the  Chicago ReportTM in contractionary territory,  although still +0.6 points above the 2023 average  and above the levels seen in both September 2023  and October 2023.&nbsp;</li>
<li>All of the subcomponents included in the  headline index rose compared to December&rsquo;s revised levels, apart from Production which  plunged -9.9 points into contractionary territory.</li>
<li>&nbsp;Production fell -9.9 points to 48.7 points,  reentering contraction, and is the lowest since  October 2023. This was driven by a larger  proportion of respondents reporting lower  production, but this may have been at least partly  due to the severe weather.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Order Backlogs grew +2.8 points. With the  exception of November 2023, this is the highest  since April 2023.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Supplier Deliveries inched up +1.0 points. Again,  with the exception of November 2023 this was the  highest since April 2023 and the third consecutive  month in expansionary territory</li>
<li>New Orders saw a small increase of +1.4 points,  remaining in contractionary territory but above the  2023 average of 44.1.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Employment crept up +0.5 points to 46.7 points.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Inventories (which are not included in the  calculation for the headline index) declined -3.1  points, the lowest since July 2023, with the highest  proportion of respondents reporting lower  inventories since October 2009.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Prices paid slipped for the first time since  September 2023 by -4.1 points to 63.9 points.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The survey ran from January 2 to January 17.</li>

<title>ACER Calls For Improvements To The New Gas Transmission Tariffs Proposed For Poland</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/acer-calls-for-improvements-to-the-new-gas-transmission-tariffs-proposed-for-pol/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ACER publishes today its report on the tariff consultation for the Polish transmission network. The report provides recommendations to URE, the Polish National Regulatory Authority (NRA), on the proposed tariff methodology which will be used to set the tariffs for 2025 and 2026. The proposed methodology is based on the results of a consultation carried out by the Polish Transmission System Operator (TSO), which concluded on 19 January 2024.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What does ACER recommend?</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Justify the proposed discount</strong>: the TSO proposed 100% discount at the entry point of the LNG terminal to increase the security of supply of the Polish network. ACER recommends that URE provides further justification on how the discount is set and how it supports this goal.</li>
<li><strong>Set a fixed entry-exit split</strong>: despite the network code on harmonised transmission tariff structures (<a href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtSUgVTV1BUVkwPAlcGHVZYDQ4dUFsAXhpWAAoCVlJRAgcJUgYdVQFaUl0EV1sdUg1UUh0GDAJSGg1RA1QZBQBTAlIHA1gHXFQERQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" target="_blank">NC TAR</a>) prescribing a fixed entry-exit split, the TSO proposes a variable split. ACER recommends setting a fixed entry-exit split to improve the predictability of network tariffs (e.g. network users could better forecast network tariffs).</li>
<li><strong>Provide forecasts</strong>: ACER recommends that the NRA explains the indicative evolution of tariffs in 2025 and 2026. This information will be useful for network users to understand the proposed methodology and its impact over time.</li>
<li><strong>Reconciliation of non-transmission services</strong>: ACER recommends reconciling potential under- or over-recoveries for both transmission and non-transmission services, separately. Doing so will enhance the accuracy of cost reflectivity of tariff.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the next steps?</span></p>
<p>By 18 July 2024, URE should adopt a motivated decision on the tariff methodology to be applied to the Polish transmission network. This decision shall also take ACER&rsquo;s recommendations into account.</p>
<p><a href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtVUA9SA1kGB0wKBgFTHVYBBFQdUF0IUBpWUFFSAVINBwVQBwIdVQFaUl0EV1sdUg1UUh0GDAJSGg1RA1QZBQBTAlIHA1gHXFQERQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" target="_blank">Access the report</a>.</p>

<div> EGX, Egyptian Exchange, stock market, indices, review
Summary:
EGX conducted its semi-annual review of the stock market indices for July to December 2023. EGX30, EGX30 Capped, and EGX30 TR saw changes in 3 companies. EGX70 EWI excluded 17 companies, with 3 joining EGX30 and another 17 joining. EGX100 EWI saw 14 companies excluded and 14 others included. Bond indices also saw changes. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The Egyptian Exchange (EGX) completed the semi-annual review of the Egyptian stock market indices, for the period from July to December 2023.</p>
<p>EGX30, EGX30 Capped, and EGX30 TR witnessed a change of 3 companies, while EGX70 EWI witnessed the exclusion of 17 companies, 3 of which joined EGX30, and another 17 joined. EGX100 EWI witnessed the exclusion of 14 companies and the inclusion of 14 others.</p>
<p>The Egyptian Exchange (EGX) conducts review twice a year on the stock indices, the first ends in January, and is scheduled to be effective on 1<sup>st</sup> February, and the second review ends by the end of July and is scheduled to be effective on 1<sup>st</sup> August.</p>
<p>The review monitors the changes in companies' different criteria and measures according to the methodologies of each index.</p>
<p>The Egyptian Exchange has developed its main indices&rsquo; methodologies to enhance the importance of liquidity and activity rates of the constituents included in the index:</p>
<p>For The Main Index (EGX30): its methodology has been developed by modifying the criteria of trading days required to join the index. Currently, the company's shares have to be traded in 95% of the trading days during the review period, instead of 65%.</p>
<p>In addition, the methodology of the EGX70 EWI index has been developed by modifying the Index's criteria of trading days required to join the index. Currently, the company's shares have to be traded in 90% of the trading days during the review period, instead of 65%.</p>
<p>Also, two additional liquidity criteria have been added, The first criterion stipulates that the average daily number of trading investors shall not be less than 0.1% of the daily average number of trading investors in the total market during the review period.</p>
<p>The second criterion stipulates that the turnover rate of free-float shares shall not be less than 10% over the last six months, or that the average daily traded value shall not be less than 0.0005 of the daily average traded value of main market.</p>
<p>During the review period, the treasury bonds index witnessed a number of changes, as 21 issues were removed from the index compared to the inclusion of 2 issues of treasury bonds, thus bringing the total number of bonds constituting the index to 19 issues. It is worth noting that the Egyptian Exchange conducts a monthly review of Treasury bond indices, according to the criteria of inclusion and exclusion in the indices methodology.</p>
<p>The ongoing development of the methodology of the different market indices comes in line with international best practices, and after consultation with the different capital market parties and representatives in the Indices committee in the Egyptian Exchange, and in the framework of the financial community dialogue held during the discussion of &ldquo;the strategy of the Egyptian Exchange's Board of Directors for Development&rdquo; in accordance with clause 36 thereof.</p>

<div> Keywords: financial markets, risk drivers, interest rates, sustainable finance, market monitoring

Summary:
- ESMA identifies key risk drivers in financial markets, including geopolitical and macro-financial uncertainty.
- Retail investors need to be cautious of false information on social media.
- Increased interest rates will impact financial stability and investors.
- Sustainable finance has seen slowed growth in ESG markets.
- Market monitoring shows increased volatility, credit risk, and cyber incidents in the financial sector.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify">The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, today publishes its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-01/ESMA50-524821-3107_TRV_1-24_risk_monitor.pdf">first risk monitoring report of 2024</a>, where it sets out the key risk drivers currently facing financial markets.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify">Verena Ross, ESMA&rsquo;s Chair, said:&nbsp;</p>
<h6 class="text-align-justify"><em>&ldquo;At ESMA we are observing a financial system that has shown a high level of resilience. Looking ahead, markets are set to remain very sensitive and risks of market corrections continue to be high, given geopolitical and macro-financial&nbsp;uncertainty. In this context, maintaining trust in financial markets is of particular concern to ESMA, and key to achieving our mission to protect investors.&nbsp;</em></h6>
<h6 class="text-align-justify"><em>Retail investors increasingly get their updates through social media, and we again stress the need to be aware of the risk of receiving false or misleading information through these media. All investors should verify the reliability and the quality of the information they use in their investment decisions.</em></h6>
<h6 class="text-align-justify"><em>Financial stability and investors will be impacted by increased interest rates which are expected to remain higher for longer. This environment has a negative impact on credit quality and real estate valuations. Finally, greenwashing entails the risk of limiting the role finance can play in the transition to a more sustainable future.&rdquo;</em></h6>
<p class="text-align-justify">Beyond the risk drivers, ESMA&rsquo;s report provides an update on structural developments and the status of key sectors of financial markets, during the second half of 2023.</p>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Structural developments</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>Market-based finance:&nbsp;</span>Access to capital markets for European corporates continued to be mainly through fixed income markets and securitised products in 2H23. Equity primary markets slightly picked up, but IPO activity was strained due to uncertain market conditions. Corporate bond issuance remained strong during 2H23. The corporate bond outlook will be shaped by a significant upcoming maturity wall from 2024 until 2028, with corporate debt sustainability remaining a considerable risk, especially in lower quality segments.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>Sustainable finance:</span>&nbsp;Following several years of uninterrupted growth, the take up of ESG investing and growth of ESG markets have levelled off in recent quarters. The ESG bond market grew at a slower pace, while gross issuance volumes declined. SFDR Article 9 funds with a sustainable investment objective faced net outflows for the first time in 4Q23, and outflows from SFDR Article 8 funds promoting environmental or social characteristics accelerated, with the use of ESG-related terms in fund names a key factor of differentiation between these funds.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>Financial innovation:</span>&nbsp;Crypto-asset valuations rebounded in 2023, fuelled by the hope that spot crypto ETFs would obtain approval by the US SEC, which they did in January 2024. Still, at EUR&nbsp;1.5tn, total market capitalisation of crypto assets remains half of the 2021 historical peak. The use of artificial intelligence in finance is growing around a wide range of applications, even though dedicated AI-investment instruments remain limited.</p>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Market monitoring</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>Securities markets:</span>&nbsp;Equity valuations were moderately up in 2H23 driven by an end-of-year rally linked to expectations of 2024 interest rate decreases. Volatility remained contained, while bid-ask spreads increased, highlighting market nervousness. Fixed-income markets were lower overall towards the end of 2023, with marked declines in yields for sovereign and corporate bonds in December. Credit quality of high-yield non-financials continued to decline, particularly associated with real estate, with default rates trending upwards.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><a><span>Asset management:</span>&nbsp;</a>EU fund performance and flows were volatile in 2H23. Investors preferred fixed income funds over equity funds, and MMFs specifically attracted significant inflows on higher interest rates and the inversion of the yield curve. Overall, risks stabilised but remained elevated, especially liquidity and credit risk. While funds managed the transition to higher interest rates, concerns remained regarding the valuation of real-estate fund assets in a falling market.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><a><span>Consumers:</span>&nbsp;</a>Sentiment among consumers remained weak amid geopolitical uncertainty and subdued growth, despite falling inflation. At higher interest rates, consumers raised holdings of bonds, both directly and via investment funds, and average performance of retail investments improved in 3Q23. Real-estate exposures via retail AIFs are a source of risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><a><span>Infrastructures and services:</span>&nbsp;</a>Equity-trading volumes showed a slight year-on-year decrease amid low volatility. Settlement fails remained broadly stable in 2H23, after their 1H23 fall. Cyber incidents in the financial sector globally remain elevated, even if they went down in 3Q23.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">&nbsp;</p>

<div> ETFs, Xetra, assets, trading volume, interest rates<br />
Summary: <br />
- ETF assets on Xetra reach EUR 1.29 trillion, up 26%<br />
- Xetra lists 123 new ETFs, totaling 2,125 products<br />
- ETF trading volume on Xetra is EUR 169.5 billion<br />
- Bond ETFs benefit from rising interest rates<br />
- Active ETFs see a 48.5% increase in fund assets and 34.6% increase in trading volume.<br /> <div>
<div class="text-highlight">
<div>
<p class="align--justify"><span>- Invested assets in the ETF segment on Xetra rise by 26 per cent to a new record of EUR 1.29 trillion</span><br /><span>- Continued high listing activity expands product range by 123 to 2,125 ETFs</span><br /><span>- Xetra continues to be Europe&rsquo;s largest ETF exchange in terms of number of products listed and trading volume</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="detailText">
<div class="paragraph">
<div>
<p>The market for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Xetra continued to record a high level of investor interest last year: ETF fund assets reached a new high of EUR 1.29 trillion, an increase of 26 per cent (2022: EUR 1.02 trillion). In the same period, the product range on Xetra expanded by 123 ETFs to a new record of 2,125 ETFs (2022: 2,002 ETFs). Against a backdrop of lower market volatility, overall ETF trading activity across Europe declined last year, resulting in an ETF trading volume of EUR 169.5 billion for Xetra (2022: EUR 232.8 billion). With this volume, Xetra was once again the ETF trading venue with the highest turnover among all European exchanges.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div>
<p class="align--justify p--heading-2">Bond ETFs benefit from changed interest rate environment</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div>
<p class="align--justify">One of the standout trends in the past year was the positive development of fixed income ETFs. &ldquo;Bond ETFs have clearly benefited from the turnaround in interest rates,&rdquo; says Stephan Kraus, head of Deutsche B&ouml;rse&rsquo;s ETF &amp; ETP segment. &ldquo;Last year, for the first time in more than ten years, a bond product was among the most traded ETFs on Xetra. Money market ETFs are thus increasingly establishing themselves as an alternative to traditional overnight money accounts,&rdquo; Kraus continues. Fund assets invested in money market ETFs on Xetra amounted to EUR 6.8 billion at the end of the year, up 185 per cent year-on-year (December 2022: EUR 2.4 billion). The corresponding Xetra trading volume in 2023 was EUR 2.9 billion (+ 67.6 percent; 2022: EUR 1.7 billion).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div>
<p class="align--justify">In addition, higher interest rates also paved the way for innovations such as the listing of fixed-maturity bond ETFs: &ldquo;The addition of fixed-maturity bond ETFs to the Xetra product range was one of the most successful product launches in recent years. The new ETFs have a fixed maturity date and offer investors a simple way to make diversified investments in bonds that are held to maturity&rdquo;, explains Kraus. Only a few months after the start of trading, 19 fixed-maturity ETFs with an investment volume of more than EUR 2 billion were already tradable on Xetra at the end of 2023.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div>
<p class="align--justify p--heading-2">Growing investor interest in active ETFs</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div>
<p class="align--justify">Active ETFs benefited disproportionately from the general increase in ETF demand last year. Fund assets managed by active ETFs on Xetra increased by 48.5 per cent year-on-year to a new high of &euro;22.3 billion (December 2022: &euro;15.0 billion). The trading volume also recorded a significant increase to EUR 1.2 billion (+ 34.6 per cent; 2022: EUR 903 million). &ldquo;The above-average growth rates for active ETFs show that ETF investments are no longer exclusively reserved for index products but are increasingly being used for active investment strategies as well. Investors also benefit from the significant advantages of the ETF structure for these products, such as continuous tradability, high transparency, and attractive fees&rdquo;, says Kraus. At the end of the year, the range of active ETFs on Xetra comprised 119 products (+31 ETFs; 2022: 88 active ETFs).</p>

<p>We successfully completed our acquisition of Adenza, bolstering our suite of mission-critical technology solutions, and accelerating our strategic vision of being the trusted fabric of the world's financial system.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>
Sarah Youngwood, Executive Vice President and CFO</span>&nbsp;said, &ldquo;I am excited to join Nasdaq at such a transformational time for the firm.</p>
<p>Despite an uncertain environment, we delivered solid financial performance and strong cash flow generation.</p>
<p>With our acquisition of Adenza now closed, we are focused on achieving our deal-related financial goals including our cross-sell and synergy targets as well as debt paydown.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>FINANCIAL REVIEW</span></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>2023 net revenues were&nbsp;$3,895 million, an increase of&nbsp;$313 million, or 9%, from&nbsp;$3,582 million&nbsp;in the prior year period. Net revenue growth included&nbsp;$178 million, or 5%, from organic growth and a&nbsp;$141 million, or 4%, net benefit from acquisitions and divestitures, including&nbsp;$149 million&nbsp;in revenue from Adenza, which was partially offset by a&nbsp;$6 million&nbsp;decrease from the impact of changes in FX rates.</li>
<li>Fourth quarter 2023 net revenues were&nbsp;$1,117 million, an increase of&nbsp;$211 million, or 23%, from&nbsp;$906 million&nbsp;in the prior year period. Net revenues reflected a&nbsp;$59 million, or 7%, positive impact from organic growth, a&nbsp;$148 million&nbsp;net benefit from acquisitions and divestitures including Adenza, and a&nbsp;$4 million&nbsp;increase from the impact of changes in FX rates.</li>
<li>Solutions revenue was&nbsp;$860 million&nbsp;in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of&nbsp;$210 million, or 32%, with organic growth of 9%, reflecting growth from both the Capital Access Platforms and Financial Technology divisions. ARR reflects the majority of Solutions revenue but excludes the AUM and transaction licensing components of our Index business. ARR grew 29% year over year or 6% organically.</li>
<li>Market Services net revenues were&nbsp;$247 million&nbsp;in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of&nbsp;$2 million, or 1%. The increase reflects&nbsp;$1 million&nbsp;in organic growth and a&nbsp;$1 million&nbsp;positive impact from changes in FX rates.</li>
<li>2023 GAAP operating expenses were&nbsp;$2,317 million, an increase of&nbsp;$299 million, or 15% over 2022. Fourth quarter 2023 GAAP operating expenses were&nbsp;$765 million, an increase of&nbsp;$208 million, or 37%, versus the prior year period. The increase for 2023 and the fourth quarter of 2023 is due to the inclusion of&nbsp;$94 million&nbsp;of Adenza operating expenses (including the amortization expense of acquired intangible assets), an increase in merger and strategic initiatives expense and restructuring costs. The expense increase in both periods reflects continued investment in our people and our businesses to drive long term growth, partially offset by lower professional services.</li>
<li>2023 non-GAAP operating expenses were&nbsp;$1,830 million, an increase of&nbsp;$109 million, or 6% over 2022, including an organic increase of&nbsp;$89 million, or 5%. Fourth quarter 2023 non-GAAP operating expenses were&nbsp;$504 million, an increase of&nbsp;$44 million, or 10% versus the prior year period, including an organic increase of&nbsp;$8 million, or 2%. The increase for 2023 and the fourth quarter of 2023 is primarily due to the inclusion of&nbsp;$35 million&nbsp;of Adenza operating expenses. The increase in both periods also reflects increased expenses associated with the continued investment in our people and our businesses to drive long term growth, higher computer operations and data costs, and higher depreciation. These impacts were partially offset by decreased professional services fees in both the quarter and year ended 2023.</li>
<li>The company returned&nbsp;$127 million&nbsp;to shareholders through dividends, repurchased&nbsp;$110 million&nbsp;in shares of its common stock, and repaid&nbsp;$260 million&nbsp;in debt during the fourth quarter of 2023. As of&nbsp;December&nbsp;31, 2023, there was&nbsp;$1.9 billion&nbsp;remaining under the board authorized share repurchase program.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>INITIATING 2024 EXPENSE AND TAX GUIDANCE</span><span><span>5</span></span></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>The company is initiating its 2024 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to a range of&nbsp;$2,105 million&nbsp;to&nbsp;$2,185 million, and its 2024 non-GAAP tax rate guidance to be in the range of 24.5% to 26.5%.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>STRATEGIC AND BUSINESS UPDATES</span></p>
<ul type="disc">

Thoma Bravo, on&nbsp;November 1, 2023. The acquisition enhances Nasdaq&rsquo;s technology solutions and further expands the company&rsquo;s complementary offerings across mission-critical capital markets infrastructure and compliance.

During the year, three of the five largest&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;operating company IPOs by capital raised chose to list with Nasdaq: Arm, Instacart, and Nextracker.</li>
<li><span>Nasdaq continued market modernization with the migration of its second&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;options market to&nbsp;Amazon Web Services&nbsp;(AWS).</span>&nbsp;Nasdaq successfully completed the migration of the core trading system of Nasdaq GEMX, one of Nasdaq's six options exchanges, to AWS. The new cloud-enabled market infrastructure, which uses AWS Outposts, delivers up to a 10% improvement in latency and the ability to more seamlessly adjust capacity in response to changing market conditions, which can deliver a better trading environment for market participants.</li>
<li><span>Market technology growth included significant&nbsp;Latin America&nbsp;(LATAM) client wins.</span>&nbsp;Nasdaq market technology continued its progress in providing critical technology underpinning global financial market infrastructure providers with particular strength in LATAM. In the fourth quarter, Nasdaq partnered with nuam exchange, formed by the merger of the&nbsp;Chile,&nbsp;Peru, and&nbsp;Colombia&nbsp;stock exchanges, to provide technology that will underpin the integration, development, and expansion of the new marketplace in LATAM, and expanded its partnership with BMV, the&nbsp;Mexican Stock Exchange, to modernize its entire post-trade technology platform across clearing and settlement.</li>

<p><span>1&nbsp;</span>Represents revenues less transaction-based expenses.</p>
<p><span>2&nbsp;</span>Constitutes revenues from our Capital Access Platforms and Financial Technology segments.</p>
<p><span>3&nbsp;</span>Refer to our reconciliations of&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP to non-GAAP net income, diluted earnings per share, operating income, operating expenses and organic impacts included in the attached schedules.</p>
<p><span>4</span>&nbsp;Annualized&nbsp;Recurring&nbsp;Revenue&nbsp;(ARR) for a given period is the current annualized value derived from subscription contracts with a defined contract value. This excludes contracts that are not recurring, are one-time in nature or where the contract value fluctuates based on defined metrics. ARR is currently one of our key performance metrics to assess the health and trajectory of our recurring business. ARR does not have any standardized definition and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those items. For Adenza recurring revenue contracts, the amount included in ARR is consistent with the amount that we invoice the customer during the current period. Additionally, for Adenza recurring revenue contracts that include annual values that increase over time, we include in ARR only the annualized value of components of the contract that are considered active as of the date of the ARR calculation. We do not include the future committed increases in the contract value as of the date of the ARR calculation. ARR is not a forecast and the active contracts at the end of a reporting period used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers.</p>
<p><span>5&nbsp;</span>U.S.&nbsp;GAAP operating expense and tax rate guidance are not provided due to the inherent difficulty in quantifying certain amounts due to a variety of factors including the unpredictability in the movement in foreign currency rates, as well as future charges or reversals outside of the normal course of business.</p>

<p><span>NON-GAAP INFORMATION</span></p>
<p>In addition to disclosing results determined in accordance with&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP, Nasdaq also discloses certain non-GAAP results of operations, including, but not limited to, non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP operating expenses, that include certain adjustments or exclude certain charges and gains that are described in the reconciliation table of&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP to non-GAAP information provided at the end of this release. Management uses this non-GAAP information internally, along with&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP information, in evaluating our performance and in making financial and operational decisions. We believe our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and supplemental data relating to our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of results as the items described below in the reconciliation tables do not reflect ongoing operating performance.</p>
<p>These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to,&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate such measures differently, which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. This information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant as a substitute for our operating results in accordance with&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP. We recommend investors review the&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP financial measures included in this earnings release. When viewed in conjunction with our&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide greater transparency and a more complete understanding of factors affecting our business than&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP measures alone.</p>
<p>We understand that analysts and investors regularly rely on non-GAAP financial measures, such as those noted above, to assess operating performance. We use these measures because they highlight trends more clearly in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our ongoing operating performance.</p>
<p><span>Organic revenue and expense growth, organic change and organic impact</span>&nbsp;are non-GAAP measures that reflect adjustments for: (i) the impact of period-over-period changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and (ii) the revenues, expenses and operating income associated with acquisitions and divestitures for the twelve month period following the date of the acquisition or divestiture. Reconciliations of these measures are described within the body of this release or in the reconciliation tables at the end of this release.</p>
<p><span>Foreign exchange impact:</span>&nbsp;In countries with currencies other than the&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;dollar, revenues and expenses are translated using monthly average exchange rates. Certain discussions in this release isolate the impact of year-over-year foreign currency fluctuations to better measure the comparability of operating results between periods. Operating results excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations are calculated by translating the current period&rsquo;s results by the prior period&rsquo;s exchange rates.</p>
<p><span>Restructuring programs</span>: In the fourth quarter of 2023, following the closing of the Adenza acquisition, our management approved, committed to and initiated a restructuring program, &ldquo;Adenza Restructuring&rdquo; to optimize our efficiencies as a combined organization. In connection with this program, we expect to incur pre-tax charges principally related to employee-related costs, contract terminations, real estate impairments and other related costs. We expect to achieve benefits primarily in the form of expense and revenue synergies. In&nbsp;October 2022, following our September announcement to realign our segments and leadership, we initiated a divisional alignment program with a focus on realizing the full potential of this structure. In connection with the program, we expect to incur pre-tax charges principally related to employee-related costs, consulting, asset impairments and contract terminations over a two-year period. We expect to achieve benefits in the form of both increased customer engagement and operating efficiencies. Costs related to the Adenza restructuring and the divisional alignment programs will be recorded as &ldquo;restructuring&rdquo; in our consolidated statements of income. We will exclude charges associated with this program for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures as they are not reflective of ongoing operating performance or comparisons in Nasdaq's performance between periods.</p>

ARR is currently one of our key performance metrics to assess the health and trajectory of our recurring business. ARR does not have any standardized definition and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those items. For Adenza recurring revenue contracts, the amount included in ARR is consistent with the amount that we invoice the customer during the current period. Additionally, for Adenza recurring revenue contracts that include annual values that increase over time, we include in ARR only the annualized value of components of the contract that are considered active as of the date of the ARR calculation. We do not include the future committed increases in the contract value as of the date of the ARR calculation. ARR is not a forecast and the active contracts at the end of a reporting period used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers.</td>

<p><span>The UK&rsquo;s first Sharia-compliant bridge finance provider,&nbsp;</span><span><a href="https://offa.co.uk/" target="_blank"><span>Offa</span></a></span><span>, has partnered with cloud-based mortgage and savings provider&nbsp;</span><span><a href="https://www.finova.tech/" target="_blank"><span>finova</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;to develop an innovative&nbsp;</span><span>end-to-end digital platform to support its growing portfolio of property finance products. Offa&rsquo;s new origination platform will be delivered by finova and its implementation partner Hexaware in the first half of 2024.</span></p>
<p><span>The innovative project &ndash; part of a &pound;1 million investment by Offa into its IT systems &ndash; is expected to transform the way Islamic property finance is conducted in Britain, creating a tech-driven &ldquo;faster, smarter and easier&rdquo; service for intermediaries and direct customers that starts with their initial enquiry and concludes with the release of funds.</span></p>
<p><span>Offa will leverage finova&rsquo;s fully customisable Apprivo software, giving it access to multiple data points, including ID verification, credit reference agencies and automated valuation models. Additional services can also be integrated via finova&rsquo;s API ecosystem, including conveyancing, valuations, and payment processing and those services specific to Offa and Sharia-compliancy. The end result will be a smoother and far quicker application process for Offa&rsquo;s trusted intermediaries, direct customers and others involved in the property finance chain.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Sagheer Malik, Offa&rsquo;s Chief Commercial Officer, said</span></b><span>: &ldquo;Speed is especially important in the real estate market segments we target. We know from past experience a key issue for customers and intermediaries seeking Islamic finance is the slow, cumbersome and complicated application processes involved. Offa is making a significant investment into the digital technologies that underpin our business, and in finova we have a trusted and highly experienced technology partner, whose Apprivo<sup>&nbsp;</sup>software will transform our service by streamlining our processes to create a faster, smarter and easier system for all.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Offa was launched in 2019 as an ethical alternative to conventional bridging. The Birmingham-headquartered company currently offers short-term property finance in line with Islamic finance principles, which means products are not based on interest or finance-prohibited activities that are regarded as damaging to society, such as alcohol, gambling and the arms trade. Islamic finance applications have a reputation for taking longer than they should, an issue addressed in the new architecture built for Offa by finova.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Chris Little, Chief Revenue Officer at finova,</span></b><span>&nbsp;commented: &ldquo;Clients have become accustomed to a seamless digital experience across every aspect of their lives, including their finances. As a fully open API, Apprivo has many applications for the Islamic Finance market and will support Offa&rsquo;s end-to-end digital processes with ease. Moving forward, we&rsquo;re excited to activate the next stages of delivery and play a part in Offa&rsquo;s growth journey as it rapidly expands its portfolio of products.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Our partnership with Offa also marks an important milestone for finova as the first project where we collaborated with Hexaware, our new implementation partner. Hexaware has played a critical role in the delivery of this platform, with oversight from the finova team, and we look forward to building on this new strategic partnership that is already off to a strong start - with Offa.&rdquo;</span></p>

<title>ASIC: Court Declares Westpac Engaged In Unconscionable Conduct For Interest Rate Swap, Maximum Penalty Applied</title>

<div> penalty, pre-hedging, interest rate swap, unconscionable conduct, ASIC

Summary:
- Westpac penalized $1.8m for unconscionable conduct and $8m for costs
- Conduct involved pre-hedging without consent, risking client's financial loss
- Westpac's actions contrasted with other banks and resulted in a significant trading profit
- Court reserved decision on order for compliance program
- International focus on pre-hedging issue and ASIC's engagement with IOSCO<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The Federal Court has declared Westpac Banking Corporation (Westpac) engaged in unconscionable conduct in October 2016 when executing a $12 billion interest rate swap transaction, the largest of its kind in Australian financial market history.</p>
<p>Westpac will pay the maximum penalty of $1.8 million in relation to the conduct, together with $8 million for ASIC&rsquo;s litigation and investigation costs.</p>
<p>Westpac&rsquo;s unconscionable conduct arose when it engaged in pre-hedging ahead of an interest rate swap transaction with a Consortium comprising AustralianSuper and IFM entities. The interest rate swap related to managing interest rate risk associated with the Consortium&rsquo;s purchase from the NSW Government of a majority stake in electricity provider, Ausgrid.</p>
<p>ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said, &lsquo;This is a significant outcome which assists to clarify expectations regarding pre-hedging, particularly around disclosure and consent where the pre-hedging can have a detrimental impact on the counterparty to the transaction&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Appropriate conduct for pre-hedging is an issue of global significance. In this case, Westpac&rsquo;s behaviour was unconscionable and exposed its client to significant risk. Westpac&rsquo;s conduct was also in stark contrast with several other banks.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We share the Court&rsquo;s concern regarding the maximum penalty available in relation to the conduct, and note that had Westpac engaged in similar conduct today the maximum available penalty would have been significantly higher.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Court declared Westpac&rsquo;s conduct was unconscionable in that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Westpac was aware of its client&rsquo;s concern about trading prior to the swap transaction (pre-hedging) that had the potential to adversely affect the price of the swap transaction to their detriment. Every basis point increase to the price of the swap transaction would involve a cost to the Consortium of about $4.7 million;</li>
<li>Despite being aware of its client&rsquo;s concerns, Westpac acted on an internal plan to pre-hedge up to 50% of the interest rate risk by trading in significant volumes of interest rate derivatives in the market before the swap transaction was executed;</li>
<li>Westpac failed to obtain client consent or give clear and full disclosure about the extent of its planned pre-hedging; and</li>
<li>Once Westpac commenced its on-market pre-hedging trading, the Consortium could not protect itself against the risk that Westpac&rsquo;s trading would increase the price of the swap transaction to the Consortium.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If pre-hedging is not carried out in an appropriate manner it can be unfair, unconscionable and result in poor client outcomes. We will continue to hold participants in these markets to high standards,&rsquo; concluded Ms Court.</p>
<p>Westpac&rsquo;s derivatives trading desk achieved a trading profit of approximately $20.7 million on the day the swap was executed (of which $3.7 million was allocated to the Sales team as commission).</p>
<p>The Court also declared that Westpac failed to have adequate arrangements to manage the conflict of interests between it and the Consortium and did not do all things necessary to ensure that the swap transaction was provided to the Consortium efficiently, honestly and fairly.</p>
<p>The Court reserved its decision on whether to make an order requiring Westpac to complete a compliance programme with an independent review of its pre-hedging practices and controls, including relating to conflicts of interest management and client communications.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>ASIC originally alleged Westpac breached s1043A of the Corporations Act (insider trading), s12CB of the ASIC Act (unconscionable conduct) and s912A of the Corporations Act (breaches of the general obligations of an Australian financial services licensee) (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2021-releases/21-093mr-asic-commences-civil-proceedings-against-westpac-for-insider-trading/" title="21-093MR ASIC commences civil proceedings against Westpac for insider trading">21-093MR</a>).</p>
<p>Pre-hedging involves trading to hedge the risk that a firm anticipates it will acquire from a future transaction.</p>
<p>The Consortium sought to enter into the interest rate swap transaction to hedge the interest rate risk associated with the money it had borrowed to fund its stake in Ausgrid. That borrowing was at variable interest rates and the Consortium wanted to protect itself from the risk of those rates increasing by converting that interest rate exposure to a fixed rate for the full term of the loan. The transaction remains the largest interest rate swap transaction executed in one tranche in Australian financial market history.</p>
<p>The $1.8 million penalty is the maximum the Court could order for statutory unconscionable conduct in 2016, when the conduct occurred. At the time, a contravention of s912A of the Corporations Act did not attract a penalty.</p>
<p>Civil penalties have significantly increased since 2016. The current penalty for unconscionable conduct in breach of the ASIC Act, or for a breach of s912A of the Corporations Act, is at least $15.65 million for a corporation. For a large entity, the maximum penalty may potentially be $782.5 million or three times the benefit derived (whichever is greater).</p>
<p>ASIC notes that issues around pre-hedging has received significant international attention and ASIC is actively engaged on this issue at the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO).</p>

<p><span>Tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou katoa. Ko Samantha Barrass taku ingoa, ko taku mahi ki te mana Tātai Hokohoko, ko te mana whakahaere, Tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā tātou katoa</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This is my third FSC outlook event. There is, as I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve all now realised, much to cover in thirty minutes. Before I do that, I want to pause, and acknowledge the work of everyone at the FSC, including Rob Flanagan. The work of the FSC, from the Board to its staff, to members whose staff contribute to its committees, is vital in our engagement-led approach.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Minister this morning set out a clear vision and direction for financial services regulation in New Zealand. Based on my experience across multiple jurisdictions, these changes offer the opportunity to streamline and bring New Zealand up to best of class, learning from what has, and has not worked overseas.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I&rsquo;m going to build on some of the points the Minister has raised, speak to the importance of the Twin Peaks regime working well, reflect on how a move to outcome focused regulation is rooted in the reasons that I became a regulator and touch on the importance of work to further develop New Zealand&rsquo;s capital markets.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>With the start of a year, there&rsquo;s an opportunity to look back, as well as look forward. I want to quickly reflect on 2023. It was a year in which the new financial advice regime came into force, our work on CoFI deepened, and our implementation of the climate related disclosure regime came into effect.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I raise these because it shows what can be achieved when the FMA and the industry work closely together. The FMA and the New Zealand financial services sector has, at its best, always been open, engaged, part of a two-way conversation about how we achieve our objectives to ensure the financial sector is working well for all New Zealanders. If we keep that in mind, preserve it, in the year ahead, I think that will serve us well.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Minister this morning set out proposals to change to how financial services is regulated in New Zealand. The FMA is committed to working with the Government to implement these.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Our view, as an independent regulator, is that using the core principles at the heart of CoFI can result in a simple and streamlined approach for conduct regulation in New Zealand across the piece. The fair conduct principle that sits at the heart of CoFI, that a &lsquo;financial institution must treat consumers fairly&rsquo; sets out that the fundamental components of fair conduct are</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Paying due regard to a consumers interests</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Acting ethically, transparently and in good faith</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Assisting customers to make informed decisions</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Ensuring relevant services and associated products meet the requirements and objectives of likely consumers</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Not subjecting consumers to unfair pressure or tactics or undue influence.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Taking this approach to the conduct of all financial services means that an outcomes-based regime can provide flexibility, support innovation and avoid box ticking. It promotes a supervisory relationship that facilitates proactive and proportionate engagement. It also enables us to minimise regulatory burden.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On CoFI, we have already been engaging proactively with the industry in a variety of ways.&nbsp; Additional guidance and engagement will be provided for very small firms to ensure they have everything they need to be successful. It obviously costs more of our resources but makes things less costly and more straightforward for firms. We will be working with both the Government and the sector to do this.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We have heard feedback from some in the sector who believe the FMA will be subjecting firms&rsquo; fair conduct programmes to significant scrutiny during the licensing process. I want to be clear that this has never been our intention and has never been a part of our planning. It&rsquo;s not for us to go through your fair conduct programme line by line. We&rsquo;re not going to be signing them off.&nbsp; The responsibility for these programmes sits with the Board of the institutions. It is for you to right-size your fair conduct programme or your CoFI application for your business, especially for smaller firms.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The FMA will be flexible and respond to different business models throughout the licensing process and in our supervision and monitoring approach. The FMA has never had a one size fits all approach to its work, taking an approach based on engagement and working with the sector.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Whenever a funding and levy review of the FMA has taken place in the last few years, the sector has been largely clear that it is this approach &ndash; of being flexible, engagement-led, that is preferred over a rules-based, enforcement-led approach. Yes, this means greater costs for the FMA - that industry largely pays for - but critically firms benefit from a more efficient regulatory regime.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As you&rsquo;ve just heard, the Government is considering the best way forward on CCCFA. When New Zealanders talk about their experience of the conduct of financial services, credit is always going to be top of mind. A critical role of&nbsp; financial services is enabling Kiwis&rsquo; lives. It's their ability to borrow money whether to buy a house or make urgent repairs to their car. We can see the sense in having a single over-arching conduct regulator.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We see the value of using the broader regulatory toolbox provided through the Financial Markets Conduct Act to support appropriate regulation of registered banks and non-bank deposit takers and high-interest rate lending by all lenders, particularly those targeted at vulnerable communities.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Aligning credit regulation with an outcomes-based approach and fair conduct rules would provide clear and constructive benefits. It would provide regulatory certainty and efficiency. It would help ease burden while ensuring a range of monitoring, supervisory and enforcement tools to manage poor conduct in the sector. It would also allow expectations to evolve as new technologies, products and business models emerge.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The FMA looks forward to engaging constructively with the planned review in the coming months and is ready to implement any changes the Government may see fit to make.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A key message that industry has regularly given both the FMA, but also other regulators and policy makers, is the need for greater coordination. We have sought to respond to that through the Council of Financial Regulators, providing clarity through the regulatory initiatives calendar and seeking to coordinate agency activities. Bi-lateral engagements have also been significantly strengthened.&nbsp;</span><span>We are mindful that industry has been through a period of significant regulatory change in recent years while coping with huge external shocks and impacts such as COVID-19 and last year&rsquo;s weather events.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Noting those events, it's important to recognise that different independent regulators and policymakers will necessarily consider risks and events through the lens of their separate regulatory objectives. Regulators have already taken steps to try to manage this, while mitigating its burden.&nbsp;</span><span>Many of you will have experienced the joint calls that the FMA and the RBNZ conducted during these events, and these received positive feedback.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>My view is that this cooperation and co-ordination should continue to intensify. Only by doing this, can we seek to manage impost on industry.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As most of you will know over the last couple of months, we&rsquo;ve been holding sessions in Auckland, Wellington and last week, Christchurch on outcome focused regulation.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Why have we embarked upon this? Why do we think it is important? What are we hearing?</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The point of it is to bring about a shared focus on the &lsquo;so what?&rsquo; of our collective effort. Yours in the industry and ours as a regulator.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The point is to recognise the risk of not seeing the wood for the trees that arises from more prescriptive, &lsquo;tick box&rsquo; approaches to regulation.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It&rsquo;s a risk I have been concerned about for my entire career in regulation. It&rsquo;s why I left my exciting career as a monetary macro-economist and moved into regulation in the first place.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The risk of &lsquo;tick box&rsquo; regulation is real. It contributes to regulators failing to spot emerging risk, despite their unique cross-sector vantage point. It increases the extent to which regulation can cut across innovation, including changes that improve outcomes for consumers, markets and society. Unfortunately it allows some to design technical compliance models that fail to achieve the consumer and market aims of the regulatory model.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Rules and other regulations are of course a critical part of the framework. These outcomes don&rsquo;t replace our legislation &ndash; they are not new rules.&nbsp; We believe strongly that our legislation supports these outcomes.&nbsp; The law also provides the mechanisms, where they&rsquo;re needed, for us to enforce the legal obligations that support the outcomes we are seeking.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We don&rsquo;t need to go back too far to recognise the market failures that have cut across consumer outcomes and clean markets. Just a cursory look at the enforcement action we have taken in the past year, demonstrates the risk posed by those who can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t deliver fair consumer outcomes or support clean markets.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We made it clear last year that we are alert to any practices by providers that lead to high pressure sales, not just commissions, not just sales-based remuneration.&nbsp; We acted following a review of the classification of wholesale customers. These are good examples of us beginning to consider how outcomes-focused regulation will work in practice. We weren&rsquo;t simply focused on a narrow range of practices. We were looking at risks to the outcome that &lsquo;consumers can trust providers to act in their interests&rsquo;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The FMA&rsquo;s focus on outcomes is in the first instance something for us. It is about our regulatory approach and the judgment we bring to our work as a regulator. It&rsquo;s about us leaning even further into our engagement-led approach. It is about forward looking supervisory judgement that is risk-based and outcomes-focused.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The consultation is seeking your views on the outcomes that will guide our approach to exercising our regulatory powers and responsibilities. It will be risks to these outcomes that first and foremost guide our decision-making on how we use our resources. For our supervisory approach, we will use these outcomes, not detailed compliance requirements, to frame our discussions with and assessments of providers.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While I&rsquo;ve set out some examples of us beginning to think about outcomes, I&rsquo;ve been clear this is a profound shift for us as an independent regulator, and it will not happen overnight.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As a part of our preparation, we will first look to pilot approaches this year with a small number of firms. Participation will be entirely voluntary. If you are interested in helping inform our approach let us know, particularly in your responses to the consultation.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We need to instil confidence in the approach, and the best way to do that is by demonstrating it to you, so you experience it. It&rsquo;s our intention that your engagement with our monitoring teams will begin to see a palpable shift to outcomes rather than rules and compliance with rules. In so doing we want to shift the focus to outcomes for consumers and markets and innovation for firms.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I&rsquo;d like to close by reflecting on the importance of the work that we can do to develop and deepen capital markets in New Zealand. A few years ago, the FMA, alongside the NZX, co-sponsored the Capital Markets 2029 work that considered further ways New Zealand can both enable businesses to attract capital, but also ensure investors have assets to invest in.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It will be important, not just this year, but in the years ahead, to look not just at the regulatory framework, but how we are ensuring New Zealand firms have access to capital to grow, and that the investments are there to ensure KiwiSaver funds have something to invest in to help grow the New Zealand economy.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>KiwiSaver has now grown to near $100 billion and is a significant part of New Zealanders&rsquo; assets. The FSC&rsquo;s Blueprint for Growth poses good questions about how Government, the sector and regulators can work together to grow the financial confidence and wellbeing of New Zealanders, and I commend you for this work.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I do want to finish on a reprise.&nbsp; The FMA and the New Zealand financial services sector, at its best, has always been open, engaged, part of a two-way conversation about how we achieve our objectives to ensure the financial sector is working well for all New Zealanders.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let&rsquo;s keep that in mind for 2024, and I suspect it will serve us well.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for your time.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<title>We're Not There Yet: Current Regulation Around AI May Not Be Sufficient - Keynote Address By ASIC Chair Joe Longo At The At UTS Human Technology Institute Shaping Our Future Symposium, 31 January 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>KEY POINTS</h2>
<ul>
<li>ASIC Chair Joe Longo spoke at the UTS Human Technology Institute Shaping Our Future Symposium on the current and future state of AI regulation and governance.</li>
<li>All participants in the financial system have a duty to balance innovation with the responsible, safe, and ethical use of emerging technologies &ndash; and existing obligations around good governance and the provision of financial services don&rsquo;t change with new technology.</li>
<li>ASIC will continue to act, within our remit, to deter bad behaviour whenever appropriate and however caused. Our focus is &ndash; and will always be &ndash; the safety and integrity of the financial system and positive outcomes for consumers and investors.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Existing laws likely do not adequately prevent AI-facilitated harms before they occur, and more work is needed to ensure there is an adequate response to harms after they occur.&rdquo;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/we-re-not-there-yet-current-regulation-around-ai-may-not-be-sufficient/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>[1]</span></a></p>
<p>These words are from the Federal Government&rsquo;s interim report on AI regulation. I&rsquo;m sure most of you are familiar with it. It&rsquo;s clear, then, that a divide exists between our current regulatory environment and the ideal. Today&rsquo;s theme of &lsquo;bridging the governance gap&rsquo; presupposes such a divide. It invites us to consider what AI governance and regulation might look like in the ideal, how great the divide is between that ideal and current circumstances &ndash; and, of course, how we might go about bridging that divide.</p>
<p>But it all hinges on that first question: what would need to be addressed for the regulatory framework to &lsquo;fit the bill&rsquo;? Or, to put it another way: in what way might the current regulatory framework inadequately prevent AI-facilitated harms? This question is key. We can only bridge the gap &ndash; and create our best approximation to the ideal &ndash; if we know where that gap lies.</p>
<p>So my purpose today is to look for that gap. But first, I want to make it very clear that any future AI regulatory changes should not be taken to mean that AI isn&rsquo;t already regulated. It is. And I will devote the first part of my speech to making that clear.</p>
<h2>AI is not the Wild West</h2>
<p>Earlier this month Microsoft&rsquo;s AI Tech &amp; Policy Lead in Asia said that &ldquo;2024 will be the year that we start to build sensible, safe, and expandable regulation around the use of AI technologies.&rdquo;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/we-re-not-there-yet-current-regulation-around-ai-may-not-be-sufficient/#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span>[2]</span></a></p>
<p>While I agree with the sentiment, statements like this imply that AI is some kind of &lsquo;Wild West&rsquo;, without law or regulation of any kind. Nothing could be further from the truth. As the interim report noted, &ldquo;businesses and individuals who develop and use AI are already subject to various Australian laws. These include laws such as those relating to privacy, online safety, corporations, intellectual property and anti-discrimination, which apply to all sectors of the economy.&rdquo;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/we-re-not-there-yet-current-regulation-around-ai-may-not-be-sufficient/#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><span>[3]</span></a></p>
<p>For example, current directors&rsquo; obligations under the&nbsp;<em>Corporations Act</em>&nbsp;aren&rsquo;t specific duties &ndash; they&rsquo;re principle-based. They apply broadly, and as companies increasingly deploy AI, this is something directors must pay special attention to, in terms of their directors&rsquo; duties.</p>
<p>In 2022, the Federal Court found that RI Advice breached its license obligations to act efficiently and fairly by failing to have adequate risk management systems to manage its cybersecurity risks.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/we-re-not-there-yet-current-regulation-around-ai-may-not-be-sufficient/#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><span>[4]</span></a>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s certainly not a stretch to apply this thinking to the use and operation of AI by financial services licensees. In fact, ASIC is already pursuing an action in which AI-related issues arise, where we believe the use of a demand model was part of an insurance pricing process that led to the full benefit of advertised loyalty discounts not being appropriately applied.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/we-re-not-there-yet-current-regulation-around-ai-may-not-be-sufficient/#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><span>[5]</span></a></p>
<p>The point is, the responsibility towards good governance is not changed just because the technology is new. Whatever may come, there&rsquo;s plenty of scope right now for making the best use of our existing regulatory toolkit. And businesses, boards, and directors shouldn&rsquo;t allow the international discussion around AI regulation to let them think AI isn&rsquo;t already regulated. Because it is. For this reason, and within our remit, ASIC will continue to act, and act early, to deter bad behaviour whenever appropriate and however caused.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re willing to test the regulatory parameters where they&rsquo;re unclear or where corporations seek to exploit perceived gaps. Among other things, that means probing the oversight, risk management, and governance arrangements entities have in place. We&rsquo;re already conducting a review into the use of AI in the banking, credit, insurance, and advice sectors. This will give us a better understanding of the actual AI use cases being deployed and developed in the Australian market &ndash; and how they impact consumers. We&rsquo;re testing what risks to consumers licensees are identifying from the use of AI, and how they&rsquo;re mitigating against these risks.</p>
<h2>Is this enough?</h2>
<p>But just because existing regulation can apply to AI, that doesn&rsquo;t mean there&rsquo;s nothing more to do. Much has already been made of 2024 as &lsquo;the year AI grows up&rsquo;. Phrases like &lsquo;leaps forward&rsquo;, &lsquo;rapid progress,&rsquo;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/we-re-not-there-yet-current-regulation-around-ai-may-not-be-sufficient/#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><span>[6]</span></a>&nbsp;and others abound, suggesting an endless stream of benefits to consumers and businesses in the wake of AI&rsquo;s growth.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re right. AI continues to be an astonishing development. The potential benefits to businesses and individuals are enormous &ndash; with an estimated &lsquo;additional $170 billion to $600 billion a year to Australia&rsquo;s GDP by 2030.&rsquo;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/we-re-not-there-yet-current-regulation-around-ai-may-not-be-sufficient/#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><span>[7]</span></a>&nbsp;But that very rapidity brings with it a host of questions.</p>
<p>In 1991, after the launch of the World Wide Web, it took seven years for it to gain 100 million users. When Myspace was launched 12 years later, it hit that milestone in three years. Facebook, YouTube, and Spotify all took four years, and Uber &ndash; that great disruptor &ndash; took five. Since then, times have decreased dramatically. When TikTok was launched in 2017, it took just nine months to reach 100 million users, while ChatGPT took&hellip; just two months.</p>
<p>The open question here is how regulation can adapt to such rapidity. As food for thought, it took two years for the Fair Work Ombudsman to determine that Uber drivers are not employees.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/we-re-not-there-yet-current-regulation-around-ai-may-not-be-sufficient/#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><span>[8]</span></a>&nbsp;This isn&rsquo;t through any fault or delay &ndash; it&rsquo;s the natural pace of any deliberative and considered regulatory organisation. But there&rsquo;s a clear question here about whether our current regulatory framework is enough to meet the rapidity of that challenge.</p>
<p>So, even as AI &lsquo;leaps forward,&rsquo; at a rate never seen before, questions around transparency and explainability become paramount if we&rsquo;re to protect consumers from harm &ndash; intended or not. Let me consider several questions and risks around the use of AI.</p>
<p>One question may be, will the &lsquo;rapid progress&rsquo; of AI carry along with it the vulnerable man or woman struggling to pay their bills in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis, whose credit score is at the whim of AI-driven credit scoring models that may be inadvertently biased?</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t fanciful to imagine that credit providers using AI systems to identify &lsquo;better&rsquo; credit risks could (potentially) unfairly discriminate against those vulnerable consumers. And with &lsquo;opaque&rsquo; AI systems, the mechanisms by which that discrimination occurs could be difficult to detect. Even if the current laws are sufficient to punish bad action, their ability to prevent the harm might not be.</p>
<p>In such a case, will that person struggling have recourse for appeal? Will they even know that AI was being used? And if they do, who&rsquo;s to blame? Is it the developers? The company? And how would the company even go about determining whether the decision was made because of algorithmic bias, as opposed to a calculus based on broader data sets than human modelling? Dario Amodei, CEO of the AI company Anthropic, admits freely that &ldquo;we, humanity, do not know how to understand what&rsquo;s going on inside these [AI] models.&rdquo;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/we-re-not-there-yet-current-regulation-around-ai-may-not-be-sufficient/#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"><span>[9]</span></a>&nbsp;So if even the experts can&rsquo;t explain how a particular system works &ndash; and it seems this is often the case &ndash; how can we justify using it? How can we be sure that vulnerable consumers are part of that great leap forward?</p>
<p>Or let&rsquo;s consider the use of AI in fraud detection and prevention, with algorithms analysing patterns and anomalies in transactions to detect potentially fraudulent activities in real-time. What happens to the customer who&rsquo;s debanked when an algorithm says so? What happens when they&rsquo;re denied a mortgage because an algorithm decides they should be? When that person ends up paying a higher insurance premium, will they know why, or even that they&rsquo;re paying a higher premium? Will the provider?</p>
<p>And what if a provider lacks adequate governance or supervision of an AI investment manager? When, as a system, it learns to manipulate the market by hitting stop losses, causing market drops and volatility&hellip; when there&rsquo;s a lack of detection systems&hellip; yes, our regulations around responsible outsourcing may apply &ndash; but have they prevented the harm? Or a provider might use the AI system to carry out some other agenda, like seeking to only support related party product, or share offerings in giving some preference based on historic data. The point is, there's a need for transparency and oversight to prevent unfair practices &ndash; accidental or intended. But can our current regulatory framework ensure that happens? I&rsquo;m not so sure.</p>
<p>Does it prevent blind reliance on AI risk models without human oversight that can lead to underestimating risks? Does it prevent failure to consider emerging risks that the models may not have encountered during training?</p>
<p>In addition to these questions I&rsquo;ve just posed, the Australian Signals Directorate last week outlined several further challenges around AI use, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>Data poisoning;</li>
<li>Input manipulation;</li>
<li>AI &lsquo;hallucinations&rsquo;; and</li>
<li>Privacy and intellectual property concerns<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/we-re-not-there-yet-current-regulation-around-ai-may-not-be-sufficient/#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><span>[10]</span></a></li>
</ol>
<p>The first three in particular present a governance challenge to any entity using AI, not to become over-reliant on any model that can&rsquo;t be understood, examined, and explained.</p>
<p>In response to these various challenges, some may suggest solutions such as red-teaming, or &lsquo;AI constitutions&rsquo; &ndash; the suggestion that AI can be better understood if it has an in-built constitution which it must follow. But even these have been shown to be vulnerable, with one team of researchers breaking through the control measures of several AI models simply by adding random characters on the end of their requests.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/we-re-not-there-yet-current-regulation-around-ai-may-not-be-sufficient/#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"><span>[11]</span></a>&nbsp;Another possibility, echoing the EU approach, might be the requirement to complete an &lsquo;AI risk assessment&rsquo; before implementing AI in any case.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/we-re-not-there-yet-current-regulation-around-ai-may-not-be-sufficient/#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"><span>[12]</span></a>&nbsp;But even here, questions like those I&rsquo;ve already asked need to be considered to ensure the risk assessment is actually effective in preventing harm.</p>
<p>My point is, these questions of transparency, explainability, and rapidity deserve careful attention. They can&rsquo;t be answered quickly or off-hand. But they must be addressed if we&rsquo;re to ensure the advancement of AI means an advancement for all. And as far as financial markets and services are concerned, it&rsquo;s clear there&rsquo;s a way to go in answering them.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>To sum up: AI, as everyone here knows, is a rapidly and constantly evolving space. But ASIC&rsquo;s interest is &ndash; and will always be &ndash; two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The safety and integrity of the financial system;</li>
<li>Positive outcomes for consumers and investors.</li>
</ol>
<p>AI may be able to help us achieve these ends; it can &lsquo;create new jobs, power new industries, boost productivity and benefit consumers&rsquo;.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/we-re-not-there-yet-current-regulation-around-ai-may-not-be-sufficient/#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"><span>[13]</span></a>&nbsp;But, as yet, no clear consensus has emerged on how best to regulate it. Business practices that deliberately or accidentally mislead and deceive consumers have existed for a long time &ndash; and are something we have a long history of dealing with. But this risk is exacerbated by the availability of vast consumer data sets and the use of tools such as AI and machine learning which allow for quick iteration and micro-targeting. As new technologies are adopted, monitoring consumer outcomes is crucial.</p>
<p>For now, existing obligations around good governance and the provision of financial services don&rsquo;t change with new technology. That means all participants in the financial system have a duty to balance innovation with the responsible, safe, and ethical use of emerging technologies.</p>
<p>Bridging the governance gap means strengthening our current regulatory framework where it&rsquo;s good, and shoring it up where it needs further development. But above it all, it means asking the right questions. And one question we should be asking ourselves again and again is this: &ldquo;is this enough?&rdquo;</p>

<div> Keywords: Citi, lawsuit, online banking security, fraud, reimbursement
Summary: The New York Attorney General Letitia James has filed a lawsuit against Citi, alleging lax online protections, misleading customers about fraud, and denial of reimbursement. Citi's negligence has resulted in millions of dollars being stolen from customers, with some losing their entire life savings. The bank has failed to respond adequately to fraudulent activity, leaving customers vulnerable to scammers. Summary: <br /><br />Attorney General Letitia James has filed a lawsuit against Citi, citing lax online protections, fraudulent activity, and denial of reimbursement. Citi's negligence has led to millions being stolen from customers, with some losing their entire life savings. The bank has failed to respond to fraudulent activity, leaving customers vulnerable to scammers. <div>
<p>New York Attorney General Letitia James today&nbsp;<a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2024-01/citi-complaint.pdf">sued Citibank, N.A. (Citi) for failing to protect and refusing to reimburse victims of fraud</a>. The lawsuit alleges that Citi does not implement strong online protections to stop unauthorized account takeovers, misleads account holders about their rights after their accounts are hacked and funds are stolen, and illegally denies reimbursement to victims of fraud. The Office of the Attorney General (OAG) has found that the bank fails to respond to fraudulent activity appropriately and quickly. As a result of Citi&rsquo;s lax security, New York customers have lost millions of dollars, and in some instances, their entire lifesavings, to scammers and hackers. Attorney General James is seeking to hold Citi accountable for failing to protect its customers and require the company to pay back defrauded New Yorkers with interest, pay penalties, and adopt enhanced anti-fraud defenses to prevent scammers from stealing consumers&rsquo; funds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Banks are supposed to be the safest place to keep money, yet Citi&rsquo;s negligence has allowed scammers to steal millions of dollars from hardworking people,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>Attorney General James</span>. &ldquo;Many New Yorkers rely on online banking to pay bills or save for big milestones, and if a bank cannot secure its customers&rsquo; accounts, they are failing in their most basic duty. There is no excuse for Citi&rsquo;s failure to protect and prevent millions of dollars from being stolen from customers&rsquo; accounts and my office will not write off illegal behavior from big banks.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Harm to New York Customers</span></p>
<p>Citi is one of the largest banks in the United States and maintains checking and savings accounts for millions of consumers nationwide, including through online and mobile banking. The lawsuit alleges that scammers are able to steal tens of thousands of dollars from Citi customers because the bank does not implement strong data security and anti-breach practices. As a result of Citi&rsquo;s lax security protocols and procedures, ineffective monitoring systems, and failure to respond in real-time and properly investigate fraud claims, New Yorkers have lost millions to scammers. Customers have lost their life savings, their children&rsquo;s college funds, or even money needed to support their day-to-day lives as a result of Citi&rsquo;s illegal and deceptive acts and practices.</p>
<p>One New Yorker had $40,000 stolen from her retirement savings account. In October 2021, the customer received a text message that appeared to be from Citi instructing her to log onto a website or call her local branch. The customer clicked the link in the message but did not provide additional information as requested in the text message. Afterwards, the customer called her local branch to report the suspicious activity but was told not to worry about it. Three days later, the customer discovered that a scammer changed her banking password, enrolled in online wire transfers, transferred $70,000 from her savings to her checking account, and then electronically executed a $40,000 wire transfer, none of which was consistent with her past account activity. For weeks, the customer continued to contact the bank and submit affidavits, but in the end, she was told that her claim for fraud was denied.</p>
<p>Another New Yorker had $35,000 stolen from her account. She was reviewing her online account and found a message that her account had been suspended and was instructed to call a phone number. She called the number provided and a scammer told her that he would send her Citi codes to verify recent suspicious activity. The scammer then transferred all of the money in the customer&rsquo;s three savings accounts into her checking account, changed her online passwords, and attempted a $35,000 wire transfer. Citi attempted to verify the wire transfer by calling the customer, but she was working and did not see the call at the time. Less than an hour later, the scammer attempted another $35,000 wire transfer, which Citi approved without ever having made direct contact with the customer. She lost nearly everything she had saved, and Citi refused to reimburse her.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Insufficient Online Banking Security</span></p>
<p>The OAG found that Citi&rsquo;s systems do not respond effectively to red flags, such as scammers who are using unrecognized devices, are accessing accounts from new locations, or are changing banking passwords or usernames. Additionally, Citi systems do not flag and stop efforts to transfer funds from multiple accounts into a single account and then send tens of thousands of dollars out the door in minutes. Citi also does not automatically initiate investigations or report fraudulent activity to police or law enforcement authorities when consumers first report it to Citi.</p>
<p>In addition, Citi fails to appropriately respond to notifications of fraud by its customers. When victims contact the bank to report fraud, Citi leaves them on lengthy telephone holds, allowing scammers to continue their fraud. Additionally, Citi does not implement sufficient measures to protect consumers from future unauthorized transactions until they visit a local branch. Citi representatives falsely told consumers that their accounts were secure and often promised that their money would be returned, although the bank did not take immediate steps to recover stolen funds. Citi also falsely tells consumers that they need to visit local branches and execute special affidavits detailing the scams that led to their losses &mdash; information Citi then used to blame consumers and deny their claims.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attorney General James alleges that because Citi makes wire transfers available to consumers online and through mobile banking apps, Citi must reimburse victims of fraud under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA), similar to when banks reimburse victims of electronic credit or debit card fraud. Under EFTA, banks such as Citi are required to reimburse their customers for money in their accounts that is lost or stolen through unauthorized electronic payments. However, Citi illegally exploited a narrow exception in these laws to deny consumer claims for reimbursement, resulting in millions of dollars in losses for New York consumers. Through this lawsuit, Attorney General James is seeking to stop Citi&rsquo;s deceptive practices and to collect restitution for victims who were denied reimbursement in the last six years, penalties, and disgorgement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attorney General James encourages all consumers who have lost money to scammers who hacked into their online or mobile banking, whether the bank accounts were with Citi or any other bank, to report their experiences to&nbsp;<a href="https://formsnym.ag.ny.gov/OAGOnlineSubmissionForm/faces/OAGCFCHome;jsessionid=VDRYAmzfy5Vvu_Lafni57NWQjworpA60Z2Y7u5I7rBxBU8iVj-AN!513712777">OAG&rsquo;s Consumer Frauds Bureau</a>.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s lawsuit is the latest action by Attorney General James to hold big banks accountable. Last month, Attorney General James&nbsp;<a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2023/attorney-general-james-works-hold-big-banks-accountable-violating-state-laws">led a coalition of 20 attorneys general in submitting&nbsp;letters</a>&nbsp;to the federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau urging both agencies to ensure that national banks cooperate with investigations being conducted by state attorneys general. In April 2022, Attorney General James led a multistate coalition of attorneys general in calling on the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, U.S. Bank, and Wells Fargo to&nbsp;<a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2022/attorney-general-james-leads-multistate-coalition-calling-consumer-banks">eliminate all overdraft fees</a>&nbsp;on consumer bank accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This matter is being handled by Assistant Attorney General Chris Filburn with the Consumer Frauds and Protection Bureau. The Consumer Frauds and Protection Bureau is led by Bureau Chief Jane Azia and Deputy Bureau Chief Laura Levine, and is a part of the Division of Economic Justice, which is overseen by Chief Deputy Attorney General Chris D&rsquo;Angelo and First Deputy Attorney General Jennifer Levy.</p>

<div> EC, ISDA, GFMA, FIA, BMR <br />
The joint response by ISDA, GFMA, and FIA to the European Commission's Call for Feedback on the BMR highlights the recognition of problems caused by the current drafting of the Benchmarks Regulation, supports the aim of establishing a sustainable third-country regime, and overall considers the proposal to result in a more proportionate and protective regime for users and administrators of benchmarks. <br /><br />Summary: The associations welcome the EC's recognition of the problems caused by the current drafting of the Benchmarks Regulation, strongly support the aim of establishing a sustainable third-country regime, and overall consider that the proposal will result in a more proportionate regime for users and administrators of benchmarks. <div>
<p><span>On Tuesday 23rd January 2024, ISDA submitted a joint response to the European Commission&rsquo;s (EC) Call for Feedback on the review of the scope and regime for non-EU benchmarks alongside GFMA and FIA. The response sets out the Associations&rsquo; comments on the EC&rsquo;s proposal, along with potential draft amendments where possible, as well as some additional revisions that were considered to also support the EC&rsquo;s aims. In summary, the Associations welcome the EC&rsquo;s recognition of the problems caused by the current drafting of the Benchmarks Regulation (BMR), and the careful thought and consideration that has been given to addressing them. They strongly support the aim of establishing a third-country regime that is sustainable in the long term once the current transitional regime expires, and overall consider that the proposal will result in a more proportionate regime for users and administrators of benchmarks, that still provides vital protections.</span></p>

<div> Committee Meeting, Rare Earth Minerals, Derivatives Market, Basel III, Energy Infrastructure<br />
Summary:<br />
The Energy and Environmental Markets Advisory Committee will hold a public meeting in Colorado to discuss the role of rare earth minerals in energy transition, the impact of Basel III proposals on derivatives markets, and updates on traditional energy infrastructure. Members of the public can attend in person or virtually and submit written statements. <div>
<p>CFTC Commissioner Summer K. Mersinger, sponsor of the Energy and Environmental Markets Advisory Committee (EEMAC), today announced the EEMAC will hold a public meeting from 9:00 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. (MST) on Tuesday, February 13 at the Colorado School of Mines in Golden, Colorado. Members of the public may also attend the meeting virtually or in person, if space permits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this meeting, the EEMAC will explore the role of rare earth minerals in transitional energy and electrification, including the potential development of derivatives products to offer price discovery and hedging opportunities in these markets. Additionally, a presentation and discussion on the federal prudential financial regulators proposed rules implementing Basel III and the implications for and impact on the derivatives market.&nbsp;Finally, the two EEMAC subcommittees will offer an update on their continued work related to traditional energy infrastructure and metals markets.</p>
<p>The meeting agenda may change to accommodate other EEMAC priorities. A formal agenda for this meeting is forthcoming. For agenda updates and more information about this advisory committee, including its members, visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/About/CFTCCommittees/EnergyEnvironmentalMarketsAdvisory/emac_meetings.html">EEMAC</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am excited to explore the lesser known world of rare minerals and how these unique commodities are central to the transition from thermal energy to more renewable forms of energy.&rdquo; said Commissioner Mersinger. &ldquo;It is important to investigate the role dynamic, robust derivatives markets could play in these markets. I am equally interested in hearing more about the potential impacts of the Basel III proposals on the derivatives markets, specifically around impacts on our energy derivatives markets and the resulting implications for household energy costs across the U.S.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Members of the public may watch a live webcast or listen to the meeting via conference call using a domestic or international number to connect to a live, listen-only audio feed.

<title>ESMA Steps Up Its Monitoring Of EU Alternative Investment Funds And Sees Potential Risks In Funds Exposed To Leverage And Liquidity Mismatches</title>

<div> regulator, supervisor, ESMA, real estate funds, liquidity mismatches
Summary:<br /><br />The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) published a report highlighting the risks posed by real estate funds, particularly in the context of declining volumes and falling prices. The report also addressed risks posed by leveraged alternative investment funds (AIFs) and outlined measures taken by authorities to address these risks. ESMA will continue to work with National Competent Authorities (NCAs) to meet its financial stability objective. <div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, today published a<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-01/ESMA50-524821-3095_EU_Alternative_Investment_Funds_2023.pdf">&nbsp;report on the EU alternative investment funds (AIFs)&rsquo; market</a>&nbsp;and an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-01/ESMA60-1389274163-2572_TRV_article_-_Assessing_risks_posed_by_leveraged_AIFs_in_the_EU.pdf">article on the risks posed by leveraged AIFs in the EU</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify">ESMA confirms the risks posed by real estate (RE) funds, in a context of declining volumes of transactions and falling prices in several jurisdictions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify">Existing liquidity mismatches in AIFs are particularly heightened by the high share of open-ended RE funds, some of which offer daily liquidity. This vulnerability could be systemically relevant in jurisdictions where RE funds own a large share of the RE market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify">Looking at the full sector and specifically at the risks posed by leveraged AIFs, ESMA finds that:&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>the size of the sector declined slightly (-3%) to EUR 6.8tn in 2022 and AIFs account for 36% of the EU fund industry,&nbsp;</li>
<li>the fall in value was mainly driven by valuation losses for funds exposed to bonds and equities amid adverse market developments in 2022,&nbsp;</li>
<li>RE funds face multiple risks related to leverage, market footprint, valuation discrepancies and liquidity mismatches&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>leverage for hedge funds remains very high, and this may pose a risk of market impact. However, most of them also dispose of large levels of cash to address potential margin calls, which limits the risk of fire sales,&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>NCAs have reported risks posed by the Liability-Driven Investment (LDI) funds, which gain leveraged exposures to the UK government bond market. Risks have remained elevated, and the limits set after the severe stress experienced in September 2022 remain appropriate.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</div>
<br />
<div>
<p>In light of these findings, ESMA reports on the measure taken by authorities to address the risks identified, and will continue to work with the NCAs to meet ESMA&rsquo;s financial stability objective.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Background</span></h4>
</div>
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify">The two documents contribute to ESMA&rsquo;s financial stability objective. They are part of ESMA&rsquo;s monitoring framework on AIFs, including market development and key risk metrics, such as leverage and liquidity. They foster a common supervisory approach of the data reported under AIFMD between ESMA and the NCAs.</p>

Our fiscal results not only highlight the robustness of our operational framework but also underscore the significant strides we are making in transforming our business, exploring new horizons, and expediting the advancement of UAE capital markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="paragraph">He continued, "DFM's state-of-the-art infrastructure, market initiatives, and our drive to innovate and evolve, positions us strategically for continuous growth, solidifying Dubai&rsquo;s status as a global epicenter for financial activities.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="paragraph"><b>Elevating the IPO Landscape</b></p>
<p class="paragraph">In 2023, DFM solidified its status as a premier market for IPOs, boasting two highly successful offerings from Dubai Taxi Company and Al Ansari Financial Services, the first family &ndash; owned company. This achievement propelled DFM to the forefront of the MENA markets, establishing itself as the benchmark for index performance. The two offerings raised AED 1.97 billion in 2023, marking an outstanding achievement. The overwhelming investor demand led to an oversubscribed value of AED 163 billion, underscoring the market&rsquo;s attraction and resilience.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Beyond listing successes, 2023 witnessed significant milestones for DFM. The success of the MENA IPO Summit and launch of the IPO Accelerator Program marked pivotal moments in DFM&rsquo;s journey as one of the leading global exchanges, aligning the entire IPO value chain and providing invaluable insights into the intricate IPO process.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><b>Sustainable Financing Initiatives</b></p>
<p>Responsible financing remained a key focus for DFM this year as it ventured into sustainable financing initiatives, launching the Carbon Credit Trading Pilot program at COP28. This initiative aims to propel issuers toward achieving the 2050 sustainability goals, showcasing DFM&rsquo;s commitment to driving positive environmental impact through innovative programs.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><b>Market Capitalization Growth</b></p>
<p class="paragraph">DFM experienced significant market capitalization growth, rising from AED 582 billion in the end of 2022 to AED 688 billion in the same period of 2023. The sector distribution of DFM&rsquo;s market capitalization is closely aligned to reflect Dubai&rsquo;s GDP mix with Financials at 41%, Utilities at 22%, Real Estate at 17%, Industrials at 15%, and Communication Services at 3.4%, while other sectors like Consumer Staples contributed to the remainder. DFM concluded the year with a robust trading value increase of 12% to AED 101 billion compared to 2022. The DFM General Index (DFMGI) advanced by 21.7%, marking a positive trajectory outperforming major global markets.</p>
<p>DFM introduced the futures contracts on its General Index (DFMGI), featuring the market's most liquid and significant companies. Trading futures allows investors to tap into one of the world's top-performing indices, fostering diversification and hedging opportunities for both retail and institutional investors, enhancing market depth and liquidity.<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>DFM launched the Omnibus Accounts structure, a strategic initiative designed for holding securities. This move functions as a gateway, enabling international investors to access variety of investment opportunities and enhancing their engagement with DFM&rsquo;s diversified portfolio.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, in collaboration with xCube, DFM has taken steps to enhance market accessibility by introducing a digital account opening platform. This innovative solution offers seamless accessibility, straightforward IPO subscription, and advanced tools for real-time market monitoring, providing investors with an efficient and streamlined investment journey.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><b>Thriving Investor Community</b></p>
<p>In 2023, against the backdrop of the increasing interest of international investors in Dubai's capital markets, DFM placed significant focus on investor engagements to reinforce our standing as a leading global exchange. DFM successfully executed four international investor roadshows spanning across prominent financial hubs such as London, Singapore, and two editions in New York, which garnered widespread participation and facilitated numerous meetings with esteemed global institutional investors and funds. Notably, the most recent New York roadshow, held in November 2023, concluded with an impressive tally of 82 one-to-one meetings involving senior representatives from 45 international funds. Such collaborative forums provide invaluable insights, contributing directly to increased investor participation on the exchange.</p>
<p>Foreign investors maintained a strong presence, contributing to 47% of DFM&rsquo;s trading value with net purchases totaling AED 5.1 billion. Their market capitalization share stood at 20% at the close of the year. Additionally, institutional investors accounted for 58% of the trading value. DFM&rsquo;s success story continued with an impressive influx of 62,676 new investors, including 73% of which were foreign investors, expanding the current investor base, which includes over a million individuals from over 200 nationalities, serves as a testament to the success of DFM&rsquo;s digital onboarding journey.</p>

<title>Statement On The Denial Of A Rulemaking Petition Regarding The Commission’s No-Admit/No-Deny Policy, SEC Chair Gary Gensler, Jan. 30, 2024</title>

<div> denied, Petition, Rulemaking, no-admit/no-deny policy, settlement
<br />
The Commission denied a Petition for Rulemaking to amend the no-admit/no-deny policy, citing its importance in avoiding false impressions of guilt. Settlements are significant for both the SEC and defendants, and altering the policy would diminish the impact of enforcement settlements and undermine the value provided by public recitation of the facts. The Commission's discretion in regulatory agenda is crucial.
<br /><br />Summary: The Commission denied a Petition for Rulemaking to amend the no-admit/no-deny policy, citing its importance in avoiding false impressions of guilt. Settlements are significant for both the SEC and defendants, and altering the policy would diminish the impact of enforcement settlements and undermine the value provided by public recitation of the facts. The Commission's discretion in regulatory agenda is crucial. <div>
<p>Today, the Commission denied a Petition for Rulemaking<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-denial-rulemaking-petition-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;to amend Rule 202.5(e), more commonly known as the Commission&rsquo;s no-admit/no-deny policy. I was pleased to support the Commission&rsquo;s decision.</p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s no admit/no deny policy was adopted in 1972. As the Commission said at the time: &ldquo;The Commission has adopted the policy that in any civil lawsuit brought by it or in any administrative proceeding of an accusatory nature pending before it, it is important to avoid creating, or permitting to be created, an impression that a decree is being entered or a sanction imposed, when the conduct alleged did not, in fact, occur.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-denial-rulemaking-petition-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>As the Commission under then-Chair Bill Casey said at the time of the adoption: &ldquo;a refusal to admit the allegations is equivalent to a denial, unless the defendant or respondent states that he neither admits nor denies the allegations.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-denial-rulemaking-petition-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Entering into a settlement is a consequential choice for both the SEC and the defendant. The Commission, in agreeing to settle a case, is relinquishing the opportunity to present the case in court. The defendant, on the other hand, relinquishes the right to defend the case in court, in the press, and in the eyes of the public. Both parties are agreeing to a set of terms based upon this 1972 policy.</p>
<p>More than 50 years on, I think this policy has served the public and the Commission well. I believe that amending this policy in the manner proposed by the Petitioner would alter the impact of enforcement settlements if defendants could deny any wrongdoing in the court of public opinion and dismiss sanctions as the cost of doing business without the Commission being able to revive its ability to have its day in court.</p>
<p>Further, an essential component of settlements is the public recitation of the facts. It informs the market as to what conduct is violative of the securities laws. It alerts investors that the Commission seeks to deter that conduct, and it helps other market participants comply with the law. A settlement that allows the denial of wrongdoing undermines the value provided by the recitation of the facts, and it muddies the message to the public.</p>
<p>Finally, an important part of the Commission&rsquo;s responsibility is determining how best to deploy the resources that Congress entrusts to us. We thoughtfully consider the timing and priorities of our regulatory agenda and how to best utilize our talented and hardworking staff. Discretion to determine the priorities of our regulatory agenda, especially with respect to discretionary rulemaking like that requested by the Petitioner, is a critical element of our ability to faithfully execute Congress&rsquo;s mandate. It is important that the Commission maintain discretion to direct focus to whichever parts of the capital markets need updated regulation.</p>

<title>The UK Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) Fines HSBC £57,417,500 For Failures In Deposit Protection Identification And Notification</title>

<div> Keywords: HSBC, PRA, fine, depositor protection failings, enforcement policies

Summary: 
- The PRA fined HSBC Bank plc and HSBC UK Bank plc £57,417,500 for historic depositor protection failings.
- The failings included inaccurately identifying deposits eligible for FSCS protection, breaching Fundamental Rules and Depositor Protection Rules, and lack of cooperation with the PRA.
- The Firms' cooperation and early admission of breaches resulted in a 45% reduction in the fine.
- The Bank of England and the PRA published revised enforcement policies to speed up investigations and incentivize early admissions.
- Both HBUK and HBEU were found to have breached multiple rules and procedures, leading to the second largest fine imposed by the PRA. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><section class="page-section">
<p>The PRA has fined&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk156809611"></a>HSBC Bank plc (<strong>HBEU</strong>) and HSBC UK Bank plc (<strong>HBUK</strong>) (together, the<strong>&nbsp;Firms</strong>) &pound;57,417,500 for historic depositor protection failings arising from the Firms&rsquo; failures over many years to properly implement the requirements set out in the Depositor Protection Rules. These included the failure to accurately identify deposits that were eligible for Financial Services Compensation Scheme (<strong>FSCS</strong>) protection. The failings occurred for HBEU between 2015 and 2022, and for HBUK between 2018 and 2021. This fine, the second highest imposed by the PRA, reflects the seriousness of the failings.</p>
<h3>HSBC Fine</h3>
<p>The Depositor Protection Rules require firms to put in place adequate systems and controls, and governance, to ensure the integrity of critical information which the FSCS relies upon to make prompt payments to depositors in the event of a firm failure. HBEU&rsquo;s depositor protection failings were so significant the PRA determined that it had materially undermined the firm&rsquo;s readiness for resolution.</p>
<p>HBEU also failed to be duly open and cooperative with the PRA in not alerting the PRA over an approximately 15-month period about problems identified in the incorrect marking of accounts as &ldquo;eligible&rdquo; for FSCS protection. This was clearly information which the PRA would expect firms to share fully and in a timely way.</p>
<p>This meant the Firms breached Fundamental Rules 2 and 6, as well as Depositor Protection Rules 11, 12 and 14. HBEU was also found to have breached Depositor Protection Rule 50, and Fundamental Rules 7 and 8. This is the first PRA enforcement action in relation to Fundamental Rule 8, which states that firm must prepare for resolution so, if the need arises, it can be resolved in an orderly manner with a minimum disruption of critical services.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Woods, Deputy Governor for Prudential Regulation and Chief Executive Officer of the PRA, said:</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;The serious failings in this case go to the heart of the PRA&rsquo;s safety and soundness objective. It is vital that all banks comply fully with our requirements around preparedness for resolution. HBEU fell far short of its obligations in this area, and failed to disclose its failings to us in a timely manner. These failures led to today&rsquo;s action, including the significant fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Firms&rsquo; failings included:</p>
<ul>
<li>The failure to assign clear ownership for the processes required under the Depositor Protection Rules; and</li>
<li>The failure to ensure that a senior manager, under the Senior Managers and Certification Regime, was allocated responsibility for these processes and the integrity of the information required under the Depositor Protection Rules.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>HBEU&rsquo;s failings further included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incorrectly marking 99% of its eligible beneficiary deposits as &lsquo;ineligible&rsquo; for FSCS protection;</li>
<li>Providing an incorrect attestation to the PRA confirming its systems satisfied certain requirements of the Depositor Protection Rules; and</li>
<li>Failing to produce finalised versions of annual reports required to be signed by its board of directors that confirmed compliance with the requirements of the Depositor Protection Rules for multiple years.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>The Firms&rsquo; cooperation throughout the investigation, including the early admission of certain rule breaches, resulted in a 15% reduction to the penalty. The Firms agreed to resolve the matter and therefore qualified for a further 30% reduction in the fine. Without these reductions, the fine imposed by the PRA would have been &pound;96.5m. The PRA does not consider that the Firms&rsquo; breaches were deliberate or reckless.</p>
<h3>The Bank of England publishes new enforcement policies</h3>
<p>Following a period of consultation, the Bank of England (<strong>Bank</strong>) and the PRA today have also published Policy Statement PS1/24, which sets out the revised approach to enforcement for both PRA firms and financial market infrastructure firms. This includes revisions to the procedures of the Bank&rsquo;s Enforcement Decision Making Committee (<strong>EDMC</strong>). The revised policies set out a new path for early cooperation and greater incentives for early admissions with the aim of speeding up investigations in appropriate cases. PS1/24 further sets out the PRA&rsquo;s policies and procedures for making supervisory and non-enforcement statutory notice decisions. Today&rsquo;s fine imposed by the PRA on HBEU and HBUK was under the PRA&rsquo;s pre-existing penalty policy.</p>
<p>The Bank expects to consult on further amendments to its enforcement policies in 2024, reflecting the additional powers granted under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2023.</p>

<title>Unsettling Silence: Dissent From Denial Of Request For Rulemaking To Amend 17 C.F.R. § 202.5(e), SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, Jan. 30, 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: Commission, settlement, denial, First Amendment, enforcement actions

Summary:<br />
- The Commission's gag rule prevents individuals from criticizing government actions during settlements, raising First Amendment concerns.
- The necessity and justification for the gag rule are questionable as it lacks firm footing in terms of protecting the Commission's reputation.
- The policy results in content-specific and permanent restraints on speech, potentially shielding the Commission's allegations from legitimate criticism.
- The requirement that defendants must either admit wrongdoing or promise not to deny the allegations as a condition of settlement has not been widely adopted by federal agencies, raising concerns about fairness and due process.
- The mandatory nature of the no-deny clause presents defendants with no real choice, undermining their constitutional rights.
- The ambiguity in the language of the no-deny clause creates uncertainty about what constitutes a prohibited action or statement, further restricting free speech. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>I dissent from the Commission&rsquo;s denial of a petition to amend Rule 202.5(e), our so-called gag rule.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp; This&nbsp;<i>de facto</i>&nbsp;rule follows from the Commission&rsquo;s enforcement of its policy, adopted in 1972, that it will not &ldquo;permit a defendant or respondent to consent to a judgment or order that imposes a sanction while denying the allegations in the complaint or order for proceedings.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp; In that same policy, the Commission articulated its belief &ldquo;that a refusal to admit the allegations is equivalent to a denial, unless the defendant or respondent states that he neither admits nor denies the allegations.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp; These two strands&mdash;the refusal to settle with persons who deny the allegations and the belief that refusing to admit is a denial&mdash;converge in the requirement that to settle with the Commission, a person must either (1) admit the allegations underlying the Commission&rsquo;s enforcement action or (2) state that she neither admits nor denies the allegations.</p>
<p>To compel compliance with the no-deny prong of the policy, the Commission requires settling defendants to agree that they &ldquo;will not take any action or make or permit to be made any public statement denying, directly or indirectly, any allegation in the complaint or creating the impression that the complaint is without factual basis&rdquo; and also &ldquo;will not make or permit to be made any public statement to the effect that Defendant does not admit the allegations of the complaint, or that this Consent contains no admission of the allegations, without also stating that Defendant does not deny the allegations.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp; The Commission further requires the settling defendant to &ldquo;withdraw[] any papers filed in this action to the extent that they deny any allegations in the complaint.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp; Finally, the Commission&rsquo;s mandatory language states that &ldquo;[i]f Defendant breaches this agreement, the Commission may petition the Court to vacate the Final Judgment and restore this action to its active docket.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp; The net result is that the settling defendant, for the action to stay settled, must agree both to rescind her past in-court statements contesting the truth of the Commission&rsquo;s allegations and promise never again to contest the truth of the Commission&rsquo;s allegations herself, or even permit others to contest the allegations.</p>
<p>In October 2018, the New Civil Liberties Alliance (NCLA) asked us to revise Rule 202.5(c) to read as follows:</p>
<p>The Commission has adopted the policy that in any civil lawsuit brought by it or in any administrative proceeding of an accusatory nature pending before it, a defendant or respondent may consent to a judgment or order in which he admits, denies, or states that he neither admits nor denies the allegations in the complaint or order for proceedings.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>I agree with the petitioner that this issue warrants a spot on our rulemaking agenda.&nbsp; One thing I love about this country is that Americans can and often do criticize their government. &nbsp;Without fearing reprisal, a person can condemn specific government actions, broad government policies, or the officials who carry out those actions and make those policies. &nbsp;This freedom to speak against the government and government officials is essential in a free society committed to the preeminence of the people. &nbsp;Of course, some criticisms of government policies, practices, or personnel may be baseless, but the American public, not government censors, should be the arbiters of validity. &nbsp;Our prohibition on denials prevents the American public from ever hearing criticisms that might otherwise be lodged against the government, let alone assessing their credibility.&nbsp; The policy of denying defendants the right to criticize publicly a settlement after it is signed is unnecessary, undermines regulatory integrity, and raises First Amendment concerns.</p>
<h2>I.</h2>
<p>When the Commission adopted the policy in 1972, it included a brief statement explaining why it needed the policy: &ldquo;it is important to avoid creating, or permitting to be created, an impression that a decree is being entered or a sanction imposed, when the conduct alleged did not, in fact, occur.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp; This concern seems largely theoretical.&nbsp; Even if the concern is real, the imprudent policy adopted in November 1972 is not the right way to protect the Commission&rsquo;s reputation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Commission devoted significant resources to evaluating its enforcement program in 1972.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp; In January 1972, Chairman William Casey created a three-member committee to &ldquo;examine the SEC&rsquo;s enforcement policy and practices, engage in frequent dialogue with the members of the Commission and with our staff, seek and sift the suggestions of the bar and make recommendations to the Commission for worthwhile improvements to our time-honored ways.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp; The June 1, 1972 Report of the Advisory Committee on Enforcement Policies and Practices&mdash;now commonly referred to as the Wells Report&mdash;included a lengthy discussion about the settlement of Commission enforcement actions, and made several recommendations related to the settlement process.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp; The Commission had decades of experience settling cases, through both settlements on a no-admit/no-deny basis and settlements allowing defendants to deny wrongdoing.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to some of these settlements, defendants issued flat denials of wrongdoing.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp; But neither the Wells Report nor Chairman Casey&rsquo;s lengthy ruminations on it discuss problems arising from settling defendants later denying the factual basis of the Commission&rsquo;s case.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp; Given the broad remit of the Committee and its public comment process,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;if problematic denials were common, the Committee and Commission would have heard about them.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>&nbsp; In the intervening years, when defendants have made denials contrary to the policy,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>&nbsp;such denials do not seem to have undermined the Commission&rsquo;s enforcement program. &nbsp;The absence of a public record specific to the adoption of the policy, the conclusory explanation of its necessity, and the absence of actual evidence of a problem weigh in favor of reexamining the policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The requirement that defendants must either admit or at least promise not to deny the government&rsquo;s allegations of wrongdoing as a condition of settlement has not been widely adopted by federal agencies.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a>&nbsp; Some agencies even explicitly allow settling defendants to deny the allegations of wrongdoing.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>&nbsp; As the Federal Trade Commission noted when approving one such settlement in 2012, it was confident in the work of its staff:</p>
<p>it is the evidentiary record developed by FTC staff during the course of its investigation, not any ensuing settlement agreement, that forms the basis for the action by Commission.&nbsp; A respondent&rsquo;s denial of liability in a consent agreement does not diminish staff&rsquo;s extensive investigation or the ability of the Commission to find a reasonable basis to finalize a settlement or to enforce an order that results from settlement negotiations.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></p>
<p>The FTC&rsquo;s Consent Order Procedures explicitly allow settlement agreements to &ldquo;state that the signing thereof is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by any party that the law has been violated as alleged in the complaint.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our staff&rsquo;s investigative work likewise would stand on its own even if we permitted defendant denials.</p>
<h2>II.</h2>
<p>Even apart from the scant factual basis for the Commission&rsquo;s given reason for needing the no-deny policy, it should be reexamined because a regulatory policy that prevents people from speaking against government action necessarily raises First Amendment concerns. &nbsp;Prohibiting a person from taking &ldquo;any action to make . . . any public statement that the complaint is without factual basis&rdquo; is a plain prior restraint on speech.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a>&nbsp; Prohibiting that same person from &ldquo;permit[ting] to be made any public statement that the complaint is without factual basis&rdquo; only exacerbates the problem by imposing on the defendant an obligation to restrain speech by others.&nbsp; Moreover, this content-specific and permanent restraint on speech effectively shields the Commission&rsquo;s allegations from criticism: as long as you live, you are bound not only to say nothing that the Commission believes &ldquo;directly or indirectly&rdquo; denies the complaint's allegations, but you also must never say anything that even &ldquo;create[s] the impression&rdquo; of a denial.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the obvious First Amendment ramifications of the no-deny policy, it is unsurprising that a court recently characterized the Commission&rsquo;s use of the no-denial provision as &ldquo;at a minimum . . . inconsistent with the spirit of the First Amendment and our Nation&rsquo;s time-honored tradition of protecting free expression.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a>&nbsp; The court continued by observing that:</p>
<p>[H]ere, the Provision is used by an agency of the federal government to shield itself from public view. This may inflict precisely the kind of societal harm the Founders adopted the First Amendment to protect against . . . . &nbsp;The upshot: so long as a defendant says what the SEC wants to hear (or says nothing at all), he does not violate the No-Admit-No-Deny Provision. This is quintessential viewpoint discrimination.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a></p>
<p>In its letter denying the NCLA&rsquo;s rulemaking petition, the Commission sidesteps First Amendment concerns. &nbsp;The Commission explains that &ldquo;a defendant can waive constitutional rights as part of a civil settlement.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a>&nbsp; In the Commission&rsquo;s telling, &ldquo;[a]s part of the settlement process, the Commission and a defendant negotiate terms,&rdquo; and &ldquo;if either party disagrees with terms that the other party views as necessary, [it] can decline to settle, and the Commission must bear its burdens of proof and persuasion in court.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission even suggests that&nbsp;<i>it</i>&nbsp;is the party making a sacrifice in settling instead of litigating because it is &ldquo;thereby forgoing its ability to prove its case in court.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a>&nbsp; Never mind that forgoing its day in court yields great benefits for the Commission.&nbsp; When it settles, the Commission does not need to prove the allegations in court&mdash;which is expensive, time-consuming, and difficult&mdash;and it gets a benefit it could never obtain through litigation&mdash;the permanent silence of the defendant.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s questionable claim that it is the party making significant concessions is not the most concerning aspect of the Commission&rsquo;s reasoning.&nbsp; That distinction goes to its casual assumption that defending litigation with the Commission is just like defending against any other plaintiff in a civil action.&nbsp; One suspects that defendants in Commission enforcement actions might view the matter differently.&nbsp; For most individuals, and even for many well-resourced corporate defendants, the time, expense, and difficulty of litigating against the federal government makes settling the only economically viable option to resolve Commission enforcement actions. &nbsp;Commission investigations preceding the settlement negotiations are themselves long and costly.&nbsp; Retaining counsel to respond to the Commission&rsquo;s document requests and subpoenas, to represent witnesses during sworn testimony, and to prepare and submit a response to a Wells notice (which allows defendants to respond to charges the staff is planning to recommend to the Commission) consumes enormous financial resources.&nbsp; Add to that monetary cost, the intangible yet often even more onerous emotional, physical, and relational tolls of litigation, and it is unremarkable that nearly all defendants in Commission actions settle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The inevitable mismatch between the Commission and most defendants in its enforcement actions carries through to the settlement process.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a>&nbsp; Even when the disparities in bargaining power between the Commission and the defendant are less pronounced, the no-deny clause is a mandatory, non-negotiable term.&nbsp; The Commission admits as much in its denial letter: &ldquo;[t]he policy binds the Enforcement staff&rdquo; and the Commission &ldquo;will not agree to a settlement . . . unless the defendant agrees not to publicly deny the allegations in the complaint.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a>&nbsp; As one judge recently put it, the mandatory nature of the no-deny policy presents defendants with no real choice; it demands: &ldquo;If you want to settle, . . . &lsquo;Hold your tongue, and don&rsquo;t say anything truthful&mdash;ever&rsquo;&mdash;or get bankrupted by having to continue litigating with the SEC.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a></p>
<p>The demand by the government that a defendant waive a fundamental constitutional right as a condition of settlement ought to be supported by a compelling rationale. &nbsp;Yet, as discussed above, the Commission&rsquo;s rationale of record&mdash;that the no-deny policy is necessary to &ldquo;avoid creating, or permitting to be created, an impression that a decree is being entered or a sanction imposed, when the conduct alleged did not, in fact occur&rdquo;&mdash;lacks firm footing.&nbsp; It would look bad if the SEC&rsquo;s settlements were shown to be baseless, unfairly negotiated, or legally flawed. The most logical solution to that concern, however, is to make sure that settlements are rooted in fact, are fairly negotiated, and are legally sound.&nbsp; Employing superior bargaining power to extract an agreement that defendants agree not to denigrate the settlement is a suboptimal solution.</p>
<p>In the end, far from shoring up the Commission&rsquo;s integrity, the reliance on these no-denial conditions undermines it. More than a decade ago, a court aptly explained the problematic perceptions that flow from the Commission&rsquo;s practice of settling without admissions and prohibiting denials:</p>
<p>[H]ere an agency of the United States is saying, in effect, &ldquo;Although we claim that these defendants have done terrible things, they refuse to admit it and we do not propose to prove it, but will simply resort to gagging their right to deny it. &rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a></p>
<p>Why should the public put much weight on allegations so flimsy that they need the protection of a contractual obligation not to deny them? &nbsp;Stated differently, &ldquo;What is the SEC so afraid of?&nbsp; Any criticism, apparently&mdash;or, rather, anything that may even &lsquo;create the impression&rsquo; of criticism&mdash;of that government agency.<a name="_Hlk157406302">&rdquo;</a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The public cannot be sure what to believe if the government actively seeks to squelch contrary voices. &nbsp;As the FTC has observed, a government regulator that is confident in its investigative work, procedural practices, and legal analysis does not need to demand silence on the part of settling defendants.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a>&nbsp; Other commentators have pointed out that &ldquo;[d]efendants who have been through an agency&rsquo;s enforcement process are often the most informed and in the best position to raise red flags about that process,&rdquo; so, by silencing them, &ldquo;the agencies insulate themselves from criticism and the public scrutiny that accountability demands.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowing people to talk freely about their experiences with the Commission would aid us in carrying out our mission.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a></p>
<h2>III.</h2>
<p>Because no-admit/no-deny settlements are the most common resolution of SEC enforcement actions, the rule at issue affects countless potential speakers. &nbsp;Given that all of these silenced speakers have been on the wrong end of an enforcement action, we can assume that some might have negative things&mdash;whether accurate or not&mdash;to say about the government. &nbsp;The gravity of silencing this subset of people weighs heavily on me. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Defenders of our policy might take comfort in the scope of the policy&mdash;after all, you can say bad things about the agency, just not about your settlement.&nbsp; To the contrary, the Commission&rsquo;s mandatory language is so ambiguous as to only aggravate my concerns. &nbsp;Defendants must agree that they will not &ldquo;indirectly&rdquo; deny &ldquo;any allegation in the complaint.&rdquo;&nbsp; What is an &ldquo;indirect&rdquo; denial?&nbsp; Defendants must also agree not to &ldquo;take any action&rdquo; that &ldquo;create[s] the impression that the complaint is without factual basis.&rdquo;&nbsp; What is an action that &ldquo;create[s] the impression&rdquo; that the complaint lacks a factual basis?&nbsp; A defendant looking at this language is not going to have any idea where it ends.&nbsp; Could she say that &ldquo;The Commission&rsquo;s enforcement process is a joke.&nbsp; Nobody should trust it to produce just results.&rdquo;? &nbsp;What if she stands outside the Commission&rsquo;s headquarters with a pile of salt, a copy of the complaint, and a sign that states &ldquo;Take these together.&rdquo; &nbsp;What if she places on a billboard the message &ldquo;SEC = Seriously Erroneous Complaints&rdquo;?&nbsp; In either case, has she &ldquo;create[d] the impression that the complaint is without factual basis&rdquo;?&nbsp; Can a defendant tell a post-settlement joke: &ldquo;How many SEC Commissioners does it take to screw in a lightbulb? &nbsp;Zero, because they prefer to let the truth languish in the dark.&rdquo;? &nbsp;What if she publishes a book with additional facts that were not included in the complaint, and those facts cast the entire case in an entirely different light?&nbsp; Has she then &ldquo;create[d] the impression&rdquo; that the complaint lacked a factual basis?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s requirement that a defendant agree not to &ldquo;permit&rdquo; denials of the allegations in the complaint is equally problematic.&nbsp; This language suggests that defendants have an affirmative obligation to stop other people from saying things that might cast doubt on the complaint&rsquo;s allegations.&nbsp; Must a settling defendant stop her husband from posting on social media his disagreement with the charges in his wife&rsquo;s settlement with the Commission?&nbsp; Must a defendant require subsequent employers to link to the settlement in the otherwise flattering profiles they post on their websites?&nbsp; Probably not, but the mandatory language nevertheless is troublingly nebulous.&nbsp; To obtain Commission authorization to file an enforcement action in district court, the Division of Enforcement is required to submit to the Commission an action memorandum that &ldquo;provides a comprehensive explanation of the . . . factual and legal foundation&rdquo; for the recommended civil action.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Enforcement Manual, however, does not require that the Division include with the action memorandum a copy of the district court complaint.</p>
<p>The petitioner is correct that reconsideration of the rule is a pressing matter that belongs on the Commission&rsquo;s current notice-and-comment rulemaking agenda. &nbsp;Or, if my colleagues have concluded that our agenda is too packed with other projects, perhaps we can just drop the no-deny rule in the same unceremonious way we adopted it.</p>

<div> priorities, market structures, corporate governance, CCPs, ESG issues
Summary: 
The World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) has announced the 2024 priorities for the exchange and clearing industry. These include fostering better corporate governance, ensuring the stability of central clearing, leading on ESG issues, providing educational qualifications, and addressing new technologies such as crypto market design and AI. The WFE aims to advocate for these priorities and promote sustainable growth. <br /><br /> <div>
<p><span>The World Federation of Exchanges (WFE), the global industry group for exchanges and CCPs, today announces the 2024 priorities for the exchange and clearing industry.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>As the foundation of the financial system, regulated market infrastructure providers seek to engender the trust of all those who depend on neutral, responsible public markets. Each new year offers an opportunity to underscore this mandate and reaffirm this commitment.</span><br /><br /><span>In 2024, the WFE&rsquo;s priorities will focus on fostering efficient market structures that are resilient, robust, fair, transparent and stable in the midst of both uncertainty and innovation.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>The priorities:</span><br /><span>1. Fostering better corporate governance in the entire financial ecosystem. At present, scrutiny focuses largely on those entities that are already regulated and within legal parameters.</span><br /><br /><span>2.&nbsp;The CCPs&rsquo; reassurance promise. Fifteen years on from the biggest financial crisis in living memory, and four years after a global pandemic, central clearing remains the steadying influence in markets. The WFE&rsquo;s focus in 2024 will be on procyclicality, recovery &amp; resolution and transparency and proportionate capital rules.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>3. How market infrastructures can lead on ESG issues such as standardization, harmonization and reporting frameworks, as has been the case with the creation of the WFE Green Equities principles.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>4. WFE Education: As the WFE&rsquo;s&nbsp;</span><a href="https://world-exchanges.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=48ddcbc11eb58f141a51219ea&amp;id=1010433407&amp;e=979576350c" target="_blank">Market Infrastructure Certificate</a><span>&nbsp;continues to gather momentum, entering its second year, we&rsquo;ll focus on rolling out the educational qualifications that will be vital to the next generation of leaders.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>5. New technologies, including the evolution of crypto market design, as these new markets begin to grow closer to regulated exchange markets, and the role of AI. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>As the global association for the industry, the WFE unites its members as one voice to work towards achieving these priorities, underpinned by our four strategic pillars of advocacy, education, emerging markets and post-trade. The WFE, which represents more than 250 market infrastructures worldwide, will build on its policy and research work across all the priority areas, and will continue to develop industry consensus positions, best practice, standards and industry guidance, in addition to working on emerging trends.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>The WFE seeks to engage in, and promote, market development that leads to optimal outcomes in the future and fosters sustainable growth. Our longer-term work around understanding, defining and quantifying the economic and social role of exchanges and CCPs continues, so that we ensure the industry remains close to the issues that affect its stakeholders.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><strong>Nandini Sukumar, CEO at the WFE</strong><span>, said: &ldquo;The WFE Board has determined the key priorities and issues we will focus on this year. With the WFE&rsquo;s unique position and global view of market structures, our access to data and information, reinforced by our own analysis &amp; research, and the expertise we have built up through experience, we look forward to engaging with stakeholders in 2024 and championing the role of public markets and market-based finance.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>

<div> methodology, capacity calculation region, balancing energy, transmission system operators, National Regulatory Authorities
Summary:<br />On 17 January 2024, the National Regulatory Authorities of the Hansa region requested a 6-month extension from ACER to agree on the TSOs' proposed cross-zonal capacity calculation methodology for the balancing timeframe. The methodology concerns the rules for capacity calculation and is crucial for ensuring the stability of the electricity transmission system. ACER aims to reach a decision by mid-March. <div>
<p>On 17 January 2024, the National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) of the Hansa capacity calculation region requested a six-month extension from ACER to agree on the Transmission System Operators&rsquo; (TSOs&rsquo;) proposed cross-zonal capacity calculation methodology for the balancing timeframe in the Hansa region.</p>
<p>The Hansa region comprises 6 countries: Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, and Sweden.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is the methodology about?</span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

<title>SEC Charges Founder Of $1.7 Billion “HyperFund” Crypto Pyramid Scheme And Top Promoter with Fraud - Promoter Brenda Chunga (aka Bitcoin Beautee) Agrees To Settle Fraud And Unregistered Offering Charges</title>

<div> charged, fraudulent, pyramid scheme, crypto asset, investors
<br />
The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Xue Lee and Brenda Chunga for their involvement in a fraudulent crypto asset pyramid scheme known as HyperFund, which raised over $1.7 billion from investors. Lee and Chunga promoted membership packages, guaranteeing high returns, but the scheme collapsed in 2022, leaving investors unable to make withdrawals.
<br /><br />Summary: The SEC charged Xue Lee and Brenda Chunga for their involvement in a fraudulent crypto asset pyramid scheme, known as HyperFund, which raised over $1.7 billion. Lee and Chunga promoted membership packages, guaranteeing high returns, but the scheme collapsed in 2022, leaving investors unable to make withdrawals. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Xue Lee (aka Sam Lee) and Brenda Chunga (aka Bitcoin Beautee) for their involvement in a fraudulent crypto asset pyramid scheme known as HyperFund that raised more than $1.7 billion from investors worldwide.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, from June 2020 through early 2022, Lee and Chunga promoted HyperFund &ldquo;membership&rdquo; packages, which they claimed guaranteed investors high returns, including from HyperFund&rsquo;s supposed crypto asset mining operations and associations with a Fortune 500 company. As the complaint alleges, however, Lee and Chunga knew or were reckless in not knowing that HyperFund was a pyramid scheme and had no real source of revenue other than funds received from investors. In 2022, the HyperFund scheme collapsed and investors were no longer able to make withdrawals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As alleged in our complaint, Lee and Chunga attracted investors with the allure of profits from crypto asset mining, but the only thing that HyperFund mined was its investors&rsquo; pockets,&rdquo; said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;This case illustrates yet again how noncompliance in the crypto space facilitates schemes where promoters capitalize on the promise of easy money, without providing the detailed investor protection disclosures required by the registration provisions of the federal securities laws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in federal district court in the District of Maryland, charges Lee and Chunga with violating the anti-fraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, conduct-based injunctions preventing the defendants from participating in multi-level marketing or crypto asset offerings, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. Chunga agreed to settle the charges, to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the charged provisions and certain other activity, and to pay disgorgement and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a future date. The settlement is subject to court approval. The charges against Lee will be litigated.</p>
<p>In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the District of Maryland today announced criminal charges against Lee and Chunga. Chunga pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s ongoing investigation is being conducted by David Snyder and Assunta Vivolo of the SEC&rsquo;s Crypto Assets &amp; Cyber Unit (CACU). It is being supervised by David Hirsch and Jorge Tenreiro of the CACU and Nicholas Grippo and Scott Thompson of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be conducted by Judson Mihok and Gregory Bockin of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the District of Maryland; the Department of Justice, Fraud Section;&nbsp;Homeland Security Investigations New York; and the IRS.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy directs investors to resources on detecting and avoiding pyramid schemes. Investors can find additional information about pyramid schemes at Investor.gov.</p>

<title>US Justice Department: Three Individuals Charged For Roles In $1.89B Cryptocurrency Fraud Scheme</title>

<div> charged, cryptocurrency fraud, guilty plea, $1.89 billion, HyperFund <br />
The Justice Department announced charges for orchestrating a $1.89 billion cryptocurrency fraud scheme. Sam Lee, an Australian citizen, was charged for co-founding HyperFund, while Rodney Burton and Brenda Chunga were promoters. They falsely represented substantial returns from cryptocurrency mining operations, and HyperFund began to block investor withdrawals.<br /><br />Summary: The Justice Department announced charges for orchestrating a $1.89 billion cryptocurrency fraud scheme. Sam Lee, an Australian citizen, was charged for co-founding HyperFund, while Rodney Burton and Brenda Chunga were promoters. They falsely represented substantial returns from cryptocurrency mining operations, and HyperFund began to block investor withdrawals. <div>
<p>The Justice Department today announced charges against two individuals and the guilty plea of a third individual for orchestrating a $1.89 billion cryptocurrency fraud scheme.</p>
<p>Sam Lee, 35, an Australian citizen residing in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, was charged in an indictment unsealed today for allegedly co-founding HyperFund, also known as HyperTech, HyperCapital, HyperVerse, and HyperNation. Rodney Burton, 54, of Miami, and Brenda Chunga, 43, of Severna Park, Maryland, were promotors of HyperFund.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The defendants are charged with defrauding investors to the tune of $1.89 billion. As alleged in court documents, the defendants falsely represented that investors would receive substantial returns paid from cryptocurrency mining operations, which did not in fact exist,&rdquo; said Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri&nbsp;of the Justice Department&rsquo;s Criminal Division. &ldquo;With our partners in Homeland Security Investigations and IRS Criminal Investigation, we are committed to uncovering sophisticated frauds involving cryptocurrency and digital assets and bringing those who perpetrate them to justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The level of alleged fraud here is staggering,&rdquo; said U.S. Attorney Erek L. Barron for the District of Maryland. &ldquo;Whether it&rsquo;s cryptocurrency fraud, or any other financial frauds, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. This office and our law enforcement partners will hold perpetrators accountable for these and other fraud schemes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to court documents, from June 2020 to November 2022, Lee and his co-conspirators allegedly offered and sold investment contracts to the public through HyperFund&rsquo;s online investment platform. HyperFund&rsquo;s promotional materials allegedly made various false claims, including that investors who purchased HyperFund &ldquo;memberships&rdquo; would receive between 0.5% to 1% daily in passive rewards until the company either doubled or tripled the investor&rsquo;s initial investment. To convince investors that HyperFund could make such payments, HyperFund allegedly claimed that its payments would be disbursed in part from its revenues from large-scale crypto mining operations, when in truth, HyperFund did not have such operations. Beginning in at least July 2021, HyperFund allegedly began to block investor withdrawals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s charges are a testament to the incredible work of HSI New York&rsquo;s El Dorado Task Force,&rdquo; said Acting Special Agent in Charge Erin Keegan of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) New York. &ldquo;I commend our law enforcement partners, including those at HSI Baltimore, for their outstanding collaboration. HSI will continue to protect American investors from financial predators.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The illegal activity alleged in this case is precisely the type of conduct IRS Criminal Investigation and our law enforcement partners are committed to deterring,&rdquo; said Acting Special Agent in Charge David Meisenheimer of the IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS:CI) Washington, D.C. Field Office. &ldquo;These charges send a clear message that we have the tools and internal fortitude to protect our financial systems by diligently investigating, prosecuting, and holding accountable those who seek to defraud the American public.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lee is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison. Burton is charged by criminal complaint with one count of conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business and one count of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. He also faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison on each count. Chunga pleaded guilty today to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud. She faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p>
<p>HSI New York&rsquo;s El Dorado Task Force and IRS:CI are investigating the case.</p>
<p>Trial Attorney Tian Huang of the Criminal Division&rsquo;s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Aaron S.J. Zelinsky and Spencer Todd for the District of Maryland are prosecuting the case. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you believe you are a victim in this case, please contact the Fraud Section&rsquo;s Victim Witness Unit toll-free at (888) 549-3945 or by email at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:victimassistance.fraud@usdoj.gov">victimassistance.fraud@usdoj.gov</a>.

<p><em>An indictment is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</em></p>

<div> Keywords: U.S. economy, GDP, labor market, inflation, housing markets
Summary: 
- U.S. economy showing strong growth, elevated labor force participation
- Real GDP growth at 3.3% in Q4 2023, personal consumption expenditure remained strong
- Labor markets exhibited solid gains but slowing job openings
- Headline and core inflation both cooled considerably
- New home construction and housing sales continued to support economic activity
- Risks to the economic outlook remain amid geopolitical tensions and a potential consumer slowdown
- The Administration is focused on expanding the economy's productive capacity through investments in clean energy, manufacturing, and infrastructure.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>Over the past three months, incoming data have remained consistent with a soft landing for the U.S. economy.&nbsp; Elevated labor force participation and the resolution of pandemic-era supply chain challenges have strengthened our economy&rsquo;s productive capacity, helping create space for strong economic growth while inflation continues to cool.&nbsp; Just last week, the Bureau of Economic Analysis&rsquo;s (BEA) advance estimate of gross domestic product (GDP) in the fourth quarter of 2023 surprised on the upside.&nbsp;While median forecasts expected annualized growth around 2.0 percent, the initial read of GDP growth was 3.3 percent at an annual rate.&nbsp; Real GDP rose 3.1 percent over the four quarters of 2023, the third strongest calendar year rate since before the Global Financial Crisis.&nbsp; In addition, employment growth moderated in the fourth quarter but remained well above rates needed to accommodate population growth.&nbsp;Importantly, labor supply remained elevated, allowing the unemployment rate to hold at low levels without adding inflationary pressures.&nbsp; Headline inflation cooled further as energy prices decreased on balance over the quarter, though further progress is needed to bring core inflation to a level consistent with the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s target.</p>
<p>Still, encouraging economic news in the fourth quarter does not assure similar performance in the current quarter.&nbsp; The economic situation can change quickly due to geopolitical and domestic events.&nbsp; Yet, despite many uncertainties and headwinds, the U.S. economy proved resilient and strong in 2023 and remains well-positioned as we move into 2024.&nbsp; The Administration remains focused on further expanding our economy&rsquo;s productive capacity as we implement significant investments in our nation&rsquo;s clean energy, manufacturing capacity, and infrastructure.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>REAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDP)</h3>
<p>Real GDP growth remained strong in the fourth quarter of 2023, rising by 3.3 percent at an annual rate, after exceptionally strong growth in the third quarter of 4.9 percent (see Table 1 &ndash; Real Gross Domestic Product).&nbsp; Significantly, growth in the fourth quarter was largely driven by underlying private domestic demand, including sustained momentum in personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and faster growth in business fixed investment.&nbsp;Over the four quarters of 2023, real GDP growth accelerated to 3.1 percent&mdash;the fastest annual pace this Administration and the third fastest annual pace since before the Global Financial Crisis.</p>
<p>Decomposing GDP into smaller components can be helpful in tracking the economy&rsquo;s performance.&nbsp; The four components we consider are: (1) private domestic final purchases (PDFP), the most persistent and stable components of output: personal consumption, business fixed investment, and residential investment; (2) government consumption and investment; (3) net international purchases (U.S. exports less U.S. imports); and (4) intermediate demand (or the change in private inventories).&nbsp;Examined separately, each component delivers specific information about activity in various sectors that can be useful in predicting the future path of growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first component, PDFP, is particularly important to analyze: it measures the private sector&rsquo;s capacity to drive self-sustaining growth and, therefore, may signal the direction of future economic performance.&nbsp; In the fourth quarter, real PDFP growth was a strong 2.6 percent at an annual rate, which accounted for 2.2 percentage points of total GDP growth.&nbsp; Although slowing modestly, personal consumption expenditure (PCE) growth remained close to the third quarter pace, as household finances were underpinned by strong labor market conditions and rising incomes in real terms.&nbsp; Spending on goods and services grew solidly.&nbsp; Household purchases of goods rose at a slower rate than in the third quarter.&nbsp; By contrast, the growth rate for consumption of services accelerated in the fourth quarter, driven by larger contributions from most components, save for expenditures on rent of rent of housing, food services, and financial service.&nbsp; On net, household spending on services accounted for roughly 55 percent of PCE&rsquo;s contribution to GDP growth.</p>
<p>Business fixed investment accelerated in the fourth quarter, reflecting growth in all three major components.&nbsp; Investment in equipment turned positive in the fourth quarter, while spending on intellectual property products grew for the fourteenth consecutive quarter.&nbsp; Meanwhile, investment in structures slowed sharply in the fourth quarter, dropping from 11.2 percent annualized in the third quarter to 3.2 percent&mdash;largely driven by less investment in commercial and health care buildings, as well as other structures.</p>
<p>Residential investment, the final component of PDFP, posted growth in the fourth quarter, marking this sector&rsquo;s first back-to-back quarters of expansion in three years.&nbsp; Although growth slowed to 1.0 percent in the final quarter of 2023 from 6.7 percent in the third quarter, the slower growth largely reflected weakness in brokers&rsquo; commissions and other types of residential investment, which partially offset a gain in single-family construction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other three components of GDP (government spending, net exports, and inventory changes) all made positive contributions to fourth quarter growth.&nbsp; Total government spending contributed solidly to growth in the fourth quarter, but paces of growth were softer at all levels of government&mdash;though state and local government expenditures accounted for more than two-thirds of the increase.&nbsp; International trade was a net positive contributor to real GDP growth as the increase in exports outweighed import growth, resulting in a narrower trade deficit in the fourth quarter.&nbsp; The change in private inventories, which can exhibit wide swings from quarter to quarter, added only slightly to growth in third quarter after a large contribution in the third quarter.&nbsp; Notably, this decline in the contribution from the change in private inventory investment explains most of the deceleration in real GDP growth from the third to the fourth quarters.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>LABOR MARKETS</h3>
<p>In the final quarter of 2023, the U.S. labor market exhibited solid employment gains, low unemployment, and stable labor force participation near post-pandemic highs.&nbsp; In addition, signs of cooling pointed to continuing realignment between labor demand and labor supply (see Table 2 &ndash; Labor Market Indicators).</p>
<p>The average pace of payroll job creation slowed in the fourth quarter to 165,000 per month.&nbsp; Although down from the third quarter average of 221,000 per month, the fourth quarter pace was still well above that needed to accommodate population growth.&nbsp; The unemployment rate also trended lower over the quarter and ended the year at 3.7 percent, down 0.1 percentage points from September.&nbsp; A broader measure of labor underutilization is the underemployment rate, which includes those working part-time for economic reasons and those marginally attached to the labor force.&nbsp; Although the underemployment rate stepped up to 7.1 percent at the end of the fourth quarter, it remains historically low; for comparison, the underemployment rate in 2019&mdash;a period generally viewed as a full-employment environment&mdash;averaged 7.2 percent throughout the year.&nbsp; Indeed, weekly unemployment insurance claims since late November have come in persistently below 2018 and 2019, when labor markets were likely at full employment.&nbsp; On average, initial unemployment claims (NSA) during the weeks ending January 13 and 20 were 12.0 percent below corresponding weeks in 2018 and 2019.&nbsp; Continuing claims data also have fallen below comparable 2018 and 2019 readings and are consistent with strong labor markets.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, labor supply and demand continued to realign in the fourth quarter.&nbsp; Labor supply held at or near post-pandemic highs: at 62.7 percent in the fourth quarter, total labor force participation was unchanged from the third quarter average.&nbsp; Although total LFPR edged down a bit in December, the year-end rate still was 62.5 percent&mdash;or 0.2 percentage points higher than a year earlier&mdash;while the prime-age (ages 25 to 54) LFPR was 83.2 percent, up 0.7 percentage points over the year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, demand for labor continued to ease.&nbsp; Job openings (or vacancies) have trended lower since peaking at 12.0 million in March 2022.&nbsp; This downtrend continued during the first two months of the fourth quarter (latest available data), during which the average number of job openings fell to 8.8 million, down 435,000 from the third quarter average.&nbsp; As a result, the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has declined from a peak of 2.0 in March 2022.&nbsp; As of November, there were 1.4 job openings per unemployed worker, down by 0.1 from the corresponding month in the third quarter.&nbsp; Although the ratio still is above the pre-pandemic high of 1.2, the downtrend since March 2022 confirms that labor demand and supply are realigning.</p>
<h3>INFLATION</h3>
<p>Headline inflation slowed considerably during the fourth quarter and, by the end of the quarter, was down on a year-over-year basis by nearly two-thirds of its peak in June 2022.&nbsp; Core inflation, meanwhile, maintained a steady pace throughout the third and further quarters; by the end of the year, core inflation was down roughly 40 percent from its peak in autumn of 2022.</p>
<p>As measured by the consumer price index (CPI), the average rate of monthly inflation during the fourth quarter was 0.1 percent, down from an average of 0.4 percent during the third quarter (see Table 3 &ndash; Inflation and Wage Growth Indicators).&nbsp; Headline inflation was held down by falling energy prices, which declined an average of 1.5 percent per month in the fourth quarter, after rising 2.4 percent on average in the third quarter.&nbsp; Despite the decline in energy prices in the fourth quarter, recent developments suggest upside price risk to energy and headline inflation.&nbsp; Geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and the Middle East, as well as OPEC+ production cuts, have added uncertainty to the energy outlook&mdash;though OPEC+ oil production cuts have encouraged output growth among non-OPEC+ countries, including the United States, and mitigated the price impact.&nbsp; For the other non-core components of inflation, average monthly food inflation was stable in the fourth quarter, remaining at the third quarter&rsquo;s average pace of 0.2 percent&mdash;that is, near rates seen prior to the pandemic.</p>
<p>Excluding energy and food, core CPI inflation remained stable in the second half of 2023&mdash;though inflation rates of core components diverged.&nbsp; Over the fourth quarter, core inflation averaged 0.3&nbsp;percent per month, unchanged from the third quarter.&nbsp; Core goods prices decreased for the second consecutive quarter&mdash;though the pace of deflation was roughly half that in the third quarter.&nbsp; By contrast, core services inflation remained elevated.&nbsp; Sustained upward pressure from rent of housing services (rent of primary residential and owners&rsquo; equivalent rent)&mdash;which is the largest share of core inflation&mdash;sets a high floor to core services inflation, though it has eased slowly.&nbsp; The fourth quarter pace of inflation for rent of housing services matched that of the previous two quarters but was 6.4 percent on a year-over-year basis in December, the slowest pace twelve-month pace since July 2022.&nbsp; For non-housing core services, inflation held steady&nbsp;at an elevated pace in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Inflation as measured by the PCE price index&nbsp;assigns different weights for different components and uses a different methodology in its calculation than the CPI.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the drivers of both measures of inflation and the patterns in the fourth quarter are broadly similar.</p>
<h3>HOUSING MARKETS</h3>
<p>New Residential Construction: On net, new home construction supported economic activity in the fourth quarter, with growth rates of all but the early stages of home building improving relative to the third quarter (see Table 4 &ndash; Housing Market Indicators).&nbsp; The pace of growth of total building permits&mdash;which precede future home construction&mdash;slowed slightly due to more moderate growth in the single-family sector.&nbsp; Multi-family permits, meanwhile, declined at a slower pace, extending the downtrend that began in the latter half of 2022.&nbsp; Meanwhile, growth of total housing starts turned positive in the fourth quarter, owing to a renewed growth in multi-unit starts.&nbsp; For the next two stages of production, the inventory of homes under construction was unchanged at the end of the fourth quarter, but home completions returned to positive growth.&nbsp; On a year-over-year basis, total home completions rose at the fastest pace since before the pandemic, signaling favorable developments for housing supply throughout 2023.</p>
<p>Homes Sales and Inventories: Ongoing housing affordability challenges&mdash;stemming from both high home prices and elevated, though declining, mortgage rates&mdash;continued to constrain existing home sales in the fourth quarter (see Table 4 &ndash; Housing Market Indicators).&nbsp; Sales of total existing homes declined for the third consecutive quarter and were down by 6.2&nbsp;percent over 2023.&nbsp; Even so, the pace of decline over 2023 was less than a fifth of that in 2022.&nbsp; Meanwhile, inventories of homes for sale fell to a 21-month low in December 2023, likely reflecting in part the reluctance of owners of existing homes to sell when they may be locked into low mortgages.</p>
<p>Accordingly, prospective homeowners have maintained their focus on the new home market, where sales of single-family units rose for five consecutive quarters before pulling back in the fourth quarter: sales of new single-family homes declined 1.6 percent per month, on average, after rising 0.7 percent in the third quarter.&nbsp; Starting in the summer of 2022, the strength of new home sales had weighed on the inventory-to-sales ratios (the number of months of sales that current inventories can support) but in the last two quarters, inventories for new homes have increased, from a low of 7.1 months in July 2023 to an average 8.3 months in the fourth quarter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Home Prices and Rents: Home prices maintained a rapid pace of growth during the early part of the fourth quarter, but some measures moderated significantly (see Table 5 &ndash; Home Price and Rent Indicators).&nbsp;Although&nbsp;growth in the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller&rsquo;s national home price index slowed modestly in October (last available data as of January 29),&nbsp;the pace of house price growth in the FHFA purchase only-index was nearly 60 percent lower than in the third quarter.&nbsp; Nonetheless, according to both home price measure, house prices set fresh record highs at the start of the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>For renters, measures of shelter cost growth were mixed in the fourth quarter.&nbsp; The CPI for rent of primary residence rose 5.7 percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter&mdash;though both rates were marginally slower than in the second quarter.&nbsp;However, measures of new rental agreements continue to suggest a favorable outlook for the rent CPI, which is a lagged measure and trails prices from rental unit listing services by about a year.&nbsp; Listing services data indicate that after slowing significantly in the third quarter, rental inflation turned negative in the fourth quarter, which may suggest further progress bringing down shelter inflation in coming quarters.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>RISKS TO THE OUTLOOK</h3>
<p>Even amid substantial economic growth and a gradual easing of labor markets, inflation has fallen substantially from the highs of mid-2022.&nbsp;We expect this trend to continue over the next year and anticipate that inflation will return to historical norms.&nbsp;However, there are risks to this outlook on both sides.&nbsp; Geopolitical risks or persistently strong demand growth without comparable supply expansion could push inflation above consensus forecasts.&nbsp; Alternatively, a significant cooling in the labor market could bring inflation down faster&mdash;but with greater cost for American workers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Geopolitical instability and supply chain disruptions:&nbsp; Russia&rsquo;s war in Ukraine continues to add uncertainty to the medium-term outlook.&nbsp; In addition, the ongoing conflict in the Middle East and drought conditions at the Panama Canal create further concerns of supply chain disruptions and could renew upward pressures on energy and goods prices.&nbsp; Fortunately, major impacts to the U.S. economy have not materialized to date, but these remain important risks to monitor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consumer slowdown and labor market cooling:&nbsp; Strong consumption in 2023 supported the economy, fueled by real income growth and a reduced saving rate.&nbsp; Households have drawn down much of their excess savings from the pandemic period, but household net worth as a share of disposable personal income remains high relative to historical levels.&nbsp; Households should be able to continue to grow consumption from growth in real incomes, but a risk remains that a slowdown in consumption could cool the labor market quickly, which could again reduce consumption and further slow the economy.&nbsp;This concern is particularly notable in areas with rising delinquency and default rates.&nbsp; In general, however, higher delinquency rates still reflect normalization from the low levels that persisted following pandemic income support programs.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
<p>The American economy remains strong, with rising incomes, a healthy labor market, and easing inflation.&nbsp; Going forward, we must continue to invest in expanding our economy&rsquo;s productive capacity in ways that benefit all Americans&mdash;what Secretary Yellen has called &ldquo;modern supply-side economics.&rdquo; The Biden-Harris Administration&rsquo;s investments in our clean energy and manufacturing sectors, as well as in our public infrastructure, are oriented toward this goal.&nbsp; The Administration remains committed to helping foster continued improvements like those we saw in 2023.</p>

<div> Treasury, borrowing, marketable debt, cash balance, financing<br />
Summary: The U.S. Department of the Treasury announced estimates of privately-held net marketable borrowing for the first two quarters of 2024. For January – March 2024, borrowing is expected to be $760 billion, and for April – June 2024, borrowing is expected to be $202 billion. The estimates are based on projected fiscal flows and cash balances. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced its current estimates of privately-held net marketable borrowing<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2054#ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;for the January &ndash; March 2024 and April &ndash; June 2024 quarters.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Sources-and-Uses-January-qtr12024.pdf">Sources and Uses Table</a></p>
<ul>
<li>During the January &ndash; March 2024 quarter, Treasury expects to borrow $760 billion in privately-held&nbsp;net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-March cash balance of $750 billion.<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2054#ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;The borrowing estimate is $55 billion lower than announced in October 2023, largely due to&nbsp;projections of higher net fiscal flows and a higher beginning of quarter cash balance.<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2054#ftn3">[3]</a></li>
<li>During the April &ndash; June 2024&nbsp;quarter, Treasury expects to borrow $202 billion in privately-held &nbsp;net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-June cash balance of $750 billion.<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2054#ftn4">[4]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the October &ndash; December 2023&nbsp;quarter, Treasury borrowed $776 billion in privately-held&nbsp;net marketable debt and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $769 billion. In October 2023, Treasury estimated borrowing of $776 billion and assumed an end-of-December cash balance of $750 billion. There was no change in privately-held net market borrowing although the ending cash balance was $19 billion higher due primarily to other sources of financing including lower than projected discount on marketable borrowing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Additional financing details relating to Treasury&rsquo;s Quarterly Refunding will be released at 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, January 31, 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: EBA, industry survey, credit institutions, ESG risks, methodologies <br />
Summary: The European Banking Authority (EBA) has launched an industry survey to gather information from credit institutions on their approaches to classifying exposures to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks and the accessibility of ESG data. Participation is voluntary, and findings will be presented anonymously. The EBA aims to assess the availability and feasibility of standardizing ESG risk identification and qualification. Additionally, they may organize an industry workshop for further discussion on the topic. <br /> <div>
<p class="body">The European Banking Authority (EBA) today launched an industry survey to receive input from credit institutions on their methodologies to classify exposures to environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, as well as on the accessibility and availability of ESG data for this purpose. The objective of the survey is to collect qualitative information on credit institutions&rsquo; current practices to inform the EBA&rsquo;s work on the feasibility of introducing a standardised methodology to identify and qualify exposures to ESG risks. The deadline to respond to the industry survey is 29 March 2024.</p>
<h4>Survey process</h4>
<p class="body">Institutions willing to take part in the survey should contact the EBA and express their interest via the address&nbsp;<a href="mailto:eba-esg-risks-classification@eba.europa.eu">eba-esg-risks-classification@eba.europa.eu</a>. These institutions will be granted access to the survey accordingly. While the file containing all questions is available on the EBA website&nbsp;for convenience, replies to the survey should be submitted directly to the EBA via the dedicated survey tool.</p>
<p class="body">Participation in the survey is voluntary. However, the EBA strongly encourages credit institutions to take part in this important exercise. No confidential information will be disclosed and the findings will be presented anonymously at an aggregated level. The EBA reserves the right to follow-up bilaterally with institutions participating in the survey.</p>
<h4>Background and next steps</h4>
<p class="body">As part of the revised banking package, the EBA will receive new mandates under Article 501c of amended Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (see&nbsp;<a href="https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-15883-2023-INIT/en/pdf">provisional agreement</a>).</p>
<p class="body">This survey is launched with a purpose to respond to points (a) and (b) of that article, which request the EBA to assess the following:</p>
<ul>
<li class="body">availability and accessibility of relatable and consistent ESG data; </li>
<li class="body">feasibility of introducing a standardised methodology to identify and qualify exposures [subject to ESG risks], based on a common set of principles for ESG risk classification, using:    
<ul>
<li class="body">information on transition and physical risk indicators made available by sustainability disclosures reporting frameworks (EU and internationally); </li>
<li class="body">guidance and conclusions coming from the supervisory stress-testing or scenario analysis of climate-related financial risks conducted by the EBA or the competent authorities; </li>
<li class="body">relevant ESG score of the ECAI credit risks rating by a nominated ECAI, if appropriately reflecting the ESG risks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="body">The mandate complements the initial discussion and findings presented in the&nbsp;<a href="https://eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-recommends-enhancements-pillar-1-framework-capture">EBA Report on the role of environmental and social risks in the prudential framework</a>&nbsp;published on 12 October 2023.</p>
<p class="body">The EBA may organise an industry workshop with institutions participating in the survey for further dialogue on this topic and to exchange on the findings.</p>

Summary:<br />2023 was a challenging year for the European economy, with inflationary pressures and geopolitical uncertainties leading to stagnant growth.

<p><span>Global Overview</span></p>
<p>2023 was a challenging year for the European economy. The continent faced multiple headwinds, including inflationary pressures and geopolitical uncertainties. These factors weighed on economic activity, leading to stagnant growth. Developments in European capital markets reflected these economic trends. Market capitalisation slowly increased while primary markets struggled and lit trading decreased.</p>
<p>ETFs volumes normalised to pre-pandemic levels, but the listed investment funds market continued its downtrend. Beyond equities, trading in exchange-traded derivatives stabilised and fixed-income trading on exchanges, including ESG bonds, resurged.</p>

<p>ICE is home to the most liquid markets to trade energy derivatives. ICE&rsquo;s global oil markets are centered around ICE Brent, used to price three quarters of the world&rsquo;s internationally traded crude oil. This market sits alongside the broadest range of benchmarks to support natural gas markets, as well as the most liquid markets to trade environmental products, designed to support market participants in meeting emissions reduction goals.</p>

<div> Securities, Markets, ESMA, Guidelines, Crypto-assets
<br />
ESMA seeks input on reverse solicitation exemption and classification of crypto-assets as financial instruments. The proposed guidance clarifies conditions for reverse solicitation exemption and aims to provide structured criteria for classifying crypto-assets as financial instruments. Consultation closes on April 29, 2024, with the final report expected in Q4 2024.
<br /><br />Summary: ESMA is seeking feedback on guidelines for reverse solicitation and the classification of crypto-assets as financial instruments. The aim is to provide clear conditions and criteria for the application of the reverse solicitation exemption and to ensure consistency across the EU. The consultation closes on April 29, 2024, with a final report expected in Q4 2024. <div>
<p class="text-align-justify">The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, today publishes two&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/consultations/consultation-reverse-solicitation-and-classification-crypto-assets">Consultations Papers on guidelines under Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA)</a>, one on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-01/ESMA35-1872330276-1619_Consultation_Paper_on_the_draft_guidelines_on_reverse_solicitation_under_MiCA.pdf">reverse solicitation</a>&nbsp;and one on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-01/ESMA75-453128700-52_MiCA_Consultation_Paper_-_Guidelines_on_the_qualification_of_crypto-assets_as_financial_instruments.pdf">classification of crypto-assets as financial instruments</a>.</p>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">ESMA invites comments from stakeholders by 29 April 2024.</p>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Consultation paper on guidelines on reverse solicitation</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify">In this consultation, ESMA is seeking input on proposed guidance relating to the conditions of application of the reverse solicitation exemption and the supervision practices that&nbsp;National&nbsp;Competent&nbsp;Authorities&nbsp;(NCAs) may take to prevent its circumvention.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">The proposed guidance confirms&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-10/ESMA74-449133380-441_Statement_on_MiCA_Supervisory_Convergence.pdf">ESMA&rsquo;s previous message</a>&nbsp;that the provision of crypto-asset services by a third-country firm is limited under MiCA to cases where the client is the exclusive initiator of the service. This exemption should be understood as very narrowly framed and must be regarded as the exception. A firm cannot use it to bypass MiCA.</p>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Consultation paper on guidelines on&nbsp;conditions and criteria for the classification of crypto-assets as financial instruments</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify">In this consultation paper, ESMA is seeking input on establishing clear conditions and criteria for the qualification of crypto-assets as financial instruments. This initiative, which follow on from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/esma50-157-1391_crypto_advice.pdf">previous work by ESMA</a>, is aimed at bridging the MiCA regulation and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II) and ensuring consistency across the EU.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">The proposed guidelines aim at providing NCAs and market participants with structured but flexible conditions and criteria to determine whether a&nbsp;<a>crypto-asset</a>&nbsp;can be classified as a financial instrument.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">To do so, the draft strikes a balance between providing guidance and avoiding establishing a one-size-fits-all approach. Once finalised, these guidelines will provide much-needed clarity and contribute to the global standards in crypto-asset regulation.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span>Next Steps</span></h4>
<p>The consultation closes on 29 of April 2024. ESMA will consider the feedback it receives to the consultation in Q2 2024 and expects to publish a final report in Q4 2024.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The European Energy Exchange (EEX) expands its product offering on the EEX natural gas derivatives markets with new, financially settled EEX TTF Natural Gas Month Futures denominated in US$/MMBtu, from 15 April 2024.</p>
<p>Steffen Koehler, COO of EEX, comments: &ldquo;<em>In recent years, TTF in US$/MMBtu has become the pricing benchmark of choice for European LNG imports as well as being used outside of this region for LNG-related trading strategies. We therefore believe that our new extended offering will be ideal to meet the growing needs of this market, by enabling wider hedging opportunities for the LNG trading community.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new products will be available with up to 72 monthly expiries, complementing EEX&rsquo;s existing offering for the LNG market, which currently comprises the EEX JKM LNG Natural Gas Futures.</p>
<p>LNG is a fast-growing global commodity, and in the first half of 2023 LNG imports to the UK and Europe exceeded pipeline delivery for the first time. In 2023, LNG made up 42% of the EU&rsquo;s total gas imports.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<span>European Energy Exchange (EEX)</span>&nbsp;is the leading energy exchange which builds secure, successful and sustainable commodity markets worldwide &ndash; together with its customers. As part of EEX Group, a group of companies serving international commodity markets, it offers contracts on Power, Natural Gas and Emission Allowances as well as Freight and Agricultural Products.

<title>CME Group Latin American FX Futures Hit All-Time Volume And Open Interest Records In 2023</title>

<ul type="disc">
<li><span><i>Increased client participation deepens liquidity and further strengthens price discovery function</i></span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CME Group, the world's leading derivatives marketplace, today announced its Mexican peso and Brazilian real FX futures contracts reached all-time average daily volume (ADV) and open interest (OI) records in 2023. The increased trading is resulting in deeper liquidity and broader client participation, which in turn, strengthens reliance on these markets as the premier source of price discovery for the broader FX marketplace.</p>
<p>2023 LatAm FX futures trading highlights include:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Mexican peso futures reached a record&nbsp;$1.8 billion&nbsp;in equivalent notional value ADV.</li>
<li>Brazilian real futures achieved a record&nbsp;$300 million&nbsp;in equivalent notional value ADV.&nbsp;</li>
<li>CME Group's&nbsp;LatAm FX futures complex hit an all-time ADV record of 82,000 contracts (+7.4% year-over-year) and an all-time OI record of 304,000 contracts (+20.4% year-over-year).&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The continued growth of the Mexican and Brazilian economies combined with the current interest rate environment, is driving more clients to trade CME Group FX futures," said&nbsp;
Paul Houston, Global Head of FX Products,&nbsp;CME Group. "As client participation continues to grow, we are focused on building and maintaining consistent liquidity that will support the long-term development of the electronic FX markets in&nbsp;Latin America."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"CME Group's&nbsp;liquidity in Mexican peso futures has been a key element to enhance our hedging activities, and thus to be able to heighten our client's product offering,"&nbsp;said&nbsp;
Alejandro Vigil, Head of FX BBVA M&eacute;xico.</p>
<p>"CME Group&nbsp;offers its clients unique access to liquidity from local onshore market markers which are particularly valuable in futures and options for non-deliverable currencies. These are markets that require cumbersome local vehicles for direct access or higher costs from global market makers," said&nbsp;
Bernardo Gattass, Head of Ita&uacute;&nbsp;Unibanco's Options trading desk. "It's the case for the Brazilian real which is a large market with relevant local liquidity and large local market makers such as&nbsp;Ita&uacute;, its largest bank by assets. Many large global institutional investors would do well to add&nbsp;CME Group&nbsp;to their price provider list for LatAm currencies and tap into the liquidity of both global and local market makers, such as&nbsp;Ita&uacute;&nbsp;for the real and many others."</p>

<title>CISI Launches Mental Health And Addiction Awareness e-Learning Modules</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cisi-launches-mental-health-and-addiction-awareness-e-learning-modules/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cisi-launches-mental-health-and-addiction-awareness-e-learning-modules/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Financial services professionals globally are being offered the opportunity to learn how to boost their wellness, both personally and in the workplace and recognise, and seek help for, potentially addictive behaviour.</p>
<p>Members of charity and professional body, the Chartered Institute for Securities &amp; Investment (CISI) can access the two new e-learning modules, free, through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisi.org/cisiweb2/cisi-website/startaconversation?section=wellbeing" target="_blank">CISI mental health portal</a>. The modules, 30 minutes each, are interactive and test knowledge based around real-life scenarios. The combined learning between the two modules qualifies for one hour of CISI CPD.</p>
<p>The two e-learning modules were designed and produced for CISI members by&nbsp;Synergy Health, a specialist medical and care management consultancy practice&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.bwrsynergyhealth.com/" target="_blank">www.bwrsynergyhealth.com</a>).</p>
<p><b><i>Mental Health Awareness &ndash; Boosting Your Brain and Wellness in the Workplace</i></b><b>&nbsp;</b>focuses on creating a mentally healthy workplace, with strategies for maintaining wellness. Module no 2,&nbsp;<b><i>Addiction Awareness, Stamping Out The Stigma and the Road to Recovery&nbsp;</i></b>focuses on understanding addiction, how to recognise signs of addictive behaviour and where to seek help.</p>
<p>The CISI was one of the first sector professional bodies to create a mental health portal, following the results of its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisi.org/cisiweb2/cisi-website/about-us/press-release/2018/12/21/off-the-scale-workloads-and-out-of-touch-senior-management-identified-as-key-causes-of-financial-services-staff-stress-and-mental-ill-health-says-cisi-survey" target="_blank">first-ever mental health survey</a>&nbsp;and feedback from members.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisi.org/cisiweb2/cisi-website/startaconversation" target="_blank">The portal</a>&nbsp;was launched to encourage the conversation around mental health in financial services and to help end the stigma around discussing mental health issues. In 2021 the CISI examined the effect the pandemic had on the&nbsp;<a href="https://financialplanning.cisi.org/cisiweb2/cisi-website/about-us/press-release/2021/07/21/pandemic-leaves-its-mark-as-55-of-women-finance-workers-have-suffered-stress-in-the-last-year-says-cisi" target="_blank">mental health of finance workers</a>, and in 2022 it looked at the&nbsp;<a href="https://financialplanning.cisi.org/cisiweb2/cisi-website/about-us/press-release/2022/08/10/banter-negatively-impacting-97-of-financial-services-professionals-while-hr-departments-have-an-image-problem-says-cisi-survey" target="_blank">effect of banter</a>&nbsp;on finance professionals&rsquo; mental health. Last year the professional body surveyed members to look at workplace support for women senior leaders&nbsp;<a href="https://financialplanning.cisi.org/cisiweb2/cisi-website/about-us/press-release/2023/02/06/almost-a-quarter-of-financial-services-firms-have-no-measures-in-place-to-support-women-experiencing-menopause" target="_blank">going through the menopause.</a></p>
<p>Tracy Vegro, CISI Chief Executive said: &ldquo;More than ever, we all need to know support and strategies are available to help us maintain a level of positive mental health, to cope with the stresses and strains of both personal and professional life. These two new modules are an important resource for CISI&rsquo;s membership community to navigate and understand some of these mental health challenges, whether it be developing mental health resilience or recognising the signs of potential addiction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Synergy Health are delighted to be partnering with the CISI to provide CISI Members with training and awareness on mental health, well-being and addiction with a particular focus on these issues in the workplace. Dr Simone Yule, Clinical Director of Synergy Health said: &ldquo;'We hope to make a difference to people's lives by raising awareness on these crucial topics and look forward to discussing our content in the forthcoming webinar&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The CISI is running a webinar on the two module topics of mental health awareness and addiction awareness on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisi.org/cisiweb2/shop/event-details?eventid=86855262" target="_blank"><b>8 February 2024</b></a>&nbsp;at 12:30 pm.</p>

<div> FPGA, Market Data, NovaSparks, Quincy Data, QED Feed
Summary: 
NovaSparks and Quincy Data collaborated to integrate the QED feed into NovaTickTM, providing ultra-low latency market data support for electronic trading platforms worldwide. This partnership allows customers to benefit from faster, more efficient trading and simplified architecture, solidifying NovaSparks' leading position in market data solutions. 
<br /><br /> <div>
<p>Quincy Data, powered by McKay Brothers, and NovaSparks, the leading field programmable gate array (FPGA) market data company, have worked together to add the support of the Quincy Extreme Data (QED) Feed to NovaTick<sup>TM</sup>.</p>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NovaTick<sup>TM</sup> is NovaSparks&rsquo; ultra-low latency ticker-plant based on a powerful FPGA matrix architecture. It handles the high-performance requirements of electronic trading platforms with the speed and determinism that only FPGAs can bring. NovaTick<sup>TM</sup> converts the QED feed into NovaSparks&rsquo; normalized wire format in 400ns and can also provide the QED wireless market data through its software C++ Application Programming Interface (API), NSMDA, or its hardware API, NovaLink<sup>TM</sup>. Arbitration between the QED wireless feed and the QED fiber feed can also be added in front of the feed handler in NovaTick<sup><sup>TM</sup></sup> to provide a reliable normalized stream of market data.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The vast majority of our customers are trading across geographies and asset classes. Often, they rely on wireless services to transport market data at the fastest speed. This collaboration will not only simplify their trading architecture, but it will also give them an opportunity to further reduce the overall latency of market data sent abroad via wireless services. The addition of the QED feed brings our global feed total to 75, confirming our leading position among all the FPGA-centric market data solutions providers. This puts us in a unique position to offer unparalleled service,&rdquo; said Luc Burgun, NovaSparks&rsquo; chief executive officer and president.</p>
<p>"Today, FPGA technology is an essential component of any high-speed trading infrastructure. FPGAs are able to handle very large market data bursts while maintaining a deterministic latency profile. The Quincy Extreme Data service distributes a normalized feed of select market data sourced from financial exchanges globally to many points of presence (PoPs) in the U.S., Europe, India, and Asia. We welcome NovaSparks into our ecosystem. This new solution will give all NovaSparks customers a very efficient way to use market data from our wireless service directly into their trading platforms," says St&eacute;phane Tyc, Quincy Data co-founder.</p>
<p>NovaTick&rsquo;s pure FPGA processing architecture is incredibly fast and deterministic, yielding one to two orders of magnitude faster than traditional software solutions. NovaSparks&rsquo; pure-FPGA feed handlers have a normalized output format across markets, enabling NovaSparks customers to integrate new feeds with minimum effort.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Support of the QED feed by NovaTick<sup>TM</sup> allows us to benefit from the tight integration we already have between NovaTick<sup>TM</sup> and our trading platform," says Alain Katchouni, Managing Director, Head of ETF and Electronic Trading at National Bank Financial Inc.,<b> </b>one of Canada's six systemically important banks. "This new addition simplifies and accelerates our trading environment when we use Quincy Extreme Data service,&rdquo; added Katchouni.</p>

Rothschild &amp; Co went ahead from occupying the sixth position by value in 2022 to top the chart in 2023.

<title>Monetary Authority Of Singapore Monetary Policy Statement - January 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/monetary-authority-of-singapore-monetary-policy-statement-january-2024/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/monetary-authority-of-singapore-monetary-policy-statement-january-2024/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>In the October 2023 Monetary Policy Statement (MPS), MAS maintained the rate of appreciation of the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER) policy band, with no change to the width of the band or level at which it was centred. Since then, the S$NEER has strengthened in line with the appreciating policy band</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Chart 1</span></span><span><br /><span>S$ Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (S$NEER)</span></span></span></p>
<p><img alt="S$NEER chart for Monetary Policy Statement January 2024" height="364px" src="https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/mas-media-library/news/monetary-policy-statements/2024/mps_chart_2024_01.jpg?h=364px&amp;w=563px&amp;hash=9190C1A48ABF3665B0F75D67DC412922" width="563px" />&nbsp;</p>
<h2>GROWTH BACKDROP</h2>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Economic activity in Singapore&rsquo;s major trading partners was resilient in the last quarter of 2023. In the near term, global growth is expected to be impacted by the lagged effects of elevated interest rates in the advanced economies. However, global final demand should pick up later this year, as lower inflation sustains private consumption expenditure, and monetary policy settings in the major economies turn more supportive. This outlook is subject to uncertainties, particularly stemming from ongoing geopolitical conflicts which could precipitate negative global supply and demand shocks.</span></p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>MTI&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Advance Estimat</em>es show that growth in the Singapore economy picked up to 1.7% on a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis in the last quarter of 2023, from 1.3% in Q3 and an average of &minus;0.1% in the first half of the year. This strengthening in momentum was mainly attributable to the external-facing sectors. For 2023 as a whole, the Singapore economy is estimated to have expanded by 1.2%.</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prospects for the Singapore economy should continue to improve in 2024, with GDP growth projected to come in between 1&ndash;3%. The recovery in the manufacturing and financial sectors should be supported by the turnaround in the electronics cycle and anticipated easing in global interest rates, respectively, even as growth in the domestic-oriented sectors further normalises towards pre-pandemic rates. Consequently, the slightly negative output gap in 2023 will narrow in the second half of 2024.</span></p>
<h2>INFLATION OUTLOOK</h2>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS Core Inflation<span>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/monetary-policy-statements/2024/mas-monetary-policy-statement-29jan24#1">[1]</a></span>&nbsp;</span>continued to decline in year-on-year terms in Q4 2023, though by less than expected. Inflation for food and retail goods moderated, offsetting firmer electricity &amp; gas inflation. Travel-related services inflation, which is largely determined by conditions in tourism markets abroad, was stronger as hotel room rates and package tour prices saw steep increases. For 2023 as a whole, MAS Core Inflation came in at 4.2%, slightly higher than the 4.1% in 2022. However, excluding the impact of the GST increase, core inflation would have fallen by an estimated 0.6%-point in 2023 compared to 2022.</p>
<div>
<div id="edn1"></div>
</div>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>CPI-All Items inflation likewise edged down in Q4 2023 from the preceding quarter. Accommodation inflation eased as the supply of completed housing units increased. This helped to offset rising private transport inflation amid higher petrol prices. CPI-All Items inflation averaged 4.8% in 2023, down from 6.1% in the preceding year.</span></p>
<p>7.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span>MAS Core Inflation is expected to rise in the current quarter due in part to the one-off impact of the 1%-point hike in the GST from January this year, as well as the increase in the carbon tax. Water prices will rise from Q2 this year amid increases in production costs. Inflation for certain services components, including public transport and healthcare, could also stay elevated as less frequently-adjusted prices rise to catch up with higher cost levels.</span></p>
<p>8.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Setting aside the transitory impact of the GST increase, core inflation is forecast to decline gradually over 2024. Lower imported costs and a slower pace of domestic cost increases should underpin the moderating trend in inflation. Global energy and food commodity prices have fallen and are expected to remain broadly stable, while imported costs of most intermediate and final goods should be tempered by favourable global supply conditions. On the domestic front, wage growth should ease this year&nbsp;</span><span>as labour market tightness dissipates</span><span>, while productivity is also projected to pick up. Consequently, unit labour costs will rise at a slower pace.</span></p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>MAS Core Inflation is projected to slow to an average of 2.5&ndash;3.5% for 2024 as a whole, unchanged from the October 2023 MPS. Excluding the impact of the increase in the GST rate this year, core inflation is forecast at 1.5&ndash;2.5%.</span></p>
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Amid the declines in COE premiums since November and the larger COE supply this year compared to 2023, CPI-All Items inflation in 2024 is now forecast to be lower at 2.5&ndash;3.5%, down from the previous range of 3&ndash;4%. Excluding the effects of the increase in the GST rate, headline inflation is forecast at 1.5&ndash;2.5%.</span></p>
<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Both upside and downside risks to the inflation outlook remain. Shocks to global food and energy prices or domestic labour costs could bring about additional inflationary pressures. However, an unexpected weakening in the global economy could induce a faster easing of cost and price pressures.</span></p>
<h2>MONETARY POLICY</h2>
<p><span>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;Barring any further global shocks, the Singapore economy is expected to strengthen in 2024, with growth becoming more broad-based. MAS Core Inflation is likely to remain elevated in the earlier part of the year, but should decline gradually and step down by Q4, before falling further next year.</span></p>
<p><span>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, current monetary policy settings remain appropriate. The sustained appreciation of the policy band will continue to dampen imported inflation and curb domestic cost pressures, thus ensuring medium-term price stability.</span></p>
<p><span>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span><span>MAS will therefore maintain the prevailing rate of appreciation of the S$NEER policy band. There will be no change to its width and the level at which it is centred.</span></span>&nbsp;MAS will closely monitor global and domestic economic developments, and remain vigilant to risks to inflation and growth.</span></p>

<title>China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) Bans Securities Lending During Restricted Periods</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/china-securities-regulatory-commission-csrc-bans-securities-lending-during-res/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/china-securities-regulatory-commission-csrc-bans-securities-lending-during-res/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In an effort to stabilize the country's stock markets, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has announced the suspension of lending restricted shares, effective from Monday. This move comes after recent sharp falls in the market and is part of a series of supportive policies implemented by Beijing.</p>
<p>Restricted shares, which are subject to limits on sale, are often offered to company employees or certain investors. However, they can be lent for trading purposes, putting additional pressure on markets during a downward trend.</p>
<p>The CSRC's decision aims to promote fairness and reasonableness, reduce the efficiency of securities lending, and level the playing field for investors. The regulator also intends to crack down on illegal activities that exploit securities lending to reduce holdings and cash out.</p>
<p>To further regulate the market, the CSRC will also limit the efficiency of securities lending in the securities refinancing market starting March 18.</p>
<p>Although the blue-chip CSI300 Index has seen some recovery, China's stock market continues to struggle. As a result, small Chinese investors are seeking alternatives to the domestic economy, driving up premiums on global index funds.</p>
<p>China's economy grew slightly above the government's target in 2023, but the recovery has been inconsistent. December data revealed weak consumption and a significant decline in home prices, indicating a deep crisis in the property market.</p>
<p>To align with the CSRC's measures, both the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges will suspend securities lending by strategic investors during lockup periods starting January 29.</p>
