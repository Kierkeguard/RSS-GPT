<title>SEC Charges Founder Of $1.7 Billion “HyperFund” Crypto Pyramid Scheme And Top Promoter with Fraud - Promoter Brenda Chunga (aka Bitcoin Beautee) Agrees To Settle Fraud And Unregistered Offering Charges</title>

<div> charged, fraudulent, pyramid scheme, crypto asset, investors
<br />
The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Xue Lee and Brenda Chunga for their involvement in a fraudulent crypto asset pyramid scheme known as HyperFund, which raised over $1.7 billion from investors. Lee and Chunga promoted membership packages, guaranteeing high returns, but the scheme collapsed in 2022, leaving investors unable to make withdrawals.
<br /><br />Summary: The SEC charged Xue Lee and Brenda Chunga for their involvement in a fraudulent crypto asset pyramid scheme, known as HyperFund, which raised over $1.7 billion. Lee and Chunga promoted membership packages, guaranteeing high returns, but the scheme collapsed in 2022, leaving investors unable to make withdrawals. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Xue Lee (aka Sam Lee) and Brenda Chunga (aka Bitcoin Beautee) for their involvement in a fraudulent crypto asset pyramid scheme known as HyperFund that raised more than $1.7 billion from investors worldwide.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, from June 2020 through early 2022, Lee and Chunga promoted HyperFund &ldquo;membership&rdquo; packages, which they claimed guaranteed investors high returns, including from HyperFund&rsquo;s supposed crypto asset mining operations and associations with a Fortune 500 company. As the complaint alleges, however, Lee and Chunga knew or were reckless in not knowing that HyperFund was a pyramid scheme and had no real source of revenue other than funds received from investors. In 2022, the HyperFund scheme collapsed and investors were no longer able to make withdrawals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As alleged in our complaint, Lee and Chunga attracted investors with the allure of profits from crypto asset mining, but the only thing that HyperFund mined was its investors&rsquo; pockets,&rdquo; said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;This case illustrates yet again how noncompliance in the crypto space facilitates schemes where promoters capitalize on the promise of easy money, without providing the detailed investor protection disclosures required by the registration provisions of the federal securities laws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in federal district court in the District of Maryland, charges Lee and Chunga with violating the anti-fraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, conduct-based injunctions preventing the defendants from participating in multi-level marketing or crypto asset offerings, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. Chunga agreed to settle the charges, to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the charged provisions and certain other activity, and to pay disgorgement and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a future date. The settlement is subject to court approval. The charges against Lee will be litigated.</p>
<p>In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the District of Maryland today announced criminal charges against Lee and Chunga. Chunga pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s ongoing investigation is being conducted by David Snyder and Assunta Vivolo of the SEC&rsquo;s Crypto Assets &amp; Cyber Unit (CACU). It is being supervised by David Hirsch and Jorge Tenreiro of the CACU and Nicholas Grippo and Scott Thompson of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be conducted by Judson Mihok and Gregory Bockin of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the District of Maryland; the Department of Justice, Fraud Section;&nbsp;Homeland Security Investigations New York; and the IRS.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy directs investors to resources on detecting and avoiding pyramid schemes. Investors can find additional information about pyramid schemes at Investor.gov.</p>

<title>US Justice Department: Three Individuals Charged For Roles In $1.89B Cryptocurrency Fraud Scheme</title>

<div> charged, cryptocurrency fraud, guilty plea, $1.89 billion, HyperFund <br />
The Justice Department announced charges for orchestrating a $1.89 billion cryptocurrency fraud scheme. Sam Lee, an Australian citizen, was charged for co-founding HyperFund, while Rodney Burton and Brenda Chunga were promoters. They falsely represented substantial returns from cryptocurrency mining operations, and HyperFund began to block investor withdrawals.<br /><br />Summary: The Justice Department announced charges for orchestrating a $1.89 billion cryptocurrency fraud scheme. Sam Lee, an Australian citizen, was charged for co-founding HyperFund, while Rodney Burton and Brenda Chunga were promoters. They falsely represented substantial returns from cryptocurrency mining operations, and HyperFund began to block investor withdrawals. <div>
<p>The Justice Department today announced charges against two individuals and the guilty plea of a third individual for orchestrating a $1.89 billion cryptocurrency fraud scheme.</p>
<p>Sam Lee, 35, an Australian citizen residing in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, was charged in an indictment unsealed today for allegedly co-founding HyperFund, also known as HyperTech, HyperCapital, HyperVerse, and HyperNation. Rodney Burton, 54, of Miami, and Brenda Chunga, 43, of Severna Park, Maryland, were promotors of HyperFund.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The defendants are charged with defrauding investors to the tune of $1.89 billion. As alleged in court documents, the defendants falsely represented that investors would receive substantial returns paid from cryptocurrency mining operations, which did not in fact exist,&rdquo; said Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri&nbsp;of the Justice Department&rsquo;s Criminal Division. &ldquo;With our partners in Homeland Security Investigations and IRS Criminal Investigation, we are committed to uncovering sophisticated frauds involving cryptocurrency and digital assets and bringing those who perpetrate them to justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The level of alleged fraud here is staggering,&rdquo; said U.S. Attorney Erek L. Barron for the District of Maryland. &ldquo;Whether it&rsquo;s cryptocurrency fraud, or any other financial frauds, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. This office and our law enforcement partners will hold perpetrators accountable for these and other fraud schemes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to court documents, from June 2020 to November 2022, Lee and his co-conspirators allegedly offered and sold investment contracts to the public through HyperFund&rsquo;s online investment platform. HyperFund&rsquo;s promotional materials allegedly made various false claims, including that investors who purchased HyperFund &ldquo;memberships&rdquo; would receive between 0.5% to 1% daily in passive rewards until the company either doubled or tripled the investor&rsquo;s initial investment. To convince investors that HyperFund could make such payments, HyperFund allegedly claimed that its payments would be disbursed in part from its revenues from large-scale crypto mining operations, when in truth, HyperFund did not have such operations. Beginning in at least July 2021, HyperFund allegedly began to block investor withdrawals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s charges are a testament to the incredible work of HSI New York&rsquo;s El Dorado Task Force,&rdquo; said Acting Special Agent in Charge Erin Keegan of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) New York. &ldquo;I commend our law enforcement partners, including those at HSI Baltimore, for their outstanding collaboration. HSI will continue to protect American investors from financial predators.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The illegal activity alleged in this case is precisely the type of conduct IRS Criminal Investigation and our law enforcement partners are committed to deterring,&rdquo; said Acting Special Agent in Charge David Meisenheimer of the IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS:CI) Washington, D.C. Field Office. &ldquo;These charges send a clear message that we have the tools and internal fortitude to protect our financial systems by diligently investigating, prosecuting, and holding accountable those who seek to defraud the American public.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lee is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison. Burton is charged by criminal complaint with one count of conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business and one count of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. He also faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison on each count. Chunga pleaded guilty today to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud. She faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p>
<p>HSI New York&rsquo;s El Dorado Task Force and IRS:CI are investigating the case.</p>
<p>Trial Attorney Tian Huang of the Criminal Division&rsquo;s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Aaron S.J. Zelinsky and Spencer Todd for the District of Maryland are prosecuting the case. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you believe you are a victim in this case, please contact the Fraud Section&rsquo;s Victim Witness Unit toll-free at (888) 549-3945 or by email at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:victimassistance.fraud@usdoj.gov">victimassistance.fraud@usdoj.gov</a>.

<p><em>An indictment is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</em></p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>Over the past three months, incoming data have remained consistent with a soft landing for the U.S. economy.&nbsp; Elevated labor force participation and the resolution of pandemic-era supply chain challenges have strengthened our economy&rsquo;s productive capacity, helping create space for strong economic growth while inflation continues to cool.&nbsp; Just last week, the Bureau of Economic Analysis&rsquo;s (BEA) advance estimate of gross domestic product (GDP) in the fourth quarter of 2023 surprised on the upside.&nbsp;While median forecasts expected annualized growth around 2.0 percent, the initial read of GDP growth was 3.3 percent at an annual rate.&nbsp; Real GDP rose 3.1 percent over the four quarters of 2023, the third strongest calendar year rate since before the Global Financial Crisis.&nbsp; In addition, employment growth moderated in the fourth quarter but remained well above rates needed to accommodate population growth.&nbsp;Importantly, labor supply remained elevated, allowing the unemployment rate to hold at low levels without adding inflationary pressures.&nbsp; Headline inflation cooled further as energy prices decreased on balance over the quarter, though further progress is needed to bring core inflation to a level consistent with the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s target.</p>
<p>Still, encouraging economic news in the fourth quarter does not assure similar performance in the current quarter.&nbsp; The economic situation can change quickly due to geopolitical and domestic events.&nbsp; Yet, despite many uncertainties and headwinds, the U.S. economy proved resilient and strong in 2023 and remains well-positioned as we move into 2024.&nbsp; The Administration remains focused on further expanding our economy&rsquo;s productive capacity as we implement significant investments in our nation&rsquo;s clean energy, manufacturing capacity, and infrastructure.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>REAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDP)</h3>
<p>Real GDP growth remained strong in the fourth quarter of 2023, rising by 3.3 percent at an annual rate, after exceptionally strong growth in the third quarter of 4.9 percent (see Table 1 &ndash; Real Gross Domestic Product).&nbsp; Significantly, growth in the fourth quarter was largely driven by underlying private domestic demand, including sustained momentum in personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and faster growth in business fixed investment.&nbsp;Over the four quarters of 2023, real GDP growth accelerated to 3.1 percent&mdash;the fastest annual pace this Administration and the third fastest annual pace since before the Global Financial Crisis.</p>
<p>Decomposing GDP into smaller components can be helpful in tracking the economy&rsquo;s performance.&nbsp; The four components we consider are: (1) private domestic final purchases (PDFP), the most persistent and stable components of output: personal consumption, business fixed investment, and residential investment; (2) government consumption and investment; (3) net international purchases (U.S. exports less U.S. imports); and (4) intermediate demand (or the change in private inventories).&nbsp;Examined separately, each component delivers specific information about activity in various sectors that can be useful in predicting the future path of growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first component, PDFP, is particularly important to analyze: it measures the private sector&rsquo;s capacity to drive self-sustaining growth and, therefore, may signal the direction of future economic performance.&nbsp; In the fourth quarter, real PDFP growth was a strong 2.6 percent at an annual rate, which accounted for 2.2 percentage points of total GDP growth.&nbsp; Although slowing modestly, personal consumption expenditure (PCE) growth remained close to the third quarter pace, as household finances were underpinned by strong labor market conditions and rising incomes in real terms.&nbsp; Spending on goods and services grew solidly.&nbsp; Household purchases of goods rose at a slower rate than in the third quarter.&nbsp; By contrast, the growth rate for consumption of services accelerated in the fourth quarter, driven by larger contributions from most components, save for expenditures on rent of rent of housing, food services, and financial service.&nbsp; On net, household spending on services accounted for roughly 55 percent of PCE&rsquo;s contribution to GDP growth.</p>
<p>Business fixed investment accelerated in the fourth quarter, reflecting growth in all three major components.&nbsp; Investment in equipment turned positive in the fourth quarter, while spending on intellectual property products grew for the fourteenth consecutive quarter.&nbsp; Meanwhile, investment in structures slowed sharply in the fourth quarter, dropping from 11.2 percent annualized in the third quarter to 3.2 percent&mdash;largely driven by less investment in commercial and health care buildings, as well as other structures.</p>
<p>Residential investment, the final component of PDFP, posted growth in the fourth quarter, marking this sector&rsquo;s first back-to-back quarters of expansion in three years.&nbsp; Although growth slowed to 1.0 percent in the final quarter of 2023 from 6.7 percent in the third quarter, the slower growth largely reflected weakness in brokers&rsquo; commissions and other types of residential investment, which partially offset a gain in single-family construction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other three components of GDP (government spending, net exports, and inventory changes) all made positive contributions to fourth quarter growth.&nbsp; Total government spending contributed solidly to growth in the fourth quarter, but paces of growth were softer at all levels of government&mdash;though state and local government expenditures accounted for more than two-thirds of the increase.&nbsp; International trade was a net positive contributor to real GDP growth as the increase in exports outweighed import growth, resulting in a narrower trade deficit in the fourth quarter.&nbsp; The change in private inventories, which can exhibit wide swings from quarter to quarter, added only slightly to growth in third quarter after a large contribution in the third quarter.&nbsp; Notably, this decline in the contribution from the change in private inventory investment explains most of the deceleration in real GDP growth from the third to the fourth quarters.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>LABOR MARKETS</h3>
<p>In the final quarter of 2023, the U.S. labor market exhibited solid employment gains, low unemployment, and stable labor force participation near post-pandemic highs.&nbsp; In addition, signs of cooling pointed to continuing realignment between labor demand and labor supply (see Table 2 &ndash; Labor Market Indicators).</p>
<p>The average pace of payroll job creation slowed in the fourth quarter to 165,000 per month.&nbsp; Although down from the third quarter average of 221,000 per month, the fourth quarter pace was still well above that needed to accommodate population growth.&nbsp; The unemployment rate also trended lower over the quarter and ended the year at 3.7 percent, down 0.1 percentage points from September.&nbsp; A broader measure of labor underutilization is the underemployment rate, which includes those working part-time for economic reasons and those marginally attached to the labor force.&nbsp; Although the underemployment rate stepped up to 7.1 percent at the end of the fourth quarter, it remains historically low; for comparison, the underemployment rate in 2019&mdash;a period generally viewed as a full-employment environment&mdash;averaged 7.2 percent throughout the year.&nbsp; Indeed, weekly unemployment insurance claims since late November have come in persistently below 2018 and 2019, when labor markets were likely at full employment.&nbsp; On average, initial unemployment claims (NSA) during the weeks ending January 13 and 20 were 12.0 percent below corresponding weeks in 2018 and 2019.&nbsp; Continuing claims data also have fallen below comparable 2018 and 2019 readings and are consistent with strong labor markets.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, labor supply and demand continued to realign in the fourth quarter.&nbsp; Labor supply held at or near post-pandemic highs: at 62.7 percent in the fourth quarter, total labor force participation was unchanged from the third quarter average.&nbsp; Although total LFPR edged down a bit in December, the year-end rate still was 62.5 percent&mdash;or 0.2 percentage points higher than a year earlier&mdash;while the prime-age (ages 25 to 54) LFPR was 83.2 percent, up 0.7 percentage points over the year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, demand for labor continued to ease.&nbsp; Job openings (or vacancies) have trended lower since peaking at 12.0 million in March 2022.&nbsp; This downtrend continued during the first two months of the fourth quarter (latest available data), during which the average number of job openings fell to 8.8 million, down 435,000 from the third quarter average.&nbsp; As a result, the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has declined from a peak of 2.0 in March 2022.&nbsp; As of November, there were 1.4 job openings per unemployed worker, down by 0.1 from the corresponding month in the third quarter.&nbsp; Although the ratio still is above the pre-pandemic high of 1.2, the downtrend since March 2022 confirms that labor demand and supply are realigning.</p>
<h3>INFLATION</h3>
<p>Headline inflation slowed considerably during the fourth quarter and, by the end of the quarter, was down on a year-over-year basis by nearly two-thirds of its peak in June 2022.&nbsp; Core inflation, meanwhile, maintained a steady pace throughout the third and further quarters; by the end of the year, core inflation was down roughly 40 percent from its peak in autumn of 2022.</p>
<p>As measured by the consumer price index (CPI), the average rate of monthly inflation during the fourth quarter was 0.1 percent, down from an average of 0.4 percent during the third quarter (see Table 3 &ndash; Inflation and Wage Growth Indicators).&nbsp; Headline inflation was held down by falling energy prices, which declined an average of 1.5 percent per month in the fourth quarter, after rising 2.4 percent on average in the third quarter.&nbsp; Despite the decline in energy prices in the fourth quarter, recent developments suggest upside price risk to energy and headline inflation.&nbsp; Geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and the Middle East, as well as OPEC+ production cuts, have added uncertainty to the energy outlook&mdash;though OPEC+ oil production cuts have encouraged output growth among non-OPEC+ countries, including the United States, and mitigated the price impact.&nbsp; For the other non-core components of inflation, average monthly food inflation was stable in the fourth quarter, remaining at the third quarter&rsquo;s average pace of 0.2 percent&mdash;that is, near rates seen prior to the pandemic.</p>
<p>Excluding energy and food, core CPI inflation remained stable in the second half of 2023&mdash;though inflation rates of core components diverged.&nbsp; Over the fourth quarter, core inflation averaged 0.3&nbsp;percent per month, unchanged from the third quarter.&nbsp; Core goods prices decreased for the second consecutive quarter&mdash;though the pace of deflation was roughly half that in the third quarter.&nbsp; By contrast, core services inflation remained elevated.&nbsp; Sustained upward pressure from rent of housing services (rent of primary residential and owners&rsquo; equivalent rent)&mdash;which is the largest share of core inflation&mdash;sets a high floor to core services inflation, though it has eased slowly.&nbsp; The fourth quarter pace of inflation for rent of housing services matched that of the previous two quarters but was 6.4 percent on a year-over-year basis in December, the slowest pace twelve-month pace since July 2022.&nbsp; For non-housing core services, inflation held steady&nbsp;at an elevated pace in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Inflation as measured by the PCE price index&nbsp;assigns different weights for different components and uses a different methodology in its calculation than the CPI.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the drivers of both measures of inflation and the patterns in the fourth quarter are broadly similar.</p>
<h3>HOUSING MARKETS</h3>
<p>New Residential Construction: On net, new home construction supported economic activity in the fourth quarter, with growth rates of all but the early stages of home building improving relative to the third quarter (see Table 4 &ndash; Housing Market Indicators).&nbsp; The pace of growth of total building permits&mdash;which precede future home construction&mdash;slowed slightly due to more moderate growth in the single-family sector.&nbsp; Multi-family permits, meanwhile, declined at a slower pace, extending the downtrend that began in the latter half of 2022.&nbsp; Meanwhile, growth of total housing starts turned positive in the fourth quarter, owing to a renewed growth in multi-unit starts.&nbsp; For the next two stages of production, the inventory of homes under construction was unchanged at the end of the fourth quarter, but home completions returned to positive growth.&nbsp; On a year-over-year basis, total home completions rose at the fastest pace since before the pandemic, signaling favorable developments for housing supply throughout 2023.</p>
<p>Homes Sales and Inventories: Ongoing housing affordability challenges&mdash;stemming from both high home prices and elevated, though declining, mortgage rates&mdash;continued to constrain existing home sales in the fourth quarter (see Table 4 &ndash; Housing Market Indicators).&nbsp; Sales of total existing homes declined for the third consecutive quarter and were down by 6.2&nbsp;percent over 2023.&nbsp; Even so, the pace of decline over 2023 was less than a fifth of that in 2022.&nbsp; Meanwhile, inventories of homes for sale fell to a 21-month low in December 2023, likely reflecting in part the reluctance of owners of existing homes to sell when they may be locked into low mortgages.</p>
<p>Accordingly, prospective homeowners have maintained their focus on the new home market, where sales of single-family units rose for five consecutive quarters before pulling back in the fourth quarter: sales of new single-family homes declined 1.6 percent per month, on average, after rising 0.7 percent in the third quarter.&nbsp; Starting in the summer of 2022, the strength of new home sales had weighed on the inventory-to-sales ratios (the number of months of sales that current inventories can support) but in the last two quarters, inventories for new homes have increased, from a low of 7.1 months in July 2023 to an average 8.3 months in the fourth quarter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Home Prices and Rents: Home prices maintained a rapid pace of growth during the early part of the fourth quarter, but some measures moderated significantly (see Table 5 &ndash; Home Price and Rent Indicators).&nbsp;Although&nbsp;growth in the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller&rsquo;s national home price index slowed modestly in October (last available data as of January 29),&nbsp;the pace of house price growth in the FHFA purchase only-index was nearly 60 percent lower than in the third quarter.&nbsp; Nonetheless, according to both home price measure, house prices set fresh record highs at the start of the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>For renters, measures of shelter cost growth were mixed in the fourth quarter.&nbsp; The CPI for rent of primary residence rose 5.7 percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter&mdash;though both rates were marginally slower than in the second quarter.&nbsp;However, measures of new rental agreements continue to suggest a favorable outlook for the rent CPI, which is a lagged measure and trails prices from rental unit listing services by about a year.&nbsp; Listing services data indicate that after slowing significantly in the third quarter, rental inflation turned negative in the fourth quarter, which may suggest further progress bringing down shelter inflation in coming quarters.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>RISKS TO THE OUTLOOK</h3>
<p>Even amid substantial economic growth and a gradual easing of labor markets, inflation has fallen substantially from the highs of mid-2022.&nbsp;We expect this trend to continue over the next year and anticipate that inflation will return to historical norms.&nbsp;However, there are risks to this outlook on both sides.&nbsp; Geopolitical risks or persistently strong demand growth without comparable supply expansion could push inflation above consensus forecasts.&nbsp; Alternatively, a significant cooling in the labor market could bring inflation down faster&mdash;but with greater cost for American workers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Geopolitical instability and supply chain disruptions:&nbsp; Russia&rsquo;s war in Ukraine continues to add uncertainty to the medium-term outlook.&nbsp; In addition, the ongoing conflict in the Middle East and drought conditions at the Panama Canal create further concerns of supply chain disruptions and could renew upward pressures on energy and goods prices.&nbsp; Fortunately, major impacts to the U.S. economy have not materialized to date, but these remain important risks to monitor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consumer slowdown and labor market cooling:&nbsp; Strong consumption in 2023 supported the economy, fueled by real income growth and a reduced saving rate.&nbsp; Households have drawn down much of their excess savings from the pandemic period, but household net worth as a share of disposable personal income remains high relative to historical levels.&nbsp; Households should be able to continue to grow consumption from growth in real incomes, but a risk remains that a slowdown in consumption could cool the labor market quickly, which could again reduce consumption and further slow the economy.&nbsp;This concern is particularly notable in areas with rising delinquency and default rates.&nbsp; In general, however, higher delinquency rates still reflect normalization from the low levels that persisted following pandemic income support programs.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
<p>The American economy remains strong, with rising incomes, a healthy labor market, and easing inflation.&nbsp; Going forward, we must continue to invest in expanding our economy&rsquo;s productive capacity in ways that benefit all Americans&mdash;what Secretary Yellen has called &ldquo;modern supply-side economics.&rdquo; The Biden-Harris Administration&rsquo;s investments in our clean energy and manufacturing sectors, as well as in our public infrastructure, are oriented toward this goal.&nbsp; The Administration remains committed to helping foster continued improvements like those we saw in 2023.</p>

<div> Treasury, borrowing, marketable debt, cash balance, financing<br />
Summary: The U.S. Department of the Treasury announced estimates of privately-held net marketable borrowing for the first two quarters of 2024. For January – March 2024, borrowing is expected to be $760 billion, and for April – June 2024, borrowing is expected to be $202 billion. The estimates are based on projected fiscal flows and cash balances. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced its current estimates of privately-held net marketable borrowing<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2054#ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;for the January &ndash; March 2024 and April &ndash; June 2024 quarters.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Sources-and-Uses-January-qtr12024.pdf">Sources and Uses Table</a></p>
<ul>
<li>During the January &ndash; March 2024 quarter, Treasury expects to borrow $760 billion in privately-held&nbsp;net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-March cash balance of $750 billion.<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2054#ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;The borrowing estimate is $55 billion lower than announced in October 2023, largely due to&nbsp;projections of higher net fiscal flows and a higher beginning of quarter cash balance.<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2054#ftn3">[3]</a></li>
<li>During the April &ndash; June 2024&nbsp;quarter, Treasury expects to borrow $202 billion in privately-held &nbsp;net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-June cash balance of $750 billion.<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2054#ftn4">[4]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the October &ndash; December 2023&nbsp;quarter, Treasury borrowed $776 billion in privately-held&nbsp;net marketable debt and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $769 billion. In October 2023, Treasury estimated borrowing of $776 billion and assumed an end-of-December cash balance of $750 billion. There was no change in privately-held net market borrowing although the ending cash balance was $19 billion higher due primarily to other sources of financing including lower than projected discount on marketable borrowing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Additional financing details relating to Treasury&rsquo;s Quarterly Refunding will be released at 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, January 31, 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2054#_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Privately-held net marketable borrowing excludes rollovers (auction &ldquo;add-ons&rdquo;) of Treasury securities held in the Federal Reserve System Open Market Account (SOMA) but includes financing required due to SOMA redemptions.&nbsp; Secondary market purchases of Treasury securities by SOMA do not directly change net privately-held marketable borrowing but, all else equal, when the securities mature and assuming the Federal Reserve does not redeem any maturing securities, would increase the amount of cash raised for a given privately-held auction size by increasing the SOMA &ldquo;add-on&rdquo; amount.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: EBA, industry survey, credit institutions, ESG risks, methodologies <br />
Summary: The European Banking Authority (EBA) has launched an industry survey to gather information from credit institutions on their approaches to classifying exposures to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks and the accessibility of ESG data. Participation is voluntary, and findings will be presented anonymously. The EBA aims to assess the availability and feasibility of standardizing ESG risk identification and qualification. Additionally, they may organize an industry workshop for further discussion on the topic. <br /> <div>
<p class="body">The European Banking Authority (EBA) today launched an industry survey to receive input from credit institutions on their methodologies to classify exposures to environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, as well as on the accessibility and availability of ESG data for this purpose. The objective of the survey is to collect qualitative information on credit institutions&rsquo; current practices to inform the EBA&rsquo;s work on the feasibility of introducing a standardised methodology to identify and qualify exposures to ESG risks. The deadline to respond to the industry survey is 29 March 2024.</p>
<h4>Survey process</h4>
<p class="body">Institutions willing to take part in the survey should contact the EBA and express their interest via the address&nbsp;<a href="mailto:eba-esg-risks-classification@eba.europa.eu">eba-esg-risks-classification@eba.europa.eu</a>. These institutions will be granted access to the survey accordingly. While the file containing all questions is available on the EBA website&nbsp;for convenience, replies to the survey should be submitted directly to the EBA via the dedicated survey tool.</p>
<p class="body">Participation in the survey is voluntary. However, the EBA strongly encourages credit institutions to take part in this important exercise. No confidential information will be disclosed and the findings will be presented anonymously at an aggregated level. The EBA reserves the right to follow-up bilaterally with institutions participating in the survey.</p>
<h4>Background and next steps</h4>
<p class="body">As part of the revised banking package, the EBA will receive new mandates under Article 501c of amended Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (see&nbsp;<a href="https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-15883-2023-INIT/en/pdf">provisional agreement</a>).</p>
<p class="body">This survey is launched with a purpose to respond to points (a) and (b) of that article, which request the EBA to assess the following:</p>
<ul>
<li class="body">availability and accessibility of relatable and consistent ESG data; </li>
<li class="body">feasibility of introducing a standardised methodology to identify and qualify exposures [subject to ESG risks], based on a common set of principles for ESG risk classification, using:    
<ul>
<li class="body">information on transition and physical risk indicators made available by sustainability disclosures reporting frameworks (EU and internationally); </li>
<li class="body">guidance and conclusions coming from the supervisory stress-testing or scenario analysis of climate-related financial risks conducted by the EBA or the competent authorities; </li>
<li class="body">relevant ESG score of the ECAI credit risks rating by a nominated ECAI, if appropriately reflecting the ESG risks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="body">The mandate complements the initial discussion and findings presented in the&nbsp;<a href="https://eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-recommends-enhancements-pillar-1-framework-capture">EBA Report on the role of environmental and social risks in the prudential framework</a>&nbsp;published on 12 October 2023.</p>
<p class="body">The EBA may organise an industry workshop with institutions participating in the survey for further dialogue on this topic and to exchange on the findings.</p>

Summary:<br />2023 was a challenging year for the European economy, with inflationary pressures and geopolitical uncertainties leading to stagnant growth. European capital markets saw slow increases in market capitalisation, struggling primary markets, and decreased lit trading.

<p><span>Global Overview</span></p>
<p>2023 was a challenging year for the European economy. The continent faced multiple headwinds, including inflationary pressures and geopolitical uncertainties. These factors weighed on economic activity, leading to stagnant growth. Developments in European capital markets reflected these economic trends. Market capitalisation slowly increased while primary markets struggled and lit trading decreased.</p>
<p>ETFs volumes normalised to pre-pandemic levels, but the listed investment funds market continued its downtrend. Beyond equities, trading in exchange-traded derivatives stabilised and fixed-income trading on exchanges, including ESG bonds, resurged.</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">ESMA invites comments from stakeholders by 29 April 2024.</p>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Consultation paper on guidelines on reverse solicitation</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify">In this consultation, ESMA is seeking input on proposed guidance relating to the conditions of application of the reverse solicitation exemption and the supervision practices that&nbsp;National&nbsp;Competent&nbsp;Authorities&nbsp;(NCAs) may take to prevent its circumvention.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">The proposed guidance confirms&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-10/ESMA74-449133380-441_Statement_on_MiCA_Supervisory_Convergence.pdf">ESMA&rsquo;s previous message</a>&nbsp;that the provision of crypto-asset services by a third-country firm is limited under MiCA to cases where the client is the exclusive initiator of the service. This exemption should be understood as very narrowly framed and must be regarded as the exception. A firm cannot use it to bypass MiCA.</p>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Consultation paper on guidelines on&nbsp;conditions and criteria for the classification of crypto-assets as financial instruments</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify">In this consultation paper, ESMA is seeking input on establishing clear conditions and criteria for the qualification of crypto-assets as financial instruments. This initiative, which follow on from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/esma50-157-1391_crypto_advice.pdf">previous work by ESMA</a>, is aimed at bridging the MiCA regulation and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II) and ensuring consistency across the EU.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">The proposed guidelines aim at providing NCAs and market participants with structured but flexible conditions and criteria to determine whether a&nbsp;<a>crypto-asset</a>&nbsp;can be classified as a financial instrument.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">To do so, the draft strikes a balance between providing guidance and avoiding establishing a one-size-fits-all approach. Once finalised, these guidelines will provide much-needed clarity and contribute to the global standards in crypto-asset regulation.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span>Next Steps</span></h4>
<p>The consultation closes on 29 of April 2024. ESMA will consider the feedback it receives to the consultation in Q2 2024 and expects to publish a final report in Q4 2024.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The European Energy Exchange (EEX) expands its product offering on the EEX natural gas derivatives markets with new, financially settled EEX TTF Natural Gas Month Futures denominated in US$/MMBtu, from 15 April 2024.</p>
<p>Steffen Koehler, COO of EEX, comments: &ldquo;<em>In recent years, TTF in US$/MMBtu has become the pricing benchmark of choice for European LNG imports as well as being used outside of this region for LNG-related trading strategies. We therefore believe that our new extended offering will be ideal to meet the growing needs of this market, by enabling wider hedging opportunities for the LNG trading community.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new products will be available with up to 72 monthly expiries, complementing EEX&rsquo;s existing offering for the LNG market, which currently comprises the EEX JKM LNG Natural Gas Futures.</p>
<p>LNG is a fast-growing global commodity, and in the first half of 2023 LNG imports to the UK and Europe exceeded pipeline delivery for the first time. In 2023, LNG made up 42% of the EU&rsquo;s total gas imports.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<span>European Energy Exchange (EEX)</span>&nbsp;is the leading energy exchange which builds secure, successful and sustainable commodity markets worldwide &ndash; together with its customers. As part of EEX Group, a group of companies serving international commodity markets, it offers contracts on Power, Natural Gas and Emission Allowances as well as Freight and Agricultural Products. EEX also provides registry services as well as auctions for Guarantees of Origin, on behalf of the French State.</p>

<title>CME Group Latin American FX Futures Hit All-Time Volume And Open Interest Records In 2023</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul type="disc">
<li><span><i>Increased client participation deepens liquidity and further strengthens price discovery function</i></span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CME Group, the world's leading derivatives marketplace, today announced its Mexican peso and Brazilian real FX futures contracts reached all-time average daily volume (ADV) and open interest (OI) records in 2023. The increased trading is resulting in deeper liquidity and broader client participation, which in turn, strengthens reliance on these markets as the premier source of price discovery for the broader FX marketplace.</p>
<p>2023 LatAm FX futures trading highlights include:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Mexican peso futures reached a record&nbsp;$1.8 billion&nbsp;in equivalent notional value ADV.</li>
<li>Brazilian real futures achieved a record&nbsp;$300 million&nbsp;in equivalent notional value ADV.&nbsp;</li>
<li>CME Group's&nbsp;LatAm FX futures complex hit an all-time ADV record of 82,000 contracts (+7.4% year-over-year) and an all-time OI record of 304,000 contracts (+20.4% year-over-year).&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The continued growth of the Mexican and Brazilian economies combined with the current interest rate environment, is driving more clients to trade CME Group FX futures," said&nbsp;
Paul Houston, Global Head of FX Products,&nbsp;CME Group. "As client participation continues to grow, we are focused on building and maintaining consistent liquidity that will support the long-term development of the electronic FX markets in&nbsp;Latin America."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"CME Group's&nbsp;liquidity in Mexican peso futures has been a key element to enhance our hedging activities, and thus to be able to heighten our client's product offering,"&nbsp;said&nbsp;
Alejandro Vigil, Head of FX BBVA M&eacute;xico.</p>
<p>"CME Group&nbsp;offers its clients unique access to liquidity from local onshore market markers which are particularly valuable in futures and options for non-deliverable currencies. These are markets that require cumbersome local vehicles for direct access or higher costs from global market makers," said&nbsp;
Bernardo Gattass, Head of Ita&uacute;&nbsp;Unibanco's Options trading desk. "It's the case for the Brazilian real which is a large market with relevant local liquidity and large local market makers such as&nbsp;Ita&uacute;, its largest bank by assets. Many large global institutional investors would do well to add&nbsp;CME Group&nbsp;to their price provider list for LatAm currencies and tap into the liquidity of both global and local market makers, such as&nbsp;Ita&uacute;&nbsp;for the real and many others."</p>

<title>CISI Launches Mental Health And Addiction Awareness e-Learning Modules</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cisi-launches-mental-health-and-addiction-awareness-e-learning-modules/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cisi-launches-mental-health-and-addiction-awareness-e-learning-modules/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Financial services professionals globally are being offered the opportunity to learn how to boost their wellness, both personally and in the workplace and recognise, and seek help for, potentially addictive behaviour.</p>
<p>Members of charity and professional body, the Chartered Institute for Securities &amp; Investment (CISI) can access the two new e-learning modules, free, through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisi.org/cisiweb2/cisi-website/startaconversation?section=wellbeing" target="_blank">CISI mental health portal</a>. The modules, 30 minutes each, are interactive and test knowledge based around real-life scenarios. The combined learning between the two modules qualifies for one hour of CISI CPD.</p>
<p>The two e-learning modules were designed and produced for CISI members by&nbsp;Synergy Health, a specialist medical and care management consultancy practice&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.bwrsynergyhealth.com/" target="_blank">www.bwrsynergyhealth.com</a>).</p>
<p><b><i>Mental Health Awareness &ndash; Boosting Your Brain and Wellness in the Workplace</i></b><b>&nbsp;</b>focuses on creating a mentally healthy workplace, with strategies for maintaining wellness. Module no 2,&nbsp;<b><i>Addiction Awareness, Stamping Out The Stigma and the Road to Recovery&nbsp;</i></b>focuses on understanding addiction, how to recognise signs of addictive behaviour and where to seek help.</p>
<p>The CISI was one of the first sector professional bodies to create a mental health portal, following the results of its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisi.org/cisiweb2/cisi-website/about-us/press-release/2018/12/21/off-the-scale-workloads-and-out-of-touch-senior-management-identified-as-key-causes-of-financial-services-staff-stress-and-mental-ill-health-says-cisi-survey" target="_blank">first-ever mental health survey</a>&nbsp;and feedback from members.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisi.org/cisiweb2/cisi-website/startaconversation" target="_blank">The portal</a>&nbsp;was launched to encourage the conversation around mental health in financial services and to help end the stigma around discussing mental health issues. In 2021 the CISI examined the effect the pandemic had on the&nbsp;<a href="https://financialplanning.cisi.org/cisiweb2/cisi-website/about-us/press-release/2021/07/21/pandemic-leaves-its-mark-as-55-of-women-finance-workers-have-suffered-stress-in-the-last-year-says-cisi" target="_blank">mental health of finance workers</a>, and in 2022 it looked at the&nbsp;<a href="https://financialplanning.cisi.org/cisiweb2/cisi-website/about-us/press-release/2022/08/10/banter-negatively-impacting-97-of-financial-services-professionals-while-hr-departments-have-an-image-problem-says-cisi-survey" target="_blank">effect of banter</a>&nbsp;on finance professionals&rsquo; mental health. Last year the professional body surveyed members to look at workplace support for women senior leaders&nbsp;<a href="https://financialplanning.cisi.org/cisiweb2/cisi-website/about-us/press-release/2023/02/06/almost-a-quarter-of-financial-services-firms-have-no-measures-in-place-to-support-women-experiencing-menopause" target="_blank">going through the menopause.</a></p>
<p>Tracy Vegro, CISI Chief Executive said: &ldquo;More than ever, we all need to know support and strategies are available to help us maintain a level of positive mental health, to cope with the stresses and strains of both personal and professional life. These two new modules are an important resource for CISI&rsquo;s membership community to navigate and understand some of these mental health challenges, whether it be developing mental health resilience or recognising the signs of potential addiction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Synergy Health are delighted to be partnering with the CISI to provide CISI Members with training and awareness on mental health, well-being and addiction with a particular focus on these issues in the workplace. Dr Simone Yule, Clinical Director of Synergy Health said: &ldquo;'We hope to make a difference to people's lives by raising awareness on these crucial topics and look forward to discussing our content in the forthcoming webinar&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The CISI is running a webinar on the two module topics of mental health awareness and addiction awareness on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisi.org/cisiweb2/shop/event-details?eventid=86855262" target="_blank"><b>8 February 2024</b></a>&nbsp;at 12:30 pm.</p>

<div> FPGA, Market Data, NovaSparks, Quincy Data, QED Feed
Summary: 
NovaSparks and Quincy Data collaborated to integrate the QED feed into NovaTickTM, providing ultra-low latency market data support for electronic trading platforms worldwide. This partnership allows customers to benefit from faster, more efficient trading and simplified architecture, solidifying NovaSparks' leading position in market data solutions. 
<br /><br /> <div>
<p>Quincy Data, powered by McKay Brothers, and NovaSparks, the leading field programmable gate array (FPGA) market data company, have worked together to add the support of the Quincy Extreme Data (QED) Feed to NovaTick<sup>TM</sup>.</p>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NovaTick<sup>TM</sup> is NovaSparks&rsquo; ultra-low latency ticker-plant based on a powerful FPGA matrix architecture. It handles the high-performance requirements of electronic trading platforms with the speed and determinism that only FPGAs can bring. NovaTick<sup>TM</sup> converts the QED feed into NovaSparks&rsquo; normalized wire format in 400ns and can also provide the QED wireless market data through its software C++ Application Programming Interface (API), NSMDA, or its hardware API, NovaLink<sup>TM</sup>. Arbitration between the QED wireless feed and the QED fiber feed can also be added in front of the feed handler in NovaTick<sup><sup>TM</sup></sup> to provide a reliable normalized stream of market data.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The vast majority of our customers are trading across geographies and asset classes. Often, they rely on wireless services to transport market data at the fastest speed. This collaboration will not only simplify their trading architecture, but it will also give them an opportunity to further reduce the overall latency of market data sent abroad via wireless services. The addition of the QED feed brings our global feed total to 75, confirming our leading position among all the FPGA-centric market data solutions providers. This puts us in a unique position to offer unparalleled service,&rdquo; said Luc Burgun, NovaSparks&rsquo; chief executive officer and president.</p>
<p>"Today, FPGA technology is an essential component of any high-speed trading infrastructure. FPGAs are able to handle very large market data bursts while maintaining a deterministic latency profile. The Quincy Extreme Data service distributes a normalized feed of select market data sourced from financial exchanges globally to many points of presence (PoPs) in the U.S., Europe, India, and Asia. We welcome NovaSparks into our ecosystem. This new solution will give all NovaSparks customers a very efficient way to use market data from our wireless service directly into their trading platforms," says St&eacute;phane Tyc, Quincy Data co-founder.</p>
<p>NovaTick&rsquo;s pure FPGA processing architecture is incredibly fast and deterministic, yielding one to two orders of magnitude faster than traditional software solutions. NovaSparks&rsquo; pure-FPGA feed handlers have a normalized output format across markets, enabling NovaSparks customers to integrate new feeds with minimum effort.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Support of the QED feed by NovaTick<sup>TM</sup> allows us to benefit from the tight integration we already have between NovaTick<sup>TM</sup> and our trading platform," says Alain Katchouni, Managing Director, Head of ETF and Electronic Trading at National Bank Financial Inc.,<b> </b>one of Canada's six systemically important banks. "This new addition simplifies and accelerates our trading environment when we use Quincy Extreme Data service,&rdquo; added Katchouni.</p>

However, it registered a jump in deal value and improvement in its ranking by value in 2023 compared to 2022. Rothschild &amp; Co went ahead from occupying the sixth position by value in 2022 to top the chart in 2023. Involvement in two billion-dollar deals* including a mega deal valued more than $10 billion was pivotal for it in leading the chart by value.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<title>Monetary Authority Of Singapore Monetary Policy Statement - January 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/monetary-authority-of-singapore-monetary-policy-statement-january-2024/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/monetary-authority-of-singapore-monetary-policy-statement-january-2024/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>In the October 2023 Monetary Policy Statement (MPS), MAS maintained the rate of appreciation of the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER) policy band, with no change to the width of the band or level at which it was centred. Since then, the S$NEER has strengthened in line with the appreciating policy band</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Chart 1</span></span><span><br /><span>S$ Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (S$NEER)</span></span></span></p>
<p><img alt="S$NEER chart for Monetary Policy Statement January 2024" height="364px" src="https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/mas-media-library/news/monetary-policy-statements/2024/mps_chart_2024_01.jpg?h=364px&amp;w=563px&amp;hash=9190C1A48ABF3665B0F75D67DC412922" width="563px" />&nbsp;</p>
<h2>GROWTH BACKDROP</h2>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Economic activity in Singapore&rsquo;s major trading partners was resilient in the last quarter of 2023. In the near term, global growth is expected to be impacted by the lagged effects of elevated interest rates in the advanced economies. However, global final demand should pick up later this year, as lower inflation sustains private consumption expenditure, and monetary policy settings in the major economies turn more supportive. This outlook is subject to uncertainties, particularly stemming from ongoing geopolitical conflicts which could precipitate negative global supply and demand shocks.</span></p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>MTI&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Advance Estimat</em>es show that growth in the Singapore economy picked up to 1.7% on a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis in the last quarter of 2023, from 1.3% in Q3 and an average of &minus;0.1% in the first half of the year. This strengthening in momentum was mainly attributable to the external-facing sectors. For 2023 as a whole, the Singapore economy is estimated to have expanded by 1.2%.</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prospects for the Singapore economy should continue to improve in 2024, with GDP growth projected to come in between 1&ndash;3%. The recovery in the manufacturing and financial sectors should be supported by the turnaround in the electronics cycle and anticipated easing in global interest rates, respectively, even as growth in the domestic-oriented sectors further normalises towards pre-pandemic rates. Consequently, the slightly negative output gap in 2023 will narrow in the second half of 2024.</span></p>
<h2>INFLATION OUTLOOK</h2>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS Core Inflation<span>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/monetary-policy-statements/2024/mas-monetary-policy-statement-29jan24#1">[1]</a></span>&nbsp;</span>continued to decline in year-on-year terms in Q4 2023, though by less than expected. Inflation for food and retail goods moderated, offsetting firmer electricity &amp; gas inflation. Travel-related services inflation, which is largely determined by conditions in tourism markets abroad, was stronger as hotel room rates and package tour prices saw steep increases. For 2023 as a whole, MAS Core Inflation came in at 4.2%, slightly higher than the 4.1% in 2022. However, excluding the impact of the GST increase, core inflation would have fallen by an estimated 0.6%-point in 2023 compared to 2022.</p>
<div>
<div id="edn1"></div>
</div>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>CPI-All Items inflation likewise edged down in Q4 2023 from the preceding quarter. Accommodation inflation eased as the supply of completed housing units increased. This helped to offset rising private transport inflation amid higher petrol prices. CPI-All Items inflation averaged 4.8% in 2023, down from 6.1% in the preceding year.</span></p>
<p>7.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span>MAS Core Inflation is expected to rise in the current quarter due in part to the one-off impact of the 1%-point hike in the GST from January this year, as well as the increase in the carbon tax. Water prices will rise from Q2 this year amid increases in production costs. Inflation for certain services components, including public transport and healthcare, could also stay elevated as less frequently-adjusted prices rise to catch up with higher cost levels.</span></p>
<p>8.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Setting aside the transitory impact of the GST increase, core inflation is forecast to decline gradually over 2024. Lower imported costs and a slower pace of domestic cost increases should underpin the moderating trend in inflation. Global energy and food commodity prices have fallen and are expected to remain broadly stable, while imported costs of most intermediate and final goods should be tempered by favourable global supply conditions. On the domestic front, wage growth should ease this year&nbsp;</span><span>as labour market tightness dissipates</span><span>, while productivity is also projected to pick up. Consequently, unit labour costs will rise at a slower pace.</span></p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>MAS Core Inflation is projected to slow to an average of 2.5&ndash;3.5% for 2024 as a whole, unchanged from the October 2023 MPS. Excluding the impact of the increase in the GST rate this year, core inflation is forecast at 1.5&ndash;2.5%.</span></p>
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Amid the declines in COE premiums since November and the larger COE supply this year compared to 2023, CPI-All Items inflation in 2024 is now forecast to be lower at 2.5&ndash;3.5%, down from the previous range of 3&ndash;4%. Excluding the effects of the increase in the GST rate, headline inflation is forecast at 1.5&ndash;2.5%.</span></p>
<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Both upside and downside risks to the inflation outlook remain. Shocks to global food and energy prices or domestic labour costs could bring about additional inflationary pressures. However, an unexpected weakening in the global economy could induce a faster easing of cost and price pressures.</span></p>
<h2>MONETARY POLICY</h2>
<p><span>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;Barring any further global shocks, the Singapore economy is expected to strengthen in 2024, with growth becoming more broad-based. MAS Core Inflation is likely to remain elevated in the earlier part of the year, but should decline gradually and step down by Q4, before falling further next year.</span></p>
<p><span>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, current monetary policy settings remain appropriate. The sustained appreciation of the policy band will continue to dampen imported inflation and curb domestic cost pressures, thus ensuring medium-term price stability.</span></p>
<p><span>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span><span>MAS will therefore maintain the prevailing rate of appreciation of the S$NEER policy band. There will be no change to its width and the level at which it is centred.</span></span>&nbsp;MAS will closely monitor global and domestic economic developments, and remain vigilant to risks to inflation and growth.</span></p>

<title>China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) Bans Securities Lending During Restricted Periods</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/china-securities-regulatory-commission-csrc-bans-securities-lending-during-res/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/china-securities-regulatory-commission-csrc-bans-securities-lending-during-res/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In an effort to stabilize the country's stock markets, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has announced the suspension of lending restricted shares, effective from Monday. This move comes after recent sharp falls in the market and is part of a series of supportive policies implemented by Beijing.</p>
<p>Restricted shares, which are subject to limits on sale, are often offered to company employees or certain investors. However, they can be lent for trading purposes, putting additional pressure on markets during a downward trend.</p>
<p>The CSRC's decision aims to promote fairness and reasonableness, reduce the efficiency of securities lending, and level the playing field for investors. The regulator also intends to crack down on illegal activities that exploit securities lending to reduce holdings and cash out.</p>
<p>To further regulate the market, the CSRC will also limit the efficiency of securities lending in the securities refinancing market starting March 18.</p>
<p>Although the blue-chip CSI300 Index has seen some recovery, China's stock market continues to struggle. As a result, small Chinese investors are seeking alternatives to the domestic economy, driving up premiums on global index funds.</p>
<p>China's economy grew slightly above the government's target in 2023, but the recovery has been inconsistent. December data revealed weak consumption and a significant decline in home prices, indicating a deep crisis in the property market.</p>
<p>To align with the CSRC's measures, both the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges will suspend securities lending by strategic investors during lockup periods starting January 29.</p>
