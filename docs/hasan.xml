<div> Keywords: Citi, lawsuit, online banking security, fraud, reimbursement
Summary: The New York Attorney General Letitia James has filed a lawsuit against Citi, alleging lax online protections, misleading customers about fraud, and denial of reimbursement. Citi's negligence has resulted in millions of dollars being stolen from customers, with some losing their entire life savings. The bank has failed to respond adequately to fraudulent activity, leaving customers vulnerable to scammers. Summary: <br><br>Attorney General Letitia James has filed a lawsuit against Citi, citing lax online protections, fraudulent activity, and denial of reimbursement. Citi's negligence has led to millions being stolen from customers, with some losing their entire life savings. The bank has failed to respond to fraudulent activity, leaving customers vulnerable to scammers. <div>
<p>New York Attorney General Letitia James today&nbsp;<a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2024-01/citi-complaint.pdf">sued Citibank, N.A. (Citi) for failing to protect and refusing to reimburse victims of fraud</a>. The lawsuit alleges that Citi does not implement strong online protections to stop unauthorized account takeovers, misleads account holders about their rights after their accounts are hacked and funds are stolen, and illegally denies reimbursement to victims of fraud. The Office of the Attorney General (OAG) has found that the bank fails to respond to fraudulent activity appropriately and quickly. As a result of Citi&rsquo;s lax security, New York customers have lost millions of dollars, and in some instances, their entire lifesavings, to scammers and hackers. Attorney General James is seeking to hold Citi accountable for failing to protect its customers and require the company to pay back defrauded New Yorkers with interest, pay penalties, and adopt enhanced anti-fraud defenses to prevent scammers from stealing consumers&rsquo; funds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Banks are supposed to be the safest place to keep money, yet Citi&rsquo;s negligence has allowed scammers to steal millions of dollars from hardworking people,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>Attorney General James</span>. &ldquo;Many New Yorkers rely on online banking to pay bills or save for big milestones, and if a bank cannot secure its customers&rsquo; accounts, they are failing in their most basic duty. There is no excuse for Citi&rsquo;s failure to protect and prevent millions of dollars from being stolen from customers&rsquo; accounts and my office will not write off illegal behavior from big banks.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Harm to New York Customers</span></p>
<p>Citi is one of the largest banks in the United States and maintains checking and savings accounts for millions of consumers nationwide, including through online and mobile banking. The lawsuit alleges that scammers are able to steal tens of thousands of dollars from Citi customers because the bank does not implement strong data security and anti-breach practices. As a result of Citi&rsquo;s lax security protocols and procedures, ineffective monitoring systems, and failure to respond in real-time and properly investigate fraud claims, New Yorkers have lost millions to scammers. Customers have lost their life savings, their children&rsquo;s college funds, or even money needed to support their day-to-day lives as a result of Citi&rsquo;s illegal and deceptive acts and practices.</p>
<p>One New Yorker had $40,000 stolen from her retirement savings account. In October 2021, the customer received a text message that appeared to be from Citi instructing her to log onto a website or call her local branch. The customer clicked the link in the message but did not provide additional information as requested in the text message. Afterwards, the customer called her local branch to report the suspicious activity but was told not to worry about it. Three days later, the customer discovered that a scammer changed her banking password, enrolled in online wire transfers, transferred $70,000 from her savings to her checking account, and then electronically executed a $40,000 wire transfer, none of which was consistent with her past account activity. For weeks, the customer continued to contact the bank and submit affidavits, but in the end, she was told that her claim for fraud was denied.</p>
<p>Another New Yorker had $35,000 stolen from her account. She was reviewing her online account and found a message that her account had been suspended and was instructed to call a phone number. She called the number provided and a scammer told her that he would send her Citi codes to verify recent suspicious activity. The scammer then transferred all of the money in the customer&rsquo;s three savings accounts into her checking account, changed her online passwords, and attempted a $35,000 wire transfer. Citi attempted to verify the wire transfer by calling the customer, but she was working and did not see the call at the time. Less than an hour later, the scammer attempted another $35,000 wire transfer, which Citi approved without ever having made direct contact with the customer. She lost nearly everything she had saved, and Citi refused to reimburse her.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Insufficient Online Banking Security</span></p>
<p>The OAG found that Citi&rsquo;s systems do not respond effectively to red flags, such as scammers who are using unrecognized devices, are accessing accounts from new locations, or are changing banking passwords or usernames. Additionally, Citi systems do not flag and stop efforts to transfer funds from multiple accounts into a single account and then send tens of thousands of dollars out the door in minutes. Citi also does not automatically initiate investigations or report fraudulent activity to police or law enforcement authorities when consumers first report it to Citi.</p>
<p>In addition, Citi fails to appropriately respond to notifications of fraud by its customers. When victims contact the bank to report fraud, Citi leaves them on lengthy telephone holds, allowing scammers to continue their fraud. Additionally, Citi does not implement sufficient measures to protect consumers from future unauthorized transactions until they visit a local branch. Citi representatives falsely told consumers that their accounts were secure and often promised that their money would be returned, although the bank did not take immediate steps to recover stolen funds. Citi also falsely tells consumers that they need to visit local branches and execute special affidavits detailing the scams that led to their losses &mdash; information Citi then used to blame consumers and deny their claims.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attorney General James alleges that because Citi makes wire transfers available to consumers online and through mobile banking apps, Citi must reimburse victims of fraud under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA), similar to when banks reimburse victims of electronic credit or debit card fraud. Under EFTA, banks such as Citi are required to reimburse their customers for money in their accounts that is lost or stolen through unauthorized electronic payments. However, Citi illegally exploited a narrow exception in these laws to deny consumer claims for reimbursement, resulting in millions of dollars in losses for New York consumers. Through this lawsuit, Attorney General James is seeking to stop Citi&rsquo;s deceptive practices and to collect restitution for victims who were denied reimbursement in the last six years, penalties, and disgorgement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attorney General James encourages all consumers who have lost money to scammers who hacked into their online or mobile banking, whether the bank accounts were with Citi or any other bank, to report their experiences to&nbsp;<a href="https://formsnym.ag.ny.gov/OAGOnlineSubmissionForm/faces/OAGCFCHome;jsessionid=VDRYAmzfy5Vvu_Lafni57NWQjworpA60Z2Y7u5I7rBxBU8iVj-AN!513712777">OAG&rsquo;s Consumer Frauds Bureau</a>.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s lawsuit is the latest action by Attorney General James to hold big banks accountable. Last month, Attorney General James&nbsp;<a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2023/attorney-general-james-works-hold-big-banks-accountable-violating-state-laws">led a coalition of 20 attorneys general in submitting&nbsp;letters</a>&nbsp;to the federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau urging both agencies to ensure that national banks cooperate with investigations being conducted by state attorneys general. In April 2022, Attorney General James led a multistate coalition of attorneys general in calling on the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, U.S. Bank, and Wells Fargo to&nbsp;<a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2022/attorney-general-james-leads-multistate-coalition-calling-consumer-banks">eliminate all overdraft fees</a>&nbsp;on consumer bank accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This matter is being handled by Assistant Attorney General Chris Filburn with the Consumer Frauds and Protection Bureau. The Consumer Frauds and Protection Bureau is led by Bureau Chief Jane Azia and Deputy Bureau Chief Laura Levine, and is a part of the Division of Economic Justice, which is overseen by Chief Deputy Attorney General Chris D&rsquo;Angelo and First Deputy Attorney General Jennifer Levy.</p>

<div> EC, ISDA, GFMA, FIA, BMR <br>
The joint response by ISDA, GFMA, and FIA to the European Commission's Call for Feedback on the BMR highlights the recognition of problems caused by the current drafting of the Benchmarks Regulation, supports the aim of establishing a sustainable third-country regime, and overall considers the proposal to result in a more proportionate and protective regime for users and administrators of benchmarks. <br><br>Summary: The associations welcome the EC's recognition of the problems caused by the current drafting of the Benchmarks Regulation, strongly support the aim of establishing a sustainable third-country regime, and overall consider that the proposal will result in a more proportionate regime for users and administrators of benchmarks. <div>
<p><span>On Tuesday 23rd January 2024, ISDA submitted a joint response to the European Commission&rsquo;s (EC) Call for Feedback on the review of the scope and regime for non-EU benchmarks alongside GFMA and FIA. The response sets out the Associations&rsquo; comments on the EC&rsquo;s proposal, along with potential draft amendments where possible, as well as some additional revisions that were considered to also support the EC&rsquo;s aims. In summary, the Associations welcome the EC&rsquo;s recognition of the problems caused by the current drafting of the Benchmarks Regulation (BMR), and the careful thought and consideration that has been given to addressing them. They strongly support the aim of establishing a third-country regime that is sustainable in the long term once the current transitional regime expires, and overall consider that the proposal will result in a more proportionate regime for users and administrators of benchmarks, that still provides vital protections.</span></p>

<div> Committee Meeting, Rare Earth Minerals, Derivatives Market, Basel III, Energy Infrastructure<br />
Summary:<br />
The Energy and Environmental Markets Advisory Committee will hold a public meeting in Colorado to discuss the role of rare earth minerals in energy transition, the impact of Basel III proposals on derivatives markets, and updates on traditional energy infrastructure. Members of the public can attend in person or virtually and submit written statements. <div>
<p>CFTC Commissioner Summer K. Mersinger, sponsor of the Energy and Environmental Markets Advisory Committee (EEMAC), today announced the EEMAC will hold a public meeting from 9:00 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. (MST) on Tuesday, February 13 at the Colorado School of Mines in Golden, Colorado. Members of the public may also attend the meeting virtually or in person, if space permits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this meeting, the EEMAC will explore the role of rare earth minerals in transitional energy and electrification, including the potential development of derivatives products to offer price discovery and hedging opportunities in these markets. Additionally, a presentation and discussion on the federal prudential financial regulators proposed rules implementing Basel III and the implications for and impact on the derivatives market.&nbsp;Finally, the two EEMAC subcommittees will offer an update on their continued work related to traditional energy infrastructure and metals markets.</p>
<p>The meeting agenda may change to accommodate other EEMAC priorities. A formal agenda for this meeting is forthcoming. For agenda updates and more information about this advisory committee, including its members, visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/About/CFTCCommittees/EnergyEnvironmentalMarketsAdvisory/emac_meetings.html">EEMAC</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am excited to explore the lesser known world of rare minerals and how these unique commodities are central to the transition from thermal energy to more renewable forms of energy.&rdquo; said Commissioner Mersinger. &ldquo;It is important to investigate the role dynamic, robust derivatives markets could play in these markets. I am equally interested in hearing more about the potential impacts of the Basel III proposals on the derivatives markets, specifically around impacts on our energy derivatives markets and the resulting implications for household energy costs across the U.S.&rdquo;</p>

<title>ESMA Steps Up Its Monitoring Of EU Alternative Investment Funds And Sees Potential Risks In Funds Exposed To Leverage And Liquidity Mismatches</title>

<div> regulator, supervisor, ESMA, real estate funds, liquidity mismatches
Summary:<br /><br />The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) published a report highlighting the risks posed by real estate funds, particularly in the context of declining volumes and falling prices. The report also addressed risks posed by leveraged alternative investment funds (AIFs) and outlined measures taken by authorities to address these risks. ESMA will continue to work with National Competent Authorities (NCAs) to meet its financial stability objective. <div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, today published a<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-01/ESMA50-524821-3095_EU_Alternative_Investment_Funds_2023.pdf">&nbsp;report on the EU alternative investment funds (AIFs)&rsquo; market</a>&nbsp;and an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-01/ESMA60-1389274163-2572_TRV_article_-_Assessing_risks_posed_by_leveraged_AIFs_in_the_EU.pdf">article on the risks posed by leveraged AIFs in the EU</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify">ESMA confirms the risks posed by real estate (RE) funds, in a context of declining volumes of transactions and falling prices in several jurisdictions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify">Existing liquidity mismatches in AIFs are particularly heightened by the high share of open-ended RE funds, some of which offer daily liquidity. This vulnerability could be systemically relevant in jurisdictions where RE funds own a large share of the RE market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify">Looking at the full sector and specifically at the risks posed by leveraged AIFs, ESMA finds that:&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>the size of the sector declined slightly (-3%) to EUR 6.8tn in 2022 and AIFs account for 36% of the EU fund industry,&nbsp;</li>
<li>the fall in value was mainly driven by valuation losses for funds exposed to bonds and equities amid adverse market developments in 2022,&nbsp;</li>
<li>RE funds face multiple risks related to leverage, market footprint, valuation discrepancies and liquidity mismatches&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>leverage for hedge funds remains very high, and this may pose a risk of market impact. However, most of them also dispose of large levels of cash to address potential margin calls, which limits the risk of fire sales,&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>NCAs have reported risks posed by the Liability-Driven Investment (LDI) funds, which gain leveraged exposures to the UK government bond market. Risks have remained elevated, and the limits set after the severe stress experienced in September 2022 remain appropriate.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</div>
<br />
<div>
<p>In light of these findings, ESMA reports on the measure taken by authorities to address the risks identified, and will continue to work with the NCAs to meet ESMA&rsquo;s financial stability objective.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Background</span></h4>
</div>
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify">The two documents contribute to ESMA&rsquo;s financial stability objective. They are part of ESMA&rsquo;s monitoring framework on AIFs, including market development and key risk metrics, such as leverage and liquidity. They foster a common supervisory approach of the data reported under AIFMD between ESMA and the NCAs.</p>

<p class="paragraph">DFM experienced significant market capitalization growth, rising from AED 582 billion in the end of 2022 to AED 688 billion in the same period of 2023.

<title>Statement On The Denial Of A Rulemaking Petition Regarding The Commission’s No-Admit/No-Deny Policy, SEC Chair Gary Gensler, Jan. 30, 2024</title>

<div> denied, Petition, Rulemaking, no-admit/no-deny policy, settlement
<br />
The Commission denied a Petition for Rulemaking to amend the no-admit/no-deny policy, citing its importance in avoiding false impressions of guilt. Settlements are significant for both the SEC and defendants, and altering the policy would diminish the impact of enforcement settlements and undermine the value provided by public recitation of the facts. The Commission's discretion in regulatory agenda is crucial.
<br /><br />Summary: The Commission denied a Petition for Rulemaking to amend the no-admit/no-deny policy, citing its importance in avoiding false impressions of guilt. Settlements are significant for both the SEC and defendants, and altering the policy would diminish the impact of enforcement settlements and undermine the value provided by public recitation of the facts. The Commission's discretion in regulatory agenda is crucial. <div>
<p>Today, the Commission denied a Petition for Rulemaking<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-denial-rulemaking-petition-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;to amend Rule 202.5(e), more commonly known as the Commission&rsquo;s no-admit/no-deny policy. I was pleased to support the Commission&rsquo;s decision.</p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s no admit/no deny policy was adopted in 1972. As the Commission said at the time: &ldquo;The Commission has adopted the policy that in any civil lawsuit brought by it or in any administrative proceeding of an accusatory nature pending before it, it is important to avoid creating, or permitting to be created, an impression that a decree is being entered or a sanction imposed, when the conduct alleged did not, in fact, occur.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-denial-rulemaking-petition-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>As the Commission under then-Chair Bill Casey said at the time of the adoption: &ldquo;a refusal to admit the allegations is equivalent to a denial, unless the defendant or respondent states that he neither admits nor denies the allegations.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-denial-rulemaking-petition-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Entering into a settlement is a consequential choice for both the SEC and the defendant. The Commission, in agreeing to settle a case, is relinquishing the opportunity to present the case in court. The defendant, on the other hand, relinquishes the right to defend the case in court, in the press, and in the eyes of the public. Both parties are agreeing to a set of terms based upon this 1972 policy.</p>
<p>More than 50 years on, I think this policy has served the public and the Commission well. I believe that amending this policy in the manner proposed by the Petitioner would alter the impact of enforcement settlements if defendants could deny any wrongdoing in the court of public opinion and dismiss sanctions as the cost of doing business without the Commission being able to revive its ability to have its day in court.</p>
<p>Further, an essential component of settlements is the public recitation of the facts. It informs the market as to what conduct is violative of the securities laws. It alerts investors that the Commission seeks to deter that conduct, and it helps other market participants comply with the law. A settlement that allows the denial of wrongdoing undermines the value provided by the recitation of the facts, and it muddies the message to the public.</p>
<p>Finally, an important part of the Commission&rsquo;s responsibility is determining how best to deploy the resources that Congress entrusts to us. We thoughtfully consider the timing and priorities of our regulatory agenda and how to best utilize our talented and hardworking staff. Discretion to determine the priorities of our regulatory agenda, especially with respect to discretionary rulemaking like that requested by the Petitioner, is a critical element of our ability to faithfully execute Congress&rsquo;s mandate. It is important that the Commission maintain discretion to direct focus to whichever parts of the capital markets need updated regulation.</p>

<title>The UK Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) Fines HSBC £57,417,500 For Failures In Deposit Protection Identification And Notification</title>

<div> Keywords: HSBC, PRA, fine, depositor protection failings, enforcement policies

Summary: 
- The PRA fined HSBC Bank plc and HSBC UK Bank plc £57,417,500 for historic depositor protection failings.
- The failings included inaccurately identifying deposits eligible for FSCS protection, breaching Fundamental Rules and Depositor Protection Rules, and lack of cooperation with the PRA.
- The Firms' cooperation and early admission of breaches resulted in a 45% reduction in the fine.
- The Bank of England and the PRA published revised enforcement policies to speed up investigations and incentivize early admissions.
- Both HBUK and HBEU were found to have breached multiple rules and procedures, leading to the second largest fine imposed by the PRA. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><section class="page-section">
<p>The PRA has fined&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk156809611"></a>HSBC Bank plc (<strong>HBEU</strong>) and HSBC UK Bank plc (<strong>HBUK</strong>) (together, the<strong>&nbsp;Firms</strong>) &pound;57,417,500 for historic depositor protection failings arising from the Firms&rsquo; failures over many years to properly implement the requirements set out in the Depositor Protection Rules. These included the failure to accurately identify deposits that were eligible for Financial Services Compensation Scheme (<strong>FSCS</strong>) protection. The failings occurred for HBEU between 2015 and 2022, and for HBUK between 2018 and 2021. This fine, the second highest imposed by the PRA, reflects the seriousness of the failings.</p>
<h3>HSBC Fine</h3>
<p>The Depositor Protection Rules require firms to put in place adequate systems and controls, and governance, to ensure the integrity of critical information which the FSCS relies upon to make prompt payments to depositors in the event of a firm failure. HBEU&rsquo;s depositor protection failings were so significant the PRA determined that it had materially undermined the firm&rsquo;s readiness for resolution.</p>
<p>HBEU also failed to be duly open and cooperative with the PRA in not alerting the PRA over an approximately 15-month period about problems identified in the incorrect marking of accounts as &ldquo;eligible&rdquo; for FSCS protection. This was clearly information which the PRA would expect firms to share fully and in a timely way.</p>
<p>This meant the Firms breached Fundamental Rules 2 and 6, as well as Depositor Protection Rules 11, 12 and 14. HBEU was also found to have breached Depositor Protection Rule 50, and Fundamental Rules 7 and 8. This is the first PRA enforcement action in relation to Fundamental Rule 8, which states that firm must prepare for resolution so, if the need arises, it can be resolved in an orderly manner with a minimum disruption of critical services.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Woods, Deputy Governor for Prudential Regulation and Chief Executive Officer of the PRA, said:</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;The serious failings in this case go to the heart of the PRA&rsquo;s safety and soundness objective. It is vital that all banks comply fully with our requirements around preparedness for resolution. HBEU fell far short of its obligations in this area, and failed to disclose its failings to us in a timely manner. These failures led to today&rsquo;s action, including the significant fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Firms&rsquo; failings included:</p>
<ul>
<li>The failure to assign clear ownership for the processes required under the Depositor Protection Rules; and</li>
<li>The failure to ensure that a senior manager, under the Senior Managers and Certification Regime, was allocated responsibility for these processes and the integrity of the information required under the Depositor Protection Rules.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>HBEU&rsquo;s failings further included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incorrectly marking 99% of its eligible beneficiary deposits as &lsquo;ineligible&rsquo; for FSCS protection;</li>
<li>Providing an incorrect attestation to the PRA confirming its systems satisfied certain requirements of the Depositor Protection Rules; and</li>
<li>Failing to produce finalised versions of annual reports required to be signed by its board of directors that confirmed compliance with the requirements of the Depositor Protection Rules for multiple years.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>The Firms&rsquo; cooperation throughout the investigation, including the early admission of certain rule breaches, resulted in a 15% reduction to the penalty. The Firms agreed to resolve the matter and therefore qualified for a further 30% reduction in the fine. Without these reductions, the fine imposed by the PRA would have been &pound;96.5m. The PRA does not consider that the Firms&rsquo; breaches were deliberate or reckless.</p>
<h3>The Bank of England publishes new enforcement policies</h3>
<p>Following a period of consultation, the Bank of England (<strong>Bank</strong>) and the PRA today have also published Policy Statement PS1/24, which sets out the revised approach to enforcement for both PRA firms and financial market infrastructure firms. This includes revisions to the procedures of the Bank&rsquo;s Enforcement Decision Making Committee (<strong>EDMC</strong>). The revised policies set out a new path for early cooperation and greater incentives for early admissions with the aim of speeding up investigations in appropriate cases. PS1/24 further sets out the PRA&rsquo;s policies and procedures for making supervisory and non-enforcement statutory notice decisions. Today&rsquo;s fine imposed by the PRA on HBEU and HBUK was under the PRA&rsquo;s pre-existing penalty policy.</p>
<p>The Bank expects to consult on further amendments to its enforcement policies in 2024, reflecting the additional powers granted under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2023.</p>

<title>Unsettling Silence: Dissent From Denial Of Request For Rulemaking To Amend 17 C.F.R. § 202.5(e), SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, Jan. 30, 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/unsettling-silence-dissent-from-denial-of-request-for-rulemaking-to-amend-17-c/</link>

<div> Keywords: Commission, settlement, denial, First Amendment, enforcement actions

Summary:<br />
- The Commission's gag rule prevents individuals from criticizing government actions during settlements, raising First Amendment concerns.
- The necessity and justification for the gag rule are questionable as it lacks firm footing in terms of protecting the Commission's reputation.
- The policy results in content-specific and permanent restraints on speech, potentially shielding the Commission's allegations from legitimate criticism.
- The requirement that defendants must either admit wrongdoing or promise not to deny the allegations as a condition of settlement has not been widely adopted by federal agencies, raising concerns about fairness and due process.
- The mandatory nature of the no-deny clause presents defendants with no real choice, undermining their constitutional rights.
- The ambiguity in the language of the no-deny clause creates uncertainty about what constitutes a prohibited action or statement, further restricting free speech. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>I dissent from the Commission&rsquo;s denial of a petition to amend Rule 202.5(e), our so-called gag rule.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp; This&nbsp;<i>de facto</i>&nbsp;rule follows from the Commission&rsquo;s enforcement of its policy, adopted in 1972, that it will not &ldquo;permit a defendant or respondent to consent to a judgment or order that imposes a sanction while denying the allegations in the complaint or order for proceedings.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp; In that same policy, the Commission articulated its belief &ldquo;that a refusal to admit the allegations is equivalent to a denial, unless the defendant or respondent states that he neither admits nor denies the allegations.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp; These two strands&mdash;the refusal to settle with persons who deny the allegations and the belief that refusing to admit is a denial&mdash;converge in the requirement that to settle with the Commission, a person must either (1) admit the allegations underlying the Commission&rsquo;s enforcement action or (2) state that she neither admits nor denies the allegations.</p>
<p>To compel compliance with the no-deny prong of the policy, the Commission requires settling defendants to agree that they &ldquo;will not take any action or make or permit to be made any public statement denying, directly or indirectly, any allegation in the complaint or creating the impression that the complaint is without factual basis&rdquo; and also &ldquo;will not make or permit to be made any public statement to the effect that Defendant does not admit the allegations of the complaint, or that this Consent contains no admission of the allegations, without also stating that Defendant does not deny the allegations.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp; The Commission further requires the settling defendant to &ldquo;withdraw[] any papers filed in this action to the extent that they deny any allegations in the complaint.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp; Finally, the Commission&rsquo;s mandatory language states that &ldquo;[i]f Defendant breaches this agreement, the Commission may petition the Court to vacate the Final Judgment and restore this action to its active docket.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp; The net result is that the settling defendant, for the action to stay settled, must agree both to rescind her past in-court statements contesting the truth of the Commission&rsquo;s allegations and promise never again to contest the truth of the Commission&rsquo;s allegations herself, or even permit others to contest the allegations.</p>
<p>In October 2018, the New Civil Liberties Alliance (NCLA) asked us to revise Rule 202.5(c) to read as follows:</p>
<p>The Commission has adopted the policy that in any civil lawsuit brought by it or in any administrative proceeding of an accusatory nature pending before it, a defendant or respondent may consent to a judgment or order in which he admits, denies, or states that he neither admits nor denies the allegations in the complaint or order for proceedings.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>I agree with the petitioner that this issue warrants a spot on our rulemaking agenda.&nbsp; One thing I love about this country is that Americans can and often do criticize their government. &nbsp;Without fearing reprisal, a person can condemn specific government actions, broad government policies, or the officials who carry out those actions and make those policies. &nbsp;This freedom to speak against the government and government officials is essential in a free society committed to the preeminence of the people. &nbsp;Of course, some criticisms of government policies, practices, or personnel may be baseless, but the American public, not government censors, should be the arbiters of validity. &nbsp;Our prohibition on denials prevents the American public from ever hearing criticisms that might otherwise be lodged against the government, let alone assessing their credibility.&nbsp; The policy of denying defendants the right to criticize publicly a settlement after it is signed is unnecessary, undermines regulatory integrity, and raises First Amendment concerns.</p>

<p>When the Commission adopted the policy in 1972, it included a brief statement explaining why it needed the policy: &ldquo;it is important to avoid creating, or permitting to be created, an impression that a decree is being entered or a sanction imposed, when the conduct alleged did not, in fact, occur.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp; This concern seems largely theoretical.&nbsp; Even if the concern is real, the imprudent policy adopted in November 1972 is not the right way to protect the Commission&rsquo;s reputation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Commission devoted significant resources to evaluating its enforcement program in 1972.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp; In January 1972, Chairman William Casey created a three-member committee to &ldquo;examine the SEC&rsquo;s enforcement policy and practices, engage in frequent dialogue with the members of the Commission and with our staff, seek and sift the suggestions of the bar and make recommendations to the Commission for worthwhile improvements to our time-honored ways.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp; The June 1, 1972 Report of the Advisory Committee on Enforcement Policies and Practices&mdash;now commonly referred to as the Wells Report&mdash;included a lengthy discussion about the settlement of Commission enforcement actions, and made several recommendations related to the settlement process.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp; The Commission had decades of experience settling cases, through both settlements on a no-admit/no-deny basis and settlements allowing defendants to deny wrongdoing.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to some of these settlements, defendants issued flat denials of wrongdoing.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp; But neither the Wells Report nor Chairman Casey&rsquo;s lengthy ruminations on it discuss problems arising from settling defendants later denying the factual basis of the Commission&rsquo;s case.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp; Given the broad remit of the Committee and its public comment process,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;if problematic denials were common, the Committee and Commission would have heard about them.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>&nbsp; In the intervening years, when defendants have made denials contrary to the policy,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>&nbsp;such denials do not seem to have undermined the Commission&rsquo;s enforcement program. &nbsp;The absence of a public record specific to the adoption of the policy, the conclusory explanation of its necessity, and the absence of actual evidence of a problem weigh in favor of reexamining the policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The requirement that defendants must either admit or at least promise not to deny the government&rsquo;s allegations of wrongdoing as a condition of settlement has not been widely adopted by federal agencies.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a>&nbsp; Some agencies even explicitly allow settling defendants to deny the allegations of wrongdoing.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>&nbsp; As the Federal Trade Commission noted when approving one such settlement in 2012, it was confident in the work of its staff:</p>
<p>it is the evidentiary record developed by FTC staff during the course of its investigation, not any ensuing settlement agreement, that forms the basis for the action by Commission.&nbsp; A respondent&rsquo;s denial of liability in a consent agreement does not diminish staff&rsquo;s extensive investigation or the ability of the Commission to find a reasonable basis to finalize a settlement or to enforce an order that results from settlement negotiations.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></p>
<p>The FTC&rsquo;s Consent Order Procedures explicitly allow settlement agreements to &ldquo;state that the signing thereof is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by any party that the law has been violated as alleged in the complaint.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our staff&rsquo;s investigative work likewise would stand on its own even if we permitted defendant denials.</p>
<h2>II.</h2>
<p>Even apart from the scant factual basis for the Commission&rsquo;s given reason for needing the no-deny policy, it should be reexamined because a regulatory policy that prevents people from speaking against government action necessarily raises First Amendment concerns. &nbsp;Prohibiting a person from taking &ldquo;any action to make . . . any public statement that the complaint is without factual basis&rdquo; is a plain prior restraint on speech.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a>&nbsp; Prohibiting that same person from &ldquo;permit[ting] to be made any public statement that the complaint is without factual basis&rdquo; only exacerbates the problem by imposing on the defendant an obligation to restrain speech by others.&nbsp; Moreover, this content-specific and permanent restraint on speech effectively shields the Commission&rsquo;s allegations from criticism: as long as you live, you are bound not only to say nothing that the Commission believes &ldquo;directly or indirectly&rdquo; denies the complaint's allegations, but you also must never say anything that even &ldquo;create[s] the impression&rdquo; of a denial.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the obvious First Amendment ramifications of the no-deny policy, it is unsurprising that a court recently characterized the Commission&rsquo;s use of the no-denial provision as &ldquo;at a minimum . . . inconsistent with the spirit of the First Amendment and our Nation&rsquo;s time-honored tradition of protecting free expression.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a>&nbsp; The court continued by observing that:</p>
<p>[H]ere, the Provision is used by an agency of the federal government to shield itself from public view. This may inflict precisely the kind of societal harm the Founders adopted the First Amendment to protect against . . . . &nbsp;The upshot: so long as a defendant says what the SEC wants to hear (or says nothing at all), he does not violate the No-Admit-No-Deny Provision. This is quintessential viewpoint discrimination.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a></p>
<p>In its letter denying the NCLA&rsquo;s rulemaking petition, the Commission sidesteps First Amendment concerns. &nbsp;The Commission explains that &ldquo;a defendant can waive constitutional rights as part of a civil settlement.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a>&nbsp; In the Commission&rsquo;s telling, &ldquo;[a]s part of the settlement process, the Commission and a defendant negotiate terms,&rdquo; and &ldquo;if either party disagrees with terms that the other party views as necessary, [it] can decline to settle, and the Commission must bear its burdens of proof and persuasion in court.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission even suggests that&nbsp;<i>it</i>&nbsp;is the party making a sacrifice in settling instead of litigating because it is &ldquo;thereby forgoing its ability to prove its case in court.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a>&nbsp; Never mind that forgoing its day in court yields great benefits for the Commission.&nbsp; When it settles, the Commission does not need to prove the allegations in court&mdash;which is expensive, time-consuming, and difficult&mdash;and it gets a benefit it could never obtain through litigation&mdash;the permanent silence of the defendant.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s questionable claim that it is the party making significant concessions is not the most concerning aspect of the Commission&rsquo;s reasoning.&nbsp; That distinction goes to its casual assumption that defending litigation with the Commission is just like defending against any other plaintiff in a civil action.&nbsp; One suspects that defendants in Commission enforcement actions might view the matter differently.&nbsp; For most individuals, and even for many well-resourced corporate defendants, the time, expense, and difficulty of litigating against the federal government makes settling the only economically viable option to resolve Commission enforcement actions. &nbsp;Commission investigations preceding the settlement negotiations are themselves long and costly.&nbsp; Retaining counsel to respond to the Commission&rsquo;s document requests and subpoenas, to represent witnesses during sworn testimony, and to prepare and submit a response to a Wells notice (which allows defendants to respond to charges the staff is planning to recommend to the Commission) consumes enormous financial resources.&nbsp; Add to that monetary cost, the intangible yet often even more onerous emotional, physical, and relational tolls of litigation, and it is unremarkable that nearly all defendants in Commission actions settle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The inevitable mismatch between the Commission and most defendants in its enforcement actions carries through to the settlement process.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a>&nbsp; Even when the disparities in bargaining power between the Commission and the defendant are less pronounced, the no-deny clause is a mandatory, non-negotiable term.&nbsp; The Commission admits as much in its denial letter: &ldquo;[t]he policy binds the Enforcement staff&rdquo; and the Commission &ldquo;will not agree to a settlement . . . unless the defendant agrees not to publicly deny the allegations in the complaint.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a>&nbsp; As one judge recently put it, the mandatory nature of the no-deny policy presents defendants with no real choice; it demands: &ldquo;If you want to settle, . . . &lsquo;Hold your tongue, and don&rsquo;t say anything truthful&mdash;ever&rsquo;&mdash;or get bankrupted by having to continue litigating with the SEC.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a></p>
<p>The demand by the government that a defendant waive a fundamental constitutional right as a condition of settlement ought to be supported by a compelling rationale. &nbsp;Yet, as discussed above, the Commission&rsquo;s rationale of record&mdash;that the no-deny policy is necessary to &ldquo;avoid creating, or permitting to be created, an impression that a decree is being entered or a sanction imposed, when the conduct alleged did not, in fact occur&rdquo;&mdash;lacks firm footing.&nbsp; It would look bad if the SEC&rsquo;s settlements were shown to be baseless, unfairly negotiated, or legally flawed. The most logical solution to that concern, however, is to make sure that settlements are rooted in fact, are fairly negotiated, and are legally sound.&nbsp; Employing superior bargaining power to extract an agreement that defendants agree not to denigrate the settlement is a suboptimal solution.</p>
<p>In the end, far from shoring up the Commission&rsquo;s integrity, the reliance on these no-denial conditions undermines it. More than a decade ago, a court aptly explained the problematic perceptions that flow from the Commission&rsquo;s practice of settling without admissions and prohibiting denials:</p>
<p>[H]ere an agency of the United States is saying, in effect, &ldquo;Although we claim that these defendants have done terrible things, they refuse to admit it and we do not propose to prove it, but will simply resort to gagging their right to deny it. &rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a></p>
<p>Why should the public put much weight on allegations so flimsy that they need the protection of a contractual obligation not to deny them? &nbsp;Stated differently, &ldquo;What is the SEC so afraid of?&nbsp; Any criticism, apparently&mdash;or, rather, anything that may even &lsquo;create the impression&rsquo; of criticism&mdash;of that government agency.<a name="_Hlk157406302">&rdquo;</a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The public cannot be sure what to believe if the government actively seeks to squelch contrary voices. &nbsp;As the FTC has observed, a government regulator that is confident in its investigative work, procedural practices, and legal analysis does not need to demand silence on the part of settling defendants.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a>&nbsp; Other commentators have pointed out that &ldquo;[d]efendants who have been through an agency&rsquo;s enforcement process are often the most informed and in the best position to raise red flags about that process,&rdquo; so, by silencing them, &ldquo;the agencies insulate themselves from criticism and the public scrutiny that accountability demands.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowing people to talk freely about their experiences with the Commission would aid us in carrying out our mission.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a></p>
<h2>III.</h2>
<p>Because no-admit/no-deny settlements are the most common resolution of SEC enforcement actions, the rule at issue affects countless potential speakers. &nbsp;Given that all of these silenced speakers have been on the wrong end of an enforcement action, we can assume that some might have negative things&mdash;whether accurate or not&mdash;to say about the government. &nbsp;The gravity of silencing this subset of people weighs heavily on me. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Defenders of our policy might take comfort in the scope of the policy&mdash;after all, you can say bad things about the agency, just not about your settlement.&nbsp; To the contrary, the Commission&rsquo;s mandatory language is so ambiguous as to only aggravate my concerns. &nbsp;Defendants must agree that they will not &ldquo;indirectly&rdquo; deny &ldquo;any allegation in the complaint.&rdquo;&nbsp; What is an &ldquo;indirect&rdquo; denial?&nbsp; Defendants must also agree not to &ldquo;take any action&rdquo; that &ldquo;create[s] the impression that the complaint is without factual basis.&rdquo;&nbsp; What is an action that &ldquo;create[s] the impression&rdquo; that the complaint lacks a factual basis?&nbsp; A defendant looking at this language is not going to have any idea where it ends.&nbsp; Could she say that &ldquo;The Commission&rsquo;s enforcement process is a joke.&nbsp; Nobody should trust it to produce just results.&rdquo;? &nbsp;What if she stands outside the Commission&rsquo;s headquarters with a pile of salt, a copy of the complaint, and a sign that states &ldquo;Take these together.&rdquo; &nbsp;What if she places on a billboard the message &ldquo;SEC = Seriously Erroneous Complaints&rdquo;?&nbsp; In either case, has she &ldquo;create[d] the impression that the complaint is without factual basis&rdquo;?&nbsp; Can a defendant tell a post-settlement joke: &ldquo;How many SEC Commissioners does it take to screw in a lightbulb? &nbsp;Zero, because they prefer to let the truth languish in the dark.&rdquo;? &nbsp;What if she publishes a book with additional facts that were not included in the complaint, and those facts cast the entire case in an entirely different light?&nbsp; Has she then &ldquo;create[d] the impression&rdquo; that the complaint lacked a factual basis?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s requirement that a defendant agree not to &ldquo;permit&rdquo; denials of the allegations in the complaint is equally problematic.&nbsp; This language suggests that defendants have an affirmative obligation to stop other people from saying things that might cast doubt on the complaint&rsquo;s allegations.&nbsp; Must a settling defendant stop her husband from posting on social media his disagreement with the charges in his wife&rsquo;s settlement with the Commission?&nbsp; Must a defendant require subsequent employers to link to the settlement in the otherwise flattering profiles they post on their websites?&nbsp; Probably not, but the mandatory language nevertheless is troublingly nebulous.&nbsp; To obtain Commission authorization to file an enforcement action in district court, the Division of Enforcement is required to submit to the Commission an action memorandum that &ldquo;provides a comprehensive explanation of the . . . factual and legal foundation&rdquo; for the recommended civil action.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Enforcement Manual, however, does not require that the Division include with the action memorandum a copy of the district court complaint.</p>
<p>The petitioner is correct that reconsideration of the rule is a pressing matter that belongs on the Commission&rsquo;s current notice-and-comment rulemaking agenda. &nbsp;Or, if my colleagues have concluded that our agenda is too packed with other projects, perhaps we can just drop the no-deny rule in the same unceremonious way we adopted it.</p>

<div> priorities, market structures, corporate governance, CCPs, ESG issues
Summary: 
The World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) has announced the 2024 priorities for the exchange and clearing industry. These include fostering better corporate governance, ensuring the stability of central clearing, leading on ESG issues, providing educational qualifications, and addressing new technologies such as crypto market design and AI. The WFE aims to advocate for these priorities and promote sustainable growth. <br /><br /> <div>
<p><span>The World Federation of Exchanges (WFE), the global industry group for exchanges and CCPs, today announces the 2024 priorities for the exchange and clearing industry.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>As the foundation of the financial system, regulated market infrastructure providers seek to engender the trust of all those who depend on neutral, responsible public markets. Each new year offers an opportunity to underscore this mandate and reaffirm this commitment.</span><br /><br /><span>In 2024, the WFE&rsquo;s priorities will focus on fostering efficient market structures that are resilient, robust, fair, transparent and stable in the midst of both uncertainty and innovation.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>The priorities:</span><br /><span>1. Fostering better corporate governance in the entire financial ecosystem. At present, scrutiny focuses largely on those entities that are already regulated and within legal parameters.</span><br /><br /><span>2.&nbsp;The CCPs&rsquo; reassurance promise. Fifteen years on from the biggest financial crisis in living memory, and four years after a global pandemic, central clearing remains the steadying influence in markets. The WFE&rsquo;s focus in 2024 will be on procyclicality, recovery &amp; resolution and transparency and proportionate capital rules.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>3. How market infrastructures can lead on ESG issues such as standardization, harmonization and reporting frameworks, as has been the case with the creation of the WFE Green Equities principles.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>4. WFE Education: As the WFE&rsquo;s&nbsp;</span><a href="https://world-exchanges.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=48ddcbc11eb58f141a51219ea&amp;id=1010433407&amp;e=979576350c" target="_blank">Market Infrastructure Certificate</a><span>&nbsp;continues to gather momentum, entering its second year, we&rsquo;ll focus on rolling out the educational qualifications that will be vital to the next generation of leaders.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>5. New technologies, including the evolution of crypto market design, as these new markets begin to grow closer to regulated exchange markets, and the role of AI. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>As the global association for the industry, the WFE unites its members as one voice to work towards achieving these priorities, underpinned by our four strategic pillars of advocacy, education, emerging markets and post-trade. The WFE, which represents more than 250 market infrastructures worldwide, will build on its policy and research work across all the priority areas, and will continue to develop industry consensus positions, best practice, standards and industry guidance, in addition to working on emerging trends.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>The WFE seeks to engage in, and promote, market development that leads to optimal outcomes in the future and fosters sustainable growth. Our longer-term work around understanding, defining and quantifying the economic and social role of exchanges and CCPs continues, so that we ensure the industry remains close to the issues that affect its stakeholders.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><strong>Nandini Sukumar, CEO at the WFE</strong><span>, said: &ldquo;The WFE Board has determined the key priorities and issues we will focus on this year. With the WFE&rsquo;s unique position and global view of market structures, our access to data and information, reinforced by our own analysis &amp; research, and the expertise we have built up through experience, we look forward to engaging with stakeholders in 2024 and championing the role of public markets and market-based finance.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Home finance remains a needlessly fragmented process,&rdquo; Bowler added. &ldquo;Fortunately, ICE has a proven playbook for streamlining and connecting complex financial transactions through digitization. Our significant investments in mortgage technology and data are allowing us to automate and accelerate elements of the process from start to finish &ndash; all to the benefit of the American home buyer or owner.

Summary:<br />On 17 January 2024, the National Regulatory Authorities of the Hansa region requested a 6-month extension from ACER to agree on the TSOs' proposed cross-zonal capacity calculation methodology for the balancing timeframe. The methodology concerns the rules for capacity calculation and is crucial for ensuring the stability of the electricity transmission system. ACER aims to reach a decision by mid-March. <div>
<p>On 17 January 2024, the National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) of the Hansa capacity calculation region requested a six-month extension from ACER to agree on the Transmission System Operators&rsquo; (TSOs&rsquo;) proposed cross-zonal capacity calculation methodology for the balancing timeframe in the Hansa region.</p>
<p>The Hansa region comprises 6 countries: Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, and Sweden.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is the methodology about?</span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

<title>SEC Charges Founder Of $1.7 Billion “HyperFund” Crypto Pyramid Scheme And Top Promoter with Fraud - Promoter Brenda Chunga (aka Bitcoin Beautee) Agrees To Settle Fraud And Unregistered Offering Charges</title>

<div> charged, fraudulent, pyramid scheme, crypto asset, investors
<br />
The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Xue Lee and Brenda Chunga for their involvement in a fraudulent crypto asset pyramid scheme known as HyperFund, which raised over $1.7 billion from investors. Lee and Chunga promoted membership packages, guaranteeing high returns, but the scheme collapsed in 2022, leaving investors unable to make withdrawals.
<br /><br />Summary: The SEC charged Xue Lee and Brenda Chunga for their involvement in a fraudulent crypto asset pyramid scheme, known as HyperFund, which raised over $1.7 billion. Lee and Chunga promoted membership packages, guaranteeing high returns, but the scheme collapsed in 2022, leaving investors unable to make withdrawals. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Xue Lee (aka Sam Lee) and Brenda Chunga (aka Bitcoin Beautee) for their involvement in a fraudulent crypto asset pyramid scheme known as HyperFund that raised more than $1.7 billion from investors worldwide.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, from June 2020 through early 2022, Lee and Chunga promoted HyperFund &ldquo;membership&rdquo; packages, which they claimed guaranteed investors high returns, including from HyperFund&rsquo;s supposed crypto asset mining operations and associations with a Fortune 500 company. As the complaint alleges, however, Lee and Chunga knew or were reckless in not knowing that HyperFund was a pyramid scheme and had no real source of revenue other than funds received from investors. In 2022, the HyperFund scheme collapsed and investors were no longer able to make withdrawals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As alleged in our complaint, Lee and Chunga attracted investors with the allure of profits from crypto asset mining, but the only thing that HyperFund mined was its investors&rsquo; pockets,&rdquo; said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;This case illustrates yet again how noncompliance in the crypto space facilitates schemes where promoters capitalize on the promise of easy money, without providing the detailed investor protection disclosures required by the registration provisions of the federal securities laws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in federal district court in the District of Maryland, charges Lee and Chunga with violating the anti-fraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, conduct-based injunctions preventing the defendants from participating in multi-level marketing or crypto asset offerings, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. Chunga agreed to settle the charges, to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the charged provisions and certain other activity, and to pay disgorgement and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a future date. The settlement is subject to court approval. The charges against Lee will be litigated.</p>
<p>In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the District of Maryland today announced criminal charges against Lee and Chunga. Chunga pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s ongoing investigation is being conducted by David Snyder and Assunta Vivolo of the SEC&rsquo;s Crypto Assets &amp; Cyber Unit (CACU). It is being supervised by David Hirsch and Jorge Tenreiro of the CACU and Nicholas Grippo and Scott Thompson of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be conducted by Judson Mihok and Gregory Bockin of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the District of Maryland; the Department of Justice, Fraud Section;&nbsp;Homeland Security Investigations New York; and the IRS.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy directs investors to resources on detecting and avoiding pyramid schemes. Investors can find additional information about pyramid schemes at Investor.gov.</p>

<title>US Justice Department: Three Individuals Charged For Roles In $1.89B Cryptocurrency Fraud Scheme</title>

<div> charged, cryptocurrency fraud, guilty plea, $1.89 billion, HyperFund <br />
The Justice Department announced charges for orchestrating a $1.89 billion cryptocurrency fraud scheme. Sam Lee, an Australian citizen, was charged for co-founding HyperFund, while Rodney Burton and Brenda Chunga were promoters. They falsely represented substantial returns from cryptocurrency mining operations, and HyperFund began to block investor withdrawals.<br /><br />Summary: The Justice Department announced charges for orchestrating a $1.89 billion cryptocurrency fraud scheme. Sam Lee, an Australian citizen, was charged for co-founding HyperFund, while Rodney Burton and Brenda Chunga were promoters. They falsely represented substantial returns from cryptocurrency mining operations, and HyperFund began to block investor withdrawals. <div>
<p>The Justice Department today announced charges against two individuals and the guilty plea of a third individual for orchestrating a $1.89 billion cryptocurrency fraud scheme.</p>
<p>Sam Lee, 35, an Australian citizen residing in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, was charged in an indictment unsealed today for allegedly co-founding HyperFund, also known as HyperTech, HyperCapital, HyperVerse, and HyperNation. Rodney Burton, 54, of Miami, and Brenda Chunga, 43, of Severna Park, Maryland, were promotors of HyperFund.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The defendants are charged with defrauding investors to the tune of $1.89 billion. As alleged in court documents, the defendants falsely represented that investors would receive substantial returns paid from cryptocurrency mining operations, which did not in fact exist,&rdquo; said Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri&nbsp;of the Justice Department&rsquo;s Criminal Division. &ldquo;With our partners in Homeland Security Investigations and IRS Criminal Investigation, we are committed to uncovering sophisticated frauds involving cryptocurrency and digital assets and bringing those who perpetrate them to justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The level of alleged fraud here is staggering,&rdquo; said U.S. Attorney Erek L. Barron for the District of Maryland. &ldquo;Whether it&rsquo;s cryptocurrency fraud, or any other financial frauds, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. This office and our law enforcement partners will hold perpetrators accountable for these and other fraud schemes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to court documents, from June 2020 to November 2022, Lee and his co-conspirators allegedly offered and sold investment contracts to the public through HyperFund&rsquo;s online investment platform. HyperFund&rsquo;s promotional materials allegedly made various false claims, including that investors who purchased HyperFund &ldquo;memberships&rdquo; would receive between 0.5% to 1% daily in passive rewards until the company either doubled or tripled the investor&rsquo;s initial investment. To convince investors that HyperFund could make such payments, HyperFund allegedly claimed that its payments would be disbursed in part from its revenues from large-scale crypto mining operations, when in truth, HyperFund did not have such operations. Beginning in at least July 2021, HyperFund allegedly began to block investor withdrawals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s charges are a testament to the incredible work of HSI New York&rsquo;s El Dorado Task Force,&rdquo; said Acting Special Agent in Charge Erin Keegan of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) New York. &ldquo;I commend our law enforcement partners, including those at HSI Baltimore, for their outstanding collaboration. HSI will continue to protect American investors from financial predators.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The illegal activity alleged in this case is precisely the type of conduct IRS Criminal Investigation and our law enforcement partners are committed to deterring,&rdquo; said Acting Special Agent in Charge David Meisenheimer of the IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS:CI) Washington, D.C. Field Office. &ldquo;These charges send a clear message that we have the tools and internal fortitude to protect our financial systems by diligently investigating, prosecuting, and holding accountable those who seek to defraud the American public.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lee is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison. Burton is charged by criminal complaint with one count of conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business and one count of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. He also faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison on each count. Chunga pleaded guilty today to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud. She faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p>
<p>HSI New York&rsquo;s El Dorado Task Force and IRS:CI are investigating the case.</p>
<p>Trial Attorney Tian Huang of the Criminal Division&rsquo;s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Aaron S.J. Zelinsky and Spencer Todd for the District of Maryland are prosecuting the case. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you believe you are a victim in this case, please contact the Fraud Section&rsquo;s Victim Witness Unit toll-free at (888) 549-3945 or by email at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:victimassistance.fraud@usdoj.gov">victimassistance.fraud@usdoj.gov</a>.

<p><em>An indictment is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</em></p>

<p>Over the past three months, incoming data have remained consistent with a soft landing for the U.S. economy.&nbsp; Elevated labor force participation and the resolution of pandemic-era supply chain challenges have strengthened our economy&rsquo;s productive capacity, helping create space for strong economic growth while inflation continues to cool.&nbsp; Just last week, the Bureau of Economic Analysis&rsquo;s (BEA) advance estimate of gross domestic product (GDP) in the fourth quarter of 2023 surprised on the upside.&nbsp;While median forecasts expected annualized growth around 2.0 percent, the initial read of GDP growth was 3.3 percent at an annual rate.&nbsp; Real GDP rose 3.1 percent over the four quarters of 2023, the third strongest calendar year rate since before the Global Financial Crisis.&nbsp; In addition, employment growth moderated in the fourth quarter but remained well above rates needed to accommodate population growth.&nbsp;Importantly, labor supply remained elevated, allowing the unemployment rate to hold at low levels without adding inflationary pressures.&nbsp; Headline inflation cooled further as energy prices decreased on balance over the quarter, though further progress is needed to bring core inflation to a level consistent with the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s target.</p>
<p>Still, encouraging economic news in the fourth quarter does not assure similar performance in the current quarter.&nbsp; The economic situation can change quickly due to geopolitical and domestic events.&nbsp; Yet, despite many uncertainties and headwinds, the U.S. economy proved resilient and strong in 2023 and remains well-positioned as we move into 2024.&nbsp; The Administration remains focused on further expanding our economy&rsquo;s productive capacity as we implement significant investments in our nation&rsquo;s clean energy, manufacturing capacity, and infrastructure.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>REAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDP)</h3>
<p>Real GDP growth remained strong in the fourth quarter of 2023, rising by 3.3 percent at an annual rate, after exceptionally strong growth in the third quarter of 4.9 percent (see Table 1 &ndash; Real Gross Domestic Product).&nbsp; Significantly, growth in the fourth quarter was largely driven by underlying private domestic demand, including sustained momentum in personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and faster growth in business fixed investment.&nbsp;Over the four quarters of 2023, real GDP growth accelerated to 3.1 percent&mdash;the fastest annual pace this Administration and the third fastest annual pace since before the Global Financial Crisis.</p>
<p>Decomposing GDP into smaller components can be helpful in tracking the economy&rsquo;s performance.&nbsp; The four components we consider are: (1) private domestic final purchases (PDFP), the most persistent and stable components of output: personal consumption, business fixed investment, and residential investment; (2) government consumption and investment; (3) net international purchases (U.S. exports less U.S. imports); and (4) intermediate demand (or the change in private inventories).&nbsp;Examined separately, each component delivers specific information about activity in various sectors that can be useful in predicting the future path of growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first component, PDFP, is particularly important to analyze: it measures the private sector&rsquo;s capacity to drive self-sustaining growth and, therefore, may signal the direction of future economic performance.&nbsp; In the fourth quarter, real PDFP growth was a strong 2.6 percent at an annual rate, which accounted for 2.2 percentage points of total GDP growth.&nbsp; Although slowing modestly, personal consumption expenditure (PCE) growth remained close to the third quarter pace, as household finances were underpinned by strong labor market conditions and rising incomes in real terms.&nbsp; Spending on goods and services grew solidly.&nbsp; Household purchases of goods rose at a slower rate than in the third quarter.&nbsp; By contrast, the growth rate for consumption of services accelerated in the fourth quarter, driven by larger contributions from most components, save for expenditures on rent of rent of housing, food services, and financial service.&nbsp; On net, household spending on services accounted for roughly 55 percent of PCE&rsquo;s contribution to GDP growth.</p>
<p>Business fixed investment accelerated in the fourth quarter, reflecting growth in all three major components.&nbsp; Investment in equipment turned positive in the fourth quarter, while spending on intellectual property products grew for the fourteenth consecutive quarter.&nbsp; Meanwhile, investment in structures slowed sharply in the fourth quarter, dropping from 11.2 percent annualized in the third quarter to 3.2 percent&mdash;largely driven by less investment in commercial and health care buildings, as well as other structures.</p>
<p>Residential investment, the final component of PDFP, posted growth in the fourth quarter, marking this sector&rsquo;s first back-to-back quarters of expansion in three years.&nbsp; Although growth slowed to 1.0 percent in the final quarter of 2023 from 6.7 percent in the third quarter, the slower growth largely reflected weakness in brokers&rsquo; commissions and other types of residential investment, which partially offset a gain in single-family construction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other three components of GDP (government spending, net exports, and inventory changes) all made positive contributions to fourth quarter growth.&nbsp; Total government spending contributed solidly to growth in the fourth quarter, but paces of growth were softer at all levels of government&mdash;though state and local government expenditures accounted for more than two-thirds of the increase.&nbsp; International trade was a net positive contributor to real GDP growth as the increase in exports outweighed import growth, resulting in a narrower trade deficit in the fourth quarter.&nbsp; The change in private inventories, which can exhibit wide swings from quarter to quarter, added only slightly to growth in third quarter after a large contribution in the third quarter.&nbsp; Notably, this decline in the contribution from the change in private inventory investment explains most of the deceleration in real GDP growth from the third to the fourth quarters.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>LABOR MARKETS</h3>
<p>In the final quarter of 2023, the U.S. labor market exhibited solid employment gains, low unemployment, and stable labor force participation near post-pandemic highs.&nbsp; In addition, signs of cooling pointed to continuing realignment between labor demand and labor supply (see Table 2 &ndash; Labor Market Indicators).</p>
<p>The average pace of payroll job creation slowed in the fourth quarter to 165,000 per month.&nbsp; Although down from the third quarter average of 221,000 per month, the fourth quarter pace was still well above that needed to accommodate population growth.&nbsp; The unemployment rate also trended lower over the quarter and ended the year at 3.7 percent, down 0.1 percentage points from September.&nbsp; A broader measure of labor underutilization is the underemployment rate, which includes those working part-time for economic reasons and those marginally attached to the labor force.&nbsp; Although the underemployment rate stepped up to 7.1 percent at the end of the fourth quarter, it remains historically low; for comparison, the underemployment rate in 2019&mdash;a period generally viewed as a full-employment environment&mdash;averaged 7.2 percent throughout the year.&nbsp; Indeed, weekly unemployment insurance claims since late November have come in persistently below 2018 and 2019, when labor markets were likely at full employment.&nbsp; On average, initial unemployment claims (NSA) during the weeks ending January 13 and 20 were 12.0 percent below corresponding weeks in 2018 and 2019.&nbsp; Continuing claims data also have fallen below comparable 2018 and 2019 readings and are consistent with strong labor markets.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, labor supply and demand continued to realign in the fourth quarter.&nbsp; Labor supply held at or near post-pandemic highs: at 62.7 percent in the fourth quarter, total labor force participation was unchanged from the third quarter average.&nbsp; Although total LFPR edged down a bit in December, the year-end rate still was 62.5 percent&mdash;or 0.2 percentage points higher than a year earlier&mdash;while the prime-age (ages 25 to 54) LFPR was 83.2 percent, up 0.7 percentage points over the year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, demand for labor continued to ease.&nbsp; Job openings (or vacancies) have trended lower since peaking at 12.0 million in March 2022.&nbsp; This downtrend continued during the first two months of the fourth quarter (latest available data), during which the average number of job openings fell to 8.8 million, down 435,000 from the third quarter average.&nbsp; As a result, the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has declined from a peak of 2.0 in March 2022.&nbsp; As of November, there were 1.4 job openings per unemployed worker, down by 0.1 from the corresponding month in the third quarter.&nbsp; Although the ratio still is above the pre-pandemic high of 1.2, the downtrend since March 2022 confirms that labor demand and supply are realigning.</p>
<h3>INFLATION</h3>
<p>Headline inflation slowed considerably during the fourth quarter and, by the end of the quarter, was down on a year-over-year basis by nearly two-thirds of its peak in June 2022.&nbsp; Core inflation, meanwhile, maintained a steady pace throughout the third and further quarters; by the end of the year, core inflation was down roughly 40 percent from its peak in autumn of 2022.</p>
<p>As measured by the consumer price index (CPI), the average rate of monthly inflation during the fourth quarter was 0.1 percent, down from an average of 0.4 percent during the third quarter (see Table 3 &ndash; Inflation and Wage Growth Indicators).&nbsp; Headline inflation was held down by falling energy prices, which declined an average of 1.5 percent per month in the fourth quarter, after rising 2.4 percent on average in the third quarter.&nbsp; Despite the decline in energy prices in the fourth quarter, recent developments suggest upside price risk to energy and headline inflation.&nbsp; Geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and the Middle East, as well as OPEC+ production cuts, have added uncertainty to the energy outlook&mdash;though OPEC+ oil production cuts have encouraged output growth among non-OPEC+ countries, including the United States, and mitigated the price impact.&nbsp; For the other non-core components of inflation, average monthly food inflation was stable in the fourth quarter, remaining at the third quarter&rsquo;s average pace of 0.2 percent&mdash;that is, near rates seen prior to the pandemic.</p>
<p>Excluding energy and food, core CPI inflation remained stable in the second half of 2023&mdash;though inflation rates of core components diverged.&nbsp; Over the fourth quarter, core inflation averaged 0.3&nbsp;percent per month, unchanged from the third quarter.&nbsp; Core goods prices decreased for the second consecutive quarter&mdash;though the pace of deflation was roughly half that in the third quarter.&nbsp; By contrast, core services inflation remained elevated.&nbsp; Sustained upward pressure from rent of housing services (rent of primary residential and owners&rsquo; equivalent rent)&mdash;which is the largest share of core inflation&mdash;sets a high floor to core services inflation, though it has eased slowly.&nbsp; The fourth quarter pace of inflation for rent of housing services matched that of the previous two quarters but was 6.4 percent on a year-over-year basis in December, the slowest pace twelve-month pace since July 2022.&nbsp; For non-housing core services, inflation held steady&nbsp;at an elevated pace in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Inflation as measured by the PCE price index&nbsp;assigns different weights for different components and uses a different methodology in its calculation than the CPI.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the drivers of both measures of inflation and the patterns in the fourth quarter are broadly similar.</p>
<h3>HOUSING MARKETS</h3>
<p>New Residential Construction: On net, new home construction supported economic activity in the fourth quarter, with growth rates of all but the early stages of home building improving relative to the third quarter (see Table 4 &ndash; Housing Market Indicators).&nbsp; The pace of growth of total building permits&mdash;which precede future home construction&mdash;slowed slightly due to more moderate growth in the single-family sector.&nbsp; Multi-family permits, meanwhile, declined at a slower pace, extending the downtrend that began in the latter half of 2022.&nbsp; Meanwhile, growth of total housing starts turned positive in the fourth quarter, owing to a renewed growth in multi-unit starts.&nbsp; For the next two stages of production, the inventory of homes under construction was unchanged at the end of the fourth quarter, but home completions returned to positive growth.&nbsp; On a year-over-year basis, total home completions rose at the fastest pace since before the pandemic, signaling favorable developments for housing supply throughout 2023.</p>
<p>Homes Sales and Inventories: Ongoing housing affordability challenges&mdash;stemming from both high home prices and elevated, though declining, mortgage rates&mdash;continued to constrain existing home sales in the fourth quarter (see Table 4 &ndash; Housing Market Indicators).&nbsp; Sales of total existing homes declined for the third consecutive quarter and were down by 6.2&nbsp;percent over 2023.&nbsp; Even so, the pace of decline over 2023 was less than a fifth of that in 2022.&nbsp; Meanwhile, inventories of homes for sale fell to a 21-month low in December 2023, likely reflecting in part the reluctance of owners of existing homes to sell when they may be locked into low mortgages.</p>
<p>Accordingly, prospective homeowners have maintained their focus on the new home market, where sales of single-family units rose for five consecutive quarters before pulling back in the fourth quarter: sales of new single-family homes declined 1.6 percent per month, on average, after rising 0.7 percent in the third quarter.&nbsp; Starting in the summer of 2022, the strength of new home sales had weighed on the inventory-to-sales ratios (the number of months of sales that current inventories can support) but in the last two quarters, inventories for new homes have increased, from a low of 7.1 months in July 2023 to an average 8.3 months in the fourth quarter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Home Prices and Rents: Home prices maintained a rapid pace of growth during the early part of the fourth quarter, but some measures moderated significantly (see Table 5 &ndash; Home Price and Rent Indicators).&nbsp;Although&nbsp;growth in the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller&rsquo;s national home price index slowed modestly in October (last available data as of January 29),&nbsp;the pace of house price growth in the FHFA purchase only-index was nearly 60 percent lower than in the third quarter.&nbsp; Nonetheless, according to both home price measure, house prices set fresh record highs at the start of the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>For renters, measures of shelter cost growth were mixed in the fourth quarter.&nbsp; The CPI for rent of primary residence rose 5.7 percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter&mdash;though both rates were marginally slower than in the second quarter.&nbsp;However, measures of new rental agreements continue to suggest a favorable outlook for the rent CPI, which is a lagged measure and trails prices from rental unit listing services by about a year.&nbsp; Listing services data indicate that after slowing significantly in the third quarter, rental inflation turned negative in the fourth quarter, which may suggest further progress bringing down shelter inflation in coming quarters.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>RISKS TO THE OUTLOOK</h3>
<p>Even amid substantial economic growth and a gradual easing of labor markets, inflation has fallen substantially from the highs of mid-2022.&nbsp;We expect this trend to continue over the next year and anticipate that inflation will return to historical norms.&nbsp;However, there are risks to this outlook on both sides.&nbsp; Geopolitical risks or persistently strong demand growth without comparable supply expansion could push inflation above consensus forecasts.&nbsp; Alternatively, a significant cooling in the labor market could bring inflation down faster&mdash;but with greater cost for American workers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Geopolitical instability and supply chain disruptions:&nbsp; Russia&rsquo;s war in Ukraine continues to add uncertainty to the medium-term outlook.&nbsp; In addition, the ongoing conflict in the Middle East and drought conditions at the Panama Canal create further concerns of supply chain disruptions and could renew upward pressures on energy and goods prices.&nbsp; Fortunately, major impacts to the U.S. economy have not materialized to date, but these remain important risks to monitor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consumer slowdown and labor market cooling:&nbsp; Strong consumption in 2023 supported the economy, fueled by real income growth and a reduced saving rate.&nbsp; Households have drawn down much of their excess savings from the pandemic period, but household net worth as a share of disposable personal income remains high relative to historical levels.&nbsp; Households should be able to continue to grow consumption from growth in real incomes, but a risk remains that a slowdown in consumption could cool the labor market quickly, which could again reduce consumption and further slow the economy.&nbsp;This concern is particularly notable in areas with rising delinquency and default rates.&nbsp; In general, however, higher delinquency rates still reflect normalization from the low levels that persisted following pandemic income support programs.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
<p>The American economy remains strong, with rising incomes, a healthy labor market, and easing inflation.&nbsp; Going forward, we must continue to invest in expanding our economy&rsquo;s productive capacity in ways that benefit all Americans&mdash;what Secretary Yellen has called &ldquo;modern supply-side economics.&rdquo; The Biden-Harris Administration&rsquo;s investments in our clean energy and manufacturing sectors, as well as in our public infrastructure, are oriented toward this goal.&nbsp; The Administration remains committed to helping foster continued improvements like those we saw in 2023.</p>

<div> Treasury, borrowing, marketable debt, cash balance, financing<br />
Summary: The U.S. Department of the Treasury announced estimates of privately-held net marketable borrowing for the first two quarters of 2024. For January – March 2024, borrowing is expected to be $760 billion, and for April – June 2024, borrowing is expected to be $202 billion. The estimates are based on projected fiscal flows and cash balances. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced its current estimates of privately-held net marketable borrowing<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2054#ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;for the January &ndash; March 2024 and April &ndash; June 2024 quarters.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Sources-and-Uses-January-qtr12024.pdf">Sources and Uses Table</a></p>
<ul>
<li>During the January &ndash; March 2024 quarter, Treasury expects to borrow $760 billion in privately-held&nbsp;net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-March cash balance of $750 billion.<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2054#ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;The borrowing estimate is $55 billion lower than announced in October 2023, largely due to&nbsp;projections of higher net fiscal flows and a higher beginning of quarter cash balance.<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2054#ftn3">[3]</a></li>
<li>During the April &ndash; June 2024&nbsp;quarter, Treasury expects to borrow $202 billion in privately-held &nbsp;net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-June cash balance of $750 billion.<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2054#ftn4">[4]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the October &ndash; December 2023&nbsp;quarter, Treasury borrowed $776 billion in privately-held&nbsp;net marketable debt and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $769 billion. In October 2023, Treasury estimated borrowing of $776 billion and assumed an end-of-December cash balance of $750 billion. There was no change in privately-held net market borrowing although the ending cash balance was $19 billion higher due primarily to other sources of financing including lower than projected discount on marketable borrowing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Additional financing details relating to Treasury&rsquo;s Quarterly Refunding will be released at 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, January 31, 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2054#_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Privately-held net marketable borrowing excludes rollovers (auction &ldquo;add-ons&rdquo;) of Treasury securities held in the Federal Reserve System Open Market Account (SOMA) but includes financing required due to SOMA redemptions.&nbsp; Secondary market purchases of Treasury securities by SOMA do not directly change net privately-held marketable borrowing but, all else equal, when the securities mature and assuming the Federal Reserve does not redeem any maturing securities, would increase the amount of cash raised for a given privately-held auction size by increasing the SOMA &ldquo;add-on&rdquo; amount.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: EBA, industry survey, credit institutions, ESG risks, methodologies <br />
Summary: The European Banking Authority (EBA) has launched an industry survey to gather information from credit institutions on their approaches to classifying exposures to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks and the accessibility of ESG data. Participation is voluntary, and findings will be presented anonymously. The EBA aims to assess the availability and feasibility of standardizing ESG risk identification and qualification. Additionally, they may organize an industry workshop for further discussion on the topic. <br /> <div>
<p class="body">The European Banking Authority (EBA) today launched an industry survey to receive input from credit institutions on their methodologies to classify exposures to environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, as well as on the accessibility and availability of ESG data for this purpose. The objective of the survey is to collect qualitative information on credit institutions&rsquo; current practices to inform the EBA&rsquo;s work on the feasibility of introducing a standardised methodology to identify and qualify exposures to ESG risks. The deadline to respond to the industry survey is 29 March 2024.</p>
<h4>Survey process</h4>
<p class="body">Institutions willing to take part in the survey should contact the EBA and express their interest via the address&nbsp;<a href="mailto:eba-esg-risks-classification@eba.europa.eu">eba-esg-risks-classification@eba.europa.eu</a>. These institutions will be granted access to the survey accordingly. While the file containing all questions is available on the EBA website&nbsp;for convenience, replies to the survey should be submitted directly to the EBA via the dedicated survey tool.</p>
<p class="body">Participation in the survey is voluntary. However, the EBA strongly encourages credit institutions to take part in this important exercise. No confidential information will be disclosed and the findings will be presented anonymously at an aggregated level. The EBA reserves the right to follow-up bilaterally with institutions participating in the survey.</p>
<h4>Background and next steps</h4>
<p class="body">As part of the revised banking package, the EBA will receive new mandates under Article 501c of amended Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (see&nbsp;<a href="https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-15883-2023-INIT/en/pdf">provisional agreement</a>).</p>
<p class="body">This survey is launched with a purpose to respond to points (a) and (b) of that article, which request the EBA to assess the following:</p>
<ul>
<li class="body">availability and accessibility of relatable and consistent ESG data; </li>
<li class="body">feasibility of introducing a standardised methodology to identify and qualify exposures [subject to ESG risks], based on a common set of principles for ESG risk classification, using:    
<ul>
<li class="body">information on transition and physical risk indicators made available by sustainability disclosures reporting frameworks (EU and internationally); </li>
<li class="body">guidance and conclusions coming from the supervisory stress-testing or scenario analysis of climate-related financial risks conducted by the EBA or the competent authorities; </li>
<li class="body">relevant ESG score of the ECAI credit risks rating by a nominated ECAI, if appropriately reflecting the ESG risks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="body">The mandate complements the initial discussion and findings presented in the&nbsp;<a href="https://eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-recommends-enhancements-pillar-1-framework-capture">EBA Report on the role of environmental and social risks in the prudential framework</a>&nbsp;published on 12 October 2023.</p>
<p class="body">The EBA may organise an industry workshop with institutions participating in the survey for further dialogue on this topic and to exchange on the findings.</p>

Summary:<br />2023 was a challenging year for the European economy, with inflationary pressures and geopolitical uncertainties leading to stagnant growth.

<p><span>Global Overview</span></p>
<p>2023 was a challenging year for the European economy. The continent faced multiple headwinds, including inflationary pressures and geopolitical uncertainties. These factors weighed on economic activity, leading to stagnant growth. Developments in European capital markets reflected these economic trends. Market capitalisation slowly increased while primary markets struggled and lit trading decreased.</p>
<p>ETFs volumes normalised to pre-pandemic levels, but the listed investment funds market continued its downtrend. Beyond equities, trading in exchange-traded derivatives stabilised and fixed-income trading on exchanges, including ESG bonds, resurged.</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">The proposed guidance confirms&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-10/ESMA74-449133380-441_Statement_on_MiCA_Supervisory_Convergence.pdf">ESMA&rsquo;s previous message</a>&nbsp;that the provision of crypto-asset services by a third-country firm is limited under MiCA to cases where the client is the exclusive initiator of the service. This exemption should be understood as very narrowly framed and must be regarded as the exception. A firm cannot use it to bypass MiCA.</p>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Consultation paper on guidelines on&nbsp;conditions and criteria for the classification of crypto-assets as financial instruments</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify">In this consultation paper, ESMA is seeking input on establishing clear conditions and criteria for the qualification of crypto-assets as financial instruments. This initiative, which follow on from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/esma50-157-1391_crypto_advice.pdf">previous work by ESMA</a>, is aimed at bridging the MiCA regulation and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II) and ensuring consistency across the EU.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">The proposed guidelines aim at providing NCAs and market participants with structured but flexible conditions and criteria to determine whether a&nbsp;<a>crypto-asset</a>&nbsp;can be classified as a financial instrument.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">To do so, the draft strikes a balance between providing guidance and avoiding establishing a one-size-fits-all approach. Once finalised, these guidelines will provide much-needed clarity and contribute to the global standards in crypto-asset regulation.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span>Next Steps</span></h4>
<p>The consultation closes on 29 of April 2024. ESMA will consider the feedback it receives to the consultation in Q2 2024 and expects to publish a final report in Q4 2024.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The European Energy Exchange (EEX) expands its product offering on the EEX natural gas derivatives markets with new, financially settled EEX TTF Natural Gas Month Futures denominated in US$/MMBtu, from 15 April 2024.</p>
<p>Steffen Koehler, COO of EEX, comments: &ldquo;<em>In recent years, TTF in US$/MMBtu has become the pricing benchmark of choice for European LNG imports as well as being used outside of this region for LNG-related trading strategies. We therefore believe that our new extended offering will be ideal to meet the growing needs of this market, by enabling wider hedging opportunities for the LNG trading community.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new products will be available with up to 72 monthly expiries, complementing EEX&rsquo;s existing offering for the LNG market, which currently comprises the EEX JKM LNG Natural Gas Futures.</p>
<p>LNG is a fast-growing global commodity, and in the first half of 2023 LNG imports to the UK and Europe exceeded pipeline delivery for the first time. In 2023, LNG made up 42% of the EU&rsquo;s total gas imports.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<span>European Energy Exchange (EEX)</span>&nbsp;is the leading energy exchange which builds secure, successful and sustainable commodity markets worldwide &ndash; together with its customers. As part of EEX Group, a group of companies serving international commodity markets, it offers contracts on Power, Natural Gas and Emission Allowances as well as Freight and Agricultural Products. EEX also provides registry services as well as auctions for Guarantees of Origin, on behalf of the French State.</p>

<title>CME Group Latin American FX Futures Hit All-Time Volume And Open Interest Records In 2023</title>

<ul type="disc">
<li><span><i>Increased client participation deepens liquidity and further strengthens price discovery function</i></span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CME Group, the world's leading derivatives marketplace, today announced its Mexican peso and Brazilian real FX futures contracts reached all-time average daily volume (ADV) and open interest (OI) records in 2023. The increased trading is resulting in deeper liquidity and broader client participation, which in turn, strengthens reliance on these markets as the premier source of price discovery for the broader FX marketplace.</p>
<p>2023 LatAm FX futures trading highlights include:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Mexican peso futures reached a record&nbsp;$1.8 billion&nbsp;in equivalent notional value ADV.</li>
<li>Brazilian real futures achieved a record&nbsp;$300 million&nbsp;in equivalent notional value ADV.&nbsp;</li>
<li>CME Group's&nbsp;LatAm FX futures complex hit an all-time ADV record of 82,000 contracts (+7.4% year-over-year) and an all-time OI record of 304,000 contracts (+20.4% year-over-year).&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The continued growth of the Mexican and Brazilian economies combined with the current interest rate environment, is driving more clients to trade CME Group FX futures," said&nbsp;
Paul Houston, Global Head of FX Products,&nbsp;CME Group. "As client participation continues to grow, we are focused on building and maintaining consistent liquidity that will support the long-term development of the electronic FX markets in&nbsp;Latin America."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"CME Group's&nbsp;liquidity in Mexican peso futures has been a key element to enhance our hedging activities, and thus to be able to heighten our client's product offering,"&nbsp;said&nbsp;
Alejandro Vigil, Head of FX BBVA M&eacute;xico.</p>
<p>"CME Group&nbsp;offers its clients unique access to liquidity from local onshore market markers which are particularly valuable in futures and options for non-deliverable currencies. These are markets that require cumbersome local vehicles for direct access or higher costs from global market makers," said&nbsp;
Bernardo Gattass, Head of Ita&uacute;&nbsp;Unibanco's Options trading desk. "It's the case for the Brazilian real which is a large market with relevant local liquidity and large local market makers such as&nbsp;Ita&uacute;, its largest bank by assets. Many large global institutional investors would do well to add&nbsp;CME Group&nbsp;to their price provider list for LatAm currencies and tap into the liquidity of both global and local market makers, such as&nbsp;Ita&uacute;&nbsp;for the real and many others."</p>

<title>CISI Launches Mental Health And Addiction Awareness e-Learning Modules</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cisi-launches-mental-health-and-addiction-awareness-e-learning-modules/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cisi-launches-mental-health-and-addiction-awareness-e-learning-modules/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Financial services professionals globally are being offered the opportunity to learn how to boost their wellness, both personally and in the workplace and recognise, and seek help for, potentially addictive behaviour.</p>
<p>Members of charity and professional body, the Chartered Institute for Securities &amp; Investment (CISI) can access the two new e-learning modules, free, through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisi.org/cisiweb2/cisi-website/startaconversation?section=wellbeing" target="_blank">CISI mental health portal</a>. The modules, 30 minutes each, are interactive and test knowledge based around real-life scenarios. The combined learning between the two modules qualifies for one hour of CISI CPD.</p>
<p>The two e-learning modules were designed and produced for CISI members by&nbsp;Synergy Health, a specialist medical and care management consultancy practice&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.bwrsynergyhealth.com/" target="_blank">www.bwrsynergyhealth.com</a>).</p>
<p><b><i>Mental Health Awareness &ndash; Boosting Your Brain and Wellness in the Workplace</i></b><b>&nbsp;</b>focuses on creating a mentally healthy workplace, with strategies for maintaining wellness. Module no 2,&nbsp;<b><i>Addiction Awareness, Stamping Out The Stigma and the Road to Recovery&nbsp;</i></b>focuses on understanding addiction, how to recognise signs of addictive behaviour and where to seek help.</p>
<p>The CISI was one of the first sector professional bodies to create a mental health portal, following the results of its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisi.org/cisiweb2/cisi-website/about-us/press-release/2018/12/21/off-the-scale-workloads-and-out-of-touch-senior-management-identified-as-key-causes-of-financial-services-staff-stress-and-mental-ill-health-says-cisi-survey" target="_blank">first-ever mental health survey</a>&nbsp;and feedback from members.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisi.org/cisiweb2/cisi-website/startaconversation" target="_blank">The portal</a>&nbsp;was launched to encourage the conversation around mental health in financial services and to help end the stigma around discussing mental health issues. In 2021 the CISI examined the effect the pandemic had on the&nbsp;<a href="https://financialplanning.cisi.org/cisiweb2/cisi-website/about-us/press-release/2021/07/21/pandemic-leaves-its-mark-as-55-of-women-finance-workers-have-suffered-stress-in-the-last-year-says-cisi" target="_blank">mental health of finance workers</a>, and in 2022 it looked at the&nbsp;<a href="https://financialplanning.cisi.org/cisiweb2/cisi-website/about-us/press-release/2022/08/10/banter-negatively-impacting-97-of-financial-services-professionals-while-hr-departments-have-an-image-problem-says-cisi-survey" target="_blank">effect of banter</a>&nbsp;on finance professionals&rsquo; mental health. Last year the professional body surveyed members to look at workplace support for women senior leaders&nbsp;<a href="https://financialplanning.cisi.org/cisiweb2/cisi-website/about-us/press-release/2023/02/06/almost-a-quarter-of-financial-services-firms-have-no-measures-in-place-to-support-women-experiencing-menopause" target="_blank">going through the menopause.</a></p>
<p>Tracy Vegro, CISI Chief Executive said: &ldquo;More than ever, we all need to know support and strategies are available to help us maintain a level of positive mental health, to cope with the stresses and strains of both personal and professional life. These two new modules are an important resource for CISI&rsquo;s membership community to navigate and understand some of these mental health challenges, whether it be developing mental health resilience or recognising the signs of potential addiction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Synergy Health are delighted to be partnering with the CISI to provide CISI Members with training and awareness on mental health, well-being and addiction with a particular focus on these issues in the workplace. Dr Simone Yule, Clinical Director of Synergy Health said: &ldquo;'We hope to make a difference to people's lives by raising awareness on these crucial topics and look forward to discussing our content in the forthcoming webinar&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The CISI is running a webinar on the two module topics of mental health awareness and addiction awareness on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisi.org/cisiweb2/shop/event-details?eventid=86855262" target="_blank"><b>8 February 2024</b></a>&nbsp;at 12:30 pm.</p>

<title>NovaSparks Expands Its Coverage Of The Wireless Market - Leading FPGA-Powered Market Data Company Adds Quincy QED Wireless Feed To NovaTick[TM]</title>

<div> FPGA, Market Data, NovaSparks, Quincy Data, QED Feed
Summary: 
NovaSparks and Quincy Data collaborated to integrate the QED feed into NovaTickTM, providing ultra-low latency market data support for electronic trading platforms worldwide. This partnership allows customers to benefit from faster, more efficient trading and simplified architecture, solidifying NovaSparks' leading position in market data solutions. 
<br /><br /> <div>
<p>Quincy Data, powered by McKay Brothers, and NovaSparks, the leading field programmable gate array (FPGA) market data company, have worked together to add the support of the Quincy Extreme Data (QED) Feed to NovaTick<sup>TM</sup>.</p>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NovaTick<sup>TM</sup> is NovaSparks&rsquo; ultra-low latency ticker-plant based on a powerful FPGA matrix architecture. It handles the high-performance requirements of electronic trading platforms with the speed and determinism that only FPGAs can bring. NovaTick<sup>TM</sup> converts the QED feed into NovaSparks&rsquo; normalized wire format in 400ns and can also provide the QED wireless market data through its software C++ Application Programming Interface (API), NSMDA, or its hardware API, NovaLink<sup>TM</sup>. Arbitration between the QED wireless feed and the QED fiber feed can also be added in front of the feed handler in NovaTick<sup><sup>TM</sup></sup> to provide a reliable normalized stream of market data.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The vast majority of our customers are trading across geographies and asset classes. Often, they rely on wireless services to transport market data at the fastest speed. This collaboration will not only simplify their trading architecture, but it will also give them an opportunity to further reduce the overall latency of market data sent abroad via wireless services. The addition of the QED feed brings our global feed total to 75, confirming our leading position among all the FPGA-centric market data solutions providers. This puts us in a unique position to offer unparalleled service,&rdquo; said Luc Burgun, NovaSparks&rsquo; chief executive officer and president.</p>
<p>"Today, FPGA technology is an essential component of any high-speed trading infrastructure. FPGAs are able to handle very large market data bursts while maintaining a deterministic latency profile. The Quincy Extreme Data service distributes a normalized feed of select market data sourced from financial exchanges globally to many points of presence (PoPs) in the U.S., Europe, India, and Asia. We welcome NovaSparks into our ecosystem. This new solution will give all NovaSparks customers a very efficient way to use market data from our wireless service directly into their trading platforms," says St&eacute;phane Tyc, Quincy Data co-founder.</p>
<p>NovaTick&rsquo;s pure FPGA processing architecture is incredibly fast and deterministic, yielding one to two orders of magnitude faster than traditional software solutions. NovaSparks&rsquo; pure-FPGA feed handlers have a normalized output format across markets, enabling NovaSparks customers to integrate new feeds with minimum effort.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Support of the QED feed by NovaTick<sup>TM</sup> allows us to benefit from the tight integration we already have between NovaTick<sup>TM</sup> and our trading platform," says Alain Katchouni, Managing Director, Head of ETF and Electronic Trading at National Bank Financial Inc.,<b> </b>one of Canada's six systemically important banks. "This new addition simplifies and accelerates our trading environment when we use Quincy Extreme Data service,&rdquo; added Katchouni.</p>

<p><span><span>&ldquo;Meanwhile, Kirkland &amp; Ellis, which was the top adviser by volume in 2022, also retained its leadership position by this metric in 2023 despite experiencing a decline in the number of deals advised.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<title>Monetary Authority Of Singapore Monetary Policy Statement - January 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/monetary-authority-of-singapore-monetary-policy-statement-january-2024/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/monetary-authority-of-singapore-monetary-policy-statement-january-2024/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>In the October 2023 Monetary Policy Statement (MPS), MAS maintained the rate of appreciation of the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER) policy band, with no change to the width of the band or level at which it was centred. Since then, the S$NEER has strengthened in line with the appreciating policy band</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Chart 1</span></span><span><br /><span>S$ Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (S$NEER)</span></span></span></p>
<p><img alt="S$NEER chart for Monetary Policy Statement January 2024" height="364px" src="https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/mas-media-library/news/monetary-policy-statements/2024/mps_chart_2024_01.jpg?h=364px&amp;w=563px&amp;hash=9190C1A48ABF3665B0F75D67DC412922" width="563px" />&nbsp;</p>
<h2>GROWTH BACKDROP</h2>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Economic activity in Singapore&rsquo;s major trading partners was resilient in the last quarter of 2023. In the near term, global growth is expected to be impacted by the lagged effects of elevated interest rates in the advanced economies. However, global final demand should pick up later this year, as lower inflation sustains private consumption expenditure, and monetary policy settings in the major economies turn more supportive. This outlook is subject to uncertainties, particularly stemming from ongoing geopolitical conflicts which could precipitate negative global supply and demand shocks.</span></p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>MTI&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Advance Estimat</em>es show that growth in the Singapore economy picked up to 1.7% on a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis in the last quarter of 2023, from 1.3% in Q3 and an average of &minus;0.1% in the first half of the year. This strengthening in momentum was mainly attributable to the external-facing sectors. For 2023 as a whole, the Singapore economy is estimated to have expanded by 1.2%.</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prospects for the Singapore economy should continue to improve in 2024, with GDP growth projected to come in between 1&ndash;3%. The recovery in the manufacturing and financial sectors should be supported by the turnaround in the electronics cycle and anticipated easing in global interest rates, respectively, even as growth in the domestic-oriented sectors further normalises towards pre-pandemic rates. Consequently, the slightly negative output gap in 2023 will narrow in the second half of 2024.</span></p>
<h2>INFLATION OUTLOOK</h2>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS Core Inflation<span>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/monetary-policy-statements/2024/mas-monetary-policy-statement-29jan24#1">[1]</a></span>&nbsp;</span>continued to decline in year-on-year terms in Q4 2023, though by less than expected. Inflation for food and retail goods moderated, offsetting firmer electricity &amp; gas inflation. Travel-related services inflation, which is largely determined by conditions in tourism markets abroad, was stronger as hotel room rates and package tour prices saw steep increases. For 2023 as a whole, MAS Core Inflation came in at 4.2%, slightly higher than the 4.1% in 2022. However, excluding the impact of the GST increase, core inflation would have fallen by an estimated 0.6%-point in 2023 compared to 2022.</p>
<div>
<div id="edn1"></div>
</div>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>CPI-All Items inflation likewise edged down in Q4 2023 from the preceding quarter. Accommodation inflation eased as the supply of completed housing units increased. This helped to offset rising private transport inflation amid higher petrol prices. CPI-All Items inflation averaged 4.8% in 2023, down from 6.1% in the preceding year.</span></p>
<p>7.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span>MAS Core Inflation is expected to rise in the current quarter due in part to the one-off impact of the 1%-point hike in the GST from January this year, as well as the increase in the carbon tax. Water prices will rise from Q2 this year amid increases in production costs. Inflation for certain services components, including public transport and healthcare, could also stay elevated as less frequently-adjusted prices rise to catch up with higher cost levels.</span></p>
<p>8.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Setting aside the transitory impact of the GST increase, core inflation is forecast to decline gradually over 2024. Lower imported costs and a slower pace of domestic cost increases should underpin the moderating trend in inflation. Global energy and food commodity prices have fallen and are expected to remain broadly stable, while imported costs of most intermediate and final goods should be tempered by favourable global supply conditions. On the domestic front, wage growth should ease this year&nbsp;</span><span>as labour market tightness dissipates</span><span>, while productivity is also projected to pick up. Consequently, unit labour costs will rise at a slower pace.</span></p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>MAS Core Inflation is projected to slow to an average of 2.5&ndash;3.5% for 2024 as a whole, unchanged from the October 2023 MPS. Excluding the impact of the increase in the GST rate this year, core inflation is forecast at 1.5&ndash;2.5%.</span></p>
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Amid the declines in COE premiums since November and the larger COE supply this year compared to 2023, CPI-All Items inflation in 2024 is now forecast to be lower at 2.5&ndash;3.5%, down from the previous range of 3&ndash;4%. Excluding the effects of the increase in the GST rate, headline inflation is forecast at 1.5&ndash;2.5%.</span></p>
<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Both upside and downside risks to the inflation outlook remain. Shocks to global food and energy prices or domestic labour costs could bring about additional inflationary pressures. However, an unexpected weakening in the global economy could induce a faster easing of cost and price pressures.</span></p>
<h2>MONETARY POLICY</h2>
<p><span>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;Barring any further global shocks, the Singapore economy is expected to strengthen in 2024, with growth becoming more broad-based. MAS Core Inflation is likely to remain elevated in the earlier part of the year, but should decline gradually and step down by Q4, before falling further next year.</span></p>
<p><span>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, current monetary policy settings remain appropriate. The sustained appreciation of the policy band will continue to dampen imported inflation and curb domestic cost pressures, thus ensuring medium-term price stability.</span></p>
<p><span>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span><span>MAS will therefore maintain the prevailing rate of appreciation of the S$NEER policy band. There will be no change to its width and the level at which it is centred.</span></span>&nbsp;MAS will closely monitor global and domestic economic developments, and remain vigilant to risks to inflation and growth.</span></p>

<title>China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) Bans Securities Lending During Restricted Periods</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/china-securities-regulatory-commission-csrc-bans-securities-lending-during-res/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/china-securities-regulatory-commission-csrc-bans-securities-lending-during-res/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In an effort to stabilize the country's stock markets, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has announced the suspension of lending restricted shares, effective from Monday. This move comes after recent sharp falls in the market and is part of a series of supportive policies implemented by Beijing.</p>
<p>Restricted shares, which are subject to limits on sale, are often offered to company employees or certain investors. However, they can be lent for trading purposes, putting additional pressure on markets during a downward trend.</p>
<p>The CSRC's decision aims to promote fairness and reasonableness, reduce the efficiency of securities lending, and level the playing field for investors. The regulator also intends to crack down on illegal activities that exploit securities lending to reduce holdings and cash out.</p>
<p>To further regulate the market, the CSRC will also limit the efficiency of securities lending in the securities refinancing market starting March 18.</p>
<p>Although the blue-chip CSI300 Index has seen some recovery, China's stock market continues to struggle. As a result, small Chinese investors are seeking alternatives to the domestic economy, driving up premiums on global index funds.</p>
<p>China's economy grew slightly above the government's target in 2023, but the recovery has been inconsistent. December data revealed weak consumption and a significant decline in home prices, indicating a deep crisis in the property market.</p>
<p>To align with the CSRC's measures, both the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges will suspend securities lending by strategic investors during lockup periods starting January 29.</p>
