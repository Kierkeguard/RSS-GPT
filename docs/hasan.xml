Summary:<br />2023 was a challenging year for the European economy, with inflationary pressures and geopolitical uncertainties leading to stagnant growth. European capital markets saw slow increases in market capitalisation, struggling primary markets, and decreased lit trading. However, ETF volumes normalised, while fixed-income trading on exchanges, including ESG bonds, resurged. <div>
<p><span>Global Overview</span></p>
<p>2023 was a challenging year for the European economy. The continent faced multiple headwinds, including inflationary pressures and geopolitical uncertainties. These factors weighed on economic activity, leading to stagnant growth. Developments in European capital markets reflected these economic trends. Market capitalisation slowly increased while primary markets struggled and lit trading decreased.</p>
<p>ETFs volumes normalised to pre-pandemic levels, but the listed investment funds market continued its downtrend. Beyond equities, trading in exchange-traded derivatives stabilised and fixed-income trading on exchanges, including ESG bonds, resurged.</p>

<div> Securities, Markets, ESMA, Guidelines, Crypto-assets
<br />
ESMA seeks input on reverse solicitation exemption and classification of crypto-assets as financial instruments. The proposed guidance clarifies conditions for reverse solicitation exemption and aims to provide structured criteria for classifying crypto-assets as financial instruments. Consultation closes on April 29, 2024, with the final report expected in Q4 2024.
<br /><br />Summary: ESMA is seeking feedback on guidelines for reverse solicitation and the classification of crypto-assets as financial instruments. The aim is to provide clear conditions and criteria for the application of the reverse solicitation exemption and to ensure consistency across the EU. The consultation closes on April 29, 2024, with a final report expected in Q4 2024. <div>
<p class="text-align-justify">The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, today publishes two&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/consultations/consultation-reverse-solicitation-and-classification-crypto-assets">Consultations Papers on guidelines under Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA)</a>, one on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-01/ESMA35-1872330276-1619_Consultation_Paper_on_the_draft_guidelines_on_reverse_solicitation_under_MiCA.pdf">reverse solicitation</a>&nbsp;and one on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-01/ESMA75-453128700-52_MiCA_Consultation_Paper_-_Guidelines_on_the_qualification_of_crypto-assets_as_financial_instruments.pdf">classification of crypto-assets as financial instruments</a>.</p>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">ESMA invites comments from stakeholders by 29 April 2024.</p>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Consultation paper on guidelines on reverse solicitation</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify">In this consultation, ESMA is seeking input on proposed guidance relating to the conditions of application of the reverse solicitation exemption and the supervision practices that&nbsp;National&nbsp;Competent&nbsp;Authorities&nbsp;(NCAs) may take to prevent its circumvention.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">The proposed guidance confirms&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-10/ESMA74-449133380-441_Statement_on_MiCA_Supervisory_Convergence.pdf">ESMA&rsquo;s previous message</a>&nbsp;that the provision of crypto-asset services by a third-country firm is limited under MiCA to cases where the client is the exclusive initiator of the service. This exemption should be understood as very narrowly framed and must be regarded as the exception. A firm cannot use it to bypass MiCA.</p>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Consultation paper on guidelines on&nbsp;conditions and criteria for the classification of crypto-assets as financial instruments</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify">In this consultation paper, ESMA is seeking input on establishing clear conditions and criteria for the qualification of crypto-assets as financial instruments. This initiative, which follow on from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/esma50-157-1391_crypto_advice.pdf">previous work by ESMA</a>, is aimed at bridging the MiCA regulation and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II) and ensuring consistency across the EU.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">The proposed guidelines aim at providing NCAs and market participants with structured but flexible conditions and criteria to determine whether a&nbsp;<a>crypto-asset</a>&nbsp;can be classified as a financial instrument.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">To do so, the draft strikes a balance between providing guidance and avoiding establishing a one-size-fits-all approach. Once finalised, these guidelines will provide much-needed clarity and contribute to the global standards in crypto-asset regulation.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span>Next Steps</span></h4>
<p>The consultation closes on 29 of April 2024. ESMA will consider the feedback it receives to the consultation in Q2 2024 and expects to publish a final report in Q4 2024.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The European Energy Exchange (EEX) expands its product offering on the EEX natural gas derivatives markets with new, financially settled EEX TTF Natural Gas Month Futures denominated in US$/MMBtu, from 15 April 2024.</p>
<p>Steffen Koehler, COO of EEX, comments: &ldquo;<em>In recent years, TTF in US$/MMBtu has become the pricing benchmark of choice for European LNG imports as well as being used outside of this region for LNG-related trading strategies. We therefore believe that our new extended offering will be ideal to meet the growing needs of this market, by enabling wider hedging opportunities for the LNG trading community.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new products will be available with up to 72 monthly expiries, complementing EEX&rsquo;s existing offering for the LNG market, which currently comprises the EEX JKM LNG Natural Gas Futures.</p>
<p>LNG is a fast-growing global commodity, and in the first half of 2023 LNG imports to the UK and Europe exceeded pipeline delivery for the first time. In 2023, LNG made up 42% of the EU&rsquo;s total gas imports.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<span>European Energy Exchange (EEX)</span>&nbsp;is the leading energy exchange which builds secure, successful and sustainable commodity markets worldwide &ndash; together with its customers. As part of EEX Group, a group of companies serving international commodity markets, it offers contracts on Power, Natural Gas and Emission Allowances as well as Freight and Agricultural Products.

<title>CME Group Latin American FX Futures Hit All-Time Volume And Open Interest Records In 2023</title>

<ul type="disc">
<li><span><i>Increased client participation deepens liquidity and further strengthens price discovery function</i></span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CME Group, the world's leading derivatives marketplace, today announced its Mexican peso and Brazilian real FX futures contracts reached all-time average daily volume (ADV) and open interest (OI) records in 2023. The increased trading is resulting in deeper liquidity and broader client participation, which in turn, strengthens reliance on these markets as the premier source of price discovery for the broader FX marketplace.</p>
<p>2023 LatAm FX futures trading highlights include:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Mexican peso futures reached a record&nbsp;$1.8 billion&nbsp;in equivalent notional value ADV.</li>
<li>Brazilian real futures achieved a record&nbsp;$300 million&nbsp;in equivalent notional value ADV.&nbsp;</li>
<li>CME Group's&nbsp;LatAm FX futures complex hit an all-time ADV record of 82,000 contracts (+7.4% year-over-year) and an all-time OI record of 304,000 contracts (+20.4% year-over-year).&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The continued growth of the Mexican and Brazilian economies combined with the current interest rate environment, is driving more clients to trade CME Group FX futures," said&nbsp;
Paul Houston, Global Head of FX Products,&nbsp;CME Group. "As client participation continues to grow, we are focused on building and maintaining consistent liquidity that will support the long-term development of the electronic FX markets in&nbsp;Latin America."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"CME Group's&nbsp;liquidity in Mexican peso futures has been a key element to enhance our hedging activities, and thus to be able to heighten our client's product offering,"&nbsp;said&nbsp;
Alejandro Vigil, Head of FX BBVA M&eacute;xico.</p>
<p>"CME Group&nbsp;offers its clients unique access to liquidity from local onshore market markers which are particularly valuable in futures and options for non-deliverable currencies. These are markets that require cumbersome local vehicles for direct access or higher costs from global market makers," said&nbsp;
Bernardo Gattass, Head of Ita&uacute;&nbsp;Unibanco's Options trading desk. "It's the case for the Brazilian real which is a large market with relevant local liquidity and large local market makers such as&nbsp;Ita&uacute;, its largest bank by assets. Many large global institutional investors would do well to add&nbsp;CME Group&nbsp;to their price provider list for LatAm currencies and tap into the liquidity of both global and local market makers, such as&nbsp;Ita&uacute;&nbsp;for the real and many others."</p>

<title>CISI Launches Mental Health And Addiction Awareness e-Learning Modules</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cisi-launches-mental-health-and-addiction-awareness-e-learning-modules/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cisi-launches-mental-health-and-addiction-awareness-e-learning-modules/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Financial services professionals globally are being offered the opportunity to learn how to boost their wellness, both personally and in the workplace and recognise, and seek help for, potentially addictive behaviour.</p>
<p>Members of charity and professional body, the Chartered Institute for Securities &amp; Investment (CISI) can access the two new e-learning modules, free, through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisi.org/cisiweb2/cisi-website/startaconversation?section=wellbeing" target="_blank">CISI mental health portal</a>. The modules, 30 minutes each, are interactive and test knowledge based around real-life scenarios. The combined learning between the two modules qualifies for one hour of CISI CPD.</p>
<p>The two e-learning modules were designed and produced for CISI members by&nbsp;Synergy Health, a specialist medical and care management consultancy practice&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.bwrsynergyhealth.com/" target="_blank">www.bwrsynergyhealth.com</a>).</p>
<p><b><i>Mental Health Awareness &ndash; Boosting Your Brain and Wellness in the Workplace</i></b><b>&nbsp;</b>focuses on creating a mentally healthy workplace, with strategies for maintaining wellness. Module no 2,&nbsp;<b><i>Addiction Awareness, Stamping Out The Stigma and the Road to Recovery&nbsp;</i></b>focuses on understanding addiction, how to recognise signs of addictive behaviour and where to seek help.</p>
<p>The CISI was one of the first sector professional bodies to create a mental health portal, following the results of its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisi.org/cisiweb2/cisi-website/about-us/press-release/2018/12/21/off-the-scale-workloads-and-out-of-touch-senior-management-identified-as-key-causes-of-financial-services-staff-stress-and-mental-ill-health-says-cisi-survey" target="_blank">first-ever mental health survey</a>&nbsp;and feedback from members.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisi.org/cisiweb2/cisi-website/startaconversation" target="_blank">The portal</a>&nbsp;was launched to encourage the conversation around mental health in financial services and to help end the stigma around discussing mental health issues. In 2021 the CISI examined the effect the pandemic had on the&nbsp;<a href="https://financialplanning.cisi.org/cisiweb2/cisi-website/about-us/press-release/2021/07/21/pandemic-leaves-its-mark-as-55-of-women-finance-workers-have-suffered-stress-in-the-last-year-says-cisi" target="_blank">mental health of finance workers</a>, and in 2022 it looked at the&nbsp;<a href="https://financialplanning.cisi.org/cisiweb2/cisi-website/about-us/press-release/2022/08/10/banter-negatively-impacting-97-of-financial-services-professionals-while-hr-departments-have-an-image-problem-says-cisi-survey" target="_blank">effect of banter</a>&nbsp;on finance professionals&rsquo; mental health. Last year the professional body surveyed members to look at workplace support for women senior leaders&nbsp;<a href="https://financialplanning.cisi.org/cisiweb2/cisi-website/about-us/press-release/2023/02/06/almost-a-quarter-of-financial-services-firms-have-no-measures-in-place-to-support-women-experiencing-menopause" target="_blank">going through the menopause.</a></p>
<p>Tracy Vegro, CISI Chief Executive said: &ldquo;More than ever, we all need to know support and strategies are available to help us maintain a level of positive mental health, to cope with the stresses and strains of both personal and professional life. These two new modules are an important resource for CISI&rsquo;s membership community to navigate and understand some of these mental health challenges, whether it be developing mental health resilience or recognising the signs of potential addiction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Synergy Health are delighted to be partnering with the CISI to provide CISI Members with training and awareness on mental health, well-being and addiction with a particular focus on these issues in the workplace. Dr Simone Yule, Clinical Director of Synergy Health said: &ldquo;'We hope to make a difference to people's lives by raising awareness on these crucial topics and look forward to discussing our content in the forthcoming webinar&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The CISI is running a webinar on the two module topics of mental health awareness and addiction awareness on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisi.org/cisiweb2/shop/event-details?eventid=86855262" target="_blank"><b>8 February 2024</b></a>&nbsp;at 12:30 pm.</p>

<div> FPGA, Market Data, NovaSparks, Quincy Data, QED Feed
Summary: 
NovaSparks and Quincy Data collaborated to integrate the QED feed into NovaTickTM, providing ultra-low latency market data support for electronic trading platforms worldwide. This partnership allows customers to benefit from faster, more efficient trading and simplified architecture, solidifying NovaSparks' leading position in market data solutions. 
<br /><br /> <div>
<p>Quincy Data, powered by McKay Brothers, and NovaSparks, the leading field programmable gate array (FPGA) market data company, have worked together to add the support of the Quincy Extreme Data (QED) Feed to NovaTick<sup>TM</sup>.</p>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NovaTick<sup>TM</sup> is NovaSparks&rsquo; ultra-low latency ticker-plant based on a powerful FPGA matrix architecture. It handles the high-performance requirements of electronic trading platforms with the speed and determinism that only FPGAs can bring. NovaTick<sup>TM</sup> converts the QED feed into NovaSparks&rsquo; normalized wire format in 400ns and can also provide the QED wireless market data through its software C++ Application Programming Interface (API), NSMDA, or its hardware API, NovaLink<sup>TM</sup>. Arbitration between the QED wireless feed and the QED fiber feed can also be added in front of the feed handler in NovaTick<sup><sup>TM</sup></sup> to provide a reliable normalized stream of market data.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The vast majority of our customers are trading across geographies and asset classes. Often, they rely on wireless services to transport market data at the fastest speed. This collaboration will not only simplify their trading architecture, but it will also give them an opportunity to further reduce the overall latency of market data sent abroad via wireless services. The addition of the QED feed brings our global feed total to 75, confirming our leading position among all the FPGA-centric market data solutions providers. This puts us in a unique position to offer unparalleled service,&rdquo; said Luc Burgun, NovaSparks&rsquo; chief executive officer and president.</p>
<p>"Today, FPGA technology is an essential component of any high-speed trading infrastructure. FPGAs are able to handle very large market data bursts while maintaining a deterministic latency profile. The Quincy Extreme Data service distributes a normalized feed of select market data sourced from financial exchanges globally to many points of presence (PoPs) in the U.S., Europe, India, and Asia. We welcome NovaSparks into our ecosystem. This new solution will give all NovaSparks customers a very efficient way to use market data from our wireless service directly into their trading platforms," says St&eacute;phane Tyc, Quincy Data co-founder.</p>
<p>NovaTick&rsquo;s pure FPGA processing architecture is incredibly fast and deterministic, yielding one to two orders of magnitude faster than traditional software solutions. NovaSparks&rsquo; pure-FPGA feed handlers have a normalized output format across markets, enabling NovaSparks customers to integrate new feeds with minimum effort.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Support of the QED feed by NovaTick<sup>TM</sup> allows us to benefit from the tight integration we already have between NovaTick<sup>TM</sup> and our trading platform," says Alain Katchouni, Managing Director, Head of ETF and Electronic Trading at National Bank Financial Inc.,<b> </b>one of Canada's six systemically important banks. "This new addition simplifies and accelerates our trading environment when we use Quincy Extreme Data service,&rdquo; added Katchouni.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Temenos (SIX: TEMN) today announced that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.temenos.com/community/partners/nagarro/" target="_blank">Nagarro</a>, a global digital engineering leader, has signed an agreement to license and further develop Temenos&nbsp;<a href="https://www.temenos.com/products/country-model-banks/" target="_blank">Country Model Banks</a>&nbsp;for financial institutions in Romania and Poland. The agreement opens new opportunities for growth for Temenos with enhanced local functionality and service capability provided by Nagarro in these markets.</p>
<p>Country Model Banks are a key differentiator for Temenos and through such licensing agreements, Temenos is able to scale this competitive advantage with partners further developing and also building new model banks compatible with the banking solutions on Temenos&rsquo; composable platform and SaaS offerings on Temenos Banking Cloud.</p>
<p>As part of this new agreement, Nagarro is committed to invest in and develop regulatory and business-specific localized functionality to enhance the Temenos Model Banks for financial institutions in Romania and Poland.</p>
<p>Nagarro, which has over 19,000 experts in 36 countries, has been operating in Romania since 1998 and in Poland since 2014 across 7 delivery centers. The Country Model Bank agreement enables Temenos customers in these markets to benefit from Nagarro&rsquo;s already well-established presence and regional expertise.</p>
<p>With over 25 years of experience in the industry, Nagarro supports the end-to-end banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) spectrum, including core banking, payments, lending and leasing, mobility and cognitive services, and financial services (investment banking, asset and wealth management).</p>
<p>This agreement builds on the strong existing relationship between the two companies, which has seen Nagarro complete more than 43 successful projects involving Temenos Transact implementation and transformation, along with 20 Temenos upgrades, and engage in 350 projects across diverse Temenos solutions. Nagarro was also awarded the&nbsp;&lsquo;APAC&nbsp;Temenos&nbsp;Delivery&nbsp;Partner of the&nbsp;Year&rsquo;&nbsp;award&nbsp;in 2023.</p>
<p><b>Ross Mallace,</b><b>&nbsp;EVP and&nbsp;</b><b>Global Head of SaaS &amp; Partner Ecosystem, Temenos, said:</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;We are excited to announce this agreement with Nagarro, which opens new opportunities for Temenos with financial institutions in Romania and Poland. Nagarro will become a trusted partner for the development and maintenance of Country Model Banks for these two countries and help customers in their progressive technology renovation. Such agreements bring additional value to our platform, which benefits our clients and ultimately delivers incremental growth for Temenos.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Vishwanath Rajashekarappa, a co-founder, Nagarro, commented:</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;We are delighted to be granted this license by Temenos to develop Country Model Banks to drive growth and customer success. This agreement is a testament to our capabilities as a long-standing partner of Temenos and our knowledge of local market practices and regulations. We look forward to helping clients in Romania and Poland scale and optimize their businesses on the Temenos banking platform.&rdquo;</p>

<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>In the October 2023 Monetary Policy Statement (MPS), MAS maintained the rate of appreciation of the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER) policy band, with no change to the width of the band or level at which it was centred. Since then, the S$NEER has strengthened in line with the appreciating policy band</span><span>.</span></p>

<h2>GROWTH BACKDROP</h2>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Economic activity in Singapore&rsquo;s major trading partners was resilient in the last quarter of 2023. In the near term, global growth is expected to be impacted by the lagged effects of elevated interest rates in the advanced economies. However, global final demand should pick up later this year, as lower inflation sustains private consumption expenditure, and monetary policy settings in the major economies turn more supportive. This outlook is subject to uncertainties, particularly stemming from ongoing geopolitical conflicts which could precipitate negative global supply and demand shocks.</span></p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>MTI&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Advance Estimat</em>es show that growth in the Singapore economy picked up to 1.7% on a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis in the last quarter of 2023, from 1.3% in Q3 and an average of &minus;0.1% in the first half of the year. This strengthening in momentum was mainly attributable to the external-facing sectors. For 2023 as a whole, the Singapore economy is estimated to have expanded by 1.2%.</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prospects for the Singapore economy should continue to improve in 2024, with GDP growth projected to come in between 1&ndash;3%. The recovery in the manufacturing and financial sectors should be supported by the turnaround in the electronics cycle and anticipated easing in global interest rates, respectively, even as growth in the domestic-oriented sectors further normalises towards pre-pandemic rates. Consequently, the slightly negative output gap in 2023 will narrow in the second half of 2024.</span></p>
<h2>INFLATION OUTLOOK</h2>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS Core Inflation<span>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/monetary-policy-statements/2024/mas-monetary-policy-statement-29jan24#1">[1]</a></span>&nbsp;</span>continued to decline in year-on-year terms in Q4 2023, though by less than expected. Inflation for food and retail goods moderated, offsetting firmer electricity &amp; gas inflation. Travel-related services inflation, which is largely determined by conditions in tourism markets abroad, was stronger as hotel room rates and package tour prices saw steep increases. For 2023 as a whole, MAS Core Inflation came in at 4.2%, slightly higher than the 4.1% in 2022. However, excluding the impact of the GST increase, core inflation would have fallen by an estimated 0.6%-point in 2023 compared to 2022.</p>
<div>
<div id="edn1"></div>
</div>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>CPI-All Items inflation likewise edged down in Q4 2023 from the preceding quarter. Accommodation inflation eased as the supply of completed housing units increased. This helped to offset rising private transport inflation amid higher petrol prices. CPI-All Items inflation averaged 4.8% in 2023, down from 6.1% in the preceding year.</span></p>
<p>7.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span>MAS Core Inflation is expected to rise in the current quarter due in part to the one-off impact of the 1%-point hike in the GST from January this year, as well as the increase in the carbon tax. Water prices will rise from Q2 this year amid increases in production costs. Inflation for certain services components, including public transport and healthcare, could also stay elevated as less frequently-adjusted prices rise to catch up with higher cost levels.</span></p>
<p>8.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Setting aside the transitory impact of the GST increase, core inflation is forecast to decline gradually over 2024. Lower imported costs and a slower pace of domestic cost increases should underpin the moderating trend in inflation. Global energy and food commodity prices have fallen and are expected to remain broadly stable, while imported costs of most intermediate and final goods should be tempered by favourable global supply conditions. On the domestic front, wage growth should ease this year&nbsp;</span><span>as labour market tightness dissipates</span><span>, while productivity is also projected to pick up. Consequently, unit labour costs will rise at a slower pace.</span></p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>MAS Core Inflation is projected to slow to an average of 2.5&ndash;3.5% for 2024 as a whole, unchanged from the October 2023 MPS. Excluding the impact of the increase in the GST rate this year, core inflation is forecast at 1.5&ndash;2.5%.</span></p>
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Amid the declines in COE premiums since November and the larger COE supply this year compared to 2023, CPI-All Items inflation in 2024 is now forecast to be lower at 2.5&ndash;3.5%, down from the previous range of 3&ndash;4%. Excluding the effects of the increase in the GST rate, headline inflation is forecast at 1.5&ndash;2.5%.</span></p>
<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Both upside and downside risks to the inflation outlook remain. Shocks to global food and energy prices or domestic labour costs could bring about additional inflationary pressures. However, an unexpected weakening in the global economy could induce a faster easing of cost and price pressures.</span></p>
<h2>MONETARY POLICY</h2>
<p><span>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;Barring any further global shocks, the Singapore economy is expected to strengthen in 2024, with growth becoming more broad-based. MAS Core Inflation is likely to remain elevated in the earlier part of the year, but should decline gradually and step down by Q4, before falling further next year.</span></p>
<p><span>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, current monetary policy settings remain appropriate. The sustained appreciation of the policy band will continue to dampen imported inflation and curb domestic cost pressures, thus ensuring medium-term price stability.</span></p>
<p><span>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span><span>MAS will therefore maintain the prevailing rate of appreciation of the S$NEER policy band. There will be no change to its width and the level at which it is centred.</span></span>&nbsp;MAS will closely monitor global and domestic economic developments, and remain vigilant to risks to inflation and growth.</span></p>

<title>China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) Bans Securities Lending During Restricted Periods</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In an effort to stabilize the country's stock markets, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has announced the suspension of lending restricted shares, effective from Monday. This move comes after recent sharp falls in the market and is part of a series of supportive policies implemented by Beijing.</p>
<p>Restricted shares, which are subject to limits on sale, are often offered to company employees or certain investors. However, they can be lent for trading purposes, putting additional pressure on markets during a downward trend.</p>
<p>The CSRC's decision aims to promote fairness and reasonableness, reduce the efficiency of securities lending, and level the playing field for investors. The regulator also intends to crack down on illegal activities that exploit securities lending to reduce holdings and cash out.</p>
<p>To further regulate the market, the CSRC will also limit the efficiency of securities lending in the securities refinancing market starting March 18.</p>
<p>Although the blue-chip CSI300 Index has seen some recovery, China's stock market continues to struggle. As a result, small Chinese investors are seeking alternatives to the domestic economy, driving up premiums on global index funds.</p>
<p>China's economy grew slightly above the government's target in 2023, but the recovery has been inconsistent. December data revealed weak consumption and a significant decline in home prices, indicating a deep crisis in the property market.</p>
<p>To align with the CSRC's measures, both the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges will suspend securities lending by strategic investors during lockup periods starting January 29.</p>
