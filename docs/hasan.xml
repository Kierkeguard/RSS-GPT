<div> Keywords: Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, Proliferation Financing, National Risk Assessments, Illicit Finance Threats

Summary:<br><br>
The U.S. Department of the Treasury published the 2024 National Risk Assessments on Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Proliferation Financing, highlighting significant threats, vulnerabilities, and risks. It details updates to the anti-money laundering framework and explains changes in the illicit finance risk environment, including ongoing fentanyl crisis, terrorist attacks, ransomware attacks, professional money laundering, and digitization of payments. These assessments also address threats to global peace and security, shaping the illicit finance risk environment in the United States. The reports are the fourth iterations of the money laundering and terrorist financing risk assessment and the third update of the proliferation financing risk assessment. It encourages the public and private sectors to use the updated assessments to understand the current illicit finance environment and inform their risk mitigation strategies. Key findings include issues related to money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing. The report highlights the misuse of legal entities, the lack of transparency in certain real estate transactions, and pockets of weakness in compliance or supervision at some regulated U.S. financial institutions as persistent and emerging money laundering risks. It also discusses the wide range of terrorist financing threats and actors, both foreign and domestic, as well as the heightened risk of Russia and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) in proliferation financing. Coming weeks will see the release of the 2024 National Strategy for Combatting Terrorist and Other Illicit Finance, informed by the analysis contained in the risk assessments, sharing recommendations for addressing the highlighted issues. Valuable feedback has aided Treasury in assessing and addressing illicit finance risk, supporting improvements to the AML/CFT regime. <div>
<p>Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury published the 2024 National Risk Assessments on Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Proliferation Financing. These reports highlight the most significant illicit finance threats, vulnerabilities, and risks facing the United States.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reports detail recent, significant updates to the U.S. anti-money laundering/counter-financing of terrorism framework and explain changes to the illicit finance risk environment. These include the ongoing fentanyl crisis, foreign and domestic terrorist attacks and related financing, increased potency of ransomware attacks, the growth of professional money laundering, and continued digitization of payments and financial services. These assessments also address how significant threats to global peace and security&mdash;such as Russia&rsquo;s ongoing illegal, unprovoked, and unjustified war in Ukraine and Hamas&rsquo;s October 7, 2023 terrorist attacks in Israel&mdash;have shaped the illicit finance risk environment in the United States.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s publications are the fourth iterations of the money laundering and terrorist financing risk assessment, and the third update of the proliferation financing risk assessment, in less than a decade. The public and private sectors can use these updated risk assessments to better understand the current illicit finance environment and inform their own risk mitigation strategies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether it&rsquo;s terrorism, drug trafficking, Russian aggression, or corruption, illicit finance is the common thread across our nation&rsquo;s biggest national security threats,&rdquo; said Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian E. Nelson. &ldquo;Treasury, through our National Risk Assessments, is at the cutting edge of analyzing the global risk environment to protect the U.S. and international financial systems from abuse by illicit actors. We urge both the public and private sectors to engage with these reports, as well as our forthcoming National Strategy for Combatting Terrorist and Other Illicit Finance.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>KEY FINDINGS:</h3>
<ul>
<li><span>Money Laundering</span>: Criminals use both traditional and novel money laundering techniques, depending on availability and convenience, to move and conceal illicit proceeds and promote criminal activity that harms Americans. The crimes that generate the largest amount of illicit proceeds laundered in or through the United States remain fraud, drug trafficking, cybercrime, human trafficking and human smuggling, and corruption. The United States continues to face both persistent and emerging money laundering risks related to: (1) the misuse of legal entities; (2) the lack of transparency in certain real estate transactions; (3) the lack of comprehensive AML/CFT coverage for certain sectors, particularly investment advisers; (4) complicit merchants and professionals that misuse their positions or businesses; and (5) pockets of weaknesses in compliance or supervision at some regulated U.S. financial institutions.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Terrorist Financing</span>: The United States continues to face a wide range of terrorist financing threats and actors, both foreign and domestic. Consistent with the 2022 risk assessment, the most common financial connections between individuals in the United States and foreign terrorist groups entail individuals directly soliciting funds for or attempting to send funds to foreign terrorist groups utilizing cash, registered money services businesses, or in some cases, virtual assets. The 2024 report also discusses Hamas and the ways they exploit the international financial system, including through solicitation of funds from witting and unwitting donors worldwide. Additionally, domestic violent extremist movements have proliferated in recent years, posing an elevated threat to the United States and continued challenges for law enforcement.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Proliferation Financing</span>: Russia and the Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea (DPRK) presented heightened risk since the 2022 assessment. To support its unlawful war in Ukraine, Russia has expanded efforts to illegally acquire U.S.-origin goods with military applications using a variety of obfuscation techniques, such as the use of front companies and transshipment points around the world. Networks linked to the DPRK increasingly exploit the digital economy, including through hacking of virtual asset service providers and the overseas deployment of fraudulent information technology workers.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Treasury&rsquo;s Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes led the assessment process and coordinated closely with offices and bureaus across the Department, relevant law enforcement and regulatory agencies, staff of the federal functional regulators, and across the intelligence and diplomatic communities.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks, Treasury will release the 2024 National Strategy for Combatting Terrorist and Other Illicit Finance, a strategic plan directly informed by the analysis contained in the risk assessments. In the strategy, Treasury will share recommendations for addressing the highlighted issues. This valuable feedback has aided Treasury in assessing and addressing illicit finance risk identified in prior iterations of the strategy to support improvements to the AML/CFT regime, including the launching of the new beneficial ownership reporting requirement that went into effect on January 1, 2024, and informing forthcoming proposed rules to address illicit finance vulnerabilities in the residential real estate sector and for certain investment advisers.</p>

<div> Advisory Committee, AIMO Prize, Timothy Gowers, Terence Tao, Dan Roberts<br />
<br />
The AIMO Prize is a $10mn challenge fund to create an AI model capable of winning gold at the International Mathematical Olympiad. The committee includes Field Medal winners Gowers and Tao, along with other experts in math, AI, and machine learning. The prize will reward publicly shared AI models achieving specific milestones up to the grand prize of $5mn. A series of AIMO approved competitions will start in early 2024.<br />
Summary:<br />
The AIMO Prize offers a $10mn challenge to create an AI model capable of winning gold at the International Mathematical Olympiad. The committee includes Field Medal winners Gowers and Tao, aiming to encourage research in the AI and mathematics field. Competitions will begin in early 2024, offering progress prizes leading up to the grand prize of $5mn. <div>
<p>XTX Markets' newly created Artificial Intelligence Mathematical Olympiad Prize ('AIMO Prize') is a $10mn challenge fund designed to spur the creation of a publicly shared AI model capable of winning a gold medal in the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO).</p>
<p>XTX Markets is delighted to be joined by a group of prominent mathematicians, and AI and machine learning specialists. The group includes Timothy Gowers and Terence Tao, both winners of the Fields Medal, one of the most prestigious awards in mathematics.</p>
<p>Alongside them are Po-Shen Loh, the former coach of the US IMO Team; Dan Roberts, an AI researcher at Sequoia Capital and MIT and a published expert in machine learning; and Geoff Smith, the former President of the IMO.</p>
<p>The AIMO Advisory Committee will support the development of the AIMO Prize, including advising on appropriate protocols and technical aspects, and designing the various competitions and prizes.</p>
<p><b>Terence Tao, Fields Medallist and Professor of Mathematics at UCLA,&nbsp;</b>commented:</p>
<p><i>"Despite recent advances, using AI to solve, or at least assist with solving, advanced mathematical problems remains an incredibly complicated and multifaceted challenge. It will be important to experiment with multiple approaches to this goal, and to benchmark the performance of each of them.</i></p>
<p><i>The AIMO Prize promises to provide at least one such set of benchmarks which will help compare different AI problem solving strategies at a technical level, in a manner that will be accessible and appealing to the broader public."</i></p>
<p><b>Timothy Gowers, Fields Medallist and Professor of Combinatorics at the Coll&egrave;ge de France,&nbsp;</b>commented:</p>
<p><i>"Machine learning methods have had spectacular success in several domains, but their performance on tasks that involve multi-step reasoning still lags behind. For this reason, solving advanced mathematics problems has been increasingly recognised as a major frontier for AI, the passing of which has the potential to open up a new wave of important applications. The AIMO prize will play a valuable role by stimulating research in this direction.</i></p>
<p><i>It is particularly welcome that the prizes are for publicly available research, as this will lead to faster and more efficient progress.''</i></p>
<p>There will be a grand prize of $5mn for the first publicly shared AI model to enter an AIMO approved competition and perform at a standard equivalent to a gold medal in the IMO. There will also be a series of progress prizes, totalling up to $5mn, for publicly shared AI models that achieve key milestones towards the grand prize.</p>
<p>The first AIMO approved competitions will open to participants in early 2024. There will be a presentation of progress held in Bath, England in July 2024, as part of the&nbsp;<a href="http://email.prnewswire.com/ls/click?upn=3slWLw94I3jq-2B-2FedjFNgZKyMLJAVAKQSEoqEtVhXFms-3DDbIo_O3XWFiAdWrzzrOIt72qAuNe9dxlo4g-2BA060UwSy-2BE-2FLtoEpk1TTaSx-2BajZQ9riiU1IBdUHYVRK8l-2B4NseQWBdXaEsNjXp00-2BbeHUS-2BpQaEcQMogilIRzeFmlGi9lbct-2BYao2xTOlou8QFLYuyc2OyN8QPlgWh9R8Im2Tki99Op-2FDWzxedI0KSByCXQF0kYPLrTOJYNd5IOojZFZ-2FY4-2Bxo-2BGgnncY6NVUrs1a9xKNqu0pNNoG8C-2F8jRgXJjpmRljk08WDdI8bbf4g9N6wC7Hz8Y8QiZBomDjNdROKUvvNxWnIiDmIIEzlYsfmZjAOPWHtywUMLe96JuebgMjUxcZV9J2wy4y3VegWUpaYh40Pfws20vs8Y8WrwAthLXfJBslS" target="_blank">65th IMO</a>.

<title>Eurex To Launch First Total Return Futures On MSCI Indexes</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/eurex-to-launch-first-total-return-futures-on-msci-indexes/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Cooperation, MSCI, TRF, Eurex, derivatives<br />
<br />Summary: Eurex is expanding its Total Return Futures segment through a collaboration with MSCI, launching TRF contracts on MSCI indexes, denominated in USD and available during US trading hours. This reflects the global shift from swap instruments to listed derivatives and the increasing demand for TRFs on global indexes, offering enhanced capital efficiencies to market participants. <div>
<ul class="rte--list">
<li>Eurex is expanding its Total Return Futures (TRF) segment</li>
<li>Launch of first TRFs covering MSCI indexes planned for 11 March</li>
<li>New contracts will be denominated in USD and initially available during US trading hours</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="x">Eurex is extending its Total Return Futures (TRF) segment through a cooperation with MSCI, a leading provider of essential decision tools and services to the global investment community.</p>
<p>Scheduled for 11 March 2024, the derivatives arm of Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group plans to launch TRF contracts on three MSCI indexes: MSCI World Index, MSCI EAFE Index, and MSCI Emerging Markets Index. The launch reflects Eurex&rsquo;s commitment to provide pioneering solutions that support the global shift from swap instruments towards listed and centrally cleared derivatives.</p>
<p><strong>Evolving demand for cleared and listed TRFs on global indexes</strong></p>
<p>The new TRFs will mark an additional milestone in Eurex&rsquo;s TRF success story, as for the first time TRFs on global indexes are offered, which are increasingly in demand by market participants. The new contracts will cover the net return versions of the following indexes: MSCI World Index (TMWO), MSCI EAFE Index (TMFA), and MSCI EM Index (TMEM). The TRFs will be denominated in USD. The underlying benchmark US funding rate is SOFR (Secured Overnight Funding Rate). For technical reasons, they will initially be available during US trading hours (14:30 &ndash; 22:00 CET, 08:30 am ET &ndash; 04:00 pm ET). Expansion to European morning and Asian trading sessions is planned later in 2024.</p>
<p>Randolf Roth, member of the Eurex Executive Board: &ldquo;Eurex reinforces its commitment and continues to lead in delivering innovative solutions that address increased capital requirements by offering important capital efficiencies to our sell-side and buy-side customers. We are pleased to work with MSCI to further strengthen and expand the TRF success story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George Harrington, managing director at MSCI: &ldquo;We're pleased to work with Eurex as they expand their TRF segment to include MSCI Indexes. This reflects the increasing demand for cleared and listed TRFs on global benchmarks, offering enhanced capital efficiencies to market participants.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Complementing Eurex&rsquo;s existing product suite</strong></p>
<p>TRFs' objective is to replicate the returns of traditional bilaterally negotiated equity or equity index-based swaps. However, compared to swaps, central clearing enables portfolio margining, simplifies settlement, and mitigates counterparty risk.</p>
<p>The new TRF contracts complement Eurex&rsquo;s existing TRF suite, which includes benchmark Index TRFs, individual Equity TRFs and Basket TRFs. Eurex is the leading global marketplace with the broadest offering in TRFs and the largest open interest pool.</p>
<p>Eurex launched the TRF segment in 2016 with the listing of the first Total Return Futures on the EURO STOXX 50 Index. Equity Total Return Futures on EUR-denominated stocks with more than 250 underlyings and the new basket trade functionality followed in October 2019. FTSE 100 Index TRFs and additional GBP-denominated equity TRFs on 73 stocks have been available since March 2021 and November 2023 respectively. Since launch, Eurex has managed to migrate most of the EURO STOXX 50 OTC Swaps market to its product. The current open interest in TRFs at Eurex stands at more than 3 million contracts or EUR 125 billion in notional terms.</p>

It will work as a Validation Agent to Legal Entity Identifier India Ltd. (LEIL), a GLEIF accredited LEI issuer and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Clearing Corporation of India Ltd.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US"><span>MNS is a leading B2B debt management and business information company based in New Delhi, India. By becoming the second Validation Agent operating in the region, it will bolster support for LEI issuance amid increasing demand &mdash; helping to realize a simpler, faster, and more convenient experience both for its clients and internally.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US"><span>Given the strong level of international support for the broader utilization of the LEI in cross-border payments use-cases, the Validation Agent framework network is playing an increasingly important role in facilitating LEI issuance in support of efforts to counter global criminality. The ongoing expansion of the Validation Agent network &mdash; which now stands at more than 10 organizations globally, spanning Africa, Australasia, China, Europe, India, the Middle East, and North America &mdash; reinforces the tremendous advantages participants gain in their relentless battle against financial crime, striving for enhanced transparency, efficiency, and security in payment processes.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US"><span>GLEIF encourages banks, financial institutions, and other organizations to consider taking a proactive approach to supporting voluntary customer adoption of the LEI by becoming a Validation Agent in the Global LEI System. In addition to easing the process of LEI implementation by making LEI issuance more convenient and accessible for customers, becoming a Validation Agent can deliver significant advantages for financial institutions themselves. By utilizing &lsquo;business-as-usual&rsquo; onboarding processes to obtain LEIs for clients, financial institutions can improve customer experience, facilitate digital transformation, and reduce client lifecycle management costs.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US"><span>Fresh worldwide impetus for the LEI follows support from key stakeholders advocating for its inclusion within ISO 20022 payment messages to enable more transparent cross-border payments.

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US"><span>Stephan Wolf, CEO of GLEIF, comments: "Welcoming MNS to the Validation Agent network marks another important development for the Global LEI System. Given widespread industry recognition of the foundational role that the LEI can play in enabling faster, cheaper, more transparent and inclusive cross-border transactions, India&rsquo;s drumbeat of support for the LEI over recent years offers a compelling precedent&mdash;underscoring the potential for jurisdictions around the world to take the fight to global financial crime by driving forward LEI adoption."</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US"><span>Sustained growth in LEI issuance in India, particularly across its dynamic and thriving small to medium enterprise (SME) population, stems principally from an advanced regulatory agenda. In recent years, bodies such as the Reserve Bank of India, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the Insurance Regulatory, Development Authority of India, and Income Tax Department have all mandated and recommended LEI usage across various applications. These include over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, credit borrowing, large value payments, insurance, cross-border transactions and income tax regulation beyond certain amount. Beyond regulatory mandates, the downstream impact of wider LEI adoption is also increasing financial inclusion, as SMEs are more easily able to verify their identities across borders, supporting greater participation in global markets.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US"><span>Seema Kumar, Director of MNS Credit, comments: "As a Validation Agent, we are committed to leveraging over two decades of local expertise to engage and educate legal entities on the significant opportunities afforded by the LEI, while streamlining the LEI issuance process and reducing onboarding time. This will play a crucial role in mitigating systemic risks, while helping to realize the promise of digital transformation across the Indian marketplace and beyond."</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US"><span>Wolf adds: &ldquo;The LEI has become embedded within the fabric of the Indian economy as a critical business enabler, with its unique capabilities as a universal identifier delivering the trust and transparency needed to not only ensure regulatory compliance, but also open the door to global markets. This is particularly true for India's myriad SMEs, who have traditionally been inhibited and constrained by an inability to prove and verify their identity.</span></span></span></span><span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<div> Australia, FAR, compliance, accountability, StarCompliance
<br /><br />Survey reveals 61% cover 4+ areas of compliance, 43% rely on manual processes, 57% lack automation, 49% struggle with infrastructure, 82% aware of FAR but only 39% know details. Star's solution streamlines compliance, provides clarity on FAR, and fosters a culture of accountability and professionalism. Financial firms need to understand and align with FAR and accountable persons.
<br /><br />Summary: 
Compliance survey shows challenges in Australia, with high reliance on manual processes and lack of automation. Star's solution provides clarity on FAR and streamlines compliance, fostering a culture of accountability and professionalism. Financial firms need to understand and align with FAR and accountable persons. <div>
<p>StarCompliance ("Star"), a leading SaaS provider of employee compliance technology solutions, has extended its Individual Accountability Regime (IAR) solution to include Australia's new Financial Accountability Regime (FAR). This will allow financial services firms regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) to comply more easily with the regulation, and establish a strong, firm-wide culture of individual accountability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>FAR is designed to improve the risk and governance cultures of Australia's financial institutions and is an extension of the current Banking Executive Accountability Regime (BEAR) introduced in 2018. A strong, firm-wide culture of responsibility and ethical behavior in financial institutions starts with the individual accountability of its senior executives, and over the past five years, there has been a 300% increase in the number of individual accountability regimes enacted globally.</p>
<p>Today's announcement follows the results of an independent market survey of financial services compliance professionals in Australia, commissioned by Star in Q3 2023, to provide deeper insights into the country's employee compliance landscape and the readiness of Australian firms for FAR.</p>
<p>The survey revealed that:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>61% of respondents cover four or more areas of compliance</li>
<li>43% still rely on manual compliance processes</li>

<p>To ensure full compliance with FAR, firms need clarity on the requirements; the ability to stay up to date as the regulation changes; streamlined, automated and easy-to-implement business processes; and certainty of comprehensive and proactive governance and insight. Less than half of the firms surveyed (43%) are confident that the processes they currently have in place for BEAR will allow them to comply with FAR.</p>
<p>"Just as compliance professionals in jurisdictions globally are often stretched and face pressures on multiple fronts, those in Australia are dealing with a range of challenges," said Jennifer Sun, CEO of StarCompliance. "With Star's Accountability &amp; Competency solution, firms are not only able to streamline compliance with the new Financial Accountability Regime &ndash; they can also drive enterprise-wide professionalism to help foster a culture of compliance that bolsters the firm's reputation."</p>
<p>"Successful compliance with Australia's FAR regime will rely on understanding the complexity of the regulation in the context of the entire business and aligning it to accountability across the firm's accountable persons," said Craig Jones, Chief Revenue Officer at StarCompliance. "Star was the first vendor to provide a suite of software solutions that support and simplify compliance for multiple individual accountability regimes globally.

<div> upgrade, economic outlook, domestic demand, fiscal stimulus, stock market

Summary:<br /> The International Monetary Fund (IMF) upgraded Thailand’s economic outlook to 4.4 percent. The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) saw cuts in listed companies’ profit growth and fund outflows due to lower economic growth. The SET Index fell by 3.6 percent in January, with foreign investors selling Thai shares. The Thailand Futures Exchange (TFEX) saw a decrease in daily trading volume. <div>
<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has upgraded Thailand&rsquo;s economic outlook this year to 4.4 percent from 3.6 percent earlier forecast, underpinned by the growing domestic demand and private consumption propelled by the government&rsquo;s fiscal stimulus. As the global inflation is cooling faster than expected, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)&nbsp; has kept its short-term interest unchanged at 5.25-5.50 percent until higher confidence that inflation will be eased to 2 percent in a sustainable manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Senior Executive Vice President of The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) Soraphol Tulayasathien</b> said that pessimism on the lower-than-expected economic growth for the final quarter of 2023 triggered cuts in listed companies&rsquo; 2023 profit growth and fund outflows from the Thai stock market in January 2024, accordingly. If tracking back foreign investors&rsquo; fund flows over the past 10 years, fund inflows were seen only in the years when listed companies&rsquo; profit forecast was raised&nbsp; significantly.&nbsp; Despite the offshore fund pullback, foreign investors&rsquo; shareholding value compared to market capitalization remained close to the historical average. Moreover, the Thai stock market&rsquo;s price to book value was still low while dividend yield rose to 3.24 percent.&nbsp; However, investor confidence in the Thai stock market in January 2024 declined from early last year, dampened by local and overseas factors.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Key highlights for January</b><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<ul>
<li>At the end of January 2024, SET Index fell by 3.6 percent from the previous month to close at 1,364.52 points, moving in line with the regional peers.</li>
<li>In January, industry groups that outperformed SET Index compared with the end of 2023 were Consumer Products, Resources, Services, Agro and Food Industry, and Technology.</li>
<li>SET&rsquo;s and Market for Alternative Investment (mai)&rsquo;s average daily trading value in January 2024 dropped 34.6 percent from a year earlier to THB 47.11 billion (approx. USD 1.32 billion). Foreign investors turned to sell Thai shares in January with a net THB 30.87 billion in January 2024 after they were net buyers in the preceding month. Their trading ratio was higher than any other types of investors for 21 consecutive months. </li>
<li>In January, there were a newly listed company on SET: Advice IT Infinite pcl (ADVICE). </li>
<li>The Thai stock exchange&rsquo;s forward P/E ratio at the end of January 2024 was 15.5 times, above the Asian stock market&rsquo;s average of 12.9 times. The historical P/E ratio stood at 16.7 times, exceeding the Asian stock market&rsquo;s average of 14.7 times.</li>
<li>Dividend yield ratio at the end of January 2024 was 3.24 percent, below the Asian stock market&rsquo;s average of 3.31 percent.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Derivatives Market</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Thailand Futures Exchange (TFEX)&rsquo;s daily trading volume in January 2024 averaged 404,435 contracts, down 17.3 percent from the previous month largely due to the lower trading volume of Single Stock Futures and SET50 Index Futures.</li>

<title>SEC Charges China-Based Tech Company Cloopen Group With Accounting Fraud - Commission Declines To Impose Civil Penalties Because Of Company’s Self-Reporting, Cooperation And Remediation</title>

<div> fraud charges, Cloopen Group Holding Limited, accounting issues, cooperation, remedial measures <br />
Cloopen Group Holding Limited, a China-based cloud communications provider, faced settled accounting fraud charges for prematurely recognizing revenue on service contracts. Senior managers orchestrated the fraudulent scheme to meet sales targets, leading to overstated financial results. However, the company self-reported the violations, cooperated with the SEC, and implemented prompt remedial measures.<br /><br />Summary: The SEC announced settled accounting fraud charges against Cloopen Group Holding Limited for prematurely recognizing revenue on service contracts. The company self-reported the violations, cooperated with the SEC, and implemented prompt remedial measures. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled accounting fraud charges against Cloopen Group Holding Limited, a China-based provider of cloud communications products and services whose American depositary shares formerly traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The SEC determined not to impose civil penalties against Cloopen because the company self-reported its accounting issues, cooperated extensively with the staff&rsquo;s investigation, and undertook prompt remedial measures.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, two senior managers who led Cloopen&rsquo;s strategic customer contracts and key accounts department orchestrated a fraudulent scheme from May 2021 through February 2022 to prematurely recognize revenue on service contracts. The order finds that, facing pressure to meet strict quarterly sales targets, the two senior managers directed their employees to improperly recognize revenue on numerous contracts for which Cloopen had either not completed work or, in some instances, not even started work. As a result of this misconduct and other accounting errors, Cloopen overstated its unaudited financial results for the second and third quarters of 2021 and its announced revenue guidance for the fourth quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>Within a few days of starting an internal investigation, Cloopen self-reported the accounting violations to the SEC and subsequently provided substantial cooperation to the staff, including summarizing interviews of witnesses located in China and identifying and translating key documents originally written in Chinese. Cloopen also implemented prompt remedial measures, which included firing or disciplining the people involved in the fraudulent scheme, reorganizing the departments engaged in the misconduct, strengthening its accounting controls, and recruiting new finance and accounting staff with expertise in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This enforcement action demonstrates what we have said repeatedly: there are real benefits to companies that self-report their potential securities law violations, assist during our investigations, and undertake remedial measures,&rdquo; said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;As detailed in our order, Cloopen, a foreign issuer, promptly self-reported accounting errors to Commission staff, provided detailed explanations of the transactions at issue, and cooperated in other ways that substantially advanced the investigation. Cloopen also promptly undertook significant remedial measures, including terminating and disciplining employees involved in the misconduct, strengthening its internal accounting controls, and clawing back compensation from its CEO and CFO. In consideration of Cloopen&rsquo;s significant cooperation, the Commission determined not to impose a civil penalty against Cloopen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that Cloopen violated the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as well as certain reporting, recordkeeping, and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, Cloopen agreed to cease and desist from further violations of the charged securities laws.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Duncan C. Simpson LaGoy and Ellen Chen and supervised by David Zhou and Jason H. Lee of the San Francisco Regional Office.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Dealer, No Dealer?[1] : Statement On Further Definition Of “As A Part Of A Regular Business” In The Definition Of Dealer And Government Securities Dealer In Connection With Certain Liquidity Providers, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, Feb. 6, 2024</title>

<div> Keywords: final rule, dealer definition, liquidity provision, market behavior, regulatory oversight<br />
Summary: The final rule redefines the dealer, capturing more market participants and creating market uncertainty. It penalizes liquidity provision, reduces liquidity, and harms competition. The rule is ambiguous, overlooks implementation challenges, and affects private funds and pension funds. It also raises questions regarding the application of the rule in the crypto market. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Thank you, Mr. Chair. I cannot support the final rule. Even though streamlined substantially,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;it perpetuates the proposal&rsquo;s fundamental flaw. The rule defines dealer in a way that is inconsistent with the statutory framework within which it sits and will distort market behavior and degrade market quality.</p>
<p>This rule turns traders, many of whom are customers, into dealers. Doing so runs counter to the statute, as the Commission and market participants have read it for decades. The Exchange Act defines a dealer as a person that is &ldquo;engaged in the business of buying and selling securities&rdquo; for its &ldquo;own account through a broker or otherwise,&rdquo; but&mdash;importantly&mdash;excludes &ldquo;a person that buys or sells securities . . . for [its] own account, either individually or in a fiduciary capacity, but not as a part of a regular business.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;Nearly any firm in the financial markets that trades securities as a principal does so &ldquo;as part of a regular business.&rdquo; Recognizing the breadth of this language read out of context, the Commission has long appropriately interpreted this provision in a way that distinguishes between market participants that operate a dealing business and those that operate an investing and trading business.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;To this end, the Commission and Commission staff repeatedly have issued guidance on what we have called the dealer-trader distinction.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>The rule the Commission is considering today obliterates this distinction by extending the definition of &ldquo;dealer&rdquo; to market participants that run investing and trading businesses, not dealing businesses. Rather than looking to whether the &ldquo;regular business&rdquo; of the firm bears the hallmarks of dealing activity,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;today&rsquo;s rule would capture any person whose &ldquo;regular business&rdquo; involves trading activity for its own account that provides liquidity on a more than &ldquo;incidental&rdquo; basis.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;Although the Commission and its staff have previously stated that liquidity provision may be indicative of dealing activity, it has not to my knowledge ever before stated categorically that liquidity provision alone by a person trading for its own account constitutes dealing activity or that trading activity becomes dealing activity merely because it has the effect of providing liquidity.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p>And for good reason: Once liquidity provision&mdash;not in the form of a service provided to market participants but as an effect of one&rsquo;s trading activity&mdash;turns a person into a dealer, the dealer-trader distinction becomes unintelligible. The rule itself demonstrates this: The statutory trader exception is no longer sufficient to exclude registered investment companies from the dealer definition; the final rule is so broad that the Commission has determined that it needed to expressly exclude these investment funds. The express regulatory exclusion for investment companies suggests that the Commission believes that the statutory exception for traders is insufficient to exclude entities that almost no one has conceived could be dealers, that likely could not operate under broker-dealer regulations, and for which Congress has established an entirely different statutory framework. Such a narrow reading of the statutory exception is clearly a misreading of the statute. The upheaval wrought by the rule&rsquo;s singular focus on liquidity provision creates uncertainty about dealer status for many market participants who rely on the trader exception.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;Perhaps recognizing this, the Commission only briefly touches on the dealer-trader distinction in the release, conveniently avoids proffering any explanation for departing from the prior understanding of that exception, and instead asserts that the rule is &ldquo;intended to reflect the longstanding [dealer-trader] distinction.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p>The express regulatory exclusion avoids creating absurd results for registered investment companies, but the rule still produces absurdities. The adopting release acknowledges that the market participants that will be forced to register under the final rule may not have any characteristics of dealers under the current rule.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;Instead, simply executing any of a number of common trading, investing, and risk management strategies could turn a market participant into a dealer if doing so happens to provide significant liquidity to the market. Not only will these entities be subject to a dealer regulatory regime that does not make sense for them,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;but they will lose the protections now afforded to them as customers.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p>In addition to harming the market participants who find themselves transformed into dealers, this rule harms the broader market. It penalizes liquidity provision, which means there will be less of it. The penalty comes in the form of a costly and ill-fitting regulatory regime for liquidity-providing market participants. For playing this important role, principal trading firms, private funds, and other market participants swept up by the rule will now have to &ldquo;register with the Commission and become members of an SRO; [and] comply with Commission and SRO rules, including certain financial responsibility and risk management rules, transaction and other reporting requirements, operational integrity rules, and books and records requirements.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;They also have to become members of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (&ldquo;SIPC&rdquo;). When serving the markets comes with such onerous and unsuitable regulatory requirements, some market participants will decide to stop the activities that give rise to the positive liquidity provision externality. The Commission is attempting to solve the problem of inadequate liquidity provision in times of crisis by reducing liquidity provision ex ante. How this advances the Commission&rsquo;s objective of shoring up liquidity provision is beyond me.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></p>
<p>The Commission casts this rule as part of an effort to protect competition,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>&nbsp;but the rule will drive competitors out of the markets. By penalizing trading and investing strategies that have the effect of providing liquidity to the markets, the rule will dampen liquidity provision. The extra costs will cause firms to consolidate so that they can spread the fixed costs of the dealer regulatory regime over more activity. Small and mid-size participants that enhance the diversity and robustness of the ranks of liquidity providers will disappear, and liquidity providers will become more concentrated and more homogenous, which will make both these firms and the market more fragile.</p>
<p>The Commission contends that this rule is necessary to give us &ldquo;more comprehensive regulatory oversight of securities markets.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>&nbsp;The SEC commonly falls back on this justification for rulemaking, but being an effective regulator does not require comprehensive surveillance and a prescriptive regulatory regime governing the activities of every market participant. In any case, we already have lots of data to conduct regulatory oversight: the Consolidated Audit Trail&rsquo;s comprehensive monitoring of the equity and options markets, the ever-expanding Form PF to collect granular private fund data, the Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (&ldquo;TRACE&rdquo;), large trader reporting, data arising from mandatory proprietary trader registration with FINRA, and the list goes on.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a>&nbsp;A regulator&rsquo;s temptation may be to put every corner of the market under a regulatory spotlight and into a regulatory straitjacket, but a clear-eyed view takes into account the costs of such &ldquo;comprehensive oversight&rdquo; to the healthy, dynamic functioning of the market and the investors and issuers that participate in it.</p>
<p>In addition to these fundamental flaws, the new rule comes with other problems, including serious implementation challenges. The rule is ambiguous in scope, which almost certainly will bring in firms the Commission has given no thought to including.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>&nbsp;These firms will incur significant costs in registering as dealers or changing their businesses so they do not have to register. The implementation period is too short, particularly given the involvement of both FINRA and SIPC.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a>&nbsp;The likely interactions with other rules are unpredictable. And, not surprisingly, the rule reflects little thought regarding its practical application in the crypto markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a></p>
<p>Thank you to the staff in the Division of Trading and Markets, the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, and the Office of General Counsel for your work on this release. You continue to impress me with your diligence and concern for the well-being of our markets. I know that the work will not stop with today&rsquo;s adoption, but will continue through implementation, so thank you in advance for that.</p>
<p>I have a number of questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>For DERA, the economic analysis acknowledges that the rule&rsquo;s consequences are difficult to predict.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a><ol>
<li>What metrics do we plan to use to measure the positive and negative consequences of this rule in a retrospective review several years from now?</li>
<li>What could we see that would suggest the rule was a success?</li>
<li>Will we be able to measure whether the rule has harmed liquidity provision?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The decision not to scope out private funds and pension funds is puzzling given the ill-fitting nature of dealer rules on funds.<ol>
<li>What is the logic for excluding registered investment companies, but not private funds and pension funds, which are also pooled investment vehicles?</li>
<li>How many private funds and pension funds do you anticipate will be pulled into dealer registration by these new amendments?</li>
<li>Will a private fund or pension fund that has to register as a dealer under the rule face any unique challenges? For example, a private fund&rsquo;s liquidity rights for investors could conflict with the net capital rule, or assessing applicability of the rule that pursues multiple independent trading strategies might have to coordinate trading in violation of the fund&rsquo;s policies and procedures.</li>
<li>How will the relationship of a private fund or a pension fund with its broker-dealers change so as to diminish customer protections if the fund has to register as a dealer?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The Release explains that a crypto automated market maker might have to register as a dealer under the final rules. How can a software protocol register as a dealer?</li>
<li>What will the Commission do to work with FINRA and SIPC to ensure that all new dealers swept up by the rule will be able to be onboarded within the one-year compliance period?</li>
<li>The final rule does not exclude investment advisers, as some commenters had hoped.<ol>
<li>Why would it make sense for an investment adviser, which is already subject to a regulatory framework, to register as a dealer, and would doing so present any challenges to carrying out the adviser&rsquo;s fiduciary duties?</li>
<li>If an adviser provides seed capital for a strategy that triggers the new dealer definition, would the adviser have to register? If so, why does that make sense?</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

This rulemaking, for example, could be recast as &ldquo;Dealer, No Dealer?&rdquo; The long running, popular game show, &ldquo;Deal or No Deal,&rdquo; presented contestants with 26 sealed briefcases, each of which represents an amount between one penny and $1 million. The contestant picks one, leaves it unopened, and then proceeds to pick other briefcases to be opened. As each briefcase&rsquo;s contents are revealed, the contestant&rsquo;s odds of winning the $1 million change. A shadowy &ldquo;banker,&rdquo; watching the odds and the contestant&rsquo;s emotions change, presents the contestant with periodic sell-your-briefcase deals of less than $1 million. Thus, how much contestants take home varies greatly and arbitrarily without having much to do with their actions. This rulemaking process has the same feel: whether a particular market participant lands in the dealer or no-dealer bucket seems largely a function of chance and the mercurial Commission&rsquo;s whim. To add a bit more rigor and predictability to the process, at the very least, we ought to have reproposed the rule to allow commenters to weigh in on a rule that differs substantially from what was proposed. Even under the new rule, classification as a dealer under the Commission&rsquo;s new approach will be somewhat arbitrary.</p>

<p>&bull; Regularly expressing trading interest that is at or near the best available prices on both sides of the market for the same security, and that is communicated and represented in a way that makes it accessible to other market participants; or</p>
<p>&bull; Earning revenue primarily from capturing bid-ask spreads, by buying at the bid and selling at the offer, or from capturing any incentives offered by trading venues to liquidity-supplying trading interest.</p>

Indeed, the Commission explained that &ldquo;dealers normally have a regular clientele, hold themselves out as buying or selling securities at a regular place of business, have a regular turnover of inventory . . . , and generally provide liquidity services in transactions with investors (or, in the case of dealers who are market makers, for other professionals).&rdquo; Definition of Terms Release, 68 FR at 8688 (emphasis added). In other words, liquidity provision is relevant in the context of other indicia of dealing activity, as something that one presumably intentionally provides as a service to investors or other professionals. Nothing in this language warrants concluding that the Commission&rsquo;s position before this release lends any support to a rule that defines dealer to include a person solely because its trading activity &ldquo;has the effect of providing liquidity to other market participants,&rdquo; much less that the final rule &ldquo;reflect[s]&rdquo; (rather than abolishes) &ldquo;the longstanding distinction between&rdquo; traders and dealers.

The adopting release explains, for example, that &ldquo;[w]hether a person&rsquo;s activity is &lsquo;regular&rsquo; will depend on the liquidity and depth of the relevant market for the security.&rdquo; Adopting Release at 36. It further explains that &ldquo;the term &lsquo;regularly&rsquo; will capture those market participants that engage in the activity described in the expressing trading interest factor on a frequent enough basis (both within a trading day and over time) that they do so as part of a regular business.&rdquo; Adopting Release at 38.

The economic analysis does not support that assertion. See, e.g., Adopting Release at 98 (&ldquo;Although the final rules may have small negative effects on market liquidity and efficiency, due to increases in costs for affected parties, the final rules may also promote liquidity and efficiency by limiting the probability that significant liquidity providers fail.&rdquo;).</p>

Not only do the tired questions about when a crypto asset is a security remain, but the rule raises new questions about how the rule will apply in the context of automated market makers (&ldquo;AMMs&rdquo;). For example, given that an AMM is a software protocol, who will have to register? In light of the difficulties that other would-be crypto registrants have encountered with the SEC and FINRA, will those persons even be able to register? Rather than engage seriously with these questions, the Commission hints that &ldquo;certain persons engaging in crypto asset securities transactions may be operating as dealers&rdquo; already.

<div> strengthened market resiliency, unregistered firms, dealer registration, high frequency trading, financial stability
Summary:<br /><br />The article discusses the importance of strengthening market resiliency by requiring unregistered high frequency trading firms to register as dealers in the Treasury market. This will provide greater protection to investors and promote financial stability. The reforms aim to level the playing field among market participants and enhance data transparency to increase market resiliency and transparency. <div>
<p>While markets and financial regulators will always face the uncertainty of unanticipated shocks, strengthened market resiliency can help reduce the harmful impact from these shocks. It can provide greater protection &ndash; and confidence &ndash; to investors, capital markets, and the financial system.</p>
<p>Today, the Commission takes important steps to strengthen market resiliency by leveling the competitive playing field between and among market participants that act as dealers but have not registered as dealers.</p>
<p>In a 2022 speech before the securities industry, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen referred to the Treasury market as &ldquo;the bedrock of our financial system.&rdquo; Secretary Yellen highlighted the need to enhance this market&rsquo;s resiliency in light of recent &ldquo;episodes of stress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In its 2023 annual report, the interagency Financial Stability Oversight Council (&ldquo;FSOC&rdquo;) urged financial regulators to strengthen resiliency through enhanced data transparency. The Commission&rsquo;s reforms today move us towards this goal.</p>
<p>In recent years, high frequency trading firms that specialize in electronic and automated trading have achieved a significant share of trading in the Treasury market. Some unregistered firms trade in high volumes that are comparable to those of the most active registered firms.</p>
<p>The net result is a Treasury market that is now split between registered firms that operate with transparency, adequate capitalization, and operational integrity and unregistered firms with a significant presence in the market that don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Registered firms provide the market with key data that make it easier to discern and assess market risks. These firms comply with applicable financial responsibility and risk management rules. Absent today&rsquo;s reforms, our capital markets and financial regulators would continue to lack key data, and therefore limited oversight, over an unregistered segment of the market.</p>
<p>Dealer registration is designed to address the specific risks related to dealer activity and the associated risks to financial stability that may arise from the failure of a significant liquidity provider. These risks are real.</p>
<p>The Treasury market has experienced numerous shocks over the last decade, including some involving unregistered firms. In the March 2020 &ldquo;dash-for-cash,&rdquo; certain unregistered firms pulled back from the market because they lacked the capital to continue providing liquidity. Had the rule we are considering today been in effect, these firms would have been registered and may have been less likely to leave the market.</p>
<p>Unregistered firms are not subject to regulatory oversight nor Commission examination of books and records; and they are not subject to Commission or FINRA rules that address algorithmic trading risks. Associated persons of unregistered dealers are also not subject to FINRA&rsquo;s registration and qualification requirements.</p>
<p>The fact that registered and unregistered entities performing substantially similar dealer functions are subject to such different standards makes the Treasury market less competitive and less transparent.</p>
<p>The final rules will increase competition among firms that are engaged in similar dealer activity. Applying consistent regulation to these entities will promote market stability by increasing the financial responsibility and operational integrity of these currently unregistered firms.</p>
<p>By requiring unregistered high frequency trading firms to register as dealers, today&rsquo;s reforms provide for a standard that is more protective of investors and our markets.</p>
<p>Both the Commission and all market participants will gain the benefit of increased visibility into, and enhanced oversight of, the trading activity of these significant market participants.</p>
<p>Overall, today&rsquo;s reforms will enhance the Treasury market&rsquo;s resiliency and transparency, strengthening investor protection and promoting financial stability. I am pleased to support these important reforms that, in particular, will benefit our country&rsquo;s vital $24 trillion Treasury market.</p>

<title>Statement On Adopting Changes To The Definition Of Dealer And Government Securities Dealer, SEC Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw, Feb. 6, 2024</title>

<div> securities, Exchange Act, dealer, liquidity, regulation
Summary: 
The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 gives the SEC authority to oversee the securities industry and regulate dealers. Dealers provide liquidity and perform market functions. The Act defines a dealer as someone engaged in buying or selling securities for their own account. The rules aim to regulate market participants providing significant liquidity and level the playing field. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;) provides the SEC with broad authority over the securities industry, including the power to register, regulate, and oversee participants in the securities markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/crenshaw-statement-dealer-trader-020624#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>The dealer regulatory regime is a key component of the U.S. Federal securities laws, and dealers perform important market functions such as absorbing order imbalances (i.e., when a market receives more buy orders than sell orders at one point in time, or vice versa) and providing liquidity to buyers and sellers in the market. Under the Exchange Act, the SEC has the authority to define the terms used in the statutory definition of &ldquo;dealer&rdquo; and oversee and regulate registered dealers.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/crenshaw-statement-dealer-trader-020624#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;The Exchange Act defines a dealer as any person engaged in the business of buying or selling securities for their own account.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/crenshaw-statement-dealer-trader-020624#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;Dealers help facilitate investor trading because dealers are willing to trade for their own account as principals when investors cannot immediately find other investors with whom to trade.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/crenshaw-statement-dealer-trader-020624#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;In this way, dealers provide the service of immediate trading.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/crenshaw-statement-dealer-trader-020624#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;The Commission has long identified the provision of liquidity , including acting as a &ldquo;market maker&rdquo; or &ldquo;a de facto market maker,&rdquo; as a factor that indicates &ldquo;dealer&rdquo; status.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/crenshaw-statement-dealer-trader-020624#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>In recent years, advancements in electronic trading have resulted in certain market participants playing an increasingly significant role in providing liquidity.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/crenshaw-statement-dealer-trader-020624#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;Of course, increased liquidity can be positive, but when the providers of significant liquidity are not compelled to comply with registration requirements, it raises concerns. For example, if a liquidity provider that is a substantial market participant fails, then its disorderly exit from a securities position (or even the market more generally) could push market prices away from fundamental value and potentially harm traders across markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/crenshaw-statement-dealer-trader-020624#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;Because a significant liquidity provider can harm others to whom it is not directly related, its failure has the potential to impose significant costs on other parties.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/crenshaw-statement-dealer-trader-020624#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;There is a clear loophole here: market participants with a significant share of market volume are engaging in activities like those performed by dealers, without being registered as dealers.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/crenshaw-statement-dealer-trader-020624#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;This has left both investors and the markets without important protections such as limitations on financial risk, reporting and disclosure requirements, and other benefits that would result from registration and regulation under the Exchange Act &ndash; regulation designed for this specific dealer activity.</p>
<p>The rules we are considering today would help close this regulatory loophole and level the playing field by subjecting market participants that perform similar dealer functions to a common regulatory regime. The regulatory regime for registered dealers includes, among other things, books and records requirements,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/crenshaw-statement-dealer-trader-020624#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;reporting and disclosure requirements (including audited financial statements<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/crenshaw-statement-dealer-trader-020624#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;and the identities of owners, directors, and managers<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/crenshaw-statement-dealer-trader-020624#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>), the Net Capital Rule,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/crenshaw-statement-dealer-trader-020624#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;and operational integrity rules.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/crenshaw-statement-dealer-trader-020624#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;These requirements help enhance market stability by giving regulators increased insight into firm-level and aggregate trading activity, which helps regulators to evaluate, assess, and address market risks.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/crenshaw-statement-dealer-trader-020624#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>&nbsp;In addition, registered dealers are also subject to the Commission&rsquo;s authority to conduct examinations and impose sanctions,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/crenshaw-statement-dealer-trader-020624#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>&nbsp;and are also subject to the rules, examination authority, and enforcement authority of relevant self-regulatory organizations.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/crenshaw-statement-dealer-trader-020624#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a>&nbsp;Moreover, registered dealers and government securities dealers are required to comply with all applicable securities laws, which include antifraud and anti-manipulation provisions.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/crenshaw-statement-dealer-trader-020624#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>&nbsp;Although the regulatory regime differs somewhat for market participants that transact only in government securities, firms that are government securities dealers (including registered broker-dealers trading government securities) must also comply with rules adopted by the U.S. Treasury, including rules relating to financial responsibility, recordkeeping, financial condition reporting, and risk oversight.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/crenshaw-statement-dealer-trader-020624#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></p>
<p>On the whole, the regulatory requirements that apply to dealers, including today&rsquo;s rules, provide fundamental protections that contribute to fair, orderly, and efficient markets. The rules will also apply consistent regulation to market participants that regularly provide significant liquidity. Today&rsquo;s rules thus begin to level the competitive playing field between liquidity provision conducted by entities that are currently registered as dealers and those that are not.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/crenshaw-statement-dealer-trader-020624#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a>&nbsp;Registration should enable more comprehensive regulatory oversight of those participants.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the staff of the Division of Trading and Markets, the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, and the Office of the General Counsel for all their hard work on this release. I&rsquo;m pleased to support today&rsquo;s rule. Thank you.</p>

<div> SEC, SIFMA, Protecting Innovation in Investment Act, regulatory regimes, technologies <br />
Summary:<br />
SIFMA opposes the SEC proposal to regulate technologies used by broker-dealers and investment advisers, citing the potential harm to investors and disruption to well-functioning regulatory regimes. SIFMA also thanks Senators Cruz and Hagerty for their leadership on the issue. <br /> <div>
<p>SIFMA and SIFMA AMG today issued the following statement from Executive Vice President of Advocacy Josh Wilsusen regarding the introduction of the&nbsp;<em>Protecting Innovation in Investment Act.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;SIFMA strongly believes that the SEC should withdraw this proposal, which would be a radical departure from decades of federal securities law and completely upend today&rsquo;s well-functioning regulatory regimes that ensure investors&rsquo; interests are protected through Regulation Best Interest and the Investment Advisers Act&rsquo;s fiduciary duty, among other requirements.&nbsp;Broker-dealers and investment advisers rely on the technologies targeted by this proposal to provide critical educational tools and financial benefits to their customers, especially low- to middle-income retail investors and retirement savers. This proposal would curtail access to these important technologies, harming the very investors the proposal aims to protect. We thank Senators Cruz and Hagerty for their leadership on this issue.&rdquo;</p>

<div> dealer, securities, liquidity, regulation, market
<br />
Today's action by the Commission to classify nearly any person who buys and sells securities as a "dealer" under the Exchange Act is problematic and lacks a limiting principle. This broad classification may reduce liquidity in the Treasury markets and increase debt costs to taxpayers. The rulemaking may also create additional regulatory confusion for other markets, including crypto asset securities. Regulatory consistency, public debt increase, and liquidity providers are also discussed in the summary.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Thank you, Chair Gensler. Thank you to the staff for your presentation.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s action is problematic. The Commission&rsquo;s effort to classify nearly any person who buys and sells securities as a &ldquo;dealer&rdquo; under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) extends beyond its statutory authority. The lack of any limiting principle creates the potential for arbitrary and capricious government action. Further, today&rsquo;s action may reduce liquidity in the Treasury markets, make them more volatile, reduce the number of liquidity providers, and increase debt costs to taxpayers.</p>
<p>The Exchange Act limits who is a &ldquo;dealer&rdquo; by requiring that the trading from one&rsquo;s own account be &ldquo;as a part of a regular business.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;The final rules fail at their attempt to clarify what &ldquo;part of a regular business&rdquo; means.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Instead, they proclaim that &ldquo;no presumption shall arise that a person is not a dealer within the meaning of [the Exchange Act] solely because that person does not satisfy [the standards set forth in the rules].&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;In other words, complying with the rules provides no assurance on dealer status, whether in the Treasury market or beyond.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s action codifies the Commission&rsquo;s view that the &ldquo;dealer&rdquo; definition is practically limitless. The public should be concerned about the immense scope of this claimed jurisdiction. The rule of law means that the government should define ex ante which activities are lawful and which are not. Without such definition, governmental authority can be arbitrary and even tyrannical. Government can favor some entities, while disfavoring others.</p>
<p>This rulemaking targets proprietary trading funds (PTFs), private funds, and others who make money by buying low and selling high in the Treasury market, while creating additional regulatory confusion for other markets, including crypto asset securities. Indeed, following Form PF, the adoption of private fund adviser rules, securities lending disclosure, and short position and short activity reporting, this action feels like another salvo in the Commission&rsquo;s war on private funds.</p>
<p>The Commission claims that advancements in electronic trading across securities markets resulted in PTFs and others providing more liquidity to the Treasury markets,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;a traditional dealer activity.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;While that may be true, it does not legally transform traders into dealers. Broadly speaking, any market participant can be a liquidity provider, and it makes no sense to use liquidity provision as the basis for legally distinguishing between dealers and traders.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>The role of PTFs and private funds has grown partly because outstanding public debt has massively increased. In January 2024, total outstanding public debt was $34.1 trillion, with $27 trillion held by the public.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;Four years ago, those amounts were $23.2 trillion and $17.1 trillion, respectively. Yet primary dealer balance sheets have stayed flat and are constrained by the supplemental leverage ratio. If the banks and dealers cannot provide additional liquidity, where will it come from? Nearly omitted from the Commission&rsquo;s analysis is that PTFs and private funds provide positive externalities to the Treasury markets through increased liquidity, more competition, and tighter spreads.</p>
<p>The Commission suggests the benefits of imposing dealer regulations on PTFs and others include: (1) these entities will be less likely to discontinue trading in turbulent markets;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;(2) regulators would have more information about their activities;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;and (3) the playing field would be leveled.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p>Overlooked is the fact that dealer regulations are designed to protect customers, not to address whether PTFs and others might stop trading during market turmoil. For example, the net capital rule<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;protects customers during a wind-down but is costly and inappropriate for firms that lack customers.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;Unsurprisingly, the Commission cannot convincingly demonstrate any gains in investor protection as a result.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></p>
<p>Ironically, today&rsquo;s action promotes the very outcome that it seeks to avoid. Increasing costs on non-dealer liquidity provision will generally result in less liquidity and/or higher transaction costs.</p>
<p>As justification, the Commission provides two examples: the March 2020 Covid lockdown and the 1982 failure of Drysdale Government Securities.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;It is telling that the most specific example is from forty years ago. As for March 2020, the unprecedented global shutdown resulted in a loss of liquidity for all asset classes. The PTFs decline in liquidity provision in March 2020 appears anomalous. By contrast, in the March 2023 market stress, the PTFs increased their activity in the Treasury market and provided a greater share of liquidity.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>&nbsp;Treasury Under Secretary for Domestic Finance Nellie Liang noted that this &ldquo;higher share is more consistent with past behavior, such as during the October 15, 2014 event.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>&nbsp;Yet the Adopting Release fails to credit PTFs with providing increased liquidity during times of Treasury market stress, including in 2014 and 2023.</p>
<p>There are already tools that constrain and monitor risk taking by PTFs. When PTFs trade through a bank or broker-dealer, Federal Reserve Regulations T, U, and X limit the principal traders&rsquo; risk by imposing margin requirements. If they trade through a broker-dealer, FINRA Rule 4210 may apply specific margin requirements. If they trade directly, the Market Access Rule requires a sponsoring broker-dealer to establish, document, and maintain a system of controls and supervision designed to limit the risks of the principal traders&rsquo; activities.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></p>
<p>The argument about leveling the playing field entails a fundamental economic fallacy. When a business engages in an economic activity, it weighs the incremental benefits against incremental costs. Even if current registered dealers have fixed regulatory costs associated with other activities, they can remain competitive in the Treasury markets with PTFs and private funds, because their marginal regulatory costs are not tightly linked to that activity per se. However, increasing the regulatory costs for PTFs and private funds will lead them to supply less liquidity to the Treasury market and some firms may exit. Suggesting that there is an intrinsic public benefit tied to increasing the costs of the lesser regulated liquidity providers is misguided.</p>
<p>The argument that the Commission needs more information on PTF transactions is similarly weak. The SEC already has access to substantial data. Most PTF trades occur on interdealer broker platforms.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>&nbsp;&ldquo;[B]roker-dealers and ATSs report transactions in U.S. government securities to TRACE&rdquo; and &ldquo;TRACE data include the identities of unregistered entities.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a>&nbsp;For non-Treasury transactions, the Consolidated Audit Trail &ldquo;generally includes all principal traders&rsquo; orders in NMS securities, OTC equities, and listed options because they are reported by other registered parties.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a>&nbsp;Finally, &ldquo;[p]rincipal traders with high volumes or with large portfolios may also have to report to the Commission on Form 13F or Form 13H.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a></p>
<p>The final rules exclude investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act, but not private funds or collective investment trusts.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a>&nbsp;The Commission largely relies on the same rationale described in the proposing release for not excluding private funds, including the comprehensive regulatory framework and extensive oversight of registered investment companies.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a>&nbsp;Yet, the Commission has not considered the aggregate effects of the various rules proposed and/or adopted for private funds since the proposing release.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a>&nbsp;The lack of such analysis makes the final rules arbitrary and capricious.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s action follows other Commission actions increasing the number of persons required to register with FINRA.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a>&nbsp;By sweeping more persons into FINRA, it starts to become a de facto federal securities regulator. As such, consideration ought to be given on whether FINRA is now a state actor.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a></p>
<p>Under the Commission&rsquo;s approach, any person can be a &ldquo;dealer&rdquo; if they buy and sell securities as part of a regular business. The final rules modification from &ldquo;routine&rdquo; to &ldquo;regular&rdquo; provides no further clarity to market participants. The ambiguity is highlighted by recent litigation over the dealer definition, when the Commission argued that the &ldquo;Exchange Act does not define what it means to be &lsquo;engaged in the business&rsquo; of buying and selling securities, but [this entity] is a business: it has offices, employees, keeps accounting records, and carries on for a profit. And its business model is to buy and sell securities.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a></p>
<p>Historically, dealers had customers. The Exchange Act&rsquo;s definitions of &ldquo;broker&rdquo; and &ldquo;dealer&rdquo; generally reference how customer securities transactions are effectuated. &ldquo;Brokers,&rdquo; acting as agents, trade &ldquo;for the account of&rdquo; the customer.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a>&nbsp;&ldquo;Dealers&rdquo; take the opposite side of a customer&rsquo;s trades in their &ldquo;own account.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a>&nbsp;The Commission selectively cherry-picks one 1930s treatise to support its view that a dealer can have no customers,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a>&nbsp;while ignoring a contemporaneous treatise stating &ldquo;a dealer sells to and buys from a client whereas a broker buys and sells for the account of the client.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a></p>
<p>Until recently, the Commission has enforced dealer registration in a manner consistent with the idea that &ldquo;broker&rdquo; and &ldquo;dealer&rdquo; relate to customer orders. That view has apparently changed through regulation by enforcement.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a>&nbsp;As a result, persons are now subject to Commission enforcement, even though they have been operating under the same business model for a long time with the understanding that they were not dealers.</p>
<p>The Commission has filed a number of cases on dealer registration,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a>&nbsp;including a recent settlement with Aryeh Goldstein.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a>&nbsp;Mr. Goldstein loaned money to publicly-traded companies through convertible debt agreements.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a>&nbsp;Goldstein could convert unpaid debt and interest into discounted stock after waiting six to twelve months, as required under Rule 144.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a>&nbsp;Staff guidance on the Commission&rsquo;s website since 2008 suggested that individuals who buy and sell securities for themselves are not considered dealers and lists a number of factors for consideration.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a>&nbsp;Mr. Goldstein and his firm did not appear to hold themselves out as dealers, did not have customers, nor did they advertise themselves as such.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[39]</a>&nbsp;The Commission&rsquo;s rulemaking could have addressed this regulatory ambiguity, but did not.</p>
<p>Given the negative consequences of the final rules, combined with the continued ambiguity on who is a dealer, I am unable to support. Many of the anticipated costs are fixed and small firms will be most disadvantaged. A number of the Commission&rsquo;s findings supporting the final rules are speculative and lack sufficient data or evidence in the administrative record.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40">[40]</a></p>
<p>While the Commission recognizes that &ldquo;a decrease in the activities of liquidity-providing entities and their investors would harm market liquidity&rdquo; and that the harms to the Treasury markets may be more pronounced than others,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41">[41]</a>&nbsp;it theorizes that if that were to occur and bid-ask spreads widen, other registered dealers might increase their own trading to offset the gap. Wishful thinking is not a strategy when it comes to the most important market in the world.</p>

Specifically, the non-dealer firms constitute only 19% of the overall Treasury market. On the other hand, PTFs do constitute a substantial proportion of the interdealer markets, &ldquo;accounting for 61 percent of the volume on automated interdealer broker platforms and 48 percent of the interdealer broker volume overall.&rdquo; See Proposing Release: Further Definition of &ldquo;As a Part of a Regular Business&rdquo; in the Definition of Dealer and Government Securities Dealer (Proposing Release), Release No. 34-94524, File No. S7-12-22, at 23080, available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/04/18/2022-06960/further-definition-of-as-a-part-of-a-regular-business-in-the-definition-of-dealer-and-government">https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/04/18/2022-06960/further-definition-of-as-a-part-of-a-regular-business-in-the-definition-of-dealer-and-government</a></p>

But all market participants make money by buying low and selling high, and by entering the market in their efforts to do so, they increase liquidity. For instance, if a trader has an algorithm that can reasonably predict the equilibrium market value at any point in time, then it would buy when the price is below that point and sell when the price is above that point, as long as the spread covered the transaction cost. In its efforts to buy low and sell high, the trader may be on both sides of the market, and others might perceive the trader as selling immediacy of execution&mdash;but the trader is engaging in the market transactions solely based on its perception of value. The efficiency of connectivity and electronic markets has rendered the resulting spreads from this type of trading activity tighter, but that does not magically transform that activity into dealer activity. Indirectly, the Adopting Release&rsquo;s Economic Analysis seems to recognize this when, in an effort to determine what entities would be covered by this new definition of dealer, it stated that &ldquo;the calculation of intraday spreads does not distinguish between trades that capture the bid-ask spread and trades that profit from intraday price movements.&rdquo; Perhaps if you can&rsquo;t empirically distinguish between those two activities, then they are not actually different. And perhaps that is why the Adopting Release immediately added that &ldquo;[a]lthough we rely on a practical definition of dealing for the purpose of this analysis, we stress that the determination of whether an entity is engaged in regular dealing activity depends on the facts and circumstances.&rdquo; Adopting Release at 116-117.</p>

If a broker-dealer fails, it should be in a position to meet all unsubordinated obligations to its customers and counterparties and generate resources sufficient to wind down its operations in an orderly manner. Certainly, an assurance that a broker-dealer can meet its customer obligations (and cannot use customer funds to satisfy its own liabilities) is vital to the protection of customers and to the orderly functioning of the retail marketplace. Requiring a trading firm to maintain net capital when it has no customers to protect is simply nonsensical &ndash; yet the Proposal would presumably require just that. Imposing capital requirements that are intended to benefit customers, not traders without customers, does not help investors or the market, and serves no purpose other than as an unnecessary barrier&nbsp;<a name="_Hlk157522869">to entry and impediment to liquidity."

No attempt is made by the Commission to quantify the additional benefits and corresponding costs resulting from registration as a dealer. Without examining such effects, the Commission does not have a rational basis for extending the dealer regime to PTFs and private funds.</p>

<div> CEO, Grant Vingoe, OSC, strategic plan, capital markets <br />
Grant Vingoe's term as CEO of the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) has been extended for five years. He has been a strong advocate for Ontario's capital markets. Under his leadership, the OSC has implemented initiatives to protect investors and modernize regulations. A new six-year strategic plan is in development to address emerging trends and support innovation and growth. <br /><br />Summary: Grant Vingoe's term as CEO of OSC has been extended for 5 years. He has been a strong advocate for Ontario's capital markets and has implemented initiatives to protect investors and modernize regulations. A new six-year strategic plan is in development to address emerging trends and support innovation and growth. <div>
<p>The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) announced today that its Board of Directors has extended Grant Vingoe&rsquo;s term as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) for a period of five years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grant Vingoe is a steadfast and unwavering champion of Ontario&rsquo;s capital markets,&rdquo; said Kevan Cowan, Chair of the Board.&nbsp;&ldquo;Under his leadership, the OSC has delivered on critical initiatives to better protect investors, modernize regulation for market participants, and provide new avenues for raising capital.&nbsp;With Grant at the helm, the OSC is well positioned to navigate the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead, and deliver results for Ontario under our new strategic plan.&rdquo;</p>

<div> Securities and Exchange Commission, rules, dealer roles, registration, market integrity <br />
Summary:<br />
SEC adopts rules requiring market participants in certain dealer roles to register, become SRO members, and comply with federal securities laws. The rules further define activities that would classify a person as a "dealer" or "government securities dealer" and require registration, SRO membership, and compliance with regulatory obligations. Effective 60 days after publication, compliance date one year after effective date. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today adopted two rules that require market participants who engage in certain dealer roles, in particular those who take on significant liquidity-providing roles in the markets, to register with the SEC, become members of a self-regulatory organization (SRO), and comply with federal securities laws and regulatory obligations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am pleased to support this adoption because it requires that firms that act like dealers register with the Commission as dealers, thereby protecting investors as well as promoting market integrity, resiliency, and transparency,&rdquo; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. &ldquo;These measures are common sense. Congress did not intend for registration and regulatory requirements to apply to some dealers and not to others. Absent an exemption or exception, if anyone trades in a manner consistent with de facto market making, it must register with us as a dealer &ndash; consistent with Congress&rsquo;s intent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The final rules, Exchange Act Rules 3a5-4 and 3a44-2, further define the phrase &ldquo;as a part of a regular business&rdquo; in Sections 3(a)(5) and 3(a)(44) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to identify certain activities that would cause persons engaging in such activities to be &ldquo;dealers&rdquo; or &ldquo;government securities dealers&rdquo; and be subject to the registration requirements of Sections 15 and 15C of the Act, respectively, in connection with certain liquidity-providing roles.</p>
<p>Under the final rules, any person that engages in activities as described in the rules is a &ldquo;dealer&rdquo; or &ldquo;government securities dealer&rdquo; and, absent an exception or exemption, required to: register with the Commission under Section 15(a) or Section 15C, as applicable; become a member of an SRO; and comply with federal securities laws and regulatory obligations and applicable SRO and Treasury rules and requirements.</p>
<p>The adopting release for the final rules will be published in the Federal Register. The final rules will become effective 60 days after publication of the adopting release in the Federal Register. The compliance date for the final rules will be one year after the effective date of the final rules.</p>

<div> SEC, final rules, government securities dealers, registration, market integrity <br />
Summary:
- SEC considering final rules for dealers and government securities dealers
- Dealers must meet capital requirements, report data, and keep records
- Unregulated failures in 1980s led to Government Securities Act
- New rules define "de facto market making" to require registration
- Rules benefit market integrity and transparency <br /> <div>
<p>Today, the Commission is considering whether to adopt final rules further defining a dealer and government securities dealer. I am pleased to support this adoption because it requires that firms that act like dealers register with the Commission as dealers, thereby protecting investors as well as promoting market integrity, resiliency, and transparency.</p>
<p>The registration, oversight, and regulatory regime for dealers is a cornerstone of the federal securities laws. It was amongst the first authorities that Congress gave the SEC as part of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</p>
<p>When dealers register, they become subject to a variety of important laws and rules that help protect the public, promote market integrity, and facilitate capital formation. Amongst these are meeting minimum capital requirements, reporting data to regulators, and keeping books and records. This regime benefits investors, issuers, and markets alike&mdash;and has done so for nearly 90 years.</p>
<p>Congress, though, in crafting the foundational securities laws from the 1930s had exempted Treasury securities&mdash;and thus government securities dealers&mdash;from these key provisions.</p>
<p>This all changed in the 1980s, in response to a dozen firms in the Treasury markets that had failed between 1982 and 1985. I actually recall vividly the failures of some of those firms. I was a young associate on Wall Street, and though I worked in the mergers and acquisitions department at the time, far from the trading floor, the news spread far and fast when Drysdale Government Securities failed in May of 1982.</p>
<p>I remember as my colleagues and I processed what had happened as well as its potential effects on the markets and potentially the economy. Drysdale, which was not registered or regulated as a dealer, had significant involvement in the U.S. Treasury markets. It also was highly leveraged. The firm had only $30 million in capital yet managed a portfolio as large potentially as $4 billion.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>In the ensuing years, it seemed like every couple of months, another unregulated government securities firm would collapse. These included E.S.M. Government Securities and others, none of which were regulated as securities dealers.</p>
<p>In response, President Ronald Reagan signed the Government Securities Act into law in 1986. The Act granted the SEC and other regulators important authorities to regulate dealers and brokers in this space.</p>
<p>Working with the SEC, the U.S. Department of Treasury put in place rules for government securities dealers. Yet in 2021, when I arrived at the SEC, I was told that though numerous firms have registered with the SEC as government securities dealers, some market participants have not. I think that leaves potential regulatory gaps and risk in the system.</p>
<p>The markets also have evolved in other ways, such as electronification, the use of algorithmic trading, and market participants transacting faster than ever before. Some market participants, such as principal-trading firms (PTFs) that use high-frequency trading strategies, started participating significantly in the Treasury cash market. In 2019, for example, PTFs represented around 60 percent of the volume on the inter-dealer broker (IDB) platforms in the Treasury markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>In essence, these PTFs and other firms are acting in a manner consistent with dealers in the securities markets. Nevertheless, despite these firms acting as de facto market makers, and despite their regularity of participation consistent with buying and selling securities or government securities &ldquo;as a part of a regular business,&rdquo; a number of these firms have not registered with the Commission as dealers.</p>
<p>This deprives investors and the markets themselves of important protections&mdash;protections that benefit market integrity, resiliency, transparency, and more.</p>
<p>To fill this regulatory gap, today&rsquo;s rules will further define what it means to be engaged in a business of buying and selling securities &ldquo;as a part of a regular business.&rdquo; They will do so for both dealers and government securities dealers by requiring entities engaging in &ldquo;de facto market making&rdquo; activity to register as dealers or government securities dealers.</p>
<p>Specifically, the rules further define &ldquo;as a part of a regular business&rdquo; to include &ldquo;engag[ing] in a regular pattern of buying and selling securities,&rdquo; or &ldquo;government securities,&rdquo; &ldquo;that has the effect of providing liquidity to other market participants by&rdquo;:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Regularly expressing trading interest that is at or near the best available prices on both sides of the market for the same security and that is communicated and represented in a way that makes it accessible to other market participants;&rdquo; or</li>
<li>&ldquo;Earning revenue primarily from capturing bid-ask spreads, by buying at the bid and selling at the offer, or from capturing any incentives offered by trading venues to liquidity-supplying trading interest.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-statement-dealer-trader-020624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These measures are common sense. Congress did not intend for registration and regulatory requirements to apply to some dealers and not to others. Absent an exemption or exception, if anyone trades in a manner consistent with de facto market making, it must register with us as a dealer&mdash;consistent with Congress&rsquo;s intent.</p>
<p>In finalizing this adoption, we benefitted from public feedback on our proposed rules and made a number of adjustments. Let me just note three. First, with regard to these qualitative standards, the final rules we are considering today do not include an additional qualitative factor that had been proposed with regard to a firm regularly making roughly comparable purchases and sales of the same or similar securities in a day. Second, the final rules do not include the proposed quantitative standard for the further definition of a dealer in the Treasury markets. Third, the final rules adopt an anti-evasion provision rather than the proposed aggregation across legal entities.</p>
<p>The final rules promote an important cornerstone of the SEC&rsquo;s work to oversee the markets.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the members of the SEC staff for their work on these final rules, including:</p>

<div> international audit, assurance, ethics, independence, standard-setting <br />
Summary:<br /> The Monitoring Group (MG) issued recommendations to strengthen the global audit and assurance standard-setting system. This includes enhancing multi-stakeholder composition, expanding technical staff, and creating a Stakeholder Advisory Council. The focus is on developing high-quality standards and securing diverse funding sources, with an emphasis on sustainability-related projects and public interest matters. <div>
<p>The Monitoring Group (MG) is responsible for the overall governance of the international audit, assurance, ethics, and independence standard-setting system, including conducting periodic effectiveness reviews. In July 2020, the MG issued its recommendations&nbsp;<a href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iosco.org%2Fabout%2Fmonitoring_group%2Fpdf%2F2020-07-MG-Paper-Strengthening-The-International-Audit-And-Ethics-Standard-Setting-System.pdf&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cmailing-lists%40iosco.org%7C1d08dc2b93954afcf16208dc272fb1aa%7Cbcc6c66cdb3b48328af2cc363a097444%7C0%7C0%7C638428333029382418%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=HZ0Sxa6HGlVeEXAOSC1B6I6cj%2FTLj7AUBKEfBetzbxs%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"><em>Strengthening the International Audit and Ethics Standard-Setting System</em></a>&nbsp;(MG Recommendations).<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;The objectives of the MG Recommendations are the implementation of a more independent and inclusive multi-stakeholder standard-setting system that is more responsive to the public interest and an accelerated pace of change in the development of timely, high-quality audit, assurance, ethics, and independence standards.</p>
<p>Stakeholders across the global corporate reporting ecosystem benefit from high-quality standard setting by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA) (collectively the Standard Setting Boards (SSBs)) under the oversight provided by the Public Interest Oversight Board (PIOB) to ensure due process is followed and that the standards are developed that are responsive to the public interest, are developed in accordance with the Public Interest Framework (PIF),<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;and are responsive to the rapid pace of change.</p>
<p><strong>Responding to the Public Interest and an Accelerated Pace of Change &ndash; Assurance over Sustainability Information</strong></p>
<p>Stakeholders have emphasized the importance of the development of timely, globally consistent, and comparable assurance, ethics, and independence standards to enhance the public trust in the quality of sustainability information. Strong momentum continues around the globe for both voluntary and mandatory reporting of sustainability information and assurance over some or all of that information. The benefits from implementing the MG Recommendations, which are designed to &ldquo;foster the development of timely, high-quality standards that respond to an accelerating pace of change,&rdquo; is on full display as it relates to the evolving space of assurance over sustainability information. The agility and public interest responsiveness of the SSBs through their ongoing projects to develop assurance, ethics, and independence standards over sustainability-related information demonstrates these benefits. On August 2, 2023, the IAASB launched a public consultation<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;on its proposed global sustainability assurance standard, and on January 29, 2024, the IESBA launched a public consultation<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;on its proposed sustainability-related ethics and independence standards.</p>
<p>To be responsive to the public interest, the SSBs are performing unprecedented outreach to ensure broad stakeholder input in the development of the final standards by the end of 2024. The standards will provide a global framework for assurance engagements over sustainability information prepared under any reporting framework and that can be used by all practitioners, both professional accountants and non-accountant assurance providers. In addition to the projects on sustainability, the SSBs continue to be responsive to other public interest matters including, but not limited to, the IAASB&rsquo;s ongoing projects on fraud and going concern and the IESBA&rsquo;s new workstream on firm culture and governance.</p>
<p><strong>High-quality International Audit, Assurance, Ethics, and Independence Standards are a Public Good</strong></p>
<p>The global business environment today in which organizations operate continues to evolve and increase in complexity and so too do the needs of investors and others who rely on high-quality reporting and assurance services. The global corporate reporting ecosystem is built upon high-quality international audit, assurance, ethics, and independence standards adopted across jurisdictions, so that investors, regulators, stock exchanges, and others can have confidence in the quality and reliability of information they use for capital allocation decisions. The development of high-quality standards based on independent, extensive, and inclusive due process that allows for input from all stakeholders and is subject to appropriate oversight, is critical to that confidence. High-quality standards are a public good and serve to increase public confidence in the reliability of information provided by the corporate reporting ecosystem. Accordingly, all stakeholders in the global corporate reporting ecosystem benefit from the high-quality work performed by the IAASB and the IESBA, under the oversight of the PIOB.</p>
<p><em>SSB Composition and Staffing</em></p>
<p>Significant progress has been made to enhance the multi-stakeholder composition of the SSBs through an independent nominations process. The result is an enhanced multi-stakeholder composition of the SSBs, with greater diversity in experiential backgrounds, including investors and preparers, as well as geographical diversification from previously underrepresented regions.</p>
<p>Progress has also been made in expanding and enhancing the technical staff of the SSBs. The SSBs have begun transitioning their standard-setting development to a model where staff are responsible for the development of relevant, timely, high-quality standards, allowing SSB members to take on a more strategic role as envisaged in the MG Recommendations. Increasing the size and technical abilities of the staff ensures the proper technical expertise is available to the SSBs, further supporting the multi-stakeholder composition of the standard-setting system. Opportunities exist to join the staff at the IAASB and the IESBA, including through secondments, which has the benefit of providing highly skilled individuals with diverse professional backgrounds an opportunity for enhanced professional growth and development while serving the public interest.</p>
<p><strong>Stakeholder Advisory Council</strong></p>
<p>A further enhancement to the standard-setting system is the newly created Stakeholder Advisory Council (SAC).<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;The SAC will provide valuable strategic advice from a multi-stakeholder perspective to the SSBs on their strategies and work plan priorities and contribute to the identification of emerging developments and public interest issues as the SSBs continue to develop high-quality standards globally. The SAC will hold its inaugural meeting on 29-30 April 2024 in New York.</p>
<p><strong>Funding the International Audit, Assurance, Ethics, and Independence Standard-Setting Structure</strong></p>
<p>Significant progress has already been made towards the diversification of funding for the activities of the standard-setting system. In 2023, as envisaged in the MG Recommendations, more than fifty percent of the PIOB&rsquo;s financial contributions came from sources outside the accounting profession. The MG is grateful to all those stakeholders who have contributed, both in-kind and financially, toward the diversification of the funding of the PIOB.</p>
<p>Funding diversification of the entire standard-setting structure remains a top priority. The MG is grateful for the significant financial support from the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), the audit firm networks that comprise the Global Public Policy Committee (GPPC),<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;and the Forum of Firms<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;towards funding the activities of the SSBs. Securing further financial commitments from a diverse set of stakeholders to build a stable, long-term funding model will further the achievement of a more independent standard-setting structure.</p>
<p>Having sufficient financial resources to support the standard-setting structure, including long-term funding commitments that will foster the independence and continuity of activities is critical to the ongoing success of the standard-setting structure. This enables the development of high-quality standards from an inclusive and comprehensive consultation process with stakeholders globally, supported by public interest oversight, and widespread adoption of the standards, including the SSBs&rsquo; important projects on sustainability and other high-priority public interest topics such as the auditor&rsquo;s responsibility with respect to fraud and going concern and the workstream on firm culture and governance.</p>
<p><strong>The MG calls on all stakeholders, who individually and collectively, benefit from these high-quality standards to financially support the standard-setting structure.</strong></p>
<p>Paul Munter, Chair of the MG stated:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;I would like to express my gratitude to all those who have worked diligently to implement the MG Recommendations and to those who have contributed, both in-kind and financially, to the standard-setting structure. As a result of this collaborative effort, we have been able to make significant progress to implement the MG Recommendations. As we look to further develop the long-term sustainable funding model, continued support of all stakeholders is critical to the ongoing success of the standard-setting structure and the continuing development of high-quality audit, assurance, ethics, and independence standards developed in the public interest.&rdquo;</em></p>

<div> benchmark, infrastructure, index, global, collaboration
<br />
The FT Wilshire GLIO Listed Infrastructure Index Series is launched in collaboration with GLIO, providing exposure to 11 infrastructure sectors using industry accepted EBITDA. This offers clear understanding of global infrastructure companies for global investors and asset managers. The index series leverages the Global Asset Taxonomy System to filter and isolate infrastructure related industry segments from the FT Wilshire Global Equity Market Series, offering a modern approach to classification.
<br /><br />Summary: 
The FT Wilshire GLIO Listed Infrastructure Index Series provides exposure to 11 infrastructure sectors using industry accepted EBITDA. It offers a clear understanding of global infrastructure companies for global investors and asset managers. The index series leverages the Global Asset Taxonomy System to filter and isolate infrastructure related industry segments from the FT Wilshire Global Equity Market Series, offering a modern approach to classification. <div>
<p>Wilshire Indexes, a leading global benchmark platform and the Global Listed Infrastructure Organisation (GLIO), the representative body for the $3 trillion listed infrastructure asset class, announce today the launch of the FT Wilshire GLIO Listed Infrastructure Index Series.</p>
<p>Providing investors with the clearest exposure to globally listed companies which own and/or operate infrastructure assets, the FT Wilshire GLIO Listed Infrastructure Index Series is designed to capture and measure the performance of infrastructure companies that fall into 11 key sectors: Electric Utilities, Roads, Satellites, Railways, Marine Ports, Airports, Gas Utilities, Water Utilities, Renewables, Energy Transport Storage, Telecommunication infrastructure. Going beyond the pre-existing simple industry classification for company selection, the FT Wilshire GLIO Listed Infrastructure Index series uses industry accepted EBITDA, rather than revenue, to determine infrastructure relevance.<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>As a key asset allocation diversification tool used by global investors, infrastructure exposure can potentially offer stable and predictable cash flows supported by long-term contracts or regulation, with high barriers to entry. However, having a clear understanding of a global infrastructure&rsquo;s company operations, valuation and market expectations is paramount for the investment decisions made by global institutional investors and asset managers.</p>
<p><b>Mark Makepeace, CEO of Wilshire Indexes</b>, said: &ldquo;We are delighted to collaborate with GLIO to develop the new market standard for infrastructure indexes. Global Infrastructure has evolved and as a result investors today are placing a greater emphasis on how new technologies and companies are captured, classified, and segmented across the global listed infrastructure industry. The FT Wilshire GLIO Listed Infrastructure Index Series was constructed specifically for the new market environment, built on flexible new technology by the team of index innovators.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Fraser Hughes, CEO of GLIO,</b>&nbsp;said: &ldquo;The partnership with Wilshire Indexes provides GLIO with a far wider platform to promote the listed infrastructure asset class to a broad range of investors. Moreover, working in collaboration with the Wilshire Indexes GLIO specialist advisory group will ensure the index offering captures the evolution of the asset class now and in the future. The next 30 years will be a critical period for global infrastructure investment. Laying a concrete foundation now with a strong partner will assist in producing meaningful and accurate information to aid this development is an exciting prospect.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Manoj Patel, Co-Head of Infrastructure Securities, DWS,&nbsp;</b>said: &ldquo;GLIO has made great progress in generating global awareness for the asset class. The partnership with Wilshire Indexes is a further step forward in the evolution of GLIO and the investment managers and listed companies it represents. Input from the specialist advisory group is a key differentiator which will enhance the classification process for company selection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The FT Wilshire GLIO Listed Infrastructure Index Series leverages the Global Asset Taxonomy System (GATS) to filter and isolate infrastructure related industry segments from the FT Wilshire Global Equity Market Series (GEMS). Designed to reflect the modern global economy, GATS prioritizes utility and usage by enabling the incorporation of new technologies into the overall classification structure by aligning technologies to their application and utility. This modern approach provides true flexibility and futureproof classification while still preserving the best aspects of existing taxonomies.&nbsp;</p>

<div> meeting, U.S., China, economic, cooperation
Summary:<br />The United States and the People’s Republic of China held the third meeting of the Economic Working Group in Beijing. Discussions included domestic macroeconomic outlooks, cooperation on shared challenges, concerns about China’s industrial policy and overcapacity, and seeking a healthy economic relationship. Treasury delegation also met with Vice Premier He to deepen communication and work on shared challenges. <br /> <div>
<p>The United States and the People&rsquo;s Republic of China held the third meeting of the Economic Working&nbsp;Group (EWG) on February 5-6. This was the first meeting of the EWG in 2024 and its first meeting in&nbsp;China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Senior officials from the U.S. Department of the Treasury and China&rsquo;s Ministry of Finance convened for&nbsp;the two-day EWG meetings in Beijing, with participation by other agencies. &nbsp;The two&nbsp;sides opened&nbsp;discussions with an exchange of views on domestic macroeconomic outlooks. &nbsp;The meeting sessions&nbsp;included discussions on cooperating on shared challenges such as debt issues in low-income and&nbsp;emerging economies. &nbsp;U.S. officials also frankly raised issues of concern, including China&rsquo;s industrial&nbsp;policy practices and overcapacity, and the resulting impact on U.S. workers and firms. &nbsp;U.S. officials reaffirmed that the U.S. is not seeking to decouple the two economies and instead seek a healthy economic&nbsp;relationship that provides a level playing field for American companies and workers.&nbsp; The&nbsp;meetings concluded with both sides agreeing to meet again in April.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While in Beijing, the Treasury delegation also met with Vice Premier He Lifeng, where they conveyed&nbsp;that Secretary Janet L. Yellen welcomed the progress made by the EWG and discussed the importance of&nbsp;continuing to deepen communication and work together on shared challenges. &nbsp;They also indicated that&nbsp;the Secretary looks forward to a return visit to China this year at the appropriate time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Economic and Financial Working Groups were established in September 2023. Both working groups&nbsp;report directly to Secretary Yellen and Vice Premier He.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Chairman McHenry, Ranking Member Waters, and Members of the Committee: Thank you for inviting me to testify.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the past three years, the Biden Administration has driven a historic recovery. GDP growth is strong and inflation has declined significantly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have also achieved a healthy labor market. The prime-age labor force participation rate is up by over two percentage points from January 2021. The unemployment rate remains below 4 percent, continuing the longest streak in 50 years. Real wages have increased. Household median wealth has too, by 37 percent between 2019 and 2022. That is the largest three-year increase on record. Families are now putting their additional income and accumulated savings back into the economy.</p>
<p>Our continued economic strength depends on a solid and resilient U.S. financial system. Throughout 2023, the Financial Stability Oversight Council monitored a wide range of risks, including risks stemming from the commercial and residential real estate sectors and from global geopolitical conflicts and technological developments. When two regional banks failed last March, we acted quickly to prevent contagion to banks with similar vulnerabilities and to maintain confidence in the banking system. The Council also increased transparency this year, issuing an analytic framework that for the first time provides the public with in-depth information on how it monitors, assesses, and responds to potential financial risks.</p>
<p>Let me now highlight five areas of ongoing work that are further detailed in the Council&rsquo;s 2023 annual report.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, the Council is focused on risks from the banking sector and from nonbank financial institutions. It supports member agencies&rsquo; plans to review whether capital measures appropriately reflect a banking institution&rsquo;s ability to absorb losses; improve resolvability at large, complex, or interconnected banks; and address vulnerabilities from uninsured deposit levels and depositor composition.</p>
<p>Nonbank financial institutions are&nbsp;an important source of capital in financial markets but also pose potential risks to the financial system, including risks related to liquidity mismatch and leverage. Securities and Exchange Commission initiatives focused on hedge funds, money market funds, and other investment funds are an important step forward here.</p>
<p>Second, the Council is focused on member agencies enhancing assessment efforts and increasing coordination around climate-related financial stability risks from increasingly severe and frequent climate-related events. Financial regulators should also continue to promote disclosures that allow investors and financial institutions to consider these risks in their investment and lending decisions.</p>
<p>Third, a key focus has been bolstering protections against cybersecurity risks. The Council promotes sharing timely and actionable cybersecurity information, including through ongoing partnerships between state and federal agencies and the private sector.</p>
<p>Fourth, the Council is closely monitoring the increasing use of artificial intelligence in financial services, which brings potential benefits such as reducing costs and improving efficiencies and potential risks like cyber and model risk. Financial institutions, regulators, and market participants should continue deepening their expertise and monitoring capacity in this area.</p>
<p>Fifth, the Council is focused on digital assets and related risks such as from runs on crypto-asset platforms and stablecoins, potential vulnerabilities from crypto-asset price volatility, and the proliferation of platforms acting outside of or out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Applicable rules and regulations should be enforced, and Congress should pass legislation to provide for the regulation of stablecoins and of the spot market for crypto-assets that are not securities. We look forward to continuing to engage with Congress on this.</p>
<p>With this overview, I look forward to taking your questions on these and other areas.</p>

<div> Meeting, Financial Stability Board, Regional Consultative Group, Middle East, North Africa <br />
The Financial Stability Board Regional Consultative Group for the Middle East and North Africa met in Riyadh, discussing global and regional financial stability vulnerabilities, FSB's work program for 2024, crypto-asset markets, and lessons learned from banking sector turmoil. The group is co-chaired by the Saudi Central Bank and the Central Bank of Egypt.<br /><br />Summary: The FSB Regional Consultative Group for the Middle East and North Africa met to discuss financial stability vulnerabilities, FSB's 2024 work program, crypto-asset markets, and lessons learned from banking sector turmoil. <div>
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) Regional Consultative Group for the Middle East and North Africa (RCG MENA) met today in Riyadh. The meeting, which was the group&rsquo;s first in-person since the COVID-19 pandemic, was hosted by the Saudi Central Bank. The FSB Chair, Klaas Knot, joined RCG members for the meeting.</p>
<p>The group discussed global and regional financial stability vulnerabilities, including financial risks arising from the higher interest-rate environment and vulnerabilities in non-bank financial intermediation.</p>
<p>Members received an update on the FSB&rsquo;s work programme for 2024. At their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/11/fsb-middle-east-and-north-africa-group-discusses-regional-financial-stability-issues-and-cross-border-payments/">previous meeting</a>, the group had discussed ways they could contribute to the FSB&rsquo;s work programme,&nbsp;bringing in additional perspectives from the region. The discussion, therefore, focused on two key areas of the FSB&rsquo;s priorities for 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Crypto-asset markets and activities</strong><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>A key focus for the FSB is the effective implementation of its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/07/fsb-global-regulatory-framework-for-crypto-asset-activities/">global regulatory and supervisory framework for crypto-asset activities and markets</a>. Members discussed the joint&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/09/imf-fsb-synthesis-paper-policies-for-crypto-assets/">IMF-FSB roadmap</a>&nbsp;to ensure effective, flexible, and coordinated implementation of the comprehensive policy response for crypto-assets, including of the FSB framework. Members shared their experiences in regulating crypto-asset activities and discussed how challenges could be addressed and the role the FSB and other international organisations could play in facilitating implementation. </li>
<li> <strong>Lessons learned from the 2023 banking-sector turmoil.&nbsp;</strong>The group discussed the FSB&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/10/2023-bank-failures-preliminary-lessons-learnt-for-resolution/">report on preliminary lessons learnt for resolution from the 2023 bank failures</a>&nbsp;in the US and Europe and exchanged views on relevant policy considerations to ensure a more resilient banking sector and effective resolution frameworks in their own jurisdictions. Members look forward to contributing to the further work in 2024 to follow up on these lessons learnt. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The FSB RCG for the Middle East and North Africa is co-chaired by the Saudi Central Bank and the Central Bank of Egypt. Membership includes financial authorities from Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, T&uuml;rkiye and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>The FSB has six Regional Consultative Groups, established under the FSB Charter, to bring together financial authorities from FSB member and non-member countries to exchange views on vulnerabilities affecting financial systems and on initiatives to promote financial stability.<a class="footnote-ref" href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/02/fsb-mena-group-discusses-implementation-of-the-global-framework-for-crypto-asset-activities-and-lessons-from-2023-banking-turmoil/#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">1</a>&nbsp;Typically, each Regional Consultative Group meets twice each year.</p>
<p>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. The FSB also conducts outreach with approximately 70 other jurisdictions through its six Regional Consultative Groups.</p>
<p>The FSB is chaired by Klaas Knot, President of De Nederlandsche Bank. The FSB Secretariat is located in Basel, Switzerland and hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>

<div> Regulatory agencies, federal bank, comment request, Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act, regulations

Summary: The federal bank regulatory agencies are seeking public comments to reduce regulatory burden as required by the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act. They will review regulations in 12 categories and are soliciting comments on three categories initially. The agencies will also hold outreach meetings for interested parties to provide direct feedback on regulatory requirements. <div>
<p>The federal bank regulatory agencies today announced their first of a series of requests for comment to reduce regulatory burden. The Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996 requires the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council and federal bank regulatory agencies to review their regulations every 10 years to identify any outdated or otherwise unnecessary regulatory requirements for their supervised institutions.</p>
<p>To facilitate this review, the agencies divided their regulations into 12 categories and are first soliciting comments on their regulations in three categories: Applications and Reporting, Powers and Activities, and International Operations. Comments on the relevant regulations will be accepted for 90 days after publication in the&nbsp;<em>Federal Register</em>.</p>
<p>Over the next two years, the agencies will request comment on the regulations in the remaining categories, asking the public to identify regulations they believe are outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome.</p>
<p>The agencies also plan to hold outreach meetings where interested parties may comment on applicable regulatory requirements directly to the agencies. Information about the outreach meetings will be publicized as details are finalized.</p>

<div> sentiment, farmer, decline, income, investment
Summary:
- Farmer sentiment declined in January 2024, with lower barometer readings.
- Producers expressed pessimism about current situation and future prospects.
- Anticipation of weaker farm income in 2024 contributed to the decline.
- Producers are worried about a cost/price squeeze leading to lower farm incomes.
- There is enduring optimism in long-term farmland values, but reduced optimism in the short-term. 
- Interest in carbon capture remains consistent, with discussions about carbon contracts. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The most recent findings from the&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4085114-1&amp;h=825155463&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fageconomybarometer%2F&amp;a=Purdue+University%2FCME+Group+Ag+Economy+Barometer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="xn-org">Purdue University</span>/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer</a>&nbsp;reveal a downturn in farmer sentiment at the start of 2024.</p>
<p>The January barometer fell to a reading of 106, 8 points lower than in December. Producers expressed a more pessimistic perspective about their farms' current situation and future prospects. The Current Conditions Index fell 9 points, and the Future Expectations Index dropped by 7, both compared to December. The anticipation of weaker farm income in 2024 contributed to the overall decline, reflected in the Farm Financial Performance Index at 85, a 12-point decrease from the previous month. This month's Ag Economy Barometer survey was conducted from&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">Jan. 15-19</span>.</p>
<p>"The number of producers pointing to lower commodity prices and lower farm income in 2024 significantly influenced the decline across all indices," said&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4085114-1&amp;h=3826478076&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fageconomybarometer%2Fteam%2Fjim-mintert%2F&amp;a=James+Mintert" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="xn-person">James Mintert</span></a>, the barometer's principal investigator and director of&nbsp;<span class="xn-org">Purdue University's</span>&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4085114-1&amp;h=2771524353&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fhome%2F&amp;a=Center+for+Commercial+Agriculture" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Center for Commercial Agriculture</a>.</p>
<p>There was an increase in the proportion of producers anticipating a decline in financial performance for the upcoming year, with the figure rising from 20% in December to 31% in January. Concurrently, the percentage of those expecting income levels to remain stable decreased from 63% to 53%.</p>
<p>"For the first time, the percentage of producers choosing lower commodity prices as a top concern matched the percentage of producers who chose higher input costs. This alignment indicates that U.S. farmers are worried about a possible cost/price squeeze leading to lower farm incomes," Mintert said.</p>
<p>The Farm Capital Investment Index fell to 35, 8 points lower than in December. This month, a shift occurred as fewer producers attributed their hesitation to make large investments to rising interest rates, which reversed a trend observed through much of 2023. Instead, more farmers cited high machinery and construction prices as reasons to defer investments. Meanwhile, among those deeming it a favorable time for large investments, an increased number pointed to expansion opportunities, while fewer referenced the rise in dealers' farm machinery inventories as a motivating factor for investment.</p>
<p>This year, a greater number of producers expect their operating loan size to remain steady compared to last year, with fewer anticipating a larger loan. Of those expecting an increase, 61% cite rising input costs, down from 80% last year, while 23% attribute it to farm expansion, up from 15% in 2023.</p>
<p>While the Short-Term Farmland Value Expectations Index declined to 115, indicating reduced optimism on the part of producers, the long-term index held steady at 150, suggesting enduring optimism. Notably, the proportion of producers anticipating a decline in farmland values for the upcoming year rose to 16%, up from 10% just three months ago, with a simultaneous drop in those expecting higher values from 35% to 31%.</p>
<p>Additionally, the January survey reveals a consistent interest in carbon capture, as 8% of respondents reported engaging in discussions about carbon contracts. Among those, 61% were offered payment rates below&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$10</span>&nbsp;per metric ton, and 12% were offered a rate of&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$30</span>&nbsp;or more per ton.</p>

<title>Quant Granted US Patent For Chronologically Ordering Blockchain Transactions</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/quant-granted-us-patent-for-chronologically-ordering-blockchain-transactions/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/quant-granted-us-patent-for-chronologically-ordering-blockchain-transactions/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Patent, Blockchain, Quant, Finance, Technology
Summary:
Quant, a pioneer in blockchain for finance, has secured a new patent from the USPTO for a method to chronologically order transactions from different blockchains. This addresses the issue of varying block times and enables reliable record production. The company views patents as crucial for protecting its research and development and solidifying its market position. <div>
<p class="paragraph"><a href="https://quant.network/" target="_blank"><span>Quant</span></a><span class="normaltextrun"><span>, the blockchain for finance pioneer, has secured a new patent from the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The patent, titled &lsquo;Blockchain Communications and Ordering&rsquo;, recognises that Quant has invented a unique method for chronologically ordering transactions from different blockchains.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun"><span>Having</span></span><span class="normaltextrun"><span>&nbsp;also secured a patent from the Japanese Patent Office last year, this represents another significant milestone in Quant&rsquo;s ongoing mission to make distributed ledger technology simple, trusted and future-proof.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun"><span>Prior to Quant&rsquo;s research and development,&nbsp;</span></span><span class="normaltextrun"><span>different &lsquo;block times&rsquo; (the average time taken to generate a new block) across blockchains meant that finding a definitive transaction ordering method over multiple blockchains, that a consortium could agree on, was a disjointed and inconsistent process. This hindered firms from integrating multi blockchain-based projects into existing systems or using more than one type of blockchain in their operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun"><span>The</span></span><span class="normaltextrun"><span>&nbsp;grant of US patent 11842335 recognises that Quant has introduced a method to agree on a universal time zone for all blockchains, so that enterprises and smaller businesses can produce reliable, consensus-based records.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun"><span>Hele</span></span><span class="normaltextrun"><span>n Kemmitt, Quant&rsquo;s general counsel, comments: &ldquo;As blockchain adoption grows, patents are vital in protecting the fruits of research and development, and act as a catalyst for ongoing innovation. At Quant we view patents as a key way of solidifying our market position as a pioneer in blockchain for finance.&rdquo;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun"><span>Quant&nbsp;</span></span><span class="normaltextrun"><span>has a proven track record of supporting large institutions in the digitisation of financial markets, including collaborating with the Bank of England and Bank of International Settlements on&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/othp69.htm" target="_blank"><span class="normaltextrun"><span>Project Rosalind</span></span></a><span class="normaltextrun"><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span class="normaltextrun"><span>to explore how APIs could be used for digital currency systems. It is also making blockchain more accessible to firms of all sizes via its low-code platform,&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://quant.network/overledger-platform/" target="_blank"><span>Overledger</span></a><span class="normaltextrun"><span>. Other elements of Overledger&rsquo;s technology are also patent pending in various jurisdictions.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<div> amendments, Focused Scope Assessment, capital market intermediaries, Recognised Market Operators, regulatory framework
<br />
The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) has introduced the Focused Scope Assessment (FSA) for new eligible Capital Market Intermediaries and Recognised Market Operators. The FSA aims to evaluate operational and regulatory readiness, shorten the time to market, and ensure compliance with critical areas including financial crimes. The revised Guidelines on Recognised Markets facilitate the FSA.
<br /><br />Summary: 
The Focused Scope Assessment (FSA) is introduced for new eligible Capital Market Intermediaries and Recognised Market Operators to evaluate their operational and regulatory readiness. The FSA aims to shorten the time to market, ensure compliance with critical areas including financial crimes, and set a level playing field for all Recognised Market Operators. <div>
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) today introduced the Focused Scope Assessment (FSA) for new eligible Capital Market Intermediaries<sup>1</sup> (CMIs) and Recognised Market Operators (RMOs).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FSA, which takes effect immediately via amendments to the Guidelines on Recognised Markets<sup>2</sup>, is part of the regulator&rsquo;s new gatekeeping approach in light of the capital market&rsquo;s growing maturity and evolving regulatory standards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SC Chairman Dato&rsquo; Seri Dr. Awang Adek Hussin said, &ldquo;The fundraising and investment channels via the private market had been on a steady growth for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) to tap into funds for their expansion plans.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As at Q3 2023, the equity crowdfunding (ECF) and peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms have collectively raised approximately RM5.9 billion, benefiting almost 10,000 MSMEs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This commitment to develop a more progressive and robust regulatory framework reflects the SC&rsquo;s recognition of the crucial role these businesses play in driving the nation&rsquo;s growth and development,&rdquo; he added.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FSA evaluates the applicant&rsquo;s operational and regulatory readiness in a more targeted and efficient manner. It aims to shorten the time to market for CMIs and RMOs to three months, where previously it could take more than six months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FSA will also require applicants to have an independent party validating their business policies and procedures as part of their submission to the SC. This will give the applicant more control in ensuring efficiency and encouraging readiness to observe the requirements to undertake a regulated activity.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the above requirement, the SC continues its regulatory obligation in assessing applicants on critical areas including fit and properness, governance and key risk areas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amendments to the Guidelines on Recognised Markets were also made to set the stage for a level playing field for all RMOs, particularly in ensuring the adequacy of financial resources to commence operations in a fair and orderly manner. Notably, the capital requirement of RM5 million is now extended to new operators of Equity Crowd Funding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, amendments to the Guidelines on Recognised Markets include the strengthening of practices against financial crimes, such as money laundering and terrorist financing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The revised Guidelines on Recognised Markets that will facilitate the FSA are available <a href="https://www.sc.com.my/regulation/guidelines/recognizedmarkets">here</a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/regulation/guidelines/recognizedmarkets">.</a></p>
<p>
<hr />
</p>
<p align="left"><sup>1&nbsp;&nbsp; </sup>Eligible Capital Market Intermediaries include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Advising on corporate finance </li>
<li>Investment advice </li>
<li>Fund management &ndash; boutique portfolio management </li>
<li>Financial planning </li>
<li>Venture Capital and Private Equity </li>

<div> improving, quality, listed companies, investment value, high-quality development
<br />
Summary:<br />
The Chinese government is emphasizing the need to greatly improve the quality and investment value of listed companies to boost confidence and economic development. A special action focusing on primary business, innovation, information disclosure, and standardized operation has been launched to promote the return to investors and support high-quality economic development. <div>
<p>At the Central Financial Work Conference,&nbsp;the need to greatly improve the quality of listed companies&nbsp;was highlighted.&nbsp;Recently, at the Executive Meeting of the State Council,&nbsp;the importance of improving the quality and investment value of listed companies&nbsp;was&nbsp;emphasized&nbsp;again. At the national video conference on deployment of visits to listed companies and promotion of high-quality development of listed companies, Vice Premier He Lifeng proposed to increase&nbsp;the&nbsp;support for high-quality listed companies to facilitate the high-quality development of listed companies. Hence,&nbsp;boosting&nbsp;confidence, capital market stability and high-quality economic development.</p>
<p>Listed companies are the cornerstone of the capital market. Improving their&nbsp;quality is the only way to enhance the vitality and resilience of the capital market. On February 1, SZSE held&nbsp;a&nbsp;symposium&nbsp;having the&nbsp;participation of 12 representative SZSE-listed companies and officially launched the special action of &ldquo;Quality and Return Improvement&rdquo;. The purpose is to implement the important instructions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council and the deployments of the 2024 System Work Conference of the CSRC, firmly establish the investor-based philosophy and further improve the quality and investment value of listed companies.</p>
<p>This special action aims to drive the quality improvement of listed companies from four aspects: enhancing the awareness of focusing on primary business, raising the innovation and development ability, improving the quality of information disclosure and strengthening standardized operation. Under the guidance of the investor-based philosophy, this special action focuses on instruct listed companies to heighten the awareness of investor return.</p>
<p>At the symposium, 12 participating companies exchanged and discussed on improving the quality and investment value of listed companies. They shared the practices and experiences in focusing on the steady development of primary business, strengthening internal performance through standardized governance and enhancing the intrinsic value of companies and discussed the ways and methods to actively establish a good image and increase investor return. For example, CATL said that it will continue to increase&nbsp;R &amp; D&nbsp;investment and innovation efforts, uphold the innovation-oriented principle, enhance core competitiveness and return investors with excellent results. BYD proposed that it will firmly establish an investor-based philosophy, enhance the awareness of focusing on primary business, continuously consolidate the leading position of the world&rsquo;s first new energy vehicle sales,&nbsp;and make full use of dividends and other measures to return investors. INOVANCE said that it will increase the overseas investment layout, enhance the international competitiveness, strengthen the awareness of investor return,&nbsp;and improve the investment value of the company.</p>
<p>The quality of listed companies is the foundation of investment value of the capital market.&nbsp;It&nbsp;is prominently reflected in the return to investors. Good investment value can make listed companies more favored by investors and help&nbsp;them&nbsp;become better and stronger by use of capital market instruments.&nbsp;Next, SZSE will thoroughly implement the guidelines of the Central Financial Work Conference and the Executive Meeting of the State Council. SZSE will, in accordance with the deployments of the CSRC, deeply&nbsp;understand&nbsp;the political and people&rsquo;s nature of the work of the capital market and the exchange, fully study and analyze the opinions and suggestions of listed companies learned from&nbsp;all approaches,&nbsp;and better play the role of the exchange&nbsp;as a&nbsp;platform and hub.&nbsp;Besides, we&nbsp;will take multiple measures to assist listed companies in becoming better and stronger, vigorously promote the improvement of quality and investment value of listed companies,&nbsp;and support high-quality economic development with high-quality services.</p>

Summary: The PCAOB reports increasing deficiency rates in audits, prompting a call for renewed commitment to high-quality audits, emphasizing professional skepticism and investor protection. Changing conditions may increase risks, requiring auditors to maintain strong skepticism and audit quality. Audit committees play a crucial role in promoting high-quality audits and protecting investors. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<h2>Introduction<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-statement-investor-protection-020524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></h2>
<p>It is well-established that high quality audits of financial statements play a key role in investor protection and in building and preserving investor confidence. The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (&ldquo;PCAOB&rdquo;) reported a troubling increase in deficiency rates found in its recent inspections.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-statement-investor-protection-020524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;In its 2022 inspections of audits performed in 2021,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-statement-investor-protection-020524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;the PCAOB inspections program found that insufficient audit evidence was obtained to support the auditor&rsquo;s opinion in 40% of inspected audits. In its 2021 inspections, this same deficiency rate was 34%, up from 29% in its 2020 inspections. This is a troubling trendline in PCAOB inspections results.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we remind auditors that their fundamental responsibility to protect the investing public<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-statement-investor-protection-020524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;can be fulfilled only by commitment to high-quality audits. This, in turn, calls for the auditor to exercise objective, impartial judgment and rigorous professional skepticism in gathering and evaluating evidence throughout the audit to support the audit opinions provided. Furthermore, auditors should conduct engagements with a mindset that the investors, rather than management, are the audit client.</p>
<p>While we believe strongly that most auditors are talented professionals, dedicated to performing high-quality audits, the issues and trends identified in PCAOB inspections in recent years demand the attention and renewed commitment of the entire profession to deliver on its mission of protecting investors.</p>
<h2>Management&rsquo;s Role and Auditors&rsquo; Exercise of Professional Skepticism in Response to Changing Conditions</h2>
<p>Various external, dynamic conditions may put pressure on the operations and financial health of companies and render financial reporting and auditing more challenging.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-statement-investor-protection-020524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;The result may be new risks, or increases in existing risks, that affect the ability of an issuer&rsquo;s existing financial reporting infrastructure to ensure that investors receive accurate, transparent, and complete disclosures. Likewise, evolving risks may require changes to accounting policies, processes, and internal control over financial reporting (&ldquo;ICFR&rdquo;) to maintain a financial reporting environment capable of producing reliable financial disclosures. Management should be mindful of these dynamics and ensure they are continuously evaluating and adjusting their systems and processes accordingly. For their part, auditors should challenge management teams to ensure that adequate systems and processes, coupled with a strong compliance culture, are in place to produce reliable, high quality financial statements and disclosures.</p>
<p>Over the past three PCAOB annual inspection cycles, for audits requiring auditor attestation over management&rsquo;s assessment of ICFR, auditor testing of management review controls has had the highest rate of deficiency.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-statement-investor-protection-020524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;For these audits of ICFR during this period, the second highest rate of deficiency was in the auditors&rsquo; identification and selection of controls to test, while the third highest rate of deficiency was in the auditors&rsquo; identification and selection of controls over the completeness and accuracy of information used in the operation of the control.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-statement-investor-protection-020524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;Accordingly, we remind auditors of their responsibility to exercise professional skepticism in the gathering and evaluating of evidence, including related to internal controls, and approaching management&rsquo;s judgments in these areas with professional skepticism.</p>
<p>PCAOB audit inspection findings also frequently identify areas of concern and deficiencies in audit evidence obtained in important financial statement areas, including revenue and related accounts, accounting estimates, business combinations, inventory, and long-lived assets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-statement-investor-protection-020524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;Additionally, fraud is an ever-present risk, but particularly as companies face challenges, a higher risk of fraud may exist. For instance, management may be under pressure to meet earnings expectations in the face of declining revenue or increased costs. As auditors conduct their audits, they must be aware of areas of common audit deficiencies, as well as conditions that may create or change incentives, pressures, and opportunities, or facilitate rationalization for management and corporate misconduct. In the face of heightened fraud risk, auditors must consider whether a proper exercise of professional skepticism requires more persuasive evidence to corroborate management&rsquo;s assertions.</p>
<p>Auditors should consider strong practices in the exercise of professional skepticism.&nbsp;<em>First</em>, as discussed in greater detail below, the auditor should frequently and proactively engage with the audit committee, which for listed issuers must be independent. These discussions should include events that impact financial reporting and related issues, including any red flags, arising from management responses. In this vein, the auditor should not agree to truncated or summary presentations of their concerns with management or management responses to audit concerns with the audit committee.&nbsp;<em>Second</em>, the auditor should also engage and effectively integrate specialists and other experts into the engagement team to assist in auditing complex areas or where specialized knowledge is needed. Doing so will help ensure that the auditor has adequate expertise to challenge management&rsquo;s assessments and assertions.&nbsp;<em>Third</em>, the auditor should ensure that engagement teams are appropriately trained on biases that can affect auditor judgment and decision-making, and that might undermine professional skepticism.&nbsp;<em>Finally</em>, the audit firm and lead engagement partner should ensure that audit staff are empowered to exercise their professional skepticism and challenge the judgments of management. This may involve, among other things, supporting audit staff in exploring areas of heightened risk and red flags, insulating audit staff from any undue pressure to accept less than persuasive audit evidence, and refusing management requests or demands to replace audit team members.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-statement-investor-protection-020524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p>Applying professional skepticism can sometimes come at a cost, whether it is budget overruns, conflicts with management, or pressure from within the audit firm to maintain client relationships. But the audit engagement is not a standard business relationship between service provider and client, with profit as the primary goal and indicator of success. Instead, as the Supreme Court recognized, the auditor&rsquo;s ultimate responsibility is to the investing public.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-statement-investor-protection-020524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;This responsibility both transcends the relationship with management of the audit client and elevates the importance of its proper functioning to produce the high-quality audits focused on the auditor&rsquo;s responsibilities to investors that are a critical piece of a fair, orderly, and efficient capital markets system.</p>
<h2>The Importance of the Audit Committee in Prioritizing and Promoting Audit Quality</h2>
<p>The audit committee has the statutory responsibility to appoint, compensate, and oversee an issuer&rsquo;s auditor.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-statement-investor-protection-020524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;In executing its responsibilities, an audit committee should prioritize, and aim to promote, audit quality, to protect investors. Academic studies highlight the risk that, in some cases, in executing their mandate, audit committees may look to protect the interests of the issuer and its management over the interests of investors.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-statement-investor-protection-020524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;This risk can arise out of an audit committee&rsquo;s association or coziness with the issuer or its management or through management's influence over the audit committee's supervision of the auditor.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-statement-investor-protection-020524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;We remind audit committees of their role as critical gatekeepers for investor protection through oversight of a high-quality audit and the benefit of having an audit committee that is independent of management.</p>
<p>Commitment to audit quality starts with the independence of the audit committee and its selection and oversight of the independent auditor. Audit committees, in selecting an auditor, should prioritize audit quality. This will encourage auditors to compete for engagements based on their ability to perform a high-quality audit, with the requisite degree of professional skepticism. To ensure quality, the audit committee should frequently evaluate its process for assessing the auditor&rsquo;s performance, including relevant firm or engagement-level metrics. For example, the audit committee should consider whether and how it monitors and considers the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>results of the auditor&rsquo;s PCAOB inspections, the firm&rsquo;s internal monitoring programs, or other firm audit quality reporting;</li>
<li>whether the engagement team has appropriate industry expertise, and whether the engagement partner is sufficiently engaged and provides leadership to the engagement team;</li>
<li>the engagement team&rsquo;s total hours and staffing mix (such as, the use of specialists, the composition of experience within the engagement team, or portions of the engagement performed by other auditors); and</li>
<li>significant changes (or the lack thereof) in hours or staffing mix from previous audits.</li>
</ul>
<p>To maximize audit quality, the audit committee should also work to support the auditor&rsquo;s independence and facilitate the auditor&rsquo;s exercise of professional skepticism. This would require the audit committee to form a strong professional relationship with the auditor, independent of management, which can reduce the auditor&rsquo;s barrier to exercising professional skepticism and focusing on its responsibilities to investors.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-statement-investor-protection-020524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;In furtherance of this critical goal, audit committees are encouraged to:<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-statement-investor-protection-020524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></p>
<ul>
<li>meet with the auditor, independent of management, through formal or informal meetings;</li>
<li>have an open dialogue that provides adequate time for in-depth discussions of financial reporting and internal control matters with the independent auditor;</li>
<li>dedicate time to asking the auditor probing questions to assess audit quality;</li>
<li>speak directly with the audit engagement team about the importance of professional skepticism and the audit committee&rsquo;s support of the engagement team; and</li>
<li>avoid substituting management&rsquo;s judgments or interactions with the independent auditor for the audit committee&rsquo;s own judgments and engagement with the independent auditor.</li>
</ul>
<p>We further encourage audit committees to leverage their unique oversight position to help set and monitor the tone for management&rsquo;s relationship with the auditor. Audit committees should evaluate the frequency and quality of the auditor&rsquo;s interactions with management.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Auditors and audit committees must focus on audit quality as their top priority. In doing so, and in the audit team&rsquo;s exercise of their duty to apply professional skepticism to the audit, each should pay particularly close attention to areas that have been frequently identified as causes of deficiencies in PCAOB inspections. Auditors and audit committees serve as gatekeepers for investor protection and the financial reporting process and have an important role in facilitating the high-quality audits that are critical to the proper functioning of our capital markets.</p>

<div> Banking, climate-related financial risks, digital finance, operational resilience, cross-border regimes
Summary:
The ninth meeting of the U.S.-UK Financial Regulatory Working Group discussed economic and financial stability, banking issues, non-bank sector developments, climate-related financial risks, digital finance, cross-border regimes, and operational resilience. Participants exchanged views, engaged in international standards discussions, and agreed to reconvene in September 2024. Ongoing dialogue on shared priorities is essential for bilateral regulatory cooperation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The ninth official meeting of the U.S.-UK Financial Regulatory Working Group took place in London on 31 January 2024.</p>
<p>Officials and senior staff from HM Treasury and the U.S. Department of the Treasury were joined by representatives from independent regulatory agencies, including the Bank of England, Financial Conduct Authority, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and Securities and Exchange Commission.&nbsp;Agency participation varied across themes with participants expressing views on issues in their respective areas of responsibility.</p>
<p>The Working Group meeting focused on several key themes, including: 1) the economic and financial stability outlook 2) banking issues 3) developments in the non-bank sector 4) climate-related financial risks and sustainable finance 5) digital finance 6) cross border regimes 7) operational resilience.</p>
<p>The meeting opened with a broad discussion of the UK and U.S. economic and financial stability outlook, with participants taking stock of current economic trends and market conditions and considering broader global factors.</p>
<p>On banking issues, participants offered an overview of developments in their domestic banking systems. The Working Group noted work being led by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and Basel Committee on Banking Supervision as part of their respective work programs, which include certain follow-up work in light of the 2023 bank failure events and the FSB&rsquo;s report on preliminary lessons learnt from resolution. Discussions were held on each jurisdiction&rsquo;s banking regulation, including resolution-related rulemaking updates, proposed Basel III-based revisions to capital requirements, and the UK&rsquo;s recently published consultation on resolution regime enhancements.&nbsp;Participants discussed the importance of ongoing dialogue among international partners when implementing these initiatives and reforms.</p>
<p>The Working Group continued with a discussion of developments in non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) and the importance and urgency of fostering resilience in the NBFI sector.&nbsp;Participants discussed the development of their respective domestic reform agendas, including on money market funds and open-ended funds. Noting the cross-border nature of NBFI, participants discussed their continued engagement at the G7, G20, FSB, and international standard-setting bodies (SSBs), specifically on FSB work to address vulnerabilities arising from leverage in the NBFI sector, and to improve market participants&rsquo; preparedness to meet margin calls. Participants acknowledged the importance of continuing the implementation of NBFI reforms at the domestic level.</p>
<p>Participants held conversations about climate-related financial risks and sustainable finance in line with their respective mandates.&nbsp; Representatives noted recent developments in these areas, including the publication of the International Sustainability Standards Board&rsquo;s (ISSB) final disclosure standards, as well as the International Organization of Securities Commission&rsquo;s (IOSCO) endorsement of those standards, which called on IOSCO&rsquo;s members to consider ways in which they might adopt, apply or otherwise be informed by the ISSB standards within the context of their jurisdictional arrangements. &nbsp;Participants noted that the ISSB standards will promote interoperability with respect to climate-related disclosures. UK authorities discussed the launch of the Transition Plan Taskforce Disclosure framework and the industry code of conduct for environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings and data providers and the Transition Finance Market review. Participants also discussed rules on sustainability disclosure requirements for financial products, including fund names and anti-greenwashing rules, noting international initiatives on these topics. Priorities in multilateral fora, including in the G20 Sustainable Finance Working Group and the FSB, were also discussed.</p>
<p>Participants shared views on issues related to crypto-assets and other areas of digital finance.&nbsp;Representatives offered updates about recent developments in crypto-asset markets and discussed international engagement within the sector.&nbsp;Participants noted the importance of effective regulation and oversight of crypto assets and markets and reiterated their support for the international work on crypto assets. Participants also discussed the publications of the FSB&rsquo;s high-level recommendations to promote consistency, given the cross-border nature of crypto-asset activities, and discussed their importance as jurisdictions implement their own frameworks, consistent with the FSB recommendations to avoid potential regulatory arbitrage. The Working Group discussed recent developments in their respective work on Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), and UK authorities provided an overview of the findings of their recent public consultation on a digital pound. &nbsp;Participants also exchanged views on their respective approaches to artificial intelligence (AI). U.S. and UK authorities discussed ways to work together, including as appropriate through international bodies, to address potential benefits and risks of AI in financial services. The Working Group discussed the importance of comprehensive regulation in the area of digital finance, as well as its objective of fostering responsible digital financial innovation, including through the bilateral Financial Innovation Partnership, which brings together subject-matter experts for technical discussions that supplement discussions in the Working Group.</p>
<p>The Working Group continued previous discussions of the importance of operational resilience. Participants discussed the UK regulators&rsquo; consultation paper on critical third parties to the UK financial sector, which was published in December 2023, and noted the importance of international cooperation in this area.</p>
<p>The Working Group also acknowledged ongoing discussions and exchanges of information between HMT and the CFTC regarding their respective cross-border regimes, including for central counterparties/derivatives clearing organisations. In particular, it was noted that the UK&rsquo;s equivalence decision for CFTC-authorised derivatives clearing organisations came into effect at the end of December 2023. At the conclusion of the event, the Working Group agreed to reconvene in September 2024, while noting the importance of continued open dialogue on shared priorities.</p>
<p>The U.S.-UK Financial Regulatory Working Group is an ongoing biannual dialogue established in 2018 to deepen bilateral regulatory cooperation and to enhance: financial stability; investor protection; fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and capital formation across both jurisdictions.</p>

<div> January 2024, Fiserv Small Business Index, small business sales, retail, consumer spending <br />
Small business sales remained steady in January, with a 0.1% month-over-month increase and a 1.7% year-over-year increase. Retail sector outperformed overall small businesses, with impressive foot traffic and growth in building materials, health and personal care, and general merchandise.

Food services and drinking places saw a decline, while specialty trade contractors and professional, scientific, and technical services showed modest growth. <div>
<ul>
<li><i>Fiserv Small Business Index of 138 indicates consumers continue to spend consistently</i></li>
<li><i style="font-family: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">Small business sales grew +0.1% month-over-month; year-over-year sales grew +1.7%</i></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fiserv.com/" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Fiserv, Inc.</a>&nbsp;(NYSE: FI), a leading global provider of payments and financial services technology, has published the Fiserv Small Business Index&trade; for January 2024. The Fiserv Small Business Index is an indicator of the performance of small businesses in the United States at national, state, and industry levels.</p>
<p>According to this month&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fiserv.com/en/fiserv-small-business-index.html" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Fiserv Small Business Index</a>, spending at small businesses held steady to start the year, growing +0.1% month-over-month to remain at an index of 138, unchanged from December. Year-over-year sales reflected healthy consumer demand, growing +1.7%, but off the pace of the +2.6% increase in December 2023.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Small businesses maintained steady sales in January despite harsh weather conditions impacting much of the country,&rdquo; said Prasanna Dhore, Chief Data Officer at Fiserv. &ldquo;Small businesses in the Retail sector outperformed the small business category overall, with growth driven by consumer spending on building materials, health and personal care, and general merchandise. Spending in the Food Services subsector, which includes restaurants and bars, slipped as we moved out of the holiday season.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Retail Spotlight</span></p>
<p>The January index for Retail was 143, representing a 1-point gain over December, with retail sector small businesses outperforming the small business category overall. This equated to +0.7% month-over-month sales growth and +1.9% year-over-year growth. Foot traffic across retail was impressive, up +4.2% year-over-year, signaling consumer demand for goods has continued to expand post-holiday. Building Materials, Health and Personal Care and General Merchandise led the growth. Areas that typically represent higher discretionary spending did not keep pace, namely Clothing and Sporting Goods.</p>
<p><span>Additional Small Business Insights</span></p>
<p>Food Services and Drinking Places saw demand slip compared to the holiday season. The January index for this subsector fell 5 points from December, to 122. Month-over-month sales were down -4.1%, and year-over-year sales were down -1.9%.</p>
<p>Specialty Trade Contractors had a January index of 145, marking a 1-point decline from December. Month-over-month sales were slightly down at -0.5%, while the subsector grew modestly at +0.9% compared to January 2023. The Specialty Trade Contractors subsector includes service providers, such as carpentry and masonry, roofing, electrical, and heating and plumbing specialists.</p>
<p>Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services increased 1 point over December to an index of 148 in January. Small business sales in this subsector grew at +0.7% compared to December and were up significantly compared to January 2023, growing +6.0%. This broad subsector includes veterinary, legal, accounting, advertising, tax preparation and other professional services.</p>
<p><span>About the Fiserv Small Business Index&trade;</span></p>
<p>The Fiserv Small Business Index is published during the first week of every month and differentiated by its direct aggregation of consumer spending activity within the U.S. small business ecosystem. Rather than relying on survey or sentiment data, the Fiserv Small Business Index is derived from point-of-sale transaction data, including card, cash, and check transactions in-store and online, across approximately 2 million U.S. small businesses.</p>
<p>Benchmarked to 2019, the Fiserv Small Business Index provides a numeric value measuring consumer spending, with an accompanying transaction index measuring customer traffic.

<title>ICE Mortgage Monitor: Positive Signs In Housing, Mortgage Markets Ahead Of Spring Homebuying Season</title>

<div> Inventory deficit, affordability, home price index, mortgage rates, equity<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
Affordability has improved with a 5% reduction in the share of income needed to purchase a home. The national inventory deficit has also improved for the 7th consecutive month, leading to a better housing market environment. The ICE Home Price Index shows a 5.6% annual growth rate. Lower mortgage rates have increased refinance incentives and mortgage holders gained $1.6T in equity in 2023. <div>
<div class="bw-subheadline-wrapper">
<ul>
<li>Affordability has improved along with rates in recent months, with the share of income required to purchase the median home falling nearly 5 percentage points from October&rsquo;s 28-year high</li>
<li>The national inventory deficit also improved for the 7<sup>th</sup><span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;consecutive month which, along with improved affordability, points to a better housing market environment in coming months</span></li>
<li>The ICE Home Price Index for December reported an annual growth rate of +5.6%, up from +5.1% in November, which at first glance suggests an accelerating housing market</li>
<li>That acceleration, however, is a residual effect of last spring and summer&rsquo;s strong run of growth, with more recent data suggesting that growth rate will begin to cool in coming months</li>
<li>Lower interest rates have also begun to increase refinance incentive, albeit slowly, with more potential on the horizon, particularly among the 4.3M mortgages originated in 2023</li>
<li>Of the 2023 vintage, 46% (2M) would be able to cut their first lien rate by 75 bps if 30-year rates fall to a projected 6% by year&rsquo;s end, with 33% able to save a full percentage point or more</li>
<li>Mortgage holders gained $1.6T in equity in 2023 to reach an aggregate $16T, the highest year-end total on record, two thirds of which is held by borrowers with credit scores of 760 or higher</li>
<li>The average mortgage holder now has $299K in equity, $193K of which is &ldquo;tappable&rdquo; and could be withdrawn while still maintaining a healthy 20% equity stake</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, released its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.blackknightinc.com/data-reports/" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">February 2024 ICE Mortgage Monitor Report</a>, based on the company&rsquo;s industry-leading mortgage, real estate and public records data sets. Mortgage rates were at 6.71% as of January 24 according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ice.com/fixed-income-data-services/index-solutions/mortgage-rate-lock-indices" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">ICE US Conforming 30-year Fixed Mortgage Rate Lock Index</a>&nbsp;&ndash; more than a full percentage point below their October 2023 high. As ICE Vice President of Enterprise Research Strategy Andy Walden explains, this and other recent market trends have produced positive, yet measured, signs for the 2024 housing market.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prospective homebuyers may feel an all-too-familiar sense of dread upon hearing that prices &ndash; already at record highs &ndash; rose another 5.6% in 2023 according to our ICE Home Price Index,&rdquo; Walden said. &ldquo;As always, the truth of the situation is more nuanced than one simple, backward-looking metric might suggest, and the data holds some encouraging signals for these folks. In recent months, we&rsquo;ve seen improvement in rates, affordability, and for sale inventory, with monthly home price growth moderating on a seasonally adjusted basis. While we are still out of sync with historical norms on multiple fronts, each of those metrics have at least been moving in the right direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Research in this month&rsquo;s report shows today&rsquo;s market remains interest-rate-driven. The recent rebound in affordability has increased purchase mortgage demand, comparable to levels seen last summer when interest rates were in a similar range. Purchase demand continues to trend very consistently with 30-year-rate changes and their downstream impact on affordability. As Walden explains, the refinance market has also seen some modest improvement, with the potential for more growth throughout the year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While the mortgage market remains overwhelmingly purchase-centric, refinance incentive is rising, albeit slowly, alongside easing interest rates,&rdquo; Walden continued. &ldquo;Since interest rates peaked back in October, we&rsquo;ve seen a threefold increase in the number of mortgage holders who could reduce their first lien rate by at least 75 bps with a rate/term refi. And while that population stands at roughly 1.7 million &ndash; up from 520K last fall &ndash; it is still a historically small number. Should rates fall to 6% by year&rsquo;s end as current forecasts suggest, the number of borrowers with refinance incentive would rise, particularly among 2023 vintage originations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under that scenario &ndash; a potential needle mover for the refinance market &ndash; some 46% of 2023-vintage borrowers would be &lsquo;in the money,&rsquo; with nearly a third able to cut a full percentage point off their current rates. As more legacy mortgages regain rate incentive as well, the overall &lsquo;in the money&rsquo; population would more than double to 3.8 million by the end of the year, with nearly 60% of that growth coming from loans originated in 2023. Originators would do well to identify and engage with these potential customers now. Of course, what&rsquo;s good news for mortgage originators simultaneously heightens prepayment risk in the capital markets. Getting a granular, daily view of prepay activity will become essential this year as investors navigate an extremely rate-sensitive and volatile market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The month&rsquo;s data also shows that aggregate American mortgage holder equity ended 2023 at $16T &ndash; gaining 11% ($1.6T) over the year to reach the highest year-end total on record. The average mortgage holder now has $299K in equity, up from $274K at the end of 2022. Such historically high equity levels create the conditions for an upswing in equity lending when interest rates ease enough to make withdrawals more attractive to homeowners. Two thirds of all equity is held by borrowers with credit scores of 760 or higher, offering lenders a likewise appealing, lower-risk cohort to whom they can offer equity-based products.</p>

<p>Mid-Curve Options on index dividend futures, currently only available as an OTC product, can now be traded at Eurex.</p>
<p>Mid-Curve Options (Eurex), or Swaptions (OTC terminology), are listed options that expire on an underlying future with a longer expiry date than the next settling future. These options focus on the next five years of dividends, allowing participants to fine-tune risk management or anticipate changes in dividend expectations.</p>
<p>Eurex, who had a global market share of 86% in dividend derivatives in 2023, aims to further strengthen its leadership position in the listed dividend segment and to facilitate the migration of OTC open interest and trading volumes using the TES Block Trade and Vola Trade functionality providing order book transparency.</p>
<p>"Dividend derivatives have evolved from a tool to hedge expected dividend risk to an outright asset class that attracts many diverse market participants. These new products give traders the ability to express their view on long-term dividend expectations using shorter expiry options in an accessible central market," says Lorena Dishnica, Equity &amp; Index Product Design&nbsp;at&nbsp;Eurex.</p>

<div> Categories, Investors, Guidelines, Capital Market, Malaysia
Summary:
The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) has expanded sophisticated investor categories to increase market accessibility. The new guidelines include a "Knowledge and Experience" category and consider an investor's primary residence value. Joint account definitions are also expanded to include accounts with a spouse or child to better represent a family's financial status and investment potential. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) announced that it has widened sophisticated investor categories in a move to increase capital market accessibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new &ldquo;Guidelines on Categories of Sophisticated Investors&rdquo;, which takes effect today, reinforces the SC&rsquo;s commitment to maintain capital market competitiveness and vibrancy, while promoting greater investor participation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SC Chairman Dato&rsquo; Seri Dr. Awang Adek Hussin said that the growing sophistication of the Malaysian capital market has resulted in varied financing needs and investment risk appetites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The criteria for sophisticated investors have been broadened to include a wider range of individuals who can contribute to the market&rsquo;s growth and stability,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 2023, the domestic capital market grew to RM3.8 trillion from RM3.6 trillion in the previous year. This presents significant opportunities for the market to attract a more diverse investor base regionally and encourage greater capital flow into sophisticated product and market segments,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Key features of the expansion include a new category that takes into account the knowledge and experience of sophisticated investors. In addition, enhancements to current categories are made, allowing flexibilities of existing financial thresholds for high net worth individuals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new &lsquo;Knowledge and Experience&rsquo; category will benefit individuals who do not meet financial tests but are able to demonstrate financial knowledge sophistication to participate in relevant market offerings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This category assesses potential investors based on their education, recognised financial association membership, and practical experience in relevant sectors such as banking, capital markets or insurance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another key change is t he inclusion of an investor's primary residence value, up to a cap of RM1 million, in assessing their qualification as a sophisticated investor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The definition of a joint account is also expanded to incorporate accounts with a spouse or child, including total net joint annual income and investment portfolios. This expansion will better depict a family's collective financial status and investment potential.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Guidelines on Categories of Sophisticated Investors&rdquo; are now available on the SC <a href="https://www.sc.com.my/regulation/guidelines/categories-of-sophisticated-investors">website</a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/regulation/guidelines/categories-of-sophisticated-investors">.</a> Consequently, all relevant guidelines have also been updated in relation to reference to sophisticated investors.</p>

<title>Hong Kong Securities And Futures Commission Urges Investors To Check Regulatory Status Of Virtual Asset Trading Platforms As Transition Period Will End Soon</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/hong-kong-securities-and-futures-commission-urges-investors-to-check-regulatory/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/hong-kong-securities-and-futures-commission-urges-investors-to-check-regulatory/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> licensed, virtual asset trading platforms, SFC, applicants, Hong Kong<br />
Summary:<br />
- SFC reminds investors to trade virtual assets only on licensed VATPs<br />
- Check the "List of licensed virtual asset trading platforms" and "List of virtual asset trading platform applicants" for regulatory status<br />
- VATPs must submit license application by 29 Feb 2024 to operate after 1 Jun 2024<br />
- Trading on unlicensed platforms carries risk, SFC urges trading only on licensed VATPs<br />
- It is a criminal offense for VATPs to operate without a license in Hong Kong <div>
<p>The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) wishes to remind investors to trade virtual assets only on SFC-licensed virtual asset trading platforms (VATPs). If they are not certain about the regulatory status of the VATP they are currently dealing with, they can check the SFC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/Welcome-to-the-Fintech-Contact-Point/Virtual-assets/Virtual-asset-trading-platforms-operators/Lists-of-virtual-asset-trading-platforms" target="_blank">Lists of virtual asset trading platforms</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In particular, investors should check whether a VATP is on the&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;List of licensed virtual asset trading platforms</em>&rdquo; or on the&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;List of virtual asset trading platform applicants</em>&rdquo;. VATPs on the<em>&nbsp;"List of licensed virtual asset trading platforms</em>&rdquo; are formally licensed by the SFC. VATPs on the&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;List of virtual asset trading platform applicants</em>&rdquo; include VATPs operating in Hong Kong which have submitted licence applications to the SFC on or before 29 February 2024. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investors should check the regulatory status of a VATP from time to time and in any event on 1 March 2024. This is because VATPs operating in Hong Kong which have not submitted their licence applications to the SFC by 29 February 2024 MUST close down their businesses in Hong Kong by&nbsp;<span>31 May 2024</span>&nbsp;pursuant to the transitional arrangements under the SFC&rsquo;s regulatory regime for VATPs (Notes 1 and 2).</p>
<p>For investors dealing with VATPs operating in Hong Kong which are NOT on the&nbsp;<em>"List of licensed virtual asset trading platforms</em>&rdquo; or on the&nbsp;<em>"List of virtual asset trading platform applicants</em>&rdquo; (Note 3), they are urged to make preparations early, before&nbsp;<span>31 May 2024</span>, such as by closing their accounts with these VATPs or transferring to SFC-licensed VATPs for trading virtual assets.</p>
<p>The SFC, however, reminds the public that the applications submitted by applicants on the&nbsp;<em>"List of virtual asset trading platform applicants</em>&rdquo; are still being processed and they may &ndash; or may not &ndash; be approved; hence, trading on these platforms carries a risk (Note 3).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last but not least, the SFC strongly urges investors to trade virtual assets ONLY on SFC-licensed VATPs because they may leave themselves unprotected by trading on unlicensed platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Under Schedule 3G to the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance (Cap 615) (AMLO), transitional arrangements up to 31 May 2024 are provided to allow sufficient time for VATPs which have been carrying on the business of operating a virtual asset exchange (VA service) as defined under section 53ZR and Schedule 3B to the AMLO in Hong Kong before 1 June 2023 to apply for a licence or to prepare for an orderly close-down of their business operations in Hong Kong. Such VATPs must submit a licence application to the SFC by 29 February 2024 in order to continue operating in Hong Kong on or after 1 June 2024.</li>
<li>Under the AMLO, it is a criminal offence for VATPs which were not carrying on a business of operating a virtual asset exchange in Hong Kong before 1 June 2023 to carry on their businesses in Hong Kong, or actively market their services to Hong Kong investors on or after 1 June 2023 without a licence. It is also a criminal offence for VATPs which have not submitted a licence application to the SFC by 29 February 2024 to continue operating in Hong Kong on or after 1 June 2024.</li>
<li>The public should be aware that VATPs on the&nbsp;<em>"List of virtual asset trading platform applicants</em>&rdquo; are NOT licensed or regulated by the SFC and they may NOT be in compliance with the SFC&rsquo;s requirements. These VATPs may NOT eventually be granted licences as the SFC may return or refuse their applications. In such cases, these VATPs may be required to close down their businesses in Hong Kong and their names may be placed on the<em>&nbsp;"List of closing-down virtual asset trading platforms</em>&rdquo;. Investors should thus also check the&nbsp;<em>"List of closing-down virtual asset trading platforms</em>&rdquo; from time to time.</li>

<p>Thank you for the invitation to join you today at the Southwestern Graduate School of Banking's 157th Assembly for Bank Directors.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240202a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1">1</a>&nbsp;In light of the recent direction of public policy affecting the financial system and bank regulation, my remarks today will discuss the potential impact of this current approach on the long-term future of banking. Too often, when we think about the future of banking, we focus only on today's most pressing issues and problems, some of which will be fleeting and may not have long-term impacts on the banking system. So today, I would like to take a higher-level view to think about the future of banking over a longer time horizon. My framing will focus on how the past can shed some light on the dynamics that bank leadership must consider in running their banks and that regulators should consider as we regulate and supervise institutions. My hope is that this broader perspective can help to provide bank directors&mdash;and even regulators&mdash;with some perspective on how today's choices may shape the banking system.</p>
<p>Before I delve into the "future" of banking, I want to spend a moment on the "present" of monetary policy and the economy.</p>
<p>At our meeting earlier this week, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) kept the target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent and continued the run-off of the Fed's securities holdings. Inflation readings over the past six months indicate that the Committee's past policy actions are having the intended effect of reducing inflationary pressures. The most recent 12-month readings through December for total and core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation came in at 2.6 and 2.9 percent respectively, the first time both measures have been below 3 percent since the spring of 2021. I view the slowdown in inflation readings over recent months as encouraging. In addition to this progress on inflation, economic activity has continued to expand at a strong pace while the labor market has remained tight. Further evidence of economic strength showed in the advance report of fourth quarter real gross domestic product (GDP) with an increase of 3.3 percent, partly reflecting ongoing strength in consumer spending, and also in today's employment report with an acceleration in job gains to a very strong pace of around 350,000 for both December and January. The unemployment rate remained low at 3.7 percent. This appears to reverse the trend from last year, when the average pace of job gains slowed and the labor force participation rate rose through November, a sign that labor market demand and supply may have been coming into better balance. That said, today's jobs report with markedly stronger job growth and a labor force participation that has retraced some of its earlier gains suggests that progress has stalled over the past two months.</p>
<p>Considering these developments, I voted to maintain the policy rate at its current level while we continue to monitor the incoming data and assess the implications for the inflation and economic outlook. My baseline outlook is that inflation will decline further with the policy rate held at the current level. Should the incoming data continue to indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, it will eventually become appropriate to gradually lower our policy rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive. In my view, we are not yet at that point. And a number of important upside inflation risks remain.</p>
<p>These include risks from geopolitical conditions, including the prominent risk of spillovers from geopolitical conflicts and the extent to which food and energy markets and supply chains remain exposed to these influences. There is also the risk that continued easing in financial conditions could add momentum to demand, stalling any further progress in lowering inflation, or even causing inflation to reaccelerate. Finally, there is a risk that continued labor market tightness could lead to persistently high core services inflation. Today's labor market data, which indicated a pickup in wage inflation in recent months, suggests ongoing elevated wage growth as some businesses continue to report above-average wage increases to compensate for inflation.</p>
<p>Given these risks, and the general uncertainty regarding the economic outlook, I will continue to watch the data closely&mdash;especially the inflation data revisions next week and upcoming inflation reports&mdash;as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy. The frequency and extent of data revisions over the past few years, as illustrated in today's employment report, make the task of predicting how the economy will evolve even more challenging, and I will remain cautious in my approach to considering future changes in the stance of policy. Reducing our policy rate too soon could result in requiring further future policy rate increases to return inflation to 2 percent in the longer run.</p>
<p>It is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. My colleagues and I will make our decisions at each meeting based on the incoming data and the implications for the outlook. While the current stance of monetary policy appears to be sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time, I remain willing to raise the federal funds rate at a future meeting should the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled or reversed. Restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.</p>
<p><strong>The Future of Banking</strong><br />Turning back to the future of banking, today we find ourselves at an interesting juncture in the evolution of the banking system. Some traditional risks&mdash;like interest rate risk and liquidity risk&mdash;have become a higher priority concern for banks and regulators, while other risks&mdash;like cybersecurity and fraud&mdash;continue to evolve and pose challenges. And of course, banking regulation and proposed reforms exert pressure on important elements of the banking system, affecting both the size and activities of banks. At the same time, I see important opportunities&mdash;and a critical need&mdash;for banks to continue supporting their communities and to find new and innovative ways to deliver financial products and services.</p>
<p>Bankers and regulators alike must think about these dynamics and how they will impact the future of the banking system, including safety and soundness, U.S. financial stability, the future role of banks in the U.S. financial system, and how our actions today could have long-term consequences.</p>
<p><strong>The Risk of Complacency</strong><br />Banks have an obligation to manage all material risks, and yet we see that even with traditional risks&mdash;interest rate and liquidity risk, for example&mdash;long periods of calm, such as those that followed the prolonged period of low interest rates following the 2008 financial crisis, can lull both bankers and regulators into a state of complacency.</p>
<p>Often, this complacency stems from false assumptions, assumptions that prove to be inaccurate over time. For example, leading up to the 2008 financial crisis there was an unrealistic expectation that housing values would continue to appreciate. Those who relied on this expectation made choices that proved to be ill-advised in the long run resulting in severe economic consequences. Likewise, the persistently low interest rates that were a legacy of the post-2008 financial crisis period led some to chase yield in their securities investment portfolios, over-investing in fixed-rate, long-term securities relying on the belief that long-term interest rates would remain low in perpetuity. Regulators themselves&mdash;while increasingly aware of and focused on these risks over time&mdash;were late to the game in terms of taking strong, proactive action, both in the lead-up to the 2008 financial crisis, and more recently, in the lead-up to the banking stress in the spring of 2023.</p>
<p>In each of these cases, false assumptions led to complacency, which resulted in an inability to appropriately recognize and appreciate the early signs of risk that ultimately stressed the banking system and the broader economy. But how do we protect the banking system against the risks that come from complacency? For bankers, I think this requires a constant focus on risks, both traditional and emerging. To be clear, many bankers live with this mindset every day; they know their borrowers and communities, and they carefully monitor traditional and emerging risks&mdash;and manage those risks&mdash;on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>In many ways, complacency can result in overlooking risks even on matters that are universal in the management of all banks, like succession planning and information technology management. We know that many banks, particularly those in rural markets, face significant challenges when planning effective leadership succession. Absent appropriate succession planning, often the only options for a bank can be a sale to a competitor or ceasing operations, both of which can harm the bank's local community. Even the management of information technology can pose significant risks if a bank fails to devote sufficient resources to maintaining and updating systems, or if a bank fails to appropriately integrate and update legacy systems, such as after a bank acquisition or merger.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240202a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2">2</a></p>
<p>For regulators, the cure for complacency is consistent attention even to dormant risks, and an appropriately robust response when issues are identified. Complacency is not always the product of inattention but can also arise because of mis-prioritization, such as when regulators focus on risks that are tangential to statutory mandates and critical areas of responsibility. This kind of misprioritization can increase the risk that regulators overlook areas that require more immediate attention.</p>
<p>Sometimes, familiar risks emerge in new ways. Having a concentrated, monoline business model and experiencing rapid growth are both well-known risks to ongoing viability, even though the particulars may vary over time. During the banking stress in 2023, several banks that experienced particularly acute stress had concentrated exposures or monoline business models, for example, with a heavy exposure to customers in the crypto-asset industry.</p>
<p>The cyclical nature of regulatory issues itself presents a challenge for regulators. Over time, examiner attrition and retirements that come along with an aging workforce erode institutional knowledge, expertise, and experience, making it more difficult to maintain an appropriate focus on longstanding risks.</p>
<p>As we look to the future of banking, we should consider the dynamic nature of the banking system and know that we must be assertive in identifying known and emerging risks, and nimble in responding to them, keeping in mind that risks that appear to be extinct may only be hibernating.</p>
<p><strong>Banking Changes Bring New Risks</strong><br />Of course, even with a relentless focus on the known risks that affect the banking system&mdash;credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, cyber risk, and others&mdash;we also know that as the banking system evolves, the risks evolve as well. Even though change in the banking system is constant, many banking services have stayed relatively similar over time. The use of paper checks, while helpful to consumers in many ways, have re-emerged as a source of increased fraud risk. The advent of the automated teller machine (ATM) and electronic banking opened up new avenues for banks to bring convenience and access to their customers, but also gave criminals new opportunities to attack the banking infrastructure. Even the legal and regulatory changes that allowed interstate banking to flourish fundamentally altered the composition of the banking sector, bringing both greater efficiencies of scale as banks took advantage of opportunities to consolidate, but also putting pressure on some banking models&mdash;and perhaps perversely resulting in less availability of local banking options in some geographic and socioeconomic areas.</p>
<p>Of course, recent changes provide consumers with enhanced options for services, including improvements to the U.S. payment system. Recent enhancements in real-time payments services have made them more widely available. But with this growth comes additional risk, including limitations on the ability to detect and prevent fraud. Banks also increasingly rely on important relationships with third parties, including service providers and partners who provide services to customers through "banking-as-a-service" arrangements. As third-party relationships continue to play an increasingly critical role in the banking system, they present another new avenue for risks that must be managed.</p>
<p>Emerging risks often arise in the context of a new mindset we see among some bank directors and management. This mindset is often associated with the culture of technology companies&mdash;a "move fast and break things" philosophy that can be incompatible with prudent banking practices. Prudent banking, in contrast with a start-up culture, requires a cautious approach to new business models, a recognition of and respect for operating in a regulated industry, and an appropriate degree of expertise and oversight. Merging these philosophies&mdash;the need to innovate in an increasingly competitive banking industry, and the need to have management and board oversight that is appropriate in the highly regulated banking system&mdash;can be difficult but is critical for long-term success. Having appropriate expertise to engage in new activities within a bank can be particularly challenging with the seemingly constant advent of new technologies, like artificial intelligence, that have the potential to transform banking. While innovation in banking is important, banks may have difficulty attracting relevant expertise. But with the potential of new technologies comes grave responsibilities to ensure that they are well understood, well-managed, and used appropriately when they are introduced in a banking environment. The banking system is not an unregulated petri dish.</p>
<p>Regulators play a vital role in making sure the banking system is safe and sound in light of these evolving risks. At a threshold matter, regulators must consider the many tradeoffs involved in how to support banks in their quest to be agile in offering new services and responding to new and evolving risks, and in how to appropriately identify, supervise, and regulate these risks. In my view, one of the most important roles of regulators in the face of changes to the banking system is to support responsible innovation as banks provide credit to their communities and customers.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240202a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3">3</a>&nbsp;In doing so, they must provide clear guidance to regulated institutions to help facilitate effective risk management, and support safety and soundness. The "start-up" mindset can be a particular challenge for regulators, as the communication of traditional supervisory messages may not resonate when delivered to directors and bank management that are not accustomed to interacting with examiners, or who are unfamiliar with operating a business in a regulated industry. In these situations, regulators must communicate clearly to ensure bank leadership understands and recognizes that safety and soundness must always be a key priority. The approach of asking forgiveness instead of permission is not compatible with the banking system.</p>
<p>Neither regulators nor banks have the ability to predict the future, and yet as we look back on large structural shifts in the banking system, many of these longer-term trends were foreseeable. As we consider these ongoing evolutions in terms of both risks and opportunities, we must remember the fundamental role of banks in providing credit to consumers and businesses, including small- and medium-sized businesses.</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory Dynamics and the Regulatory Perimeter</strong><br />Earlier this year, I shared three resolutions that will guide my approach to regulation in the coming year, and beyond:</p>
<ol>
<li>prioritize safety and soundness in the execution of our regulatory responsibilities when it comes to both enacting regulation and conducting supervisory examinations,</li>
<li>renewing our commitment to tailoring, and</li>
<li>increasing transparency in supervisory expectations.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240202a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4">4</a></li>
</ol>
<p>I continue to believe that adherence to these principles will help buttress the safety and soundness of banks.</p>
<p>In some ways, these priorities focus on the "how" of regulation and supervision&mdash;how we engage in prioritization of supervision, how we make policy decisions, and how we engage with regulated institutions and the public. Of course, another equally important consideration&mdash;relevant for regulators and those who run banks&mdash;is the "why," which goals and objectives should be kept in mind in the execution of these responsibilities. An awareness of the impacts of regulation and supervision&mdash;the intended and unintended consequences of changes to the bank regulatory framework&mdash;must underpin the regulatory process.</p>
<p>Policymakers often acknowledge that the diversity of banks&mdash;with a wide range of sizes, locations, and activities&mdash;contributes to the strength of the banking system. As I have noted in the past, research supports this perspective.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240202a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5">5</a>&nbsp;Banking reforms that result in over-regulation, or excessive compliance burdens that are disproportionate to risk, can threaten the banking system, and by extension, the U.S. economy. The cyclical nature of risks&mdash;and the perception that fundamental transformation of the regulatory framework is the only cure&mdash;can often contribute to instability in the regulatory approach and in the financial system. Targeted changes&mdash;changes that ensure&nbsp;<em>ongoing&nbsp;</em>attention to long-recognized risks and nimbleness to deal with emerging risks&mdash;can often be more efficient and effective in addressing the concerns on a permanent basis. I do not envy bankers that have to deal with regulatory whiplash. Establishing a consistent framework to deal with regulatory risks, a framework that is broadly supported through consensus and analysis, is often a better and more permanent solution to enhance safety and soundness than more pronounced swings of the regulatory pendulum.</p>
<p>As the role of banks continues to evolve, we must continue to ask difficult questions about the functioning of the regulatory framework, and whether it requires adjustments: How do we define a "community bank" for purposes of tailoring regulations to risks? What are the implications of regulatory cliff effects, like those around regulatory capital thresholds under the Basel III endgame and long-term debt proposals, where there is a new, stark line at $100 billion in assets? Will regulatory proposals effectively impact the viability of certain institutions, particularly those clustered around regulatory thresholds? What would the loss of these smaller institutions mean for credit availability and pricing? In all of these policy decisions, banks must not be passive observers. They must ensure the that regulators and policymakers recognize and understand their important role and the impacts of considered changes to ensure their viability in the future.</p>
<p>Of course, while we often think of the banking system as being defined by a "regulatory perimeter"&mdash;a line that distinguishes institutions that are subject to direct oversight from those that are not&mdash;this line in some ways blinds us from some of the important and unintended consequences we must consider in shaping the regulatory framework. Banks are an integral part of the larger financial system, and financial risks, including financial stability risks, are not unique to banks. For example, we know that the cost of capital influences not only the pricing of financial services offered by banks, but&nbsp;<em>where</em>&nbsp;activities occur, either within the regulatory perimeter or in nonbank entities and the shadow-banking system. I worry about the migration of risks across this line and what it means for the stability of the U.S. financial system. But I am particularly concerned about intentional regulatory actions that actually&nbsp;<em>push</em>&nbsp;activity to the nonbank financial system. In my view, this structural dynamic&mdash;where activities occur and how those choices are influenced by regulation&mdash;is one that banks themselves must be concerned with, as over the long-term, it will affect every decision they make about the products and services they offer.</p>
<p>While regulatory choices can affect the scope of the regulatory perimeter, these choices can also help to mitigate the flow of risk between the permeable boundary separating regulated banks and other companies. Regulators often address risks in the financial system by focusing on regulated banks, promoting up-front due diligence of bank partners, monitoring the risks of these relationships, and placing accountability for issues that arise on the banks themselves. A potentially underused tool that could be used to address these risks is oversight of third-party service providers under the authority granted to banking regulators under the Bank Service Company Act. Better aligning supervisory attention with the source of risk in this way could be a more efficient mechanism to address risks on the borders of the regulatory perimeter.</p>
<p><strong>Closing</strong><br />In closing, thank you again to the Southwestern Graduate School of Banking for the invitation to discuss my thoughts about the future of banking. Bank management and directors face significant challenges in preparing for an unpredictable future, a future that will be impacted by emerging risks, new business opportunities, regulatory actions, and many other factors beyond a bank's immediate control. While the factors I have highlighted do not&mdash;and could not possibly&mdash;provide a roadmap to the future, they do provide a different way of thinking about the long-term challenges and opportunities in the banking industry, a perspective that may be helpful for bank directors, bankers&mdash;and even for regulators.</p>

<div> SEC, fraud charges, crypto trading course, settlement, hedge fund
Summary:
The SEC charged Brian Sewell and Rockwell Capital Management with fraud for deceiving students into investing $1.2 million in a nonexistent hedge fund using advanced technologies. Sewell falsely promised AI-guided investment strategies and stole the funds in bitcoin when his digital wallet was hacked. The defendants settled, with Rockwell Capital Management paying $1,602,089 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and Sewell agreeing to a civil penalty of $223,229. The settlement is pending court approval. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Brian Sewell and his company, Rockwell Capital Management, agreed to settle fraud charges in connection with a scheme that targeted students taking Sewell&rsquo;s online crypto trading course known as the American Bitcoin Academy. The SEC alleges that the fraudulent scheme cost 15 students $1.2 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, from at least early 2018 to mid-2019, Sewell encouraged hundreds of his online students to invest in the Rockwell Fund, a hedge fund that he claimed he would launch, and which would use cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence and trading strategies involving crypto assets to generate returns for investors. The complaint alleges that Sewell, who resided in Hurricane, Utah, before relocating to Puerto Rico, received approximately $1.2 million from 15 students but never launched the fund nor executed the trading strategies he advertised to investors, instead holding on to the invested money in bitcoin. The complaint further alleges that the bitcoin was eventually stolen when Sewell&rsquo;s digital wallet was hacked and looted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We allege that Sewell defrauded students in his online American Bitcoin Academy of over a million dollars through a series of lies about investment opportunities in his purported crypto hedge fund. Among other things, he falsely claimed that his investment strategies would be guided by his own &lsquo;artificial intelligence&rsquo; and &lsquo;machine learning&rsquo; technology which, like the fund itself, never existed,&rdquo; said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;Whether it&rsquo;s AI, crypto, DeFi or some other buzzword, the SEC will continue to hold accountable those who claim to use attention-grabbing technologies to attract and defraud investors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, charges the defendants with violating antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The defendants have agreed to settle the charges. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants have consented to injunctive relief. Defendant Rockwell Capital Management also agreed to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling $1,602,089 and Defendant Sewell agreed to a civil penalty of $223,229. The settlement is subject to court approval.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SEC's investigation was conducted by Matthew S. Raalf and Jacquelyn D. King with assistance from Gregory Bockin and Karen M. Klotz, all of the Philadelphia Regional Office. It was supervised by Assunta Vivolo, Scott A. Thompson, and Nicholas P. Grippo.</p>
<p>The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-alerts/investor-13">cautions investors&nbsp;to check the background</a>&nbsp;of anyone selling them an investment and to always independently research investment opportunities and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-alerts/artificial-intelligence-fraud">has issued Investor Alerts on&nbsp;investment frauds touting new technologies</a>.&nbsp; Additional information is available on Investor.gov and SEC.gov.</p>

<div> fraud, crypto assets, securities, Ponzi scheme, receivership
Summary: 
The B.C. Securities Commission alleges that three now-dissolved companies and their director defrauded customers through a crypto asset trading platform. The platform made false claims about security and responsiveness, misappropriated customer assets, and operated as a Ponzi scheme. Eventually, the entities entered receivership, owing customers millions of dollars. The director, a former investment advisor, authorized the alleged fraud. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>The B.C. Securities Commission (BCSC)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/enforcement/administrative-enforcement/notices-of-hearing-and-temporary-orders/2024/michael-ongun-gokturk-einstein-capital-partners-ltd-einstein-exchange-inc-and-einstein-law-corporation-notice-of-hearing" target="_blank">is alleging</a>&nbsp;fraud by three now-dissolved companies and their sole director, related to their operation of a purported crypto asset trading platform.</p>
<p>The BCSC alleges that the Einstein Exchange&rsquo;s controlling entities &ndash; Einstein Exchange Inc., Einstein Capital Ltd. and Einstein Law Corporation (which was not a law firm) &ndash; and their sole director, Michael Ongun Gokturk, induced customers to make deposits into the platform by claiming that:</p>
<ul>
<li>It provided safe and secure storage for their money and crypto assets</li>
<li>Customers could withdraw funds same-day to their bank</li>
<li>Crypto addresses, called &ldquo;wallets,&rdquo; were encrypted and most assets were stored offline in &ldquo;cold storage,&rdquo; and</li>
<li>It provided an unparalleled combination of secure and responsive currency management.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The BCSC alleges that all of the claims were false, in several respects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gokturk and the Einstein entities transferred customer assets into various bank accounts of theirs and Gokturk&rsquo;s personal wallets on other unrelated platforms. Gokturk and the Einstein entities used those assets for speculative investments, to fund the platform&rsquo;s operations and to pay out customer withdrawals</li>
<li>Because of that misappropriation, many customers could not withdraw their funds same-day, or at all, to their bank</li>
<li>The platform did not retain custody of most of its customers&rsquo; assets, and</li>
<li>The platform did not provide currency management that was secure or responsive.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After becoming insolvent in January 2018, Gokturk and the Einstein entities operated the platform as a Ponzi scheme by continuing to accept deposits and paying out some customers with money and crypto assets drawn from the pooled bank accounts and wallets. They purported to act as a counterparty to customer trades but failed to acquire corresponding assets to fulfil the transactions, and populated customer dashboards with information that falsely suggested the orders had been processed and assets were available. They also entered into separate contracts with large investors to trade crypto assets in bulk using customer money and crypto assets.</p>
<p>At its peak in January 2018, Gokturk and the Einstein entities held more than $US34 million in money and crypto assets on behalf of customers. About 18 months later, they owed customers money and crypto assets with a total value of about $US19.2 million, but held assets valued at only about US$100,000, resulting in a loss to customers of $US19.1 million.</p>
<p>In November 2019, Gokturk and the Einstein entities entered receivership as a result of a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/about/media-room/news-releases/2019/68-bcsc-acts-to-protect-customers-of-einstein-exchange-cryptoasset-trading-platform">BCSC request</a>&nbsp;to the Supreme Court of British Columbia. The agreements between the platform and its customers were futures contracts, which were securities under the&nbsp;<em>Securities Act</em>&nbsp;during the period of alleged misconduct.</p>
<p>Gokturk, who was a B.C. resident during the relevant period, had been registered as an investment advisor from 2002 to 2003 and as a salesperson from 2003 to 2006. He was the directing mind of the Einstein entities, and as such, authorized, permitted and/or acquiesced in the alleged fraud.</p>
<p>The BCSC&rsquo;s allegations have not been proven. The Commission requires Gokturk and the Einstein entities, or their counsel, to appear at the BCSC&rsquo;s offices on May 14, 2024 if they wish to be heard before a hearing is scheduled.</p>

<title>ACER Publishes Its Report On The Gas Transmission Tariffs For Portugal</title>

<div> ACER, report, gas transmission tariffs, Portugal, reference price methodology <br />
Summary:<br />
- ACER concludes ERSE's proposed RPM is suitable for the Portuguese transmission network<br />
- RPM may result in cross-subsidies between users of different networks<br />
- The proposed RPM partially limits cross-subsidization<br />
- ACER recommends adjusting the methodology to prevent regional network costs from being allocated to the transmission network<br />
- ERSE to make a decision on the methodology by May 4, 2024. <br /> <div>
<p>ACER publishes today its report on the proposed gas transmission tariffs for Portugal. This report assesses the reference price methodology proposed by the Portuguese national regulatory authority, ERSE, and provides a recommendation for its motivated decision on the final methodology to be applied.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What does ACER say?</span></p>
<p>ACER concludes that ERSE&rsquo;s proposed reference price methodology (RPM) is appropriate for the Portuguese transmission network but finds one issue to address.</p>
<p>The costs allocated using the RPM also take into account regional networks as opposed to just the Portuguese national transmission network. The use of a single methodology allocating the costs of both networks can potentially result in cross-subsidies between the users of both types of infrastructure (i.e. users of the transmission network may bear the costs of regional networks).</p>
<p>While the proposed RPM partially limits cross-subsidisation between the transmission network and the regional networks, it does not completely prevent this. ACER recommends that the methodology is adjusted so that the costs of regional networks are not allocated to the transmission network.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the next steps?</span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>ERSE should take a motivated decision by 4 May 2024 on the methodology to set the tariffs for the coming regulatory period (from 2024 to 2027).</p>

<div> fine, Hamburger Hafen und Logistik Aktiengesellschaft, financial reports, Securities Trading Act, BaFin<br />
Summary:<br />
On 22 January 2024, BaFin imposed a 200,000 euro fine on Hamburger Hafen und Logistik Aktiengesellschaft for failing to announce the availability of their annual and half-yearly financial reports. Companies must disclose this information to aid investors in making informed decisions. Failure to comply with this obligation can result in significant fines. <div>
<div class="abstract">
<p>On 22 January 2024, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (<abbr lang="de" title="Bundesanstalt f&uuml;r Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht" xml:lang="de">BaFin</abbr>) imposed an administrative fine amounting to 200,000 euros on&nbsp;<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hamburger Hafen und Logistik Aktiengesellschaft</span>. The fine was imposed because the company had contravened obligations under the German Securities Trading Act (Wertpapierhandelsgesetz &ndash;&nbsp;<abbr title="Gesetz &uuml;ber den Wertpapierhandel">WpHG</abbr>).</p>
</div>
<div class="wrapBodytext">
<p>The company failed to publish an announcement stating the date from which and the website on which the annual financial report for the financial year 2021 and the half-yearly financial report for the financial year 2022 were made publicly available.</p>
<p>Annual financial reports and half-yearly financial reports are available in the Company Register. However, companies must provide information about when and where their financial reports are published in addition to this.</p>
<p>An appeal may be lodged against the administrative fine order.</p>
<h3>Background information:</h3>
<p>Financial reports provide information on companies&rsquo; assets, financial position and results of operations. This information is important to investors because it allows them to make informed investment decisions.</p>
<p>Companies such as Hamburger Hafen und Logistik Aktiengesellschaft that are domiciled in Germany and issue securities that are traded on an organised market in Germany must publish an announcement about the date from which and the website where their annual financial reports and half-yearly financial reports are made publicly available, in addition to their availability in the company register. Such announcements must be published no later than four months after the end of each reporting period and before the annual financial report; for half-yearly financial reports, the announcement must be published no later than three months after the end of each reporting period and before the half-yearly financial report.</p>
<p>Failure on the part of a company to publish financial reports and the corresponding announcements, or failure to do so within the prescribed period, constitutes a contravention of the Securities Trading Act.&nbsp;<abbr lang="de" title="Bundesanstalt f&uuml;r Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht" xml:lang="de">BaFin</abbr>&nbsp;may in each case impose administrative fines on companies that fail to comply with this obligation. The maximum amount for this fine is 10 million euros or up to 5% of total revenue..</p>

<p>&ldquo;Investors who cannot afford private counsel are significantly disadvantaged in arbitration or litigation with their financial professionals,&rdquo; said SEC Ombuds Stacy Puente. &ldquo;The clinics help level that playing field, advocating for the personal interests of these investors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The program will address the impact of the students&rsquo; legal work on their clients, their law schools, their communities, and on the students themselves. Students will also participate in panel discussions with SEC staff about investor outreach, and the role of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in their clinic work. The Summit&rsquo;s co-hosts, the SEC&rsquo;s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy (OIEA) and Office of Minority and Women Inclusion (OMWI), will have staff available at the event to discuss the SEC&rsquo;s investor resources and career paths at the agency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through its outreach efforts and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investor.gov/">Investor.gov</a>, the Office of Investor Education and Advocacy provides tools and information to help investors make better informed investment decisions and avoid fraud,&rdquo; said Lori Schock, OIEA Director. &ldquo;Investor advocacy clinics and law students&nbsp;can play a vital role in helping us promote these important resources.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;OMWI is eager to engage with law students from across the country and spark transformative conversations aimed to broaden their work as student attorneys through a diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility lens,&rdquo; said Allison Wise, Acting Director of OMWI.</p>
<p>The Summit will feature remarks from the SEC Chair, SEC Commissioners, Division Directors, the Investor Advocate, and the Director of FINRA Dispute Resolution Services. Keynote remarks will be delivered by Nicole Iannarone, Chair of FINRA&rsquo;s National Arbitration and Mediation Committee and Professor of the Drexel University Kline School of Law.</p>
<p>Participating law school clinics include Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, Cornell University Law School, Fordham University School of Law, Howard University School of Law, Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law, Elizabeth Haub School of Law at Pace University, St. John&rsquo;s University School of Law, Seton Hall University School of Law, University of Miami School of Law, and the University of Pittsburgh School of Law.</p>

<div> aggregator, distribution, model portfolios, tokenized, wealth management
<br />
Tokenbridge introduces new features to simplify and modernize the model portfolio ecosystem. The platform improves connectivity between tokenized and un-tokenized funds, reduces cost and complexity for institutions and distributors, allows for constant portfolio evaluation, and offers investors greater flexibility and hyper-personalization in their portfolios.
<br /><br />Summary:
Tokenbridge's new features streamline the model portfolio ecosystem, connecting tokenized and un-tokenized funds, reducing cost and complexity, allowing for constant portfolio evaluation, and offering investors greater flexibility and hyper-personalization. <div>
<ul>
<li><b>New Tokenbridge platform simplifies issuance, distribution and rebalancing of model portfolios</b></li>
<li><b>More efficient processes significantly reduce cost and friction between participants</b></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tokenbridge, a token aggregator and distribution platform streamlining the wealth and fund management ecosystem, today announces the introduction of new features to support the construction, distribution and evaluation of tokenized model portfolios.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11px;">The new functionality is designed to modernize and simplify the model portfolio ecosystem by improving connectivity between tokenized and un-tokenized funds and securities, enabling greater automation. For institutions and distributors, Tokenbridge&rsquo;s model portfolio token design significantly reduces the volume, complexity and cost of processes through several key features:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Greater connectivity with model portfolio providers:&nbsp;</b>providers of model portfolios are able to issue smart contracts via the blockchain that dynamically manage the rules and characteristics of their models enabling wealth managers and advisers to far better match suitable model portfolios to their clients&rsquo; desired investment outcomes.</li>
<li><b>Greater connectivity between distributors and clients:&nbsp;</b>distributors can execute their chosen model portfolio smart contract, creating a &lsquo;personalized&rsquo; token on behalf of clients.</li>
<li><b>Constant portfolio evaluation:&nbsp;</b>Tokenbridge&rsquo;s infrastructure allows for the evaluation of the client&rsquo;s portfolio against the selected model by comparing the issuer&rsquo;s smart contract with the fund tokens (and untokenized units) in the consumer&rsquo;s portfolio, so that rebalancing of the underlying (for example, for drift) is instantly reflected in the client&rsquo;s portfolio.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For investors, tokenized model portfolio functionality offers greater flexibility to choose or switch model portfolios and paves the way for &lsquo;hyper-personalization&rsquo;, ensuring that their portfolios accurately reflect their investment preferences in both the tokenized and TradFi (untokenized underlying funds and securities) ecosystems. This is achieved by automating the acquisition of fund tokens (and untokenized units) to match the composition of their desired, customized model portfolio.</p>
<p><b>Stephen Ashurst, CEO of Tokenbridge, said:&nbsp;</b>&ldquo;The fund ecosystem is ripe for modernization. Model portfolios are hugely popular and growing fast globally and for good reason as they provide investors with access to sophisticated diversified portfolios underlying constructed by experts. The historic complexity and expense of connecting such a broad ecosystem &ndash; from fund managers to model providers to distributors and investors &ndash; is vastly simplified with the intelligent use of fund tokens and smart contracts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tokenbridge&rsquo;s model portfolio infrastructure is designed to facilitate this change &ndash; giving broader access and a simpler, more effective and more personalized experience to the next generation of investors. As tokenization gathers pace, for wealth managers and advisors, our technology means that client portfolios can be easily linked to popular retail models and any changes to those models will be instantly reflected in the client&rsquo;s portfolios. A tokenized funds ecosystem represents a natural next step for the industry, vastly improving current processes, benefiting participants across the ecosystem, and aligning with regulators concerned about access to advice and investor outcomes. Our model portfolio token design ensures that TradFi assets are also connected to the distributed ledger world, offering advisers and their clients the best cost advantages of today with their brand-name favourites&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This announcement follows Tokenbridge's full platform launch in late 2023, as well as the addition of several senior advisors to its advisory board.</p>

<li><b>Establishing 2024 Adjusted Operating Expense Guidance<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;of $798 to $808 million, reflecting continued investment to drive long-term revenue and earnings growth.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cboe Global Markets,&nbsp;Inc. (Cboe: CBOE) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter of 2023 and full year.</p>
<p>"I am pleased to report that Cboe generated another year of strong revenue growth and financial results in 2023," said Fredric Tomczyk, Cboe Global Markets Chief Executive Officer. "Our Derivatives and Data and Access Solutions categories helped drive the 10% net revenue growth and 13% adjusted diluted EPS growth for the year as both strong secular and cyclical trends helped boost these business lines. In addition, we made meaningful progress on our strategic initiatives as a company and are well-positioned for 2024. This year we plan to unlock additional value from our global derivatives and securities network by leveraging our core strengths &ndash; our global footprint, superior technology and product innovation &ndash; to help drive continued strong revenue growth and financial results."</p>
<p>"In the fourth quarter, Cboe generated record net revenues and strong earnings results to finish a remarkable year," said Jill Griebenow, Cboe Global Markets Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer. "Derivative trends were strong throughout 2023 with net revenues growing 21% for the full year. Data and Access Solutions delivered solid growth with net revenue up 9% in 2023, while Cash and Spot Markets declined given a challenging volume backdrop for global cash equity markets. Following our record year of revenue generation, we anticipate organic total net revenue growth<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;will average 5-7% in 2024, in line with our medium-term guidance range. We anticipate Data and Access Solutions organic net revenue growth<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>will average an attractive 7-10%, in line with our medium-term expectations. We look to balance solid revenue growth expectations with disciplined expense management, targeting expense growth in the 6-8% range for the year. 2024 is off to a strong start, and we look forward to delivering on our objectives to drive durable returns for shareholders in the year ahead."</p>

<li>Total revenues less cost of revenues (referred to as "net revenue") of $499.0 million increased 9 percent, compared to $457.1 million in the prior-year period, reflecting increases in derivatives markets and data and access solutions net revenue, partially offset by a decrease in cash and spot markets net revenue.</li>
<li>Total operating expenses were $205.0 million versus $206.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, a decrease of $1.6 million. Adjusted operating expenses<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;of $191.7 million increased 9 percent compared to $176.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. This increase was primarily due to higher compensation and benefits and technology support services, partially offset by a decline in other expenses, depreciation and amortization, and professional fees and outside services.</li>
<li>The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 26.3 percent as compared with 32.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022. The lower effective tax rate in 2023 is primarily due to the impact the Cboe Digital goodwill impairment had on the effective tax rate in 2022.

<p><b>Discussion of Results by Business Segment<sup>1</sup>:</b></p>
<p class="prntal"><b>Options:</b></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Options net revenue of $314.5 million was up $41.3 million, or 15 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2022. Net transaction and clearing fees<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;increased primarily as a result of a 24 percent increase in index options trading volumes versus the fourth quarter of 2022. Access and capacity fees were 6 percent higher than fourth quarter 2022.</li>
<li>Net transaction and clearing fees<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;increased $51.7 million, or 23 percent, reflecting a 2 percent increase in total options average daily volume ("ADV") and a 20 percent increase in total options RPC compared to the fourth quarter 2022. The increase in total options RPC was due to a mix shift, with index options representing a higher percentage of total options volume.</li>
<li>Cboe's Options exchanges had total market share of 33.5 percent for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to 34.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022.</li>
</ul>
<p class="prntal"><b>North American (N.A.) Equities:</b></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>N.A. Equities net revenue of $86.3 million decreased $10.1 million, or 10 percent versus the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting lower net transaction and clearing fees<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;and industry market data.</li>
<li>Net transaction and clearing fees<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;decreased by $9.9 million, or 30 percent, compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease was driven by a lower on-exchange U.S. Equities net capture rate as unfavorable client mix shift pushed more activity to higher volume tiers. The decrease was partially offset by a stronger U.S. off-exchange net capture rate and increased market share in Canadian Equities.</li>
<li>Cboe's U.S. Equities exchanges had market share of 13.0 percent for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to 13.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022. Cboe's U.S. Equities off-exchange market share was 20.6 percent versus 21.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022. Canadian Equities market share rose to 15.3 percent as compared to 13.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022 due to greater adoption by existing clients and new client growth.</li>
</ul>
<p class="prntal"><b>Europe and Asia Pacific (APAC):</b></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Europe and APAC net revenue of $48.0 million increased by 9 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting double-digit non-transaction revenue growth led by higher market data fees, access and capacity fees, and other revenue. On a constant currency basis<sup>2</sup>, net revenues were $46.1 million, up 4 percent on a year-over-year basis. European Equities average daily notional value ("ADNV") traded on Cboe European Equities was &euro;9.0 billion, down 10 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 given a 6 percent decline in industry market volumes and lower market share.</li>
<li>For the fourth quarter of 2023, Cboe European Equities had 23.9 percent market share, down from 24.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022 given higher closing auction activity at listing venues. Cboe Australia had 20.3 percent market share for the fourth quarter of 2023, up from 17.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022. Cboe Japan grew market share to 4.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2023 from 2.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022. Cboe European Equities net capture rate increased 4 percent and Cboe Australia net capture increased 11 percent when compared to the fourth quarter of 2022.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="prntal"><b>Futures:</b></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Futures net revenue of $32.4 million increased $5.6 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 due to double-digit increases in net transaction and clearing fees<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>and market data fees.</li>
<li>Net transaction and clearing fees<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;increased $4.9 million, reflecting a 21 percent increase in ADV during the quarter.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="prntal"><b>Global FX:</b></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Global FX net revenue of $18.9 million increased 12 percent, primarily due to higher net transaction and clearing fees<sup>2</sup>. ADNV traded on the Cboe FX platform was $47.0 billion for the quarter, up 15 percent compared to last year's fourth quarter, and net capture rate per one million dollars traded was $2.60 for the quarter, down 3 percent compared to $2.69 in the fourth quarter of 2022.</li>
<li>Cboe FX market share was 21.3 percent for the quarter compared to 18.4 percent in last year's fourth quarter, which set a quarterly record for Cboe FX. The record was driven by new client growth and increased adoption of our diverse set of FX order types and trading protocols.</li>

<p><b>2024 Fiscal Year Financial Guidance</b></p>
<p>Cboe provided guidance for the 2024 fiscal year as noted below.</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Organic total net revenue growth<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;is expected to be in the range of 5 to 7 percentage points in 2024, in line with medium-term organic total net revenue<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;guidance expectations of 5 to 7 percentage points.</li>
<li>Organic net revenue<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;from Data and Access Solutions is expected to increase by approximately 7 to 10 percentage points in 2024, in line with medium-term guidance expectations of 7 to 10 percentage points.</li>
<li>Adjusted operating expenses<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;in 2024 are expected to be in the range of $798 to $808 million. The guidance excludes the expected amortization of acquired intangible assets of $93 million; the company reflects the exclusion of this amount in its non-GAAP reconciliation.</li>
<li>Depreciation and amortization expense for 2024 is expected to be in the range of $43 to $47 million, excluding the expected amortization of acquired intangible assets.</li>
<li>Other income (expense) from minority investments is expected to contribute a $37 to $43 million benefit in 2024.</li>
<li>The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;for the full year 2024 is expected to be in the range of 28.5 to 30.5 percent. Significant changes in trading volume, expenses, tax laws or rates and other items could materially impact this expectation.</li>
<li>Capital expenditures for 2024 are expected to be in the range of $51 to $57 million.</li>

You can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as "may," "might," "should," "expect," "plan," "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "predict," "potential" or "continue," and the negative of these terms and other comparable terminology. All statements that reflect our expectations, assumptions or projections about the future other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements, which are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us, may include projections of our future financial performance based on our growth strategies and anticipated trends in our business. These statements are only predictions based on our current expectations and projections about future events.

<p>We operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible to predict all risks and uncertainties, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.</p>
<p>Some factors that could cause actual results to differ include: the loss of our right to exclusively list and trade certain index options and futures products; economic, political and market conditions; compliance with legal and regulatory obligations; price competition and consolidation in our industry; decreases in trading or clearing volumes, market data fees or a shift in the mix of products traded on our exchanges; legislative or regulatory changes or changes in tax regimes; our ability to protect our systems and communication networks from security vulnerabilities and breaches; our ability to attract and retain skilled management and other personnel, including compensation inflation; increasing competition by foreign and domestic entities; our dependence on and exposure to risk from third parties; global expansion of operations; factors that impact the quality and integrity of our indices; our ability to manage our growth and strategic acquisitions or alliances effectively; our ability to operate our business without violating the intellectual property rights of others and the costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights; our ability to minimize the risks, including our credit, counterparty investment, and default risks, associated with operating a European clearinghouse; our ability to accommodate trading and clearing volume and transaction traffic, including significant increases, without failure or degradation of performance of our systems; misconduct by those who use our markets or our products or for whom we clear transactions; challenges to our use of open source software code; our ability to meet our compliance obligations, including managing potential conflicts between our regulatory responsibilities and our for-profit status; our ability to maintain BIDS Trading as an independently managed and operated trading venue, separate from and not integrated with our registered national securities exchanges; damage to our reputation; the ability of our compliance and risk management methods to effectively monitor and manage our risks; restrictions imposed by our debt obligations and our ability to make payments on or refinance our debt obligations; our ability to maintain an investment grade credit rating; impairment of our goodwill, long-lived assets, investments or intangible assets; the impacts of pandemics; the accuracy of our estimates and expectations; litigation risks and other liabilities; and operating a digital asset business and clearinghouse, including the expected benefits of our Cboe Digital acquisition, cybercrime, changes in digital asset regulation, losses due to digital asset custody, and fluctuations in digital asset prices.

<p class="prntal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Non-GAAP Information</b></span></p>
<p>In addition to disclosing results determined in accordance with GAAP, Cboe Global Markets has disclosed certain non-GAAP measures of operating performance. These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP, and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The non-GAAP measures provided in this press release include net transaction and clearing fees, adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income, organic net revenue, inorganic net revenue, and adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income allocated to common stockholders and adjusted diluted earnings per share, effective tax rate on adjusted earnings, adjusted cash, net revenues in constant currency, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin.</p>
<p>Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release provide additional and comparative information to assess trends in our core operations and a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by management are provided as additional information to investors in order to provide them with an alternative method for assessing our financial condition and operating results.</p>
<p><i>Organic net revenue, inorganic net revenue, organic non-transaction revenue and organic net revenue guidance:</i>&nbsp;These are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude or have otherwise been adjusted for the impact of our acquisitions for the period or guidance, as applicable. Management believes the organic net revenue growth and guidance measures provide users with supplemental information regarding the company's ongoing and future potential revenue performances and trends by presenting revenue growth and guidance excluding the impact of the acquisitions. Revenues from acquisitions that have been owned for at least one year are considered organic and are no longer excluded from organic net revenue from either period for comparative purposes.</p>
<p><i>Amortization expense of acquired intangible assets:&nbsp;</i>We amortize intangible assets acquired in connection with various acquisitions. Amortization of intangible assets is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions. As such, if intangible asset amortization is included in performance measures, it is more difficult to assess the day-to-day operating performance of the businesses, the relative operating performance of the businesses between periods and the earnings power of the company. Therefore, we believe performance measures excluding intangible asset amortization expense provide investors with an additional basis for comparison across accounting periods.</p>
<p><i>Acquisition-related expenses:&nbsp;</i>From time to time, we have pursued acquisitions, which have resulted in expenses which would not otherwise have been incurred in the normal course of the company's business operations. These expenses include integration costs, as well as legal, due diligence, impairment charges, and other third-party transaction costs. The frequency and the amount of such expenses vary significantly based on the size, timing and complexity of the transaction. Accordingly, we exclude these costs for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures which provide an additional analysis of Cboe's ongoing operating performance or comparisons in Cboe's performance between periods.</p>
<p><b>The tables below show the reconciliation of each financial measure from GAAP to non-GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of those items detailed below and are referred to as adjusted financial measures.&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class="prntal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>EBITDA Reconciliations</b></span></p>
<p>EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) and Adjusted EBITDA are widely used non-GAAP financial measures of operating performance. EBITDA margin represents EBITDA divided by revenues less cost of revenues (net revenue). It is presented as supplemental information that the company believes is useful to investors to evaluate its results because it excludes certain items that are not directly related to the company's core operating performance. EBITDA is calculated by adding back to net income interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adding back to EBITDA acquisition-related expenses, gain on investment, loan forgiveness, investment establishment costs, impairment of goodwill, impairment of investment, and income from investment. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as substitutes either for net income, as an indicator of the company's operating performance, or for cash flow, as a measure of the company's liquidity. In addition, because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be calculated identically by all companies, the presentation here may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenue.</p>

<div> consultation paper, financial institutions, insurance policies, Basic Financial Planning Guide, protection needs <br />
<br />
The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is seeking feedback on proposals to reduce the amount of information collected by financial institutions for selected insurance policies based on the Basic Financial Planning Guide. The proposals aim to simplify the process for consumers, encourage cost-effective products, and set limits to protect consumers' interests. <br />
Summary: The MAS is seeking feedback on proposals to reduce information collection by financial institutions for specific insurance policies based on the Basic Financial Planning Guide. The aim is to simplify the process for consumers, encourage cost-effective products, and set limits to protect consumers' interests. <div>
<p><span>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) today published a consultation paper to seek feedback on proposals to reduce the amount of information collected by financial institutions from their clients for selected insurance policies, when recommendations are made based on the Basic Financial Planning Guide (Guide). The proposals will enable consumers to meet their protection needs more easily through the purchase of simple and cost-effective insurance policies.</span><br /><br /><span>2&nbsp;</span><span> </span><span>MAS and MoneySense, in collaboration with CPF Board and finance industry associations, launched the Guide in October 2023 to help Singaporeans take steps to enhance their financial well-being. The Guide outlines a few rules of thumb for individuals to start taking proactive steps to address their savings, insurance and investment needs. In particular, the Guide encourages Singaporeans to allocate up to 15% of their take-home pay on insurance protection. Consumers are also advised to obtain insurance coverage of 9 times&rsquo; their annual income for death and total permanent disability, and 4 times&rsquo; their annual income for critical illness. Six customised variations of the Guide were issued on 31 January 2024 to illustrate the financial planning needs of individuals at different life stages. More information on the Guide can be found on the&nbsp;</span><a class="mas-link" href="http://www.go.gov.sg/financialplanningguide" target="_blank"><span class="mas-link__text">MoneySense website</span>&nbsp;<span class="mas-icon mas-glyphs-external--link"></span></a><span>.</span><br /><br /><span>3&nbsp;</span><span> </span><span>MAS is now proposing to reduce the amount of information which financial institutions are required to collect from clients, when they make recommendations on term life insurance and standard critical illness policies that are based on the rules of thumb in the Guide. This will simplify the process for consumers, and encourage the offer of simple and cost-effective products to help consumers meet their protection needs, subject to the limits in the Guide.</span><br /><br /><span>4&nbsp;</span><span> </span><span>Mr Lim Tuang Lee, Assistant Managing Director (Capital Markets), MAS, said, &ldquo;The proposals seek to simplify the financial advisory process through which Singaporeans can obtain cost-effective insurance coverage. At the same time, the upper limits stipulated in the Basic Financial Planning Guide on insurance coverage and spending serve as safeguards to protect consumers&rsquo; interests.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>5&nbsp;</span><span> </span><span>For more details, please refer to the consultation paper&nbsp;</span><a class="mas-link" href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/publications/consultations/CMI/2024/cp-on-proposals-to-simplify-requirements-and-facilitate-access-to-insurance-products" target="_blank"><span class="mas-link__text">here</span>&nbsp;<span class="mas-icon mas-glyphs-external--link"></span></a><span>. MAS invites financial institutions, consumers, and other interested parties to submit their comments on the proposals by 15 March 2024.</span></p>

<title>SIFMA Statement On Introduction Of Resolution To Address SAB 121</title>

<div> SEC, SIFMA, SAB 121, digital assets, regulatory oversight
Summary:
SIFMA thanked Senator Lummis, Congressman Flood, and Representative Nickel for addressing the issues with SAB 121, which had been issued without stakeholder engagement and impacted bank capital and liquidity ratios by disincentivizing custodial services for digital assets. They emphasized the need for comprehensive and deliberate regulatory oversight. <div>
<p>SIFMA &nbsp;issued the following statement from president and CEO Kenneth E. Bentsen, Jr. regarding a&nbsp;<em>Congressional Review Act</em>&nbsp;resolution introduced today related to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121):</p>
<p>&ldquo;SIFMA thanks Senator Lummis, Congressman Flood and Representative Nickel for their efforts to address Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (&ldquo;SAB 121&rdquo;), which the SEC issued without stakeholder engagement or consultation with the prudential regulators to fundamentally change the way financial institutions are expected to account for the custody of digital assets. SAB 121&rsquo;s requirement for balance sheet recognition deviates from current accounting treatment for traditional assets held in custody, which are not required to be recorded on a firm&rsquo;s balance sheet. Because of its impact on bank capital and liquidity ratios, SAB 121 has disincentivized banks from providing custodial services for digital assets. We do not disagree with the need for&nbsp;regulatory oversight, but the process should be deliberate and comprehensive&nbsp;to avoid unintended knock-on effects. Banks are already subject to extensive prudential rules and oversight and have deep expertise in providing safe custody of a wide variety of assets. SIFMA has consistently supported congressional action to bring attention to this issue and restore the ability for banks to provide such services for their clients, and we thank Senator Lummis and Congressmen Flood and Nickel for their leadership today.&rdquo;</p>

<title>B.C. Securities Commission: Blockchain Company Commits Misrepresentation About Consultant Spending</title>

<p>The B.C. Securities Commission (BCSC)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/hearings/decisions/2024/blok-technologies-inc-and-james-joseph-hyland-findings" target="_blank">has found</a>&nbsp;that a Vancouver-based blockchain technology investment company made misrepresentations when it failed to disclose it had spent, or planned to spend, most of the proceeds from a private placement on consultants.</p>
<p>A panel found that BLOK Technologies Inc., previously known as Aida Minerals Corp., published a false or misleading news release which said the company had raised approximately $5.4 million, but did not disclose that nearly $4.4 million would go toward consulting fees. The company retained approximately $950,000 &ndash; less than 18 per cent of the amount raised.</p>
<p>The news release indicated that the proceeds of the private placement would be spent on advancing the company&rsquo;s blockchain investment projects, evaluating new blockchain opportunities and working capital. It also stated that the financing will take &ldquo;our company to the next level in the execution of its business model &hellip; and we look forward to advancing our worldwide investment projects with top-level strategic partners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Given these claims, the panel concluded that reasonable investors would not have expected that BLOK would retain less than 18 per cent of what it had raised to execute its business model and pay expenses.</p>
<p>The panel found that the company&rsquo;s failure to disclose this information to investors was misleading and a misrepresentation.</p>
<p>The panel dismissed allegations that BLOK&rsquo;s vice-president and director, James Joseph Hyland, authorized, permitted or acquiesced in BLOK&rsquo;s contravention and therefore committed the same offence. In making this determination, the panel concluded that the &ldquo;Executive Director has failed to establish that Hyland had actual knowledge of the consulting agreements when the June 8 news release was issued.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Last year BLOK&rsquo;s former CEO, Robert Earle Dawson and its former CFO, David Malcolm Alexander, were&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/about/media-room/news-releases/2023/47-ceo-and-cfo-suspended-from-investment-market-for-misrepresentation">prohibited</a>&nbsp;from participating in the investment market for their part in the misrepresentation. Alexander also paid $25,000 for his misconduct.</p>
<p>The company, which is in the process of being dissolved, used to trade on the Canadian Securities Exchange.</p>
<p>The panel will next consider what sanctions to impose, which could include monetary penalties or bans from market participation</p>

<title>New Investor Advocacy Coalition Calls On SEC, Congress To Fix RIA Forced Arbitration Problems - Formation Of Investor Advocacy Coalition Follows Increasing Complaints From Wronged Investors, Scathing SEC OIA Report That Found Rias In ‘Violation Of The Fiduciary Duty’; Groups Calling For Reforms To Industry-Favored Forced Arbitration Practices</title>

<div> SEC, Investor Advocacy Coalition, Forced Arbitration Clauses, RIA, Investment Fraud Victims
Summary:<br />Investor advocacy groups form coalition to reform SEC rules. Concerns include forced arbitration clauses used by RIAs, violation of fiduciary duty, and cost-prohibitive forum fees. Victims struggle to recover losses and face financial hurdles to arbitration. SEC urged to act or Congress to pass laws to protect investors. <div>
<p><span><span><span>A coalition of investor advocacy groups, including the Public Investors Advocate Bar Association (PIABA), the American Association for Justice (AAJ), Americans for Financial Reform (AFR), Better Markets, Consumer Federation of America (CFA), the National Association of Consumer Advocates (NACA), and Public Citizen, formally announced a new campaign aimed at reforming Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC) rules for registered investor advisers (RIA)&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=4tNED-2FM8iDZJQyQ53jATUWgRE384tHgp8wdcDkAUwQ8a9GKZkbzpUNBTssR2HpnsEnNT5kAR-2BjIMAWXUXNrl5Q-3D-3DirEW_dOZemr-2FgfCF7mCOtP6PwaQNIgduZQ7bQ177Ra6lERxzr1nz8fftCyEChkv6xi4cWEY6V4bZTsEJG7L17SaUrVefdJd-2FinBmqS0tKJl87e06dc6UzwbqbJJiaf2NBPSTnzR90fcndLCTi2fDQaXKxGxQgTJ9eiZBjR11D1te0zQpjmMkE9geXvFc1V9-2FVDilXQZX37F8Jx2quDCXcU1E6VF-2Be-2FXyG1OLmFixvHCLcJkcAk6R90MyAJGpncSwsA-2FKyCM6YSPkgbcUenqB46gCOLivwyK5-2FW-2ByZlSYae0Y4tV8PIfC072WfE600I98tmMsTlfWaepMo7QLBoGauAymv2zZ2JtPlZEL0-2BEhupOWRYPQ-3D" target="_blank"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>during a press conference</span></span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;held at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Speaking at the press event, PIABA President Joe Peiffer, said:&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;PIABA will continue to fight forced arbitration clauses inserted into investor contracts by unscrupulous RIAs. These fake fiduciaries use their boilerplate agreements to stack the deck against investors. It&rsquo;s time that either the SEC or Congress put an end to this nonsense.&rdquo;</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The formation of the investor advocacy coalition follows&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=4tNED-2FM8iDZJQyQ53jATUfzEOx6X3y4gRpsybVDazMtLWhMrMRVbU9QT4as-2BBrimbN1mAJmpo6QxS7JBcTTQxQ-3D-3D1_R-_dOZemr-2FgfCF7mCOtP6PwaQNIgduZQ7bQ177Ra6lERxzr1nz8fftCyEChkv6xi4cWEY6V4bZTsEJG7L17SaUrVefdJd-2FinBmqS0tKJl87e06dc6UzwbqbJJiaf2NBPSTnzR90fcndLCTi2fDQaXKxGxQgTJ9eiZBjR11D1te0zQpjmMkE9geXvFc1V9-2FVDilXQZX37F8Jx2quDCXcU1E6VEVRHYQUukkqe1dyClB1V-2B-2BAfPGB5YwzjReGOMd7UI2rQLkgttnOQFq1-2BvzSL34moWVg0GJKwxUJlNgMsaFNnk4IGAohbKdlCQEqHwbO3vRylUzSvfqeEVpiteIDsJNU-2FCqS0SG-2BGRf5FrmapW7h7-2FM-3D" target="_blank"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>a December report by the SEC&rsquo;s Office of the Investor Advocate (OIA)</span></span></span></a><span><span>, which found many RIA forced arbitration agreements may be in &ldquo;violation of the [advisers&rsquo;] fiduciary duty.&rdquo; The report also found that approximately 61% of SEC-registered advisers serving retail investor clients incorporated forced arbitration clauses into their investment advisory agreements. The OIA report echoed what PIABA previously had described as an &ldquo;untenable&rdquo; system for aggrieved investors who seek restitution for improper investment practices by their RIA, which can often dissuade wronged investors from seeking compensatory damages for losses they&rsquo;ve suffered.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Micah Hauptman, director of Investor Protection at the Consumer Federation of America, said: &ldquo;<strong>Advisers should not be able to use forced arbitration clauses to immunize themselves from accountability for their misconduct. If an adviser uses forced arbitrations in ways that effectively deny a client&rsquo;s ability to pursue justice and recover for losses they&rsquo;ve suffered, the adviser is placing their interests ahead of the client&rsquo;s, in violation of the adviser&rsquo;s fiduciary duty. No reasonable investor would consent to the use of such a clause.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Martha Perez-Pedemonti,&nbsp;civil justice &amp; consumer rights Counsel at&nbsp;Public Citizen, said:&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;This is an issue affecting a diverse group of investors, not just the wealthy investors. Middle-class investors, who&rsquo;ve worked their entire lives saving bit by bit so that one day they can finally retire, find themselves in an untenable situation where there is little to no recourse if they fall victim to fraud or mismanagement by their &lsquo;trusted&rsquo; investment advisors. We support those investors &ndash; and that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re calling on the SEC and Congress to fix this.&rdquo;</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;<strong>We agree with our colleagues that the use of forced arbitration directly conflicts with prohibitions on advisor self-dealing and self-serving misconduct that risks harm to investors,&rdquo;&nbsp;</strong>said<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Christine Hines, legislative director for the National Association of Consumer Advocates (NACA). &ldquo;<strong>The SEC must act or Congress must pass a law to ensure that arbitration is truly voluntary and chosen after the dispute arises, not tucked away in an obscure provision of the initial contract.&rdquo;</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Brady Williams, legal counsel at Better Markets, said:<strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;Better Markets and others believe that the financial services industry should simply not be allowed to force their clients into arbitration. But at a minimum, the SEC should have more information about the use of these clauses in the world of investment advisers, where the abuses appear to be most egregious.&rdquo;&nbsp;</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The concerns of the newly formed investor advocacy coalition strongly echo complaints made by investment fraud victims, represented by PIABA member attorneys, during a&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=4tNED-2FM8iDZJQyQ53jATUWgRE384tHgp8wdcDkAUwQ-2BtzJEucQAHN-2B90L0m23vhxXJcXuqLnyASXzd208YsqdA-3D-3Drkm7_dOZemr-2FgfCF7mCOtP6PwaQNIgduZQ7bQ177Ra6lERxzr1nz8fftCyEChkv6xi4cWEY6V4bZTsEJG7L17SaUrVefdJd-2FinBmqS0tKJl87e06dc6UzwbqbJJiaf2NBPSTnzR90fcndLCTi2fDQaXKxGxQgTJ9eiZBjR11D1te0zQpjmMkE9geXvFc1V9-2FVDilXQZX37F8Jx2quDCXcU1E6VP5mlGyN9efQRuyYYsvzP6ePu2RncH9L4XnTCf-2BN6JBh4YYJEW46weaoRGEHA8V2v64Wa-2FkZypFQMQJdGbQJyOZ-2F3isBkeb2uoqFhgOAPj-2BQiYW29tiuEeSNQXFsnCcCSJA85x2MvtOZplxY48HKW4o-3D" target="_blank"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>press conference held in July.</span></span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;The investor fraud victims described two primary issues that were confirmed in recent SEC report: fiduciary RIAs using arbitration provisions as a shield against liability; and RIAs failing to pay the awards issued against them.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Marykay Dragovich, the conservator for her cousin Rita Berardelli, described the process of forced arbitration after their trusted RIA lost over $228,000 in principal investments, money that Berardelli had saved as a registered nurse before suffering two life-altering brain aneurisms that left her incapacitated. When Dragovich investigated recovering the losses for her cousin, she learned it would cost up to $202,000 to pay the upfront costs of an arbitration hearing. So even if Berardelli got all her money back, she would have to pay as much as 90% of it to the arbitrators as prescribed by the overlooked forced arbitration clause in the agreement with her RIA.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A second investment fraud victim, Michael Phillips recounted what he described as a &ldquo;cruel lesson&rdquo; after he was awarded over $4 million in a FINRA arbitration dispute against an investment management firm but has yet to receive the funds. The investment management firm, Asia Pacific, instead of paying their owed restitution to Mr. Phillips, filed bankruptcy in bad faith to escape the financial responsibility of paying the award &ndash; a surprisingly legal evasion tactic that was also spelled out as one of the primary issues identified in the December SEC OIA report.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Unlike brokerage firms, which must designate FINRA as the arbitration forum, RIAs most commonly require clients to file arbitration claims with privately run dispute resolution forums such as the American Arbitration Association or JAMS, where arbitrators set their own fees &ndash; unlike the FINRA forum, where FINRA sets the arbitrators&rsquo; rates. According to arbitration attorneys, it is not uncommon for an AAA or JAMS arbitrator to charge $8,000 or more for a day&rsquo;s work. Total arbitration costs can easily exceed $64,000 for five days of hearings and three days of pre-hearing and post-hearing work. The costs can triple if there are three arbitrators hearing the dispute.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Under many RIA-investor agreements, the privately run forums require the expected fees to be deposited prior to the case proceeding. This means that an investor may have to deposit tens of thousands of dollars just to have their claim move forward. RIAs, knowing the forum fees are cost-prohibitive for most clients, use these types of forced arbitration clauses to shield themselves from liability for their misconduct.</span></span></p>

<div> indictment, money laundering, cryptocurrency, BTC-e, arrest
Summary:<br />Belarusian and Cypriot nationals indicted for operating BTC-e, a digital currency exchange involved in cybercrime and money laundering. Klimenka was arrested in Latvia and faces 25 years in prison if convicted. The National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team is leading the investigation and prosecution, collaborating with government agencies and the private sector to combat illicit use of cryptocurrencies. <div>
<p>An indictment was unsealed on Tuesday charging a Belarusian and Cypriot national with money laundering conspiracy and operation of an unlicensed money services business.</p>
<p>According to the indictment, between 2011 and July 2017, Aliaksandr Klimenka, 42, allegedly controlled BTC-e, a digital currency exchange, with Alexander Vinnik and others. Klimenka also allegedly controlled Soft-FX, a technology services company, and FX Open, a financial company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The indictment alleges BTC-e was a significant cybercrime and online money laundering entity that allowed its users to trade in bitcoin with high levels of anonymity and developed a customer base heavily reliant on criminal activity. BTC-e allegedly facilitated transactions for cybercriminals worldwide and received criminal proceeds from numerous computer intrusions and hacking incidents, ransomware scams, identity theft schemes, corrupt public officials, and narcotics distribution rings, and allegedly was used to facilitate crimes ranging from computer hacking to fraud, identity theft, tax refund fraud schemes, public corruption, and drug trafficking. BTC-e&rsquo;s servers, maintained in the United States, were allegedly one of the primary ways in which BTC-e and its operators effectuated their scheme. Those servers were allegedly leased to and maintained by Klimenka and Soft-FX.</p>
<p>Despite doing substantial business in the United States, BTC-e allegedly was not registered as a money services business with the U.S. Department of Treasury, had no anti-money laundering process, no system for appropriate &ldquo;know your customer&rdquo; or &ldquo;KYC&rdquo; verification, and no anti-money laundering program as required by federal law.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Klimenka was arrested in Latvia on Dec. 21, 2023, at the request of the United States and made his initial appearance in San Francisco yesterday. He is currently being held in custody.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If convicted, Klimenka faces a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri of the Justice Department&rsquo;s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Ismail J. Ramsey for the Northern District of California, Special Agent in Charge William Mancino of the U.S. Secret Service (USSS) Criminal Investigative Division, Assistant Director Michael D. Nordwall of the FBI&rsquo;s Criminal Investigative Division, Chief Jim Lee of IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS:CI), and Special Agent in Charge Tatum King of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) San Francisco made the announcement.</p>
<p>The USSS; FBI; IRS:CI Oakland Field Office and Cyber Crime Unit in Washington, D.C.; and HSI are investigating the case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trial Attorney C. Alden Pelker of the Criminal Division&rsquo;s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Claudia Quiroz for the Northern District of California, both members of the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET), and Assistant U.S. Attorney Katherine Lloyd-Lovett for the Northern District of California are prosecuting the case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Justice Department&rsquo;s Office of International Affairs worked with the Latvian government to secure the arrest of Klimenka.</p>
<p>The NCET was established to combat the growing illicit use of cryptocurrencies and digital assets. Within the Criminal Division&rsquo;s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, the NCET conducts and supports investigations into individuals and entities that are enabling the use of digital assets to commit and facilitate a variety of crimes, with a particular focus on virtual currency exchanges, mixing and tumbling services, and infrastructure providers. The NCET also works to set strategic priorities regarding digital asset technologies, identify areas for increased investigative and prosecutorial focus, and lead the department&rsquo;s efforts to collaborate with domestic and foreign government agencies as well as the private sector to aggressively investigate and prosecute crimes involving cryptocurrency and digital assets.</p>
<p><em>An indictment is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</em></p>

The EBA is consulting on draft RTS for determining if an instrument acts as a hedge under the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book.

<p><span>The EBA consults on draft technical standards on residual risk add-on hedges under the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book&nbsp;</span><br /><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today launched a public consultation on its draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on the conditions for determining whether an instrument attracting residual risk acts as a hedge. These RTS are part of the Phase 1 deliverables of the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-publishes-roadmap-implementation-eu-banking-package" title="The EBA publishes roadmap on the implementation of the EU Banking Package"><span>EBA roadmap on the implementation of the EU banking package in the area of market risk</span></a><span>. The consultation runs until 3 May 2024.</span></p>
<p>One of the pillars of the standardised approach (SA) under the new fundamental review of the trading book (FRTB) framework is the residual risk add-on (RRAO).</p>
<p>The Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR3) introduces a provision in the RRAO framework allowing the exemption from the RRAO charge for instruments bearing residual risks that are taken to hedge instruments bearing residual risks too. The CRR3 also includes a mandate for the EBA to develop RTS specifying when an instrument qualifies as a hedge for the purpose of the exemption and when not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The RTS proposed for consultation require institutions to identify whether the RRAO charge for which the institution seeks the exemption relates to a risk factor that is not shocked in the SbM (i.e. non-SbM risk factor), or if it is down to other reasons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the RRAO relates exclusively to a non-SbM risk factor, the RTS envisage conditions to verify that, as a result of the hedge, the sensitivity towards the non-SbM risk factor is significantly reduced.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, where the RRAO charge is due to other reasons than the presence of a non-SbM risk factor, the RTS allow the hedging instrument to be recognised as hedge, and as such, exempted from the RRAO charge, only if it completely offsets the RRAO risk stemming from the hedged instruments.</p>
<h4>Consultation process</h4>
<p>Comments to this consultation can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the "send your comments" button on the consultation page. Please note that the deadline for the submission of comments is 3 May 2024.</p>
<p>The public hearing on these draft RTS will take place via conference call on 6 March 2024 from 15.00 to 16.00 CET. The EBA invites interested stakeholders to register using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/public-hearing-rrao-hedge-under-frtb-rules" title="Public hearing on RRAO hedge under FRTB rules ">this link</a>&nbsp;by 4 March 2024 at 16:00 CET.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<p>The draft RTS on the FRTB have been developed according to Article 325(u)(6) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR), as amended by the CRR3, which mandates the EBA to specify criteria to identify positions attracting residual risk that act as a hedge.&nbsp;</p>

<p>CME Group, the world's leading derivatives marketplace, today announced it will launch E-mini S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight futures on&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">February 26</span>, pending regulatory review.</p>
<p>While the S&amp;P 500 Index weights companies based on market capitalization, the S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Index applies equal weight to all constituents in the index. The addition of these new E-mini contracts will give market participants another tool to deploy hedging and investment strategies across a broad range of potential market scenarios.</p>
<p>"The introduction of E-mini S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight futures will provide market participants with a new way to access equity market breadth," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Paul Woolman</span>, Global Head of Equity Products at CME Group. "As the S&amp;P 500 becomes more heavily concentrated towards larger companies, these new contracts can provide a liquid, cost-efficient tool to gain equal exposure to all names in the index, further allowing traders to diversify their equity trading strategies."</p>
<p>"For generations, the S&amp;P 500 has been widely regarded as the best single gauge of the U.S. equity market. To complement S&amp;P DJI's iconic market benchmark, the S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Index was launched in&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">January 2003</span>, measuring the performance of equal allocations among S&amp;P 500 constituents," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Bruce Schachne</span>, Chief Commercial Officer&nbsp;at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.

<div class="abstract">
<p>The Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (<abbr lang="de" title="Bundesanstalt f&uuml;r Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht" xml:lang="de">BaFin</abbr>) warns consumers about the services offered on the website coinmarkupp.com.

<h2>Monetary Policy Summary, February 2024</h2>
<p>The Bank of England&rsquo;s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. At its meeting ending on 31 January 2024, the MPC voted by a majority of 6&ndash;3 to maintain Bank Rate at 5.25%. Two members preferred to increase Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 5.5%. One member preferred to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 5%.</p>
<p>The Committee&rsquo;s updated projections for activity and inflation are set out in the accompanying February Monetary Policy Report. These are conditioned on a market-implied path for Bank Rate that declines from 5&frac14;% to around 3&frac14;% by the end of the forecast period, almost 1 percentage point lower on average than in the November Report.</p>
<p>Since the MPC&rsquo;s previous meeting, global GDP growth has remained subdued, although activity continues to be stronger in the United States. Inflationary pressures are abating across the euro area and United States. Wholesale energy prices have fallen significantly. Material risks remain from developments in the Middle East and from disruption to shipping through the Red Sea.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk157533109"></a>Following recent weakness, GDP growth is expected to pick up gradually during the forecast period, in large part reflecting a waning drag on the rate of growth from past increases in Bank Rate. Business surveys are consistent with an improving outlook for activity in the near term.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk157445313"></a>The labour market has continued to ease, but remains tight by historical standards. In the February Report projections, the continuing relative weakness of demand, despite subdued supply growth by historical standards, leads a margin of economic slack to emerge during the first half of the forecast period. Unemployment is expected to rise somewhat further.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk157533248"></a>Twelve-month CPI inflation fell to 4.0% in December 2023, below expectations in the November Report. This downside news has been broad-based,&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk157443762"></a>reflecting lower fuel, core goods and services price inflation. Although still elevated, wage growth has eased across a number of measures and is projected to decline further in coming quarters.</p>
<p>CPI inflation is projected to fall temporarily to the 2% target in 2024 Q2 before increasing again in Q3 and Q4. This profile of inflation over the second half of the year is&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk157533352"></a>accounted for by developments in the direct energy price contribution to 12-month inflation, which becomes less negative. In the MPC&rsquo;s latest most likely, or modal, projection conditioned on the lower market-implied path for Bank Rate, CPI inflation is around 2&frac34;% by the end of this year. It then remains above target over nearly all of the remainder of the forecast period. This reflects the persistence of domestic inflationary pressures, despite an increasing degree of slack in the economy. CPI inflation is projected to be 2.3% in two years&rsquo; time and 1.9% in three years.</p>
<p>The Committee judges that the risks around its modal CPI inflation projection are skewed to the upside over the first half of the forecast period, stemming from geopolitical factors. It now judges that the risks from domestic price and wage pressures are more evenly balanced, meaning that, unlike in previous forecasts, there is no difference between the MPC&rsquo;s modal and mean projections at the two and three-year horizons.</p>
<p>Conditioned on the alternative assumption of constant interest rates at 5.25%, the path for CPI inflation is significantly lower than in the Committee&rsquo;s modal projection conditioned on the declining path of market rates, falling below the 2% target from 2025 Q4 onwards.</p>
<p>The MPC&rsquo;s remit is clear that the inflation target applies at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework recognises that there will be occasions when inflation will depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. Monetary policy will ensure that CPI inflation returns to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term.</p>
<p>At this meeting, the Committee voted to maintain Bank Rate at 5.25%. Headline CPI inflation has fallen back relatively sharply. The restrictive stance of monetary policy is weighing on activity in the real economy and is leading to a looser labour market.&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk157447553"></a>In the Committee&rsquo;s February forecast, the risks to inflation are more balanced. Although services price inflation and wage growth have fallen by somewhat more than expected, key indicators of inflation persistence remain elevated.</p>
<p>As a result, monetary policy will need to remain restrictive for sufficiently long to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term in line with the MPC&rsquo;s remit. The Committee has judged since last autumn that monetary policy needs to be restrictive for an extended period of time until the risk of inflation becoming embedded above the 2% target dissipates.</p>
<p>The MPC remains prepared to adjust monetary policy as warranted by economic data to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably. It will therefore continue to monitor closely indications of persistent inflationary pressures and resilience in the economy as a whole, including a range of measures of the underlying tightness of labour market conditions, wage growth and services price inflation. On that basis, the Committee will keep under review for how long Bank Rate should be maintained at its current level.</p>

<h2>Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 31 January 2024</h2>
<p>1: Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. The latest data on these topics were set out in the accompanying&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy-report/2024/february-2024">February 2024 Monetary Policy Report</a>.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk157536174"></a>2: Consumer price inflation across major advanced economies had declined by more than had been expected in the November Report, with continued easing of both goods and services price inflation. The Committee compared features of the disinflation seen across the United States, the euro area and the United Kingdom, and the risks around the inflation outlook. The Committee judged that the divergence seen across economies reflected differences in energy price dynamics and variation in the impact and timing of recent global shocks and their subsequent dissipation, alongside distinct profiles for spare capacity. Disinflation in core goods prices had been comparatively more pronounced so far in the United States because in the euro area and the United Kingdom the lag between falls in producer output price inflation and core consumer goods inflation had shown signs that it might have been longer than in previous cycles.</p>
<p>3: There had also been some differences, as well as commonalities, in the development of services price inflation and wage growth across these economies. Bank staff analysis suggested that the recent falls in services inflation across the three economies had been accounted for largely by declining non-labour input costs, including energy. Labour costs, by contrast, had remained elevated across countries, although there were some signs of easing emerging, particularly in the United States. To the extent that they were broadly comparable, measures of wage inflation had remained considerably higher in the United Kingdom than elsewhere.</p>
<p>4: In the United Kingdom, all of the respondents to the Bank&rsquo;s latest Market Participants Survey (MaPS) expected Bank Rate to be left unchanged at this MPC meeting. They also all expected the next move in the Bank Rate to be downward. The median expected profile for Bank Rate from the MaPS implied a cumulative 100 basis point reduction in Bank Rate this year starting from June 2024, broadly in line with market pricing. Market contacts had suggested that disinflationary news in recent economic data outturns both in other jurisdictions and in the United Kingdom had been a significant factor in the downward moves in UK short-term rates in recent months. Similar downward moves in short-term rates had also occurred in other advanced economies over this period.</p>
<p>5: UK GDP growth had weakened in 2023, with this weakness particularly pronounced in market sector output. This reflected the significant tightening of monetary policy implemented since the end of 2021 to contain the persistence of second-round effects on inflation as well as continued weakness in potential supply growth. Cumulative GDP growth over 2023 as a whole had been materially weaker than expected at the time of the November Report, with the path for household consumption notably below expectations. Timelier indicators suggested that activity would edge up in 2024 Q1.</p>
<p>6: The Committee had completed its annual supply stocktake, as set out in Section 3 of the February Report, and judged that potential supply growth remained weak by historical standards. The MPC also now judged that the degree of excess demand had been a little higher over the recent past than had been assumed in the November Report, implying weaker supply growth in the past. At the same time, it had revised up slightly its view of potential supply growth in the future, although this was still expected to be weaker than the rates seen pre-Covid.</p>
<p>7: The Committee discussed the degree of persistence in wage growth and domestic price inflation. There had been downside news in headline CPI inflation relative to the November Report, accounted for by a combination of fuel, core goods and services prices. In absolute terms, services price inflation remained significantly elevated. There had been a common signal from a range of indicators that wage growth had eased somewhat recently, although it had remained significantly elevated overall. This downward trend had been most pronounced in the annual rate of growth of private sector regular average weekly earnings (AWE), although that had brought the AWE series more into line with other indicators.</p>
<p>8: The majority of this year&rsquo;s wage setting processes would conclude in the next few months. A survey of firms conducted by the Bank&rsquo;s Agents suggested that the average pay settlement in 2024 would be for a rise only slightly lower than in 2023, at 5.4%. It remained to be seen to what degree the falls in CPI inflation and short-term inflation expectations would influence this year&rsquo;s wage setting, although this could also be influenced by a catch-up effect following the high rates of CPI inflation seen over the past couple of years. Evidence from the Agents suggested some possible upward pressures on wages from indirect effects of the increase in the National Living Wage. Intelligence from the Agents, however, also suggested that companies would not be able to pass on increased costs into prices as much as they had done in 2023.</p>
<h3>The immediate policy decision</h3>
<p>9: The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment.</p>
<p>10: In the MPC&rsquo;s February Monetary Policy Report projections, UK GDP was expected to have been flat in 2023 Q4. Growth was expected to pick up gradually during the forecast period, in large part reflecting a waning drag from past increases in Bank Rate. In the medium term, the lower market-implied interest rate path, on which the forecast was conditioned, pushed up on GDP materially compared with the November projection.</p>
<p>11: The labour market had continued to ease, but had remained tight. In the February Report projections, the continuing relative weakness of demand, despite subdued supply growth by historical standards, led to a margin of economic slack emerging during the first half of the forecast period. Relative to November, the output gap projection had been pushed up by the boost to demand from the lower market path of interest rates. Equivalently, this implied&nbsp;that, if monetary policy were to follow the yield curve, then the stance of policy would be less restrictive than at the time of the November Report.</p>
<p>12: Twelve-month CPI inflation had remained above the 2% target. Inflation had fallen to 4.0% in December, below expectations in the November Report. The downside news had been broad-based, reflecting lower fuel, core goods and services price inflation. Although still elevated, wage growth had eased across a number of measures and was projected to decline further in coming quarters.</p>
<p>13: In the MPC&rsquo;s latest most likely, or modal, projections, CPI inflation was expected to fall temporarily to the 2% target in 2024 Q2 before increasing again in Q3 and Q4. This profile of inflation over the second half of the year was accounted for by developments in the direct energy price contribution to 12-month inflation, which becomes less negative. Conditioned on a lower market-implied path for Bank Rate than had underpinned the November Report, CPI inflation was then projected to remain above the 2% target over nearly all of the remainder of the forecast period, owing to persistence in domestic inflationary pressures.</p>
<p>14: The Committee judged that the risks around the modal inflation projection were skewed to the upside over the first half of the forecast period, stemming from geopolitical factors. Risks from domestic price and wage pressures were now more evenly balanced, however. Taken together, this meant there was no difference between the MPC&rsquo;s modal and mean projections at the two and three-year horizons.</p>
<p>15: The MPC judged that monetary policy would need to remain restrictive for sufficiently long to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, in line with the MPC&rsquo;s remit. The Committee had judged since last autumn that monetary policy needed to be restrictive for an extended period of time until the risk of inflation becoming embedded above the 2% target dissipated.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk157608350"></a>16: Six members judged that maintaining Bank Rate at 5.25% was warranted at this meeting. Headline CPI inflation had fallen back relatively sharply. The restrictive stance of monetary policy was weighing on activity and was leading to a looser labour market. In the Committee&rsquo;s February forecast, the risks to inflation were more balanced. Although services price inflation and wage growth had fallen by somewhat more than had been expected, key indicators of inflation persistence remained elevated. There were questions, on which further evidence would be required, about how entrenched this persistence would be, and therefore about how long the current level of Bank Rate would need to be maintained.</p>
<p>17: Two members preferred a 0.25 percentage point increase in Bank Rate, to 5.5%, at this meeting. Although headline inflation had fallen by more than had been expected, this was not necessarily informative about inflation persistence. Current indicators of economic activity had remained subdued, but real household incomes had continued to edge up, and forward-looking indicators of output had remained positive. The labour market was still relatively tight, consistent with a rise in the medium-term equilibrium rate of unemployment, and a range of indicators suggested that the pace of loosening had been slow. Measures of wage growth had moderated further but remained at rates above those consistent with the inflation target. Underlying services price inflation had slowed but remained elevated. These members continued to judge that there was evidence of more persistent inflationary pressures than included within the forecast. Financial conditions had eased since the MPC&rsquo;s December meeting. An increase in Bank Rate at this meeting was necessary to address the risks of more deeply embedded inflation persistence and to return inflation to target sustainably in the medium term.</p>
<p>18: One member preferred a 0.25 percentage point reduction in Bank Rate at this meeting. For this member, the increments applied on the way up, together with lags in transmission, meant that Bank Rate needed to become less restrictive now. Waiting for lagging indicators of domestic relative price growth to fall sharply before reducing rates would come with a risk of overtightening. There might be potential upside risks from geopolitics. That said, consumer price inflation was already, and had been for some time, on a firm downward trajectory. Moreover, leading indicators, such as those from granular producer prices data, pointed to an easing in consumer prices. The outlook for demand remained weak, and less resilient than previously assumed, with vacancies falling more sharply than in some other advanced economies and consumption not having recovered to pre-pandemic levels. This further reduced the prospects of embedded persistence, shown in forward-looking indicators of domestic relative prices, such as monthly annualised rates of nominal pay growth and the Bank&rsquo;s Agents&rsquo; surveys, and suggested lower pass-through of costs to prices.</p>
<p>19: The MPC remained prepared to adjust monetary policy as warranted by economic data to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably. It would, therefore, continue to monitor closely indications of persistent inflationary pressures and resilience in the economy as a whole, including a range of measures of the underlying tightness of labour market conditions, wage growth and services price inflation. On that basis, the Committee would keep under review for how long Bank Rate should be maintained at its current level.</p>
<p>20: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bank Rate should be maintained at 5.25%.</li>
</ul>
<p>21: Six members (Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Ben Broadbent, Megan Greene, Huw Pill and Dave Ramsden) voted in favour of the proposition. Three members voted against the proposition. Two members (Jonathan Haskel and Catherine L Mann) preferred to increase Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 5.5%. One member (Swati Dhingra) preferred to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 5%.</p>
<h3>Operational considerations</h3>
<p>22: On 31 January, the total stock of assets held for monetary policy purposes was &pound;738.0 billion, comprising &pound;737.6 billion of UK government bond purchases and &pound;0.4 billion of sterling non‐financial investment‐grade corporate bond purchases.</p>

<div> cooperation, virtual assets, supervisory experience, legislative procedure, declaration of cooperation
Summary:
The Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) and the Ukrainian National Securities and Stock Market Commission (NSSMC) have agreed to collaborate closely on the regulation of virtual assets. They held a joint online workshop focusing on operational supervisory experience and plan to continue their long-term partnership through a declaration of cooperation. This collaboration is a result of a Joint Declaration of Intent between the finance ministries of Germany and Ukraine. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<div class="abstract">
<p>The Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (<abbr lang="de" title="Bundesanstalt f&uuml;r Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht" xml:lang="de">BaFin</abbr>) and the Ukrainian National Securities and Stock Market Commission (NSSMC) plan to work together closely in future. A joint online workshop on the topic of virtual assets on 30 January marked an important milestone in their cooperation.</p>
</div>
<div class="wrapBodytext">
<p>&ldquo;We are looking forward to cooperating closely with our partner authority in Ukraine,&rdquo; explained Rupert Schaefer, Chief Executive Director of Strategy, Policy and Control at&nbsp;<abbr lang="de" title="Bundesanstalt f&uuml;r Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht" xml:lang="de">BaFin</abbr>. &ldquo;We want to give the Ukrainian supervisors the best support possible and share our supervisory experience of the&nbsp;<abbr title="Europ&auml;ische Union">EU</abbr>&nbsp;legal framework. It is also just as important for us to learn from our colleagues there&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The agenda for the first joint workshop focussed on fundamental questions about virtual assets with an emphasis on operational supervisory experience. A legislative procedure regarding the treatment of investments in cryptoassets is currently underway in Ukraine. Last year, the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCAR) entered into force in the European Union (<abbr title="Europ&auml;ische Union">EU</abbr>).</p>
<h2>Long-term partnership</h2>
<p><abbr lang="de" title="Bundesanstalt f&uuml;r Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht" xml:lang="de">BaFin</abbr>&nbsp;and the NSSMC wish to continue working together over the long term on the basis of a declaration of cooperation. The envisaged collaboration will extend to all important subject areas of financial supervision.</p>
<p>Such cooperation between the two supervisory authorities will also represent a tangible result of the Joint Declaration of Intent on Strengthening Cooperation between the Federal Ministry of Finance of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine, which was signed by the Federal Minister of Finance Christian Lindner and his Ukrainian counterpart Sergii Marchenko in August 2023.</p>
<div class="hervorhebung klammer full">
<h2 class="isFirstInSlot">About the National Securities and Stock Market Commission</h2>
<p>NSSMC is the regulator of capital markets in Ukraine and has the authority over investment firms, various trading venues, investment and pension funds and their asset management companies, as well as over central securities depositories, central counterparties and other representatives of financial market infrastructure.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, FinTech Scotland, working with professional services supporter Deloitte, and with Tesco Bank, Morgan Stanley and abrdn, launched a first-of-its-kind innovation challenge. The industry-led call to action will encourage financial institutions and innovators from across the Fintech community and beyond to learn collaboratively and facilitate industry forums to collectively share best practices for companies to develop new solutions to key financial regulatory challenges.</p>
<p>The inaugural innovation challenge, spearheaded by the newly established Financial Regulation Innovation Lab (FRIL), and funded through the UK Governments&rsquo; Innovation Accelerator programme, delivered by Innovate UK, focuses on 'Simplifying Compliance through the Application of AI and Emerging Technologies'.</p>
<p>The first in a series of industry-led innovation calls, the initiative is dedicated to fostering confidence in the adoption of emerging technologies into financial services. Notably, this call aims to demonstrate the ability technology could have in meeting global regulatory requirements, setting a new standard for future advancements in the industry.</p>
<p>FinTech Scotland and the financial services firms, in conjunction with professional services leader Deloitte, are inviting entrepreneurs and innovators to identify and use technologies to address industry compliance challenges. Launched under the principle of responsible innovation, these calls set the stage for exploration and development of effective solutions that will yield positive outcomes for the pressing needs of consumers and businesses alike, resulting in an overall economic contribution.</p>
<p><strong>Nicola Anderson, CEO of FinTech Scotland, said:</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;We are extremely excited to kick off this inaugural industry innovation challenge. Demand-led innovation calls are an important part of the toolkit that the Financial Regulation Innovation Lab will employ to drive positive outcomes. It is also an opportunity to bring together financial institutions and innovators, enabling financial institutions to learn collaboratively about ways to improve compliance processes to drive efficiency for the sector and, ultimately, increase consumer protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In partnership with the University of Strathclyde and the University of Glasgow, the Lab aims to leverage expertise in financial services risk and compliance and combine this with emerging technologies to build capabilities that maintain and grow both Scotland and the UK&rsquo;s position as a global leader in financial services regulatory innovation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Kent Mackenzie, Fintech Lead for Scotland at Deloitte said:</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;Deloitte is excited to be one of the challenge supporters of the Financial Regulation Innovation Lab&rsquo;s first innovation call. Simplifying compliance is critical to delivering change in financial services, and industry-wide solutions can help enable us to accelerate this positive change. The Lab provides a unique environment to support collaboration, and this groundbreaking initiative will further support how financial services firms are innovating to meet their regulatory obligations.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Joanne Seagrave, Head of Regulatory Affairs</strong><strong>&nbsp;at Tesco Bank:</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;At Tesco Bank we embrace the opportunity that the Financial Regulation Innovation Lab&rsquo;s innovation call series offers to collaborate with innovators. This will allow us to gain further insight on how utilising AI and emerging technologies could help support us in managing the evolving regulatory change landscape. It also presents a significant opportunity to advance industry understanding.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Angela Benson, Head of Glasgow Finance at Morgan Stanley:&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;Morgan Stanley recognises the opportunity in employing AI and emerging technologies to address the industry&rsquo;s global regulatory obligations. We are delighted to partner with FinTech Scotland on this innovation challenge to foster ideation and support the next generation of innovators in this space. Having opened our office in Glasgow over 20 years ago, we have seen first-hand the depth of talent Scotland has to offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Gareth Murphy, Chief Risk Officer at abrdn:</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;At abrdn, we're delighted to join the Financial Regulation Innovation Lab's inaugural innovation call to action.&nbsp; It is essential that we continue to evolve the mix of people, process and technology in all of our activities.&nbsp; We draw on extensive experience in financial services, in Scotland and globally. This collaboration is a testament to our commitment to seizing the ongoing opportunities that financial services and innovation present."</p>
<p>The programme includes three phases: challenge definition, solution design &amp; testing, and final demonstrations. Applicants will receive invaluable insights about financial firms through close collaboration, a support network, academic expertise and service design support. Successful companies will receive grant awards up to &pound;50,000 for further development and implementation.</p>
<p>Fintechs and other teams of innovators are invited to join the challenge. The application window is open from 1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;February.

Supporting the UK Government&rsquo;s levelling-up agenda, this is a new model of R&amp;D decision making that empowers local leaders to harness innovation in support of regional economic growth and help attract private R&amp;D investment and develop future technologies.</p>
<p>Glasgow has a remarkable history rooted in industry and innovation and is home to world-leading science and technology expertise. The Innovation Accelerator programme will support the Region&rsquo;s key economic aims of increasing productivity, delivering inclusive growth and achieving net zero.</p>

<title>Euroclear Delivers Strong Performance In 2023</title>

<p>Euroclear continues to separate Russian sanction-related earnings from the underlying financial results and retain these profits until further guidance is provided on the distribution or management of such profits.</p>
<ul>
<li>Underlying business income reached a record EUR 1,658 million, an increase of 3% year-on-year.</li>
<li>Underlying net profit increased by 63% to almost EUR 1 billion, driven by a robust business performance and a high interest rates environment.</li>
<li>Underlying operating expenses increased by 14% to EUR 1,290 million, on higher inflation and increased investments in line with our strategic ambition to develop digital capabilities and IT infrastructure. The impact of inflation on the group&rsquo;s workforce and non-payroll related costs accounted for an increase of around 5% compared to 2022.</li>
<li>Net interest earnings amounted to EUR 5.5 billion, of which EUR 4.4 billion relate to interests linked to Russian sanctions.</li>
<li>The Russian sanctions and countermeasures resulted in direct costs of EUR 62 million and a loss of business income of EUR 24 million.</li>
<li>Group impairments were recorded in 2023 totalling EUR 125 million, principally related to the impairment of part of the goodwill of our Swedish CSD. The harsher economic conditions and reduced volumes combined with an increase in costs are expected to persist, leading to reduced long-term projections. This has resulted in an impairment of EUR 100 million of the goodwill of the group&rsquo;s Swedish CSD.</li>
<li>Euroclear achieved an underlying EBITDA margin of 57.4%, an increase of 9.7 percentage points compared to 2022.</li>
<li>Underlying earnings per share rose by 63% to EUR 312.1 per share, reflecting the continued increase in net profit.</li>
<li>The Board proposes to pay a dividend per share of EUR 210 in the third quarter of 2024. This represents an increase of 82% and maintains the pay-out ratio at 60% of the underlying earnings.</li>

<p><span>Lieve Mostrey, Chief Executive Officer of Euroclear group, commented:</span></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;2023 was another turbulent year, with geopolitical tensions impacting our macro-economic reality and the global capital markets. In times of complexity and market uncertainty, it is rewarding to know that our diverse client base continues to rely on us for safety and efficiency in processing and safeguarding their assets.</i></p>
<p><i>In 2023, we reached a record underlying business income of EUR 1,658 million and an underlying net profit of almost EUR 1 billion, driven by a robust business performance and a high interest rates environment. We also made solid progress in delivering on our strategic objectives, maintaining our focus on clients, while further developing ESG, data and digital capabilities, and continuing to grow our business internationally. Key achievements include the launch of the Digital Securities Issuance (D-SI) service, the successful connection of Euroclear Bank and Euroclear Finland to the European Central Bank&rsquo;s T2S settlement system and the opening of a new Tech Hub in Krakow, allowing us to create 400 new jobs.</i><br /><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><i>As we recently announced a leadership transition and the selection of Val&eacute;rie Urbain as my successor, this is my last set of full-year results as CEO of Euroclear. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our colleagues across the entire group for their commitment and dedication in delivering another robust performance, servicing our clients and contributing to preserve the certainty, fluidity, and safety of our markets.&rdquo;</i></p>

<p>With a record underlying business income of EUR 1,658 million (+ 3% year-on-year), Euroclear continues to deliver growth despite subdued market conditions. In contrast with 2022, which was characterised by volatile markets following the invasion of Ukraine, 2023 saw market activity slightly decrease while equities valuations recovered. Fixed-income issuance performed well. The diversification of Euroclear&rsquo;s business continues to provide resilience thanks to its subscription-like model as approximately three quarters of the group&rsquo;s business income is decoupled from financial market valuation.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Eurobond and European assets performance resulted from solid issuance and partial recovery of equities valuations, in spite of lower levels of trading compared to last year in most markets.</li>
<li>The investment funds business also suffered from lower activity mainly impacting mutual funds. ETF investment remained strong.</li>
<li>Revenue emanating from the Collateral Highway increased despite reduced volumes for lending and borrowing.</li>
<li>Global and Emerging Markets performance remained solid amid interest in new, emerging markets.</li>

<p>In line with Euroclear&rsquo;s aspiration to become a digital and data-enabled financial market infrastructure, a D&sup2;-FMI, it launched its&nbsp;<i>new Digital Securities Issuance (D-SI) service</i>&nbsp;in September 2023.<i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>The service enables the issuance, distribution and settlement of fully digital international securities - Digitally Native Notes (DNN) - on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). The inaugural DNN was issued by the World Bank, raising EUR 100 million to support its sustainable development activities. The DNN is automatically linked to the traditional settlement platform of Euroclear for secondary market operations, ensuring investors full access to liquidity.</p>
<p>Separately, in December 2023,<i>&nbsp;</i>Fnality, an international consortium of banks and financial institutions, including Euroclear, announced it had completed the first blockchain payments at the Bank of England.&nbsp;Fnality aims to bring central bank money in a digital tokenised form with near-real-time 24/7 settlement capability to allow banks to significantly reduce their intraday liquidity requirements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Building on its acquisitions of MFEX and Goji, Euroclear has continued to enhance its service offering in investment funds with the launch of a new service targeting private market funds. Leveraging Goji&rsquo;s capabilities and the FundSettle platform, the new service complements Euroclear&rsquo;s existing money market, mutual and alternative fund offerings. The launch of the new service also follows the gradual inclusion of MFEX&rsquo;s distribution and data services into the FundSettle platform.</p>
<p>To further streamline Euroclear&rsquo;s funds offering and reflect its ambition to create a true one-stop-shop offering to clients across the full spectrum of funds products, Euroclear&rsquo;s funds offering transitioned to a new brand name, Euroclear FundsPlace.</p>
<p>Euroclear also continued to deploy innovative services for fund distributors globally. In 2023, several clients from Europe and Asia chose Euroclear&rsquo;s fund platform for the onboarding of their investment funds. Euroclear provides a one-stop-shop solution for fund distribution and execution services via its extensive network, allowing these clients to have access to more than 100,000 funds.</p>

<p>Euroclear fully supports the need for integrated, deep and liquid capital markets within the European Union. As a common settlement platform for Europe, the European Central Bank&rsquo;s TARGET2-Securities (T2S) system underpins this harmonised environment.</p>
<p>Euroclear Bank and Euroclear Finland successfully completed the connection to the European Central Bank&rsquo;s T2S settlement system in late 2023. By joining this common infrastructure, the Finnish CSD can offer its users delivery-versus-payment settlement of securities and cash in euro and Danish krone central bank money.</p>
<p>Euroclear also continues to grow its international ecosystem in Asia. Euroclear Bank and the Korea Securities Depository took further step in making the Korean market 'Euroclearable' by signing an agreement to open an omnibus account structure in August 2023. The link will allow international investors efficient post-trade access to KTBs.</p>

<p>In 2023, Euroclear continued to build on its strong ESG foundations established in previous years. It has started work on implementing the principles laid out in its ESG Board policy and begun to measure progress against the ESG KPIs which were approved in early 2023. Euroclear has made progress against its commitments in many areas, meeting its supply-chain screening targets, receiving approval for its targets from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and broadening its training offer. Actions are ongoing to integrate ESG into its current service offering, together with its business partners Impact Cubed and Greenomy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />Within its workplace, Euroclear aims to foster a healthy, performant and learning-orientated corporate culture. Last year, Euroclear onboarded 800 new employees and started to work with the World Economic Forum as one of its partners for &lsquo;The Good Work Alliance&rsquo; which commits to building a more resilient, equitable, inclusive and just future of work.</p>

<div class="text    ">
<p>In recent years, Euroclear&rsquo;s shareholder base has evolved from its traditional 'user-owned' model to include a greater proportion of longer-term institutional investors. In 2023, the group welcomed two new shareholders: New Zealand Super Fund and Novo Holdings, each holding 4.99% and 3.22% respectively.</p>
<p>Furthermore, two of Euroclear&rsquo;s main shareholders reinforced their holding last year. Soci&eacute;t&eacute; F&eacute;d&eacute;rale de Participations et d'Investissement (SFPI/FPIM) acquired 1.79% from various sellers, and now holds 12.92%, while Caisse des D&eacute;p&ocirc;ts et Consignations (CDC) increased its holding by 4.19%, and now holds 10.91%.</p>
<p>The long-term investment vision and commitment of this increasingly diversified shareholder base strengthens Euroclear&rsquo;s position as a neutral and open financial market infrastructure.</p>

Under her tenure, Euroclear grew its business, expanded its global footprint, enriched its funds offering notably through the acquisitions of MFEX and Goji and accelerated value creation for shareholders, while at the same time securing CSDR licenses for each of its operating entities.</p>
<p>With over 30 years of experience at Euroclear in a variety of senior roles, including as Head of Human Resources of Euroclear group, CEO of Euroclear Bank and most recently as Chief Business Officer, Val&eacute;rie brings unparalleled knowledge of Euroclear, clients and market trends.

<h2 class="h2  ">Update on Russian sanctions and countermeasures</h2>
</div>
<div class="text"><a class="anchorID" id="content_text_1351730653" name="content_text_1351730653"></a>
<div class="text    ">
<p>The number of sanctions and countersanctions that have been introduced since February 2022 are unprecedented and continue to have a significant impact on the daily operations of Euroclear. While new sanctions were issued at a declining pace in 2023, these still resulted in more breakage of straight-through process and increased manual interventions.</p>
<p>Well-established processes are in place which allow the group to implement the sanctions, while maintaining the normal course of business. However, one consequence of the sanctions is that blocked coupon payments and redemptions owed to sanctioned entities results in an accumulation of cash on Euroclear Bank&rsquo;s balance sheet. At the end of 2023, Euroclear Bank&rsquo;s balance sheet had increased by EUR 38 billion year-on-year to a total of EUR 162 billion.</p>
<p>Euroclear&rsquo;s priority has been to manage the sanctions according to the spirit and letter of the law. As per Euroclear&rsquo;s standard procedures, Euroclear does not remunerate cash balances and such cash balances are re-invested to minimise risk and capital requirements. Prudent management of such risks is a requirement under Euroclear&rsquo;s Risk Appetite and Policies and expected by the EU Capital Requirements Regulation. The interest received on the reinvestment of cash balances is net interest income earned by Euroclear.</p>
<p>In 2023, interest arising on cash balances from Russia-sanctioned assets was approx. EUR 4.4 billion. Such interest earnings are driven by two factors: (i) the prevailing interest rates and (ii) the amount of cash balances that Euroclear is required to invest. Subject to Belgian corporate tax, these earnings will generate EUR 1,085 million tax revenue for the Belgian State in 2023. As such, future earnings will be influenced by the evolving interest rate environment and the size of cash balances as the sanctions evolve.</p>
<p>Since considerable uncertainties persist,&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk140225743" name="_Hlk140225743"></a>Euroclear considers it necessary to separate the estimated sanction-related earnings from the underlying financial results when assessing the company&rsquo;s performance and resources.</p>
<p>Euroclear is faced with a high level of complexity in managing both the wide-ranging package of sanctions and a set of countermeasures, which Russia has implemented to try to mitigate the impact of the sanctions. Euroclear allocates considerable time, resources and capital to manage market issues, potential risks and implications of these countermeasures, while maintaining regular dialogue with clients and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>Overall, Euroclear incurred additional direct costs from the management of Russian sanctions of EUR 62 million in 2023, with considerable senior management and Board focus on the topic. Additionally, the international sanctions and Russian countermeasures have resulted in a loss of activities from sanctioned clients and Russian securities, which negatively impacted business income by EUR 24 million.</p>
<p>2023 also saw various parties contest the consequences of the application of sanctions, with a significant number of legal proceedings ongoing, almost exclusively in Russian courts. Claimants have initiated legal proceeding aiming mainly to access the assets blocked in Euroclear&rsquo;s books. Despite all legal actions taken by Euroclear and the considerable resources mobilised, the probability of unfavourable rulings in Russian courts is high since Russia does not recognise the international sanctions. Euroclear will continue to defend itself against all legal claims.</p>
<p>In parallel, the Board notes that the European Commission is contemplating various options to use the profits generated by the reinvestment of sanctioned amounts held by financial institutions, including Euroclear, for the financing of Ukraine&rsquo;s reconstruction.</p>
<p>Euroclear is focused on minimising potential legal and operational risks that may arise for itself and its clients from the implementation of any proposals from the European Commission. The company continues to act in a transparent manner with all authorities involved and to retain profits related to the international sanctions applicable on Russian assets until further guidance is provided on the distribution or management of such profits.</p>
<p>Euroclear continues to monitor and assess the potential impact of post balance sheet events on its 2023 financial statements.&nbsp;</p>

<div> Governance, Company Secretary, Role, Singapore, Chief Governance Officer
<br />
The article discusses the evolving role of company secretaries in Singapore. It highlights the traditional and enhanced roles of company secretaries, emphasizing the importance of good corporate governance and the value it brings to companies and investors. It also emphasizes the need for company secretaries to adapt to disruption and the multidisciplinary nature of their role.
<br /><br />Summary: The article emphasizes the traditional and enhanced roles of company secretaries in Singapore, focusing on the importance of good corporate governance and the evolving nature of the role in the face of disruption and multidisciplinary expectations. <div>
<p>Mr Raymond Lam, Chairman, CSIS,</p>
<p>Friends and Colleagues,</p>
<p>Good morning,</p>
<p>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for inviting me here today. I am honoured to have the opportunity to share my views on the role of company secretaries in Singapore, and how it is evolving.</p>
<p>Traditional Roles of the Company Secretary &ndash; &ldquo;What People Think You Do&rdquo;</p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The company secretary is a key officer of any company, who (often together with General Counsel) is responsible for ensuring that the company complies with relevant laws and regulations. The company secretary also acts as a bridge between the board of directors, the management, and the shareholders, facilitating effective communication and collaboration among them.</p>
<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Singapore, in addition to the Companies Act which sets out the statutory duties of all company secretaries, the duties of a company secretary are also governed by the specific constitution of the company and for listed companies, the listing rules of SGX and the Code of Corporate Governance.</p>
<p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Traditionally, the company secretary has had to perform various administrative and operational tasks, such as maintaining the statutory registers and records, arranging for, and attending shareholder and board meetings, preparing and filing the necessary documents, issuing share certificates, and so on. These tasks may seem mundane, but they are essential for the smooth running of the company and the protection of its interests.</p>
<p>Company Secretary as the Chief Governance Officer &ndash; What you Also Do</p>
<p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the role of the company secretary is not limited to these compliance and administrative functions. In fact, the company secretary can &ndash; and in my view should &ndash; play a more strategic and value-adding role, acting as the chief governance officer of the company.</p>
<p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is a chief governance officer, you may ask? Just like any other member of the C-Suite, the chief governance officer in an institution is a senior executive who is tasked with the overall direction and marshalling of people, processes, systems, and other resources in a particular area &ndash; and in this case, to deliver good corporate governance.</p>
<p>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practically, what this means is that the company secretary can help the board and the management to develop and implement a robust and effective governance framework, one that aligns with the vision, mission, values, and objectives of the company. The company secretary can also help to foster a culture of integrity, accountability, transparency, and sustainability within the company, and promote stakeholder engagement and trust.</p>
<p>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, as the chief governance officer, the company secretary can leverage on his or her expertise, experience, and pivotal role in interactions with the board to provide strategic advice and guidance to both the board and management on various matters, such as risk management, business ethics, corporate social responsibility, digital transformation, and innovation. The company secretary can also help to identify and establish partnerships with key stakeholders, industry associations, and regulators, to enhance the reputation and competitiveness of the company. In short, as the chief governance officer, the company secretary can be a catalyst for change and improvement, and a driver for growth and value creation, for the company.</p>
<p>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To varying degrees, some of the above roles are taken on by company secretaries but such an enhanced identity for company secretaries is not widely perceived and understood.</p>
<p>Why Does this Matter?</p>
<p>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to some possible questions that you may have.</p>
<p>11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, does governance matter? Do investors care? Do they reward good governance? The answer is yes, yes, and yes. Governance is not just a matter of compliance, but a matter of performance. Good governance can enhance the efficiency, effectiveness, and sustainability of the company, and create long-term value for shareholders and other stakeholders. Investors are increasingly demanding more transparency, accountability, and engagement from the companies they invest in; one study for instance found that governance-related demands by activist investors increased 50-fold between 2009 to 2019.<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp; And a number of other studies have also found correlations between good governance and higher valuations, and lower cost of capital.</p>
<p>12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are other practical benefits for companies as well. For instance, SGX maintains a Fast Track programme which recognises and rewards companies with high corporate governance standards and good compliance track records. These companies enjoy faster clearance for submissions, including for corporate actions such as share issuances, and requests for waivers. They also benefit from greater visibility and recognition among investors and the public.</p>
<p>13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another example is the Singapore Governance and Transparency Index, which assesses the corporate governance practices of Singapore-listed companies. The index is based on various indicators, such as board structure, board processes, disclosure and communication, stakeholder engagement, and sustainability. The index provides a benchmark for companies to measure and improve their governance standards, and serves as a reference for investors and analysts to evaluate the governance quality of companies. Good corporate governance provides reputational benefits.</p>
<p>14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As company secretaries, you have a vital role to play in ensuring and enhancing the governance of your companies, and in communicating and demonstrating the value of good governance to your investors and other stakeholders. By creating more trust with investors, it increases the prospects of them becoming and remaining shareholders for the longer term, both for listed and non-listed companies. In the case of non-listed companies, failures in governance are often the reason for minority suits against controlling shareholders.</p>
<p>15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, company secretaries play an enhanced role in public or listed companies. Part of the fundamental bargain that underpins public markets is that in exchange for the ability to raise funds from the general public, listed companies commit to higher standards of transparency, disclosure, and corporate governance than apply to non-listed companies. In turn, this means that company secretaries have a more complex and dynamic regulatory environment to deal with, and to keep abreast of. Stakeholder expectations are also more diverse and demanding. Some of the ways that you can be adding value would be as a strategic partner to your boards and your management, and a trusted advisor to your stakeholders by providing insights, guidance, and solutions on various governance and business issues, and by facilitating effective governance processes and practices.</p>
<p>16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the chief governance officer, you are responsible for overseeing and coordinating the governance activities and initiatives of your companies. You are also responsible for ensuring that your companies prepare for and comply with the relevant governance standards and requirements, even as they evolve and change.</p>
<p>17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One live example that highlights the role that the company secretaries should be playing is in the context of the relatively new rules that SGX RegCo has recently introduced such as the 9-year hard cap on the tenure of independent directors and the requirements to disclose a board diversity policy. These rules aim to promote board renewal and diversity, which are essential for enhancing the quality and effectiveness of the board. As the chief governance officer, you have a key responsibility in ensuring that the board agenda includes these matters, and to plan ahead given the deadlines and the expectations of the regulators and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus far, compliance with these new rules has not been uniform. According to a recently released joint study by SGX RegCo and the Council for Board Diversity, while 89% of SGX-listed issuers have disclosed a board diversity policy with &ldquo;objectives, targets, plans, timelines, and progress&rdquo;, the level of detail in disclosures varied significantly. Clearly room for disclosures to improve exists, and we will be looking to the people in this room to help us achieve this. While the buck stops with the board, your role as the chief governance officer should be to advise your boards on developing and disclosing a clear and comprehensive board diversity policy that reflects the circumstances and requirements of your companies and stakeholders. What this requires is some level of education and upskilling on your part. To this end, SGX RegCo has tried as much as possible to aid by providing best practice examples in many of our reviews of listed company disclosures, and where necessary, one-on-one engagements with listed companies that have fallen far short of the average.</p>
<p>19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These case studies and engagements can, I think, serve as springboards for deeper conversations with your boards on how to improve. Conversely, we are open to your feedback on how we can help you do your job better. So, let&rsquo;s have a two-way conversation so we can all lift corporate governance standards to a higher level.</p>
<p>20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, and relatedly, how can company secretaries cope with disruption and their increasingly multidisciplinary role? In recent years, company secretaries have had to deal with changes coming from all sides. The expectations are no longer just about compliance, and other traditional matters. Issues such as sustainability, the environment, climate change, diversity, digitalisation, and cybersecurity have come into the spotlight. The recent release of the International Sustainability Standards Board&rsquo;s disclosure standards is one case in point, with assurance standards for sustainability reporting also targeted to be finalised by end-2024. All these have implications for how companies organise and govern themselves and serve their stakeholders.</p>
<p>21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How can company secretaries work with their boards in navigating these changes? Here I have three suggestions. First, maintain an active curiosity about the state of the world, keep yourself informed on current affairs, think deeply about the drivers of change, and try to anticipate future trends and expectations. Second, develop a good support network of sources of helpful advice and input. This can include colleagues within your teams and companies, as well as the use of tools including information aggregators. But just as important is maintaining links and networks with others who are in the same situation as you. Here I would like to congratulate Raymond and the rest of the CSIS team, for organising today&rsquo;s forum, and providing us with an opportunity to engage in dialogue and mutual learning. I encourage CSIS to keep up your efforts in this regard. CSIS is a professional body that has a valuable role to play in equipping company secretaries with the skills and knowledge required in a fast-changing corporate landscape. Third, be bold. Provide advice when you see risks and opportunities, where you observe instances where the letter of the rules is being observed, but not their spirit.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me conclude. Company secretaries today have a much more expanded role than in the past. And there is no going back. I urge you then to embrace the disruption and the multidisciplinary role that you face, leverage on your existing skills and knowledge, and upskill yourselves and your networks, to add value to your companies and your stakeholders. While it is correct that company secretaries play an important administrative role, company secretaries can be much more than this. At a time of rapid change, company secretaries should seize the opportunity to become knowledgeable about matters such as sustainability, the environment, digitalisation, and diversity to become even more indispensable advisors to their companies.</p>
<p>23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, it is also important to highlight the importance of the board and other members of senior management in supporting the role of the company secretary as chief governance officer. Tone and culture at the top are important to create the right environment for company secretaries to perform their role fully.</p>
<p>24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for your time and attention, and I wish you all the best for the rest of your discussions today.</p>

<title>ASIC’s 2024 Enforcement Priorities In The Superannuation Sector - Keynote Address By ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court At The Connexus Super Chair Forum, 1 February 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>KEY POINTS</h2>
<ul>
<li>ASIC&rsquo;s enforcement priorities in the superannuation sector in the coming year run along three key themes: member services failures; misleading conduct, including greenwashing; and failures to protect superannuation balances.</li>
<li>These reflect areas of genuine harm ASIC is seeing through intelligence and surveillance and should serve as fair warning to the sector as to where it needs to lift performance.</li>
<li>Superannuation fund board chairs are in a powerful position to impact outcomes for members and ASIC is calling on them to be proactive in placing members at the heart of day-to-day operations or face possible regulatory attention.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good morning to you all.</p>
<p>Thank you for the invitation to be here today. This is an important audience for ASIC to engage with about our enforcement priorities in the superannuation sector for the year ahead.</p>
<p>Before I turn to those priorities, I should acknowledge that this month marks the five- year anniversary of the handing down of the Financial Services Royal Commission report. That was, of course, a seminal time for those involved in the financial services sector, for both the regulated and regulators alike.</p>
<p>ASIC is a very different regulator now than we were a decade ago. ASIC&rsquo;s remit has substantially increased since that time &ndash; we have new laws and new powers, and we are determined to use them to ensure that we do not see a repeat of the misconduct that emerged in the course of the Royal Commission.</p>
<p>Many of those new laws and powers are relevant, of course, to our conduct role in the superannuation sector. We see our role in the sector in broad terms being to drive trustees to improve member outcomes and hold trustees to account where there is misconduct or poor governance.</p>
<p>We have been, and will continue to be, an active conduct regulator in the superannuation sector.</p>
<p>Last year alone we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Undertook 219 surveillances of superannuation entities (2023 CY);</li>
<li>Took legal action in the courts against four superannuation trustees, being Mercer, Active Super, TelstraSuper and AustralianSuper (2023 CY); and</li>
<li>The courts imposed $29 million in penalties in relation to misconduct in the superannuation sector (2023 CY).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the coming year, we intend to build on this strong record.</p>
<h2>2024 enforcement priorities</h2>
<p>We publicly announced our enforcement priorities late last year. We do this for a number of reasons: it provides transparency to our regulated community, it holds us to account for delivering against those priorities, and we have found that the announcement by ASIC of areas of interest to us tends to have an immediate compliance effect.</p>
<p>Our enforcement priorities in the superannuation sector in the coming year run along three key themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Member services failures;</li>
<li>Misleading conduct, including greenwashing; and</li>
<li>Failures to protect superannuation balances.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The people in this room, as stewards of Australia&rsquo;s $2.5 trillion superannuation pool, are in a powerful position to impact outcomes for members.</p>
<p>These themes could be regarded as a call to action &ndash; they reflect areas of genuine harm we are still seeing through intelligence and surveillance and should serve as fair warning to the sector as to where it needs to lift performance.</p>
<h3>Member service failures</h3>
<p>First to member service failures.</p>
<p>Australians have a right to expect to be dealt with efficiently, honestly and fairly by their superannuation fund.</p>
<p>ASIC expects trustees to communicate proactively with members, deal responsibly with members&rsquo; money, and deliver good value for money. This is regardless of the phase of membership of the member.</p>
<p>From early accumulation through to retirement and draw-down phase, services and member needs may change across the &lsquo;life&rsquo; of the membership, but these core expectations remain. They must be met consistently, which requires operational soundness.</p>
<p>Through our surveillance and enforcement work over recent years it has become increasingly clear that in many cases member services provided by superannuation funds are falling short of these expectations. In particular, we have observed that services are too often slow, unresponsive, and not member focused.</p>
<h4>TelstraSuper</h4>
<p>In an example of our concerns in this regard, in November of last year we commenced civil penalty proceedings against TelstraSuper for alleged failures to comply with the internal dispute resolution requirements that came into effect in October 2021.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/asic-s-2024-enforcement-priorities-in-the-superannuation-sector/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>[1]</span></a>&nbsp;These are the first proceedings we have commenced under this regime.</p>
<p>We allege TelstraSuper failed to respond adequately to two in five complaints within the relevant time period, and failed to operate efficiently, honestly and fairly.</p>
<p>One year before we took this matter to court, we warned superannuation trustees to improve their internal dispute resolution systems, after a review that uncovered sub-standard complaints handling arrangements across the industry.</p>
<p>That we now have a specific enforcement priority for member service failures should serve as a further warning to trustees to improve efforts in this area.</p>
<h4>Death benefit claims handling</h4>
<p>When individuals have bad experiences with a fund, their confidence in the superannuation system is likely to be undermined.</p>
<p>Nowhere is this more evident than in relation to death benefit claims handling.</p>
<p>We are aware of a significant increase in complaints to the Australian Financial Complaints Authority about extreme processing delays for death benefit claims, among other issues, leading to additional distress for members&rsquo; families.</p>
<p>We are undertaking an industry review focused on improving the delivery of superannuation fund member services, looking initially at trustee compliance with obligations related to the handling of death benefit claims.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I will not comment specifically on investigations underway, we are actively considering these issues and whether they amount to an industry-wide problem.</p>
<p>I note some commentary from funds attributing these delays to administrative outsourcing. But this is not an answer to the issue. It is the trustee that has the legal responsibility to ensure it can meet the legal obligations owed to members, irrespective of the administrative arrangements the fund chooses to adopt. The legal obligations on trustees cannot be outsourced. I will return to this theme when I talk about greenwashing.</p>
<h3>Greenwashing</h3>
<p>There has been much written and reported in recent times about the phenomenon of greenwashing, and ASIC has been very active in this area in recent times.</p>
<p>It is important to recognise that greenwashing, of course, is not new. Despite the significant current interest in the issue, what is now referred to as 'greenwashing' is of course just misleading and deceptive conduct by another name.</p>
<p>All the actions ASIC has taken to date in this area fall within that general descriptor &ndash; that is, all are allegations about firms engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct. This is not to say that our future greenwashing work will be confined to misleading and deceptive cases. It may be that licence obligations, directors&rsquo; and officers&rsquo; duties and a range of other obligations can be applied here. Again, all existing laws which people are familiar with.</p>
<p>There is of course new law on the horizon, which will entail significant additional and new compliance obligations. But our current focus is on existing laws, which should be familiar to everyone, and ensuring that we maximise their availability to protect potential investors and ensure that investors are getting what they bargained for.</p>
<p>Greenwashing remains a key focus for ASIC in 2024.</p>
<p>With proceedings underway against Mercer Super and Active Super, trustees will be aware that we will use every lever legislation affords us to eliminate this practice, and we will continue to monitor the superannuation sector for misleading greenwashing claims.</p>
<p>Going forward our focus will be on net zero statements and targets made without merit; the use of terms like &lsquo;carbon neutral&rsquo;, &lsquo;clean&rsquo; or &lsquo;green&rsquo; that are not founded on reasonable grounds; and the use of inaccurate labelling or vague terms in sustainability-related funds.</p>
<p>We expect boards to engage directly on sustainability claims &ndash; whether they are aspirational statements, targets, active stewardship commitments or investment descriptions.</p>
<p>If trustees are making environmental, social or ethical claims to attract potential members, those claims need to be backed with evidence and transparent about their basis.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Failure to protect superannuation balances</h3>
<p>Finally, to failures by trustees to protect members&rsquo; superannuation balances.</p>
<p>We know that with the increased cost of living, Australians are more worried than ever about having enough money in retirement.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/asic-s-2024-enforcement-priorities-in-the-superannuation-sector/#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span>[2]</span></a></p>
<p>Members should be able to have confidence that their superannuation savings are not being eroded by unnecessary or inappropriate fees and charges, and that the products in which they are investing are designed to maximise retirement outcomes and sufficiently balance risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, some of our recent enforcement actions demonstrate the sector is falling short in this regard.</p>
<h4>AustralianSuper</h4>
<p>Last year we commenced civil penalty proceedings against the trustee of Australia&rsquo;s largest superannuation fund, AustralianSuper, alleging failures to address multiple member accounts.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/asic-s-2024-enforcement-priorities-in-the-superannuation-sector/#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><span>[3]</span></a></p>
<p>We allege around 90,000 AustralianSuper members were affected, costing members approximately $69 million in multiple sets of fees and insurance premiums and lost investment earnings on those amounts.</p>
<p>This was the first case we have brought alleging contraventions of section 52 of the&nbsp;<em>Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993</em>&nbsp;relating to the conduct of trustee&rsquo;s duties.</p>
<p>Unintended multiple accounts remain a significant issue for Australian consumers despite reforms designed to reduce their frequency.</p>
<p>It is in the interest of all superannuation funds to proactively identify and consolidate multiple accounts within the fund, where it is in the members&rsquo; interest to help their members avoid extra fees&nbsp;and to ensure their funds avoid costly remediation.</p>
<h4>OnePath</h4>
<p>We also secured a $5 million penalty against superannuation trustee OnePath for deducting fees from members of Integra Super for advice services they did not receive and misleading consumers.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/asic-s-2024-enforcement-priorities-in-the-superannuation-sector/#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><span>[4]</span></a></p>
<p>The court found that between December 2015 and November 2021, OnePath deducted $3.8 million in fees from members for advice services they did not receive.</p>
<p>OnePath told members they had to pay a fee for advice from a &lsquo;plan adviser&rsquo; even after the member had been transferred to a division of Integra Super, where they were not entitled to receive advice services.</p>
<h4>The role of the trustee</h4>
<p>What these cases demonstrate is the important role of the trustee in safeguarding members&rsquo; super balances by eliminating poor practices.</p>
<p>Boards that are engaged in their businesses and exercise appropriate oversight are well positioned to identify, address and remediate harms to members before they come to the attention of ASIC. This requires asking tough questions, and prioritising members in decision-making.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Following the Royal Commission, we sought &ndash; and received from Parliament &ndash; significantly higher financial penalties to provide the strongest possible deterrent to financial services misconduct.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Misconduct post-dating March 2019 now attracts maximum penalties more than tenfold those that existed before &ndash; and we are committed to pursuing these penalties through the courts, so the cost of breaking the law well exceeds the cost of doing business.</p>
<p>We have also indicated publicly that we will take on cases where the outcome is not guaranteed, and we will test the bounds of the law where it is uncertain or open to interpretation.</p>
<p>Given these commitments, the themes I have outlined today should provide clear guidance as to where you might focus your attention this year to avoid attracting ours.</p>
<p>Thank you for your attention today. I look forward to the Q&amp;A discussion.</p>

<p><em>* Adjusted EBITDA, NPAT and EPS exclude certain non-cash and non-recurring items that have less bearing on SGX&rsquo;s operating performance. Hence, they better reflect the group&rsquo;s underlying performance. Adjusted figures are non-SFRS(I) measures. Please refer to Section 7 of our financial results for reconciliations between the adjusted and their equivalent measures.</em></p>
<p><em>All figures are for the year except for figures in brackets, which are for the year earlier unless otherwise stated. Figures may be subject to rounding.</em></p>
<p><em>The presentation of revenue in our 1H FY2024 income statement has been revised to the following four operating segments &ndash; Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities; Equities &ndash; Cash; Equities &ndash; Derivatives; and Platform and Others</em><a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn1"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a><em>. 1H FY2023 revenue has been reclassified to the four operating segments for a like-for-like comparison against 1H FY2024.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Singapore Exchange (SGX Group) today reported 1H FY2024 adjusted net profit of S$251.4 million (S$236.8 million). Adjusted EBITDA rose to S$344.6 million (S$334.1 million), while adjusted earnings per share increased to 23.5 cents (22.2 cents).</p>
<p>Revenue increased 3.6% to S$592.2 million (S$571.4 million), mainly driven by higher revenues from Currencies and Commodities<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn2"><sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup></a>&nbsp;and Platform and Others, partially offset by lower Equities &ndash; Cash<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;and Equities &ndash; Derivatives<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;revenue.</p>
<p>The Board of Directors has declared an interim quarterly dividend of 8.5 cents (8.0 cents) per share, payable on 20 February 2024. This brings total dividends in 1H FY2024 to 17.0 cents (16.0 cents) per share.</p>
<p>Loh Boon Chye, Chief Executive Officer of SGX Group, said, &ldquo;Our multi-asset offering continued to serve our customers well in a persistently challenging macro environment. Our currency and commodity derivatives business has been a growing contributor to revenue, and our OTC FX franchise is making good progress with average daily volume consistently reaching US$100 billion in recent months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The year ahead could see muted global economic growth and geopolitical concerns that may affect market sentiment and risk appetite. Nonetheless, the resilience of our multi-asset strategy as well as healthy financial position and discipline will enable us to capitalise on conditions across cycles. To drive growth, we will focus on expanding our solutions to capture opportunities in Asia, grow our emerging products and further strengthen our global distribution and network,&rdquo; added Mr. Loh.</p>
<p>Results Summary</p>
<p>Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC)</p>
<p>FICC revenue increased 28.1% to S$151.9 million (S$118.5 million) and accounted for 25.6% (20.7%) of total revenue<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn3"><sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup></a>.</p>
<p>FICC &ndash; Fixed Income</p>
<p>Fixed Income revenue decreased 8.4% to S$3.9 million (S$4.3 million).</p>
<ul>

<li>Corporate actions and other revenue: S$1.4 million, down 19.1% from S$1.7 million</li>
</ul>
<p>There were 489 bond listings raising S$131.7 billion, compared with 449 bond listings raising S$104.3 billion a year earlier.</p>
<p>FICC &ndash; Currencies and Commodities</p>
<p>Currencies and Commodities revenue increased 29.5% to S$148.0 million (S$114.3 million). OTC FX revenue was S$40.9 million (S$36.2 million) and accounted for 27.7% (31.7%) of Currencies and Commodities revenue.</p>
<ul>
<li>Trading and clearing revenue: S$111.3 million, up 25.3% from S$88.8 million</li>
<li>Treasury and other revenue: S$36.7 million, up 44.3% from S$25.4 million</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trading and clearing revenue grew by S$22.4 million, mainly from increased volumes in commodity derivatives and OTC FX transactions.</p>
<p>Commodity derivatives volumes increased 48.3% to 28.7 million contracts (19.4 million contracts), primarily due to higher volumes in iron ore derivatives.</p>
<p>Currency derivatives volumes increased 23.8% to 23.0 million contracts (18.6 million contracts) mainly from higher volumes in our USD/CNH FX futures.</p>
<p>OTC FX average daily volume (ADV) increased 46.4% to US$100.1 billion (US$68.4 billion).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Treasury and other revenue increased mainly due to higher average yields on margin deposits, partially offset by a decrease in margin balances.</p>
<p>Equities &ndash; Cash</p>
<p>Equities &ndash; Cash revenue declined by 5.6% to S$159.6 million (S$169.1 million) and accounted for 26.9% (29.6%) of total revenue.</p>
<ul>
<li>Listing revenue: S$14.6 million, down 3.3% from S$15.1 million</li>
<li>Trading and clearing revenue: S$77.2 million, down 13.9% from S$89.6 million</li>
<li>Securities settlement, depository management, corporate actions and other revenue: S$67.9 million, up 5.3% from S$64.5 million</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recorded 4 (4) new equity listings, which raised S$19.0 million (S$9.7 million). Secondary equity funds raised were S$0.6 billion (S$2.4 billion).</p>
<p>Daily average traded value (DAV) and total traded value declined 11.5% and 12.2% to S$1.0 billion (S$1.1 billion) and S$121.2 billion (S$138.1 billion) respectively. This was made up of Cash Equities<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn4"><sup><sup>[4]</sup></sup></a>, where total traded value decreased by 11.9% to S$116.0 billion (S$131.6 billion), and Other Products<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn5"><sup><sup>[5]</sup></sup></a>, where traded value decreased 19.5% to S$5.2 billion (S$6.5 billion). There were 126 (127) trading days in the first half of FY2024.</p>
<p>Overall average clearing fees decreased 2.1% to 2.47 basis points (2.53 basis points). Average clearing fees for Cash Equities decreased 2.3% to 2.55 basis points (2.61 basis points) due to a higher proportion of market maker participation. Average clearing fee for Other Products decreased 3.6% to 0.79 basis points (0.82 basis points) due to a higher proportion of lower yielding daily leverage certificates in 1H FY24. Overall turnover velocity for the first half of FY2024 was 34% (37%).</p>
<p>The increase in securities settlement, depository management, corporate action and other revenue was mainly due to higher interest income from handling of corporate actions, partially offset by lower number of settlement instructions.</p>
<p>Equities &ndash; Derivatives</p>
<p>Equities &ndash; Derivatives revenue declined 6.9% to S$160.7 million (S$172.6 million) and accounted for 27.1% (30.2%) of total revenue.</p>
<ul>
<li>Trading and clearing revenue: S$123.2 million, down 15.3% from S$145.4 million</li>
<li>Treasury and other revenue: S$37.5 million, up 37.7% from S$27.2 million</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The decline in trading and clearing revenue was due to a 14.0% decline in total equity derivatives volumes, mainly from declines in volumes of GIFT Nifty and FTSE China A50 index futures contracts. Excluding Nifty, trading and clearing revenue decreased 5.1%.</p>
<p>Treasury and other revenue increased mainly due to higher average yields on margin deposits, partially offset by a decrease in margin balances.</p>
<p>Average fee per contract for Equity, Currency and Commodity derivatives was lower at S$1.54 (S$1.58) mainly driven by a decline in the average fee of Nifty 50 index futures, due to reclass of NSE fee arrangement from expense to revenue as part of GIFT Connect. On a pro forma basis<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn6"><sup><sup>[6]</sup></sup></a>, 1H FY2024 average fee per contract remained comparable at S$1.54 (S$1.53) from a year ago.</p>
<p>Platform and Others</p>
<p>Platform and Others revenue increased 8.0% to S$120.1 million (S$111.2 million) and accounted for 20.3% (19.5%) of total revenue.</p>
<ul>
<li>Market data revenue: S$24.2 million, up 9.9% from S$22.0 million</li>
<li>Connectivity revenue: S$38.5 million, up 8.7% from S$35.4 million</li>
<li>Indices and other revenue<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn7"><sup><sup>[7]</sup></sup></a>: S$57.4 million, up 6.8% from S$53.8 million</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The increase in Market data revenue was driven by higher revenue realised from Securities and Derivatives Market Direct Feed subscribers, as well as growth in distribution of Commodities data.</p>
<p>The increase in Connectivity revenue was mainly due to higher revenue from co-location subscribers.</p>
<p>Indices and other revenue increased mainly from higher revenue contribution from EMC and Indices.</p>
<p>Expenses Overview</p>
<p>Total expenses increased 3.0% to S$296.1 million (S$287.4 million), mainly from higher staff costs and technology costs, offset by lower royalties and professional fees.</p>
<p>Adjusted total expenses increased 3.5% to S$289.7 million (S$279.9 million), which excludes amortisation of purchased intangible assets.</p>
<p>Total capital expenditure was S$18.5 million (S$17.8 million). These investments include upgrades to our Titan OTC trade reporting system, modernisation of our technology infrastructure and consolidation of our office spaces.</p>
<p>We are cautious on the near-term outlook as prospects for global growth appear muted. Rising geopolitical tensions and divergence in economic performance are likely to add to the headwinds and uncertainties that we are facing. As such, we will remain prudent in managing our expenses and capital expenditure.</p>
<p>Expense growth in FY2024 is likely to be similar to the 3% year-on-year expense growth rate observed in the first half of FY2024, lower than the previously guided mid-single digit percentage range. Our projected capital expenditure for FY2024 is anticipated to be within S$70-75 million, lower than our previously guided S$75-80 million range.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;As a result of the new presentation format, the main change in the FICC segment is the reclassification of revenue streams from EMC and Baltic Exchange to Platform and Others.</p>

<title>ASIC’s Guidance For Market Intermediaries On Pre-Hedging</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asics-guidance-for-market-intermediaries-on-pre-hedging/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asics-guidance-for-market-intermediaries-on-pre-hedging/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>KEY POINTS</h2>
<ul>
<li>ASIC has published a letter to market intermediary CEOs setting out its guidance regarding pre-hedging practices in Australia.</li>
<li>ASIC is concerned with how differences in market intermediaries&rsquo; approach to pre-hedging can disrupt fair competition and the effective functioning of markets.</li>
<li>Market intermediaries should always carefully consider their obligations under Australian law and applicable international codes and standards when undertaking pre-hedging.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Pre-hedging practices in Australia</h2>
<p>Pre-hedging is a practice that occurs in financial markets and can help the effective functioning of markets by facilitating trades that could otherwise significantly impact market pricing.</p>
<p>ASIC acknowledges that pre-hedging has a role in markets, including in the management of market intermediaries&rsquo; risk associated with anticipated client orders and may assist in liquidity provision and execution for clients. However, it can also create significant conflicts of interest between a client and the market intermediary which actively trades in possession of confidential information about the client&rsquo;s anticipated order or trade.</p>
<p>Market intermediaries need to manage confidential client information very carefully and have robust, closely monitored and frequently tested arrangements for ensuring conflicts of interest are appropriately managed and in compliance with the&nbsp;<em>Corporations Act 2001.</em></p>
<p>ASIC has also observed a wide range of pre-hedging practices in the Australian market, with some falling significantly short of its expectations. Differences in pre-hedging practices can disrupt fair competition and the effective functioning of markets.</p>
<p>Raising and harmonising minimum standards of conduct is a key focus of ASIC and an increasing focus among international regulators and standard setters, including the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the Financial Markets Standards Board (FMSB), and the FX Global Code.</p>
<p>If pre-hedging is not carried out in an appropriate manner it can be unfair, unconscionable and result in poor client outcomes. This may adversely impact investor confidence and undermine market integrity.</p>
<p>ASIC encourages market intermediaries to carefully consider the guidance set out in the letter below.</p>

<title>Federal Reserve Issues FOMC statement</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> expanding pace, job gains, low unemployment, inflation, monetary policy  
Summary: Recent indicators show solid economic expansion with moderated job gains and low unemployment. Inflation remains elevated, and the Committee maintains the federal funds rate target range at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent. They aim for maximum employment and 2 percent inflation, closely monitoring incoming data for adjustments in the monetary policy stance. Voting members include Chair Jerome H. Powell. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace. Job gains have moderated since early last year but remain strong, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation has eased over the past year but remains elevated.</p>
<p>The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee remains highly attentive to inflation risks.</p>
<p>In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in its previously announced plans. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.</p>
<p>In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.</p>
<p>Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Thomas I. Barkin; Michael S. Barr; Raphael W. Bostic; Michelle W. Bowman; Lisa D. Cook; Mary C. Daly; Philip N. Jefferson; Adriana D. Kugler; Loretta J. Mester; and Christopher J. Waller.</p>

<div> updates, Federal Open Market Committee, investment, trading, policy
The Federal Open Market Committee has announced updates to its investment and trading policy to ensure impartiality and integrity. The updates include stricter restrictions on staff investment and trading activities, increased coverage of staff, and a new compliance regime for those with access to sensitive information. These changes will take effect on June 30, 2024.

Summary:<br />The Federal Open Market Committee has updated its policy on investment and trading to enhance impartiality and integrity. The updates include stricter restrictions on staff, increased coverage, and a new compliance regime for those with access to sensitive information. These changes will be effective on June 30, 2024. <div>

<div id="article">
<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-8">
<p>The Federal Open Market Committee on Wednesday announced updates that further enhance its policy on investment and trading. The policy, which was first adopted in 2022, aims to support public confidence in the impartiality and integrity of the Committee's work by guarding against even the appearance of any conflict of interest.</p>
<p>The updates will increase the number of Federal Reserve System staff who will be covered by the most stringent restrictions on investment and trading activities and will tighten restrictions on all staff with access to confidential FOMC information. Additionally, the updated policy supports a new compliance regime where staff with access to the most sensitive FOMC information may be directed to submit brokerage statements or other securities transaction statements to verify the accuracy of their financial disclosures.</p>
<p>The existing policy already prohibits senior Federal Reserve officials involved in monetary policy decision-making from purchasing individual stocks or sector funds; holding investments in individual bonds, agency securities, cryptocurrencies, commodities, or foreign currencies; entering into derivatives contracts; and engaging in short sales or purchasing securities on margin. The policy also requires those officials to provide 45-days' non-retractable notice for securities transactions and receive prior approval.</p>
<p>The new restrictions in the policy are effective on June 30, 2024.</p>

<title>Moa Langemark Is Finansinspektionen’s New Consumer Protection Economist</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/moa-langemark-is-finansinspektionens-new-consumer-protection-economist/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>A clear and independent voice is needed to help consumers on the financial market. Moa Langemark will now take on the role of consumer protection economist at Finansinspektionen. She will undertake overall responsibility for supporting and developing our consumer protection work. Together with Director General Daniel Barr, Moa will also be FI&rsquo;s spokesperson in consumer protection-related matters.</span></p>
<div class="editor-content">
<p>Every day many people in Sweden must make major &ndash; and often difficult &ndash; financial decisions, for example saving for their pension or borrowing money to buy a home. At the same time, it can be difficult to understand how the financial market works or know where to turn for information. Consumers receive a deluge of financial tips and advice, often from financial companies.</p>
<p>"Consumer protection is a focus area at FI. It is related to both how we conduct our supervision of financial firms and the communication that directly targets consumers. As our new consumer protection economist, Moa Langemark will be able to contribute independent guidance that is not linked to commercial interests," says Finansinspektionen's Director General Daniel Barr.</p>
<p>Moa Langemark has extensive experience in consumer protection, most recently as a senior advisor on consumer protection at FI and from previous positions at the Department of Finance and as a savings analyst at Avanza Bank.</p>
<p>"We know that many consumers find their personal finances a bit complicated and boring. I want more people to understand how they can gain control over their wallets, often by following a few simple steps. With FI's expert knowledge behind me, I hope to be able to help more consumers find the right products and avoid traps in the financial market," says Moa Langemark, consumer protection economist at FI.</p>

<title>Identity Theft: BaFin Warns Consumers About The Website heptagoninvestments.com</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="abstract">
<p>The Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (<abbr lang="de" title="Bundesanstalt f&uuml;r Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht" xml:lang="de">BaFin</abbr>) is currently investigating the unknown operator of the website heptagoninvestments.com. The operator uses this website to offer financial and investment services without the required authorisation. The website is not operated by the British firm Heptagon Capital LLP. This is a case of identity theft targeting the aforementioned firm, which is registered with the British Financial Conduct Authority (<abbr title="Financial Conduct Authority">FCA</abbr>).</p>
</div>
<div class="wrapBodytext">
<p>The&nbsp;<abbr title="Financial Conduct Authority">FCA</abbr>&nbsp;has issued a warning on its website stating that a fraudulent &ldquo;clone firm&rdquo; is operating under the name Heptagon Capital LLP. That warning makes explicit reference to the website heptagoninvestments.com.<br />When dealing with customers, the clone firm uses various company names such as Heptagon Capital Investments Ltd, Heptagon Capital, Heptagon Capital LLP and Heptagon Capital Limited.<br /><br />Furthermore, business documentation available on the website states that FIBINANCE is the operator. According to BaFin&rsquo;s information, this operator used to call itself AxianceFx. The operator provides two business addresses: one in Valetta, Malta, as well as that of the registered office of the firm registered with the&nbsp;<abbr title="Financial Conduct Authority">FCA</abbr>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li>The Chicago Business Barometer&trade;, produced  with MNI, tempered by -1.2 points to 46.0 from  December&rsquo;s revised figure of 47.2. This is the  second consecutive monthly fall, keeping the  Chicago ReportTM in contractionary territory,  although still +0.6 points above the 2023 average  and above the levels seen in both September 2023  and October 2023.&nbsp;</li>
<li>All of the subcomponents included in the  headline index rose compared to December&rsquo;s revised levels, apart from Production which  plunged -9.9 points into contractionary territory.</li>
<li>&nbsp;Production fell -9.9 points to 48.7 points,  reentering contraction, and is the lowest since  October 2023. This was driven by a larger  proportion of respondents reporting lower  production, but this may have been at least partly  due to the severe weather.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Order Backlogs grew +2.8 points. With the  exception of November 2023, this is the highest  since April 2023.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Supplier Deliveries inched up +1.0 points. Again,  with the exception of November 2023 this was the  highest since April 2023 and the third consecutive  month in expansionary territory</li>
<li>New Orders saw a small increase of +1.4 points,  remaining in contractionary territory but above the  2023 average of 44.1.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Employment crept up +0.5 points to 46.7 points.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Inventories (which are not included in the  calculation for the headline index) declined -3.1  points, the lowest since July 2023, with the highest  proportion of respondents reporting lower  inventories since October 2009.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Prices paid slipped for the first time since  September 2023 by -4.1 points to 63.9 points.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The survey ran from January 2 to January 17.</li>

<title>ACER Calls For Improvements To The New Gas Transmission Tariffs Proposed For Poland</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/acer-calls-for-improvements-to-the-new-gas-transmission-tariffs-proposed-for-pol/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ACER publishes today its report on the tariff consultation for the Polish transmission network. The report provides recommendations to URE, the Polish National Regulatory Authority (NRA), on the proposed tariff methodology which will be used to set the tariffs for 2025 and 2026. The proposed methodology is based on the results of a consultation carried out by the Polish Transmission System Operator (TSO), which concluded on 19 January 2024.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What does ACER recommend?</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Justify the proposed discount</strong>: the TSO proposed 100% discount at the entry point of the LNG terminal to increase the security of supply of the Polish network. ACER recommends that URE provides further justification on how the discount is set and how it supports this goal.</li>
<li><strong>Set a fixed entry-exit split</strong>: despite the network code on harmonised transmission tariff structures (<a href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtSUgVTV1BUVkwPAlcGHVZYDQ4dUFsAXhpWAAoCVlJRAgcJUgYdVQFaUl0EV1sdUg1UUh0GDAJSGg1RA1QZBQBTAlIHA1gHXFQERQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" target="_blank">NC TAR</a>) prescribing a fixed entry-exit split, the TSO proposes a variable split. ACER recommends setting a fixed entry-exit split to improve the predictability of network tariffs (e.g. network users could better forecast network tariffs).</li>
<li><strong>Provide forecasts</strong>: ACER recommends that the NRA explains the indicative evolution of tariffs in 2025 and 2026. This information will be useful for network users to understand the proposed methodology and its impact over time.</li>
<li><strong>Reconciliation of non-transmission services</strong>: ACER recommends reconciling potential under- or over-recoveries for both transmission and non-transmission services, separately. Doing so will enhance the accuracy of cost reflectivity of tariff.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the next steps?</span></p>
<p>By 18 July 2024, URE should adopt a motivated decision on the tariff methodology to be applied to the Polish transmission network. This decision shall also take ACER&rsquo;s recommendations into account.</p>

<div> EGX, Egyptian Exchange, stock market, indices, review
Summary:
EGX conducted its semi-annual review of the stock market indices for July to December 2023. EGX30, EGX30 Capped, and EGX30 TR saw changes in 3 companies. EGX70 EWI excluded 17 companies, with 3 joining EGX30 and another 17 joining. EGX100 EWI saw 14 companies excluded and 14 others included. Bond indices also saw changes. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The Egyptian Exchange (EGX) completed the semi-annual review of the Egyptian stock market indices, for the period from July to December 2023.</p>
<p>EGX30, EGX30 Capped, and EGX30 TR witnessed a change of 3 companies, while EGX70 EWI witnessed the exclusion of 17 companies, 3 of which joined EGX30, and another 17 joined. EGX100 EWI witnessed the exclusion of 14 companies and the inclusion of 14 others.</p>
<p>The Egyptian Exchange (EGX) conducts review twice a year on the stock indices, the first ends in January, and is scheduled to be effective on 1<sup>st</sup> February, and the second review ends by the end of July and is scheduled to be effective on 1<sup>st</sup> August.</p>
<p>The review monitors the changes in companies' different criteria and measures according to the methodologies of each index.</p>
<p>The Egyptian Exchange has developed its main indices&rsquo; methodologies to enhance the importance of liquidity and activity rates of the constituents included in the index:</p>
<p>For The Main Index (EGX30): its methodology has been developed by modifying the criteria of trading days required to join the index. Currently, the company's shares have to be traded in 95% of the trading days during the review period, instead of 65%.</p>
<p>In addition, the methodology of the EGX70 EWI index has been developed by modifying the Index's criteria of trading days required to join the index. Currently, the company's shares have to be traded in 90% of the trading days during the review period, instead of 65%.</p>
<p>Also, two additional liquidity criteria have been added, The first criterion stipulates that the average daily number of trading investors shall not be less than 0.1% of the daily average number of trading investors in the total market during the review period.</p>
<p>The second criterion stipulates that the turnover rate of free-float shares shall not be less than 10% over the last six months, or that the average daily traded value shall not be less than 0.0005 of the daily average traded value of main market.</p>
<p>During the review period, the treasury bonds index witnessed a number of changes, as 21 issues were removed from the index compared to the inclusion of 2 issues of treasury bonds, thus bringing the total number of bonds constituting the index to 19 issues. It is worth noting that the Egyptian Exchange conducts a monthly review of Treasury bond indices, according to the criteria of inclusion and exclusion in the indices methodology.</p>
<p>The ongoing development of the methodology of the different market indices comes in line with international best practices, and after consultation with the different capital market parties and representatives in the Indices committee in the Egyptian Exchange, and in the framework of the financial community dialogue held during the discussion of &ldquo;the strategy of the Egyptian Exchange's Board of Directors for Development&rdquo; in accordance with clause 36 thereof.</p>
<p align="left">The following are changes in constituents for the EGX Indices, which will take place as of the close of January 31, 2024.</p>

<title>ESMA: Remarkable Resilience Of Financial Markets In A Higher-For-Longer Interest-Rate Environment</title>

<div> Keywords: financial markets, risk drivers, interest rates, sustainable finance, market monitoring

Summary:
- ESMA identifies key risk drivers in financial markets, including geopolitical and macro-financial uncertainty.
- Retail investors need to be cautious of false information on social media.
- Increased interest rates will impact financial stability and investors.
- Sustainable finance has seen slowed growth in ESG markets.
- Market monitoring shows increased volatility, credit risk, and cyber incidents in the financial sector.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify">The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, today publishes its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-01/ESMA50-524821-3107_TRV_1-24_risk_monitor.pdf">first risk monitoring report of 2024</a>, where it sets out the key risk drivers currently facing financial markets.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify">Verena Ross, ESMA&rsquo;s Chair, said:&nbsp;</p>
<h6 class="text-align-justify"><em>&ldquo;At ESMA we are observing a financial system that has shown a high level of resilience. Looking ahead, markets are set to remain very sensitive and risks of market corrections continue to be high, given geopolitical and macro-financial&nbsp;uncertainty. In this context, maintaining trust in financial markets is of particular concern to ESMA, and key to achieving our mission to protect investors.&nbsp;</em></h6>
<h6 class="text-align-justify"><em>Retail investors increasingly get their updates through social media, and we again stress the need to be aware of the risk of receiving false or misleading information through these media. All investors should verify the reliability and the quality of the information they use in their investment decisions.</em></h6>
<h6 class="text-align-justify"><em>Financial stability and investors will be impacted by increased interest rates which are expected to remain higher for longer. This environment has a negative impact on credit quality and real estate valuations. Finally, greenwashing entails the risk of limiting the role finance can play in the transition to a more sustainable future.&rdquo;</em></h6>
<p class="text-align-justify">Beyond the risk drivers, ESMA&rsquo;s report provides an update on structural developments and the status of key sectors of financial markets, during the second half of 2023.</p>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Structural developments</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>Market-based finance:&nbsp;</span>Access to capital markets for European corporates continued to be mainly through fixed income markets and securitised products in 2H23. Equity primary markets slightly picked up, but IPO activity was strained due to uncertain market conditions. Corporate bond issuance remained strong during 2H23. The corporate bond outlook will be shaped by a significant upcoming maturity wall from 2024 until 2028, with corporate debt sustainability remaining a considerable risk, especially in lower quality segments.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>Sustainable finance:</span>&nbsp;Following several years of uninterrupted growth, the take up of ESG investing and growth of ESG markets have levelled off in recent quarters. The ESG bond market grew at a slower pace, while gross issuance volumes declined. SFDR Article 9 funds with a sustainable investment objective faced net outflows for the first time in 4Q23, and outflows from SFDR Article 8 funds promoting environmental or social characteristics accelerated, with the use of ESG-related terms in fund names a key factor of differentiation between these funds.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>Financial innovation:</span>&nbsp;Crypto-asset valuations rebounded in 2023, fuelled by the hope that spot crypto ETFs would obtain approval by the US SEC, which they did in January 2024. Still, at EUR&nbsp;1.5tn, total market capitalisation of crypto assets remains half of the 2021 historical peak. The use of artificial intelligence in finance is growing around a wide range of applications, even though dedicated AI-investment instruments remain limited.</p>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Market monitoring</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>Securities markets:</span>&nbsp;Equity valuations were moderately up in 2H23 driven by an end-of-year rally linked to expectations of 2024 interest rate decreases. Volatility remained contained, while bid-ask spreads increased, highlighting market nervousness. Fixed-income markets were lower overall towards the end of 2023, with marked declines in yields for sovereign and corporate bonds in December. Credit quality of high-yield non-financials continued to decline, particularly associated with real estate, with default rates trending upwards.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><a><span>Asset management:</span>&nbsp;</a>EU fund performance and flows were volatile in 2H23. Investors preferred fixed income funds over equity funds, and MMFs specifically attracted significant inflows on higher interest rates and the inversion of the yield curve. Overall, risks stabilised but remained elevated, especially liquidity and credit risk. While funds managed the transition to higher interest rates, concerns remained regarding the valuation of real-estate fund assets in a falling market.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><a><span>Consumers:</span>&nbsp;</a>Sentiment among consumers remained weak amid geopolitical uncertainty and subdued growth, despite falling inflation. At higher interest rates, consumers raised holdings of bonds, both directly and via investment funds, and average performance of retail investments improved in 3Q23. Real-estate exposures via retail AIFs are a source of risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><a><span>Infrastructures and services:</span>&nbsp;</a>Equity-trading volumes showed a slight year-on-year decrease amid low volatility. Settlement fails remained broadly stable in 2H23, after their 1H23 fall. Cyber incidents in the financial sector globally remain elevated, even if they went down in 3Q23.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">&nbsp;</p>

<div> ETFs, Xetra, assets, trading volume, interest rates<br />
Summary: <br />
- ETF assets on Xetra reach EUR 1.29 trillion, up 26%<br />
- Xetra lists 123 new ETFs, totaling 2,125 products<br />
- ETF trading volume on Xetra is EUR 169.5 billion<br />
- Bond ETFs benefit from rising interest rates<br />
- Active ETFs see a 48.5% increase in fund assets and 34.6% increase in trading volume.<br /> <div>
<div class="text-highlight">
<div>
<p class="align--justify"><span>- Invested assets in the ETF segment on Xetra rise by 26 per cent to a new record of EUR 1.29 trillion</span><br /><span>- Continued high listing activity expands product range by 123 to 2,125 ETFs</span><br /><span>- Xetra continues to be Europe&rsquo;s largest ETF exchange in terms of number of products listed and trading volume</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="detailText">
<div class="paragraph">
<div>
<p>The market for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Xetra continued to record a high level of investor interest last year: ETF fund assets reached a new high of EUR 1.29 trillion, an increase of 26 per cent (2022: EUR 1.02 trillion). In the same period, the product range on Xetra expanded by 123 ETFs to a new record of 2,125 ETFs (2022: 2,002 ETFs). Against a backdrop of lower market volatility, overall ETF trading activity across Europe declined last year, resulting in an ETF trading volume of EUR 169.5 billion for Xetra (2022: EUR 232.8 billion). With this volume, Xetra was once again the ETF trading venue with the highest turnover among all European exchanges.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div>
<p class="align--justify p--heading-2">Bond ETFs benefit from changed interest rate environment</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div>
<p class="align--justify">One of the standout trends in the past year was the positive development of fixed income ETFs. &ldquo;Bond ETFs have clearly benefited from the turnaround in interest rates,&rdquo; says Stephan Kraus, head of Deutsche B&ouml;rse&rsquo;s ETF &amp; ETP segment. &ldquo;Last year, for the first time in more than ten years, a bond product was among the most traded ETFs on Xetra. Money market ETFs are thus increasingly establishing themselves as an alternative to traditional overnight money accounts,&rdquo; Kraus continues. Fund assets invested in money market ETFs on Xetra amounted to EUR 6.8 billion at the end of the year, up 185 per cent year-on-year (December 2022: EUR 2.4 billion). The corresponding Xetra trading volume in 2023 was EUR 2.9 billion (+ 67.6 percent; 2022: EUR 1.7 billion).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div>
<p class="align--justify">In addition, higher interest rates also paved the way for innovations such as the listing of fixed-maturity bond ETFs: &ldquo;The addition of fixed-maturity bond ETFs to the Xetra product range was one of the most successful product launches in recent years. The new ETFs have a fixed maturity date and offer investors a simple way to make diversified investments in bonds that are held to maturity&rdquo;, explains Kraus. Only a few months after the start of trading, 19 fixed-maturity ETFs with an investment volume of more than EUR 2 billion were already tradable on Xetra at the end of 2023.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div>
<p class="align--justify p--heading-2">Growing investor interest in active ETFs</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div>
<p class="align--justify">Active ETFs benefited disproportionately from the general increase in ETF demand last year. Fund assets managed by active ETFs on Xetra increased by 48.5 per cent year-on-year to a new high of &euro;22.3 billion (December 2022: &euro;15.0 billion). The trading volume also recorded a significant increase to EUR 1.2 billion (+ 34.6 per cent; 2022: EUR 903 million). &ldquo;The above-average growth rates for active ETFs show that ETF investments are no longer exclusively reserved for index products but are increasingly being used for active investment strategies as well. Investors also benefit from the significant advantages of the ETF structure for these products, such as continuous tradability, high transparency, and attractive fees&rdquo;, says Kraus. At the end of the year, the range of active ETFs on Xetra comprised 119 products (+31 ETFs; 2022: 88 active ETFs).</p>

<p><span>*Net revenues include Other Revenues which primarily reflect revenues associated with the European power trading and clearing business which is pending sale. Refer to the financial tables at the end of this press release for fourth quarter and full year Other Revenues.</span></p>
<p><span>
Adena Friedman, Chair and CEO</span>&nbsp;said, &ldquo;We delivered another strong year of operating performance in a dynamic economic and capital markets backdrop. We executed well across our business in 2023, maintaining our listings leadership in the&nbsp;U.S., achieving a breakthrough year for&nbsp;Verafin&nbsp;in our strategy to move upmarket, and introducing new innovations across our products and services.</p>
<p>We successfully completed our acquisition of Adenza, bolstering our suite of mission-critical technology solutions, and accelerating our strategic vision of being the trusted fabric of the world's financial system.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>
Sarah Youngwood, Executive Vice President and CFO</span>&nbsp;said, &ldquo;I am excited to join Nasdaq at such a transformational time for the firm.</p>
<p>Despite an uncertain environment, we delivered solid financial performance and strong cash flow generation.</p>
<p>With our acquisition of Adenza now closed, we are focused on achieving our deal-related financial goals including our cross-sell and synergy targets as well as debt paydown.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>FINANCIAL REVIEW</span></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>2023 net revenues were&nbsp;$3,895 million, an increase of&nbsp;$313 million, or 9%, from&nbsp;$3,582 million&nbsp;in the prior year period. Net revenue growth included&nbsp;$178 million, or 5%, from organic growth and a&nbsp;$141 million, or 4%, net benefit from acquisitions and divestitures, including&nbsp;$149 million&nbsp;in revenue from Adenza, which was partially offset by a&nbsp;$6 million&nbsp;decrease from the impact of changes in FX rates.</li>
<li>Fourth quarter 2023 net revenues were&nbsp;$1,117 million, an increase of&nbsp;$211 million, or 23%, from&nbsp;$906 million&nbsp;in the prior year period. Net revenues reflected a&nbsp;$59 million, or 7%, positive impact from organic growth, a&nbsp;$148 million&nbsp;net benefit from acquisitions and divestitures including Adenza, and a&nbsp;$4 million&nbsp;increase from the impact of changes in FX rates.</li>
<li>Solutions revenue was&nbsp;$860 million&nbsp;in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of&nbsp;$210 million, or 32%, with organic growth of 9%, reflecting growth from both the Capital Access Platforms and Financial Technology divisions. ARR reflects the majority of Solutions revenue but excludes the AUM and transaction licensing components of our Index business. ARR grew 29% year over year or 6% organically.</li>
<li>Market Services net revenues were&nbsp;$247 million&nbsp;in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of&nbsp;$2 million, or 1%. The increase reflects&nbsp;$1 million&nbsp;in organic growth and a&nbsp;$1 million&nbsp;positive impact from changes in FX rates.</li>
<li>2023 GAAP operating expenses were&nbsp;$2,317 million, an increase of&nbsp;$299 million, or 15% over 2022. Fourth quarter 2023 GAAP operating expenses were&nbsp;$765 million, an increase of&nbsp;$208 million, or 37%, versus the prior year period. The increase for 2023 and the fourth quarter of 2023 is due to the inclusion of&nbsp;$94 million&nbsp;of Adenza operating expenses (including the amortization expense of acquired intangible assets), an increase in merger and strategic initiatives expense and restructuring costs. The expense increase in both periods reflects continued investment in our people and our businesses to drive long term growth, partially offset by lower professional services.</li>
<li>2023 non-GAAP operating expenses were&nbsp;$1,830 million, an increase of&nbsp;$109 million, or 6% over 2022, including an organic increase of&nbsp;$89 million, or 5%. Fourth quarter 2023 non-GAAP operating expenses were&nbsp;$504 million, an increase of&nbsp;$44 million, or 10% versus the prior year period, including an organic increase of&nbsp;$8 million, or 2%. The increase for 2023 and the fourth quarter of 2023 is primarily due to the inclusion of&nbsp;$35 million&nbsp;of Adenza operating expenses. The increase in both periods also reflects increased expenses associated with the continued investment in our people and our businesses to drive long term growth, higher computer operations and data costs, and higher depreciation. These impacts were partially offset by decreased professional services fees in both the quarter and year ended 2023.</li>
<li>The company returned&nbsp;$127 million&nbsp;to shareholders through dividends, repurchased&nbsp;$110 million&nbsp;in shares of its common stock, and repaid&nbsp;$260 million&nbsp;in debt during the fourth quarter of 2023. As of&nbsp;December&nbsp;31, 2023, there was&nbsp;$1.9 billion&nbsp;remaining under the board authorized share repurchase program.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>INITIATING 2024 EXPENSE AND TAX GUIDANCE</span><span><span>5</span></span></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>The company is initiating its 2024 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to a range of&nbsp;$2,105 million&nbsp;to&nbsp;$2,185 million, and its 2024 non-GAAP tax rate guidance to be in the range of 24.5% to 26.5%.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>STRATEGIC AND BUSINESS UPDATES</span></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><span>Nasdaq completed transformative acquisition of Adenza.</span>&nbsp;Nasdaq completed its acquisition of Adenza, a provider of mission-critical risk management, regulatory reporting, and capital markets software to the financial services industry from a leading software investment firm,&nbsp;
Thoma Bravo, on&nbsp;November 1, 2023. The acquisition enhances Nasdaq&rsquo;s technology solutions and further expands the company&rsquo;s complementary offerings across mission-critical capital markets infrastructure and compliance. In addition, Adenza&rsquo;s financial profile is highly attractive and is expected to enhance Nasdaq&rsquo;s organic revenue growth rate and improve the company&rsquo;s operating margins as the deal synergies are achieved.</li>
<li><span>Adenza continued new client wins and cloud progress under the Nasdaq brand.</span>&nbsp;Adenza added 6 new clients in November and December, including 2 new central banks. In total, Adenza garnered 23 new clients in 2023, up from 17 in the prior year, highlighting continued demand for these mission-critical products amidst a dynamic market environment. Overall, cloud represented nearly 50% of new annual contract value in the year, underscoring the ongoing cloud progress at Adenza which Nasdaq aims to bolster and accelerate going forward.</li>
<li><span>Verafin&nbsp;had a breakthrough year in its move upmarket and realized strong small-to-medium bank growth.</span>&nbsp;Verafin&nbsp;signed both a Tier 1 and a Tier 2 bank client in the fourth quarter, bringing the total number of Tier 1 bank clients signed in the year to 3 and the total number of Tier 2 bank clients signed in the year to 4. 2023 was a milestone year in Verafin&rsquo;s move upmarket including its first Tier 1 bank signing.&nbsp;Verafin&nbsp;also realized continued adoption by small-to-medium banks resulting in 100 overall new clients added in the fourth quarter and 237 overall new clients added in 2023.</li>
<li><span>Index generated&nbsp;$31 billion&nbsp;in exchange traded product (ETP) net inflows during 2023.</span>&nbsp;In 2023, ETPs linked to Nasdaq indices realized&nbsp;$31 billion&nbsp;of net inflows, ending the year at&nbsp;$473 billion&nbsp;in assets under management. Nasdaq supported our clients in launching 83 new products linked to Nasdaq indices, bringing to market robust solutions in-line with investor demand.</li>
<li><span>Nasdaq maintained its listings leadership in the&nbsp;U.S.</span>&nbsp;Nasdaq led&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;exchanges for operating company IPOs with a 71% total win rate in the fourth quarter of 2023 and an 81% total win rate in 2023. In a muted capital markets year, Nasdaq welcomed 103 U.S. operating company IPOs that raised more than&nbsp;$11 billion&nbsp;in proceeds, marking Nasdaq&rsquo;s fifth consecutive year as the leading&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;listing exchange in terms of both number of IPOs and proceeds raised. During the year, three of the five largest&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;operating company IPOs by capital raised chose to list with Nasdaq: Arm, Instacart, and Nextracker.</li>
<li><span>Nasdaq continued market modernization with the migration of its second&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;options market to&nbsp;Amazon Web Services&nbsp;(AWS).</span>&nbsp;Nasdaq successfully completed the migration of the core trading system of Nasdaq GEMX, one of Nasdaq's six options exchanges, to AWS. The new cloud-enabled market infrastructure, which uses AWS Outposts, delivers up to a 10% improvement in latency and the ability to more seamlessly adjust capacity in response to changing market conditions, which can deliver a better trading environment for market participants.</li>
<li><span>Market technology growth included significant&nbsp;Latin America&nbsp;(LATAM) client wins.</span>&nbsp;Nasdaq market technology continued its progress in providing critical technology underpinning global financial market infrastructure providers with particular strength in LATAM. In the fourth quarter, Nasdaq partnered with nuam exchange, formed by the merger of the&nbsp;Chile,&nbsp;Peru, and&nbsp;Colombia&nbsp;stock exchanges, to provide technology that will underpin the integration, development, and expansion of the new marketplace in LATAM, and expanded its partnership with BMV, the&nbsp;Mexican Stock Exchange, to modernize its entire post-trade technology platform across clearing and settlement.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>NASDAQ TO HOST 2024 INVESTOR DAY</span></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Nasdaq announced that it will host its 2024 Investor Day on&nbsp;Tuesday, March 5, 2024. The event will feature presentations on the company&rsquo;s operations and strategy, as well as question and answer sessions, with members of Nasdaq&rsquo;s senior leadership team including&nbsp;
Adena Friedman, Chair and CEO, and&nbsp;
Sarah Youngwood, Executive Vice President and CFO. A registration for the webcast of the event can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/wqhcvms2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>____________</span></p>
<p><span>1&nbsp;</span>Represents revenues less transaction-based expenses.</p>
<p><span>2&nbsp;</span>Constitutes revenues from our Capital Access Platforms and Financial Technology segments.</p>
<p><span>3&nbsp;</span>Refer to our reconciliations of&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP to non-GAAP net income, diluted earnings per share, operating income, operating expenses and organic impacts included in the attached schedules.</p>
<p><span>4</span>&nbsp;Annualized&nbsp;Recurring&nbsp;Revenue&nbsp;(ARR) for a given period is the current annualized value derived from subscription contracts with a defined contract value. This excludes contracts that are not recurring, are one-time in nature or where the contract value fluctuates based on defined metrics. ARR is currently one of our key performance metrics to assess the health and trajectory of our recurring business. ARR does not have any standardized definition and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those items. For Adenza recurring revenue contracts, the amount included in ARR is consistent with the amount that we invoice the customer during the current period. Additionally, for Adenza recurring revenue contracts that include annual values that increase over time, we include in ARR only the annualized value of components of the contract that are considered active as of the date of the ARR calculation. We do not include the future committed increases in the contract value as of the date of the ARR calculation. ARR is not a forecast and the active contracts at the end of a reporting period used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers.</p>
<p><span>5&nbsp;</span>U.S.&nbsp;GAAP operating expense and tax rate guidance are not provided due to the inherent difficulty in quantifying certain amounts due to a variety of factors including the unpredictability in the movement in foreign currency rates, as well as future charges or reversals outside of the normal course of business.</p>

<p><span>NON-GAAP INFORMATION</span></p>
<p>In addition to disclosing results determined in accordance with&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP, Nasdaq also discloses certain non-GAAP results of operations, including, but not limited to, non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP operating expenses, that include certain adjustments or exclude certain charges and gains that are described in the reconciliation table of&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP to non-GAAP information provided at the end of this release. Management uses this non-GAAP information internally, along with&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP information, in evaluating our performance and in making financial and operational decisions. We believe our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and supplemental data relating to our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of results as the items described below in the reconciliation tables do not reflect ongoing operating performance.</p>
<p>These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to,&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate such measures differently, which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. This information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant as a substitute for our operating results in accordance with&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP. We recommend investors review the&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP financial measures included in this earnings release. When viewed in conjunction with our&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide greater transparency and a more complete understanding of factors affecting our business than&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP measures alone.</p>
<p>We understand that analysts and investors regularly rely on non-GAAP financial measures, such as those noted above, to assess operating performance. We use these measures because they highlight trends more clearly in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our ongoing operating performance.</p>
<p><span>Organic revenue and expense growth, organic change and organic impact</span>&nbsp;are non-GAAP measures that reflect adjustments for: (i) the impact of period-over-period changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and (ii) the revenues, expenses and operating income associated with acquisitions and divestitures for the twelve month period following the date of the acquisition or divestiture. Reconciliations of these measures are described within the body of this release or in the reconciliation tables at the end of this release.</p>
<p><span>Foreign exchange impact:</span>&nbsp;In countries with currencies other than the&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;dollar, revenues and expenses are translated using monthly average exchange rates. Certain discussions in this release isolate the impact of year-over-year foreign currency fluctuations to better measure the comparability of operating results between periods. Operating results excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations are calculated by translating the current period&rsquo;s results by the prior period&rsquo;s exchange rates.</p>
<p><span>Restructuring programs</span>: In the fourth quarter of 2023, following the closing of the Adenza acquisition, our management approved, committed to and initiated a restructuring program, &ldquo;Adenza Restructuring&rdquo; to optimize our efficiencies as a combined organization. In connection with this program, we expect to incur pre-tax charges principally related to employee-related costs, contract terminations, real estate impairments and other related costs. We expect to achieve benefits primarily in the form of expense and revenue synergies. In&nbsp;October 2022, following our September announcement to realign our segments and leadership, we initiated a divisional alignment program with a focus on realizing the full potential of this structure. In connection with the program, we expect to incur pre-tax charges principally related to employee-related costs, consulting, asset impairments and contract terminations over a two-year period. We expect to achieve benefits in the form of both increased customer engagement and operating efficiencies. Costs related to the Adenza restructuring and the divisional alignment programs will be recorded as &ldquo;restructuring&rdquo; in our consolidated statements of income. We will exclude charges associated with this program for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures as they are not reflective of ongoing operating performance or comparisons in Nasdaq's performance between periods.</p>

<td colspan="16">(1) Annualized&nbsp;Recurring&nbsp;Revenue&nbsp;(ARR) for a given period is the current annualized value derived from subscription contracts with a defined contract value. This excludes contracts that are not recurring, are one-time in nature, or where the contract value fluctuates based on defined metrics. ARR is currently one of our key performance metrics to assess the health and trajectory of our recurring business. ARR does not have any standardized definition and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those items. For Adenza recurring revenue contracts, the amount included in ARR is consistent with the amount that we invoice the customer during the current period. Additionally, for Adenza recurring revenue contracts that include annual values that increase over time, we include in ARR only the annualized value of components of the contract that are considered active as of the date of the ARR calculation. We do not include the future committed increases in the contract value as of the date of the ARR calculation. ARR is not a forecast and the active contracts at the end of a reporting period used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers.</td>

<title>Offa Selects Finova’s Apprivo Origination Platform To Power Its Sharia-Compliant Finance Products</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/offa-selects-finovas-apprivo-origination-platform-to-power-its-sharia-compliant/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/offa-selects-finovas-apprivo-origination-platform-to-power-its-sharia-compliant/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The UK&rsquo;s first Sharia-compliant bridge finance provider,&nbsp;</span><span><a href="https://offa.co.uk/" target="_blank"><span>Offa</span></a></span><span>, has partnered with cloud-based mortgage and savings provider&nbsp;</span><span><a href="https://www.finova.tech/" target="_blank"><span>finova</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;to develop an innovative&nbsp;</span><span>end-to-end digital platform to support its growing portfolio of property finance products. Offa&rsquo;s new origination platform will be delivered by finova and its implementation partner Hexaware in the first half of 2024.</span></p>
<p><span>The innovative project &ndash; part of a &pound;1 million investment by Offa into its IT systems &ndash; is expected to transform the way Islamic property finance is conducted in Britain, creating a tech-driven &ldquo;faster, smarter and easier&rdquo; service for intermediaries and direct customers that starts with their initial enquiry and concludes with the release of funds.</span></p>
<p><span>Offa will leverage finova&rsquo;s fully customisable Apprivo software, giving it access to multiple data points, including ID verification, credit reference agencies and automated valuation models. Additional services can also be integrated via finova&rsquo;s API ecosystem, including conveyancing, valuations, and payment processing and those services specific to Offa and Sharia-compliancy. The end result will be a smoother and far quicker application process for Offa&rsquo;s trusted intermediaries, direct customers and others involved in the property finance chain.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Sagheer Malik, Offa&rsquo;s Chief Commercial Officer, said</span></b><span>: &ldquo;Speed is especially important in the real estate market segments we target. We know from past experience a key issue for customers and intermediaries seeking Islamic finance is the slow, cumbersome and complicated application processes involved. Offa is making a significant investment into the digital technologies that underpin our business, and in finova we have a trusted and highly experienced technology partner, whose Apprivo<sup>&nbsp;</sup>software will transform our service by streamlining our processes to create a faster, smarter and easier system for all.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Offa was launched in 2019 as an ethical alternative to conventional bridging. The Birmingham-headquartered company currently offers short-term property finance in line with Islamic finance principles, which means products are not based on interest or finance-prohibited activities that are regarded as damaging to society, such as alcohol, gambling and the arms trade. Islamic finance applications have a reputation for taking longer than they should, an issue addressed in the new architecture built for Offa by finova.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Chris Little, Chief Revenue Officer at finova,</span></b><span>&nbsp;commented: &ldquo;Clients have become accustomed to a seamless digital experience across every aspect of their lives, including their finances. As a fully open API, Apprivo has many applications for the Islamic Finance market and will support Offa&rsquo;s end-to-end digital processes with ease. Moving forward, we&rsquo;re excited to activate the next stages of delivery and play a part in Offa&rsquo;s growth journey as it rapidly expands its portfolio of products.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Our partnership with Offa also marks an important milestone for finova as the first project where we collaborated with Hexaware, our new implementation partner. Hexaware has played a critical role in the delivery of this platform, with oversight from the finova team, and we look forward to building on this new strategic partnership that is already off to a strong start - with Offa.&rdquo;</span></p>

<title>ASIC: Court Declares Westpac Engaged In Unconscionable Conduct For Interest Rate Swap, Maximum Penalty Applied</title>

<div> penalty, pre-hedging, interest rate swap, unconscionable conduct, ASIC

Summary:
- Westpac penalized $1.8m for unconscionable conduct and $8m for costs
- Conduct involved pre-hedging without consent, risking client's financial loss
- Westpac's actions contrasted with other banks and resulted in a significant trading profit
- Court reserved decision on order for compliance program
- International focus on pre-hedging issue and ASIC's engagement with IOSCO<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The Federal Court has declared Westpac Banking Corporation (Westpac) engaged in unconscionable conduct in October 2016 when executing a $12 billion interest rate swap transaction, the largest of its kind in Australian financial market history.</p>
<p>Westpac will pay the maximum penalty of $1.8 million in relation to the conduct, together with $8 million for ASIC&rsquo;s litigation and investigation costs.</p>
<p>Westpac&rsquo;s unconscionable conduct arose when it engaged in pre-hedging ahead of an interest rate swap transaction with a Consortium comprising AustralianSuper and IFM entities. The interest rate swap related to managing interest rate risk associated with the Consortium&rsquo;s purchase from the NSW Government of a majority stake in electricity provider, Ausgrid.</p>
<p>ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said, &lsquo;This is a significant outcome which assists to clarify expectations regarding pre-hedging, particularly around disclosure and consent where the pre-hedging can have a detrimental impact on the counterparty to the transaction&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Appropriate conduct for pre-hedging is an issue of global significance. In this case, Westpac&rsquo;s behaviour was unconscionable and exposed its client to significant risk. Westpac&rsquo;s conduct was also in stark contrast with several other banks.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We share the Court&rsquo;s concern regarding the maximum penalty available in relation to the conduct, and note that had Westpac engaged in similar conduct today the maximum available penalty would have been significantly higher.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Court declared Westpac&rsquo;s conduct was unconscionable in that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Westpac was aware of its client&rsquo;s concern about trading prior to the swap transaction (pre-hedging) that had the potential to adversely affect the price of the swap transaction to their detriment. Every basis point increase to the price of the swap transaction would involve a cost to the Consortium of about $4.7 million;</li>
<li>Despite being aware of its client&rsquo;s concerns, Westpac acted on an internal plan to pre-hedge up to 50% of the interest rate risk by trading in significant volumes of interest rate derivatives in the market before the swap transaction was executed;</li>
<li>Westpac failed to obtain client consent or give clear and full disclosure about the extent of its planned pre-hedging; and</li>
<li>Once Westpac commenced its on-market pre-hedging trading, the Consortium could not protect itself against the risk that Westpac&rsquo;s trading would increase the price of the swap transaction to the Consortium.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If pre-hedging is not carried out in an appropriate manner it can be unfair, unconscionable and result in poor client outcomes. We will continue to hold participants in these markets to high standards,&rsquo; concluded Ms Court.</p>
<p>Westpac&rsquo;s derivatives trading desk achieved a trading profit of approximately $20.7 million on the day the swap was executed (of which $3.7 million was allocated to the Sales team as commission).</p>
<p>The Court also declared that Westpac failed to have adequate arrangements to manage the conflict of interests between it and the Consortium and did not do all things necessary to ensure that the swap transaction was provided to the Consortium efficiently, honestly and fairly.</p>
<p>The Court reserved its decision on whether to make an order requiring Westpac to complete a compliance programme with an independent review of its pre-hedging practices and controls, including relating to conflicts of interest management and client communications.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>ASIC originally alleged Westpac breached s1043A of the Corporations Act (insider trading), s12CB of the ASIC Act (unconscionable conduct) and s912A of the Corporations Act (breaches of the general obligations of an Australian financial services licensee) (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2021-releases/21-093mr-asic-commences-civil-proceedings-against-westpac-for-insider-trading/" title="21-093MR ASIC commences civil proceedings against Westpac for insider trading">21-093MR</a>).</p>
<p>Pre-hedging involves trading to hedge the risk that a firm anticipates it will acquire from a future transaction.</p>
<p>The Consortium sought to enter into the interest rate swap transaction to hedge the interest rate risk associated with the money it had borrowed to fund its stake in Ausgrid. That borrowing was at variable interest rates and the Consortium wanted to protect itself from the risk of those rates increasing by converting that interest rate exposure to a fixed rate for the full term of the loan. The transaction remains the largest interest rate swap transaction executed in one tranche in Australian financial market history.</p>
<p>The $1.8 million penalty is the maximum the Court could order for statutory unconscionable conduct in 2016, when the conduct occurred. At the time, a contravention of s912A of the Corporations Act did not attract a penalty.</p>
<p>Civil penalties have significantly increased since 2016. The current penalty for unconscionable conduct in breach of the ASIC Act, or for a breach of s912A of the Corporations Act, is at least $15.65 million for a corporation. For a large entity, the maximum penalty may potentially be $782.5 million or three times the benefit derived (whichever is greater).</p>
<p>ASIC notes that issues around pre-hedging has received significant international attention and ASIC is actively engaged on this issue at the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO).</p>

<p><span>Tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou katoa. Ko Samantha Barrass taku ingoa, ko taku mahi ki te mana Tātai Hokohoko, ko te mana whakahaere, Tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā tātou katoa</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This is my third FSC outlook event. There is, as I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve all now realised, much to cover in thirty minutes. Before I do that, I want to pause, and acknowledge the work of everyone at the FSC, including Rob Flanagan. The work of the FSC, from the Board to its staff, to members whose staff contribute to its committees, is vital in our engagement-led approach.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Minister this morning set out a clear vision and direction for financial services regulation in New Zealand. Based on my experience across multiple jurisdictions, these changes offer the opportunity to streamline and bring New Zealand up to best of class, learning from what has, and has not worked overseas.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I&rsquo;m going to build on some of the points the Minister has raised, speak to the importance of the Twin Peaks regime working well, reflect on how a move to outcome focused regulation is rooted in the reasons that I became a regulator and touch on the importance of work to further develop New Zealand&rsquo;s capital markets.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>With the start of a year, there&rsquo;s an opportunity to look back, as well as look forward. I want to quickly reflect on 2023. It was a year in which the new financial advice regime came into force, our work on CoFI deepened, and our implementation of the climate related disclosure regime came into effect.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I raise these because it shows what can be achieved when the FMA and the industry work closely together. The FMA and the New Zealand financial services sector has, at its best, always been open, engaged, part of a two-way conversation about how we achieve our objectives to ensure the financial sector is working well for all New Zealanders. If we keep that in mind, preserve it, in the year ahead, I think that will serve us well.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Minister this morning set out proposals to change to how financial services is regulated in New Zealand. The FMA is committed to working with the Government to implement these.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Our view, as an independent regulator, is that using the core principles at the heart of CoFI can result in a simple and streamlined approach for conduct regulation in New Zealand across the piece. The fair conduct principle that sits at the heart of CoFI, that a &lsquo;financial institution must treat consumers fairly&rsquo; sets out that the fundamental components of fair conduct are</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Paying due regard to a consumers interests</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Acting ethically, transparently and in good faith</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Assisting customers to make informed decisions</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Ensuring relevant services and associated products meet the requirements and objectives of likely consumers</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Not subjecting consumers to unfair pressure or tactics or undue influence.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Taking this approach to the conduct of all financial services means that an outcomes-based regime can provide flexibility, support innovation and avoid box ticking. It promotes a supervisory relationship that facilitates proactive and proportionate engagement. It also enables us to minimise regulatory burden.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On CoFI, we have already been engaging proactively with the industry in a variety of ways.&nbsp; Additional guidance and engagement will be provided for very small firms to ensure they have everything they need to be successful. It obviously costs more of our resources but makes things less costly and more straightforward for firms. We will be working with both the Government and the sector to do this.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We have heard feedback from some in the sector who believe the FMA will be subjecting firms&rsquo; fair conduct programmes to significant scrutiny during the licensing process. I want to be clear that this has never been our intention and has never been a part of our planning. It&rsquo;s not for us to go through your fair conduct programme line by line. We&rsquo;re not going to be signing them off.&nbsp; The responsibility for these programmes sits with the Board of the institutions. It is for you to right-size your fair conduct programme or your CoFI application for your business, especially for smaller firms.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The FMA will be flexible and respond to different business models throughout the licensing process and in our supervision and monitoring approach. The FMA has never had a one size fits all approach to its work, taking an approach based on engagement and working with the sector.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Whenever a funding and levy review of the FMA has taken place in the last few years, the sector has been largely clear that it is this approach &ndash; of being flexible, engagement-led, that is preferred over a rules-based, enforcement-led approach. Yes, this means greater costs for the FMA - that industry largely pays for - but critically firms benefit from a more efficient regulatory regime.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As you&rsquo;ve just heard, the Government is considering the best way forward on CCCFA. When New Zealanders talk about their experience of the conduct of financial services, credit is always going to be top of mind. A critical role of&nbsp; financial services is enabling Kiwis&rsquo; lives. It's their ability to borrow money whether to buy a house or make urgent repairs to their car. We can see the sense in having a single over-arching conduct regulator.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We see the value of using the broader regulatory toolbox provided through the Financial Markets Conduct Act to support appropriate regulation of registered banks and non-bank deposit takers and high-interest rate lending by all lenders, particularly those targeted at vulnerable communities.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Aligning credit regulation with an outcomes-based approach and fair conduct rules would provide clear and constructive benefits. It would provide regulatory certainty and efficiency. It would help ease burden while ensuring a range of monitoring, supervisory and enforcement tools to manage poor conduct in the sector. It would also allow expectations to evolve as new technologies, products and business models emerge.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The FMA looks forward to engaging constructively with the planned review in the coming months and is ready to implement any changes the Government may see fit to make.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A key message that industry has regularly given both the FMA, but also other regulators and policy makers, is the need for greater coordination. We have sought to respond to that through the Council of Financial Regulators, providing clarity through the regulatory initiatives calendar and seeking to coordinate agency activities. Bi-lateral engagements have also been significantly strengthened.&nbsp;</span><span>We are mindful that industry has been through a period of significant regulatory change in recent years while coping with huge external shocks and impacts such as COVID-19 and last year&rsquo;s weather events.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Noting those events, it's important to recognise that different independent regulators and policymakers will necessarily consider risks and events through the lens of their separate regulatory objectives. Regulators have already taken steps to try to manage this, while mitigating its burden.&nbsp;</span><span>Many of you will have experienced the joint calls that the FMA and the RBNZ conducted during these events, and these received positive feedback.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>My view is that this cooperation and co-ordination should continue to intensify. Only by doing this, can we seek to manage impost on industry.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As most of you will know over the last couple of months, we&rsquo;ve been holding sessions in Auckland, Wellington and last week, Christchurch on outcome focused regulation.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Why have we embarked upon this? Why do we think it is important? What are we hearing?</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The point of it is to bring about a shared focus on the &lsquo;so what?&rsquo; of our collective effort. Yours in the industry and ours as a regulator.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The point is to recognise the risk of not seeing the wood for the trees that arises from more prescriptive, &lsquo;tick box&rsquo; approaches to regulation.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It&rsquo;s a risk I have been concerned about for my entire career in regulation. It&rsquo;s why I left my exciting career as a monetary macro-economist and moved into regulation in the first place.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The risk of &lsquo;tick box&rsquo; regulation is real. It contributes to regulators failing to spot emerging risk, despite their unique cross-sector vantage point. It increases the extent to which regulation can cut across innovation, including changes that improve outcomes for consumers, markets and society. Unfortunately it allows some to design technical compliance models that fail to achieve the consumer and market aims of the regulatory model.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Rules and other regulations are of course a critical part of the framework. These outcomes don&rsquo;t replace our legislation &ndash; they are not new rules.&nbsp; We believe strongly that our legislation supports these outcomes.&nbsp; The law also provides the mechanisms, where they&rsquo;re needed, for us to enforce the legal obligations that support the outcomes we are seeking.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We don&rsquo;t need to go back too far to recognise the market failures that have cut across consumer outcomes and clean markets. Just a cursory look at the enforcement action we have taken in the past year, demonstrates the risk posed by those who can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t deliver fair consumer outcomes or support clean markets.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We made it clear last year that we are alert to any practices by providers that lead to high pressure sales, not just commissions, not just sales-based remuneration.&nbsp; We acted following a review of the classification of wholesale customers. These are good examples of us beginning to consider how outcomes-focused regulation will work in practice. We weren&rsquo;t simply focused on a narrow range of practices. We were looking at risks to the outcome that &lsquo;consumers can trust providers to act in their interests&rsquo;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The FMA&rsquo;s focus on outcomes is in the first instance something for us. It is about our regulatory approach and the judgment we bring to our work as a regulator. It&rsquo;s about us leaning even further into our engagement-led approach. It is about forward looking supervisory judgement that is risk-based and outcomes-focused.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The consultation is seeking your views on the outcomes that will guide our approach to exercising our regulatory powers and responsibilities. It will be risks to these outcomes that first and foremost guide our decision-making on how we use our resources. For our supervisory approach, we will use these outcomes, not detailed compliance requirements, to frame our discussions with and assessments of providers.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While I&rsquo;ve set out some examples of us beginning to think about outcomes, I&rsquo;ve been clear this is a profound shift for us as an independent regulator, and it will not happen overnight.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As a part of our preparation, we will first look to pilot approaches this year with a small number of firms. Participation will be entirely voluntary. If you are interested in helping inform our approach let us know, particularly in your responses to the consultation.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We need to instil confidence in the approach, and the best way to do that is by demonstrating it to you, so you experience it. It&rsquo;s our intention that your engagement with our monitoring teams will begin to see a palpable shift to outcomes rather than rules and compliance with rules. In so doing we want to shift the focus to outcomes for consumers and markets and innovation for firms.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I&rsquo;d like to close by reflecting on the importance of the work that we can do to develop and deepen capital markets in New Zealand. A few years ago, the FMA, alongside the NZX, co-sponsored the Capital Markets 2029 work that considered further ways New Zealand can both enable businesses to attract capital, but also ensure investors have assets to invest in.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It will be important, not just this year, but in the years ahead, to look not just at the regulatory framework, but how we are ensuring New Zealand firms have access to capital to grow, and that the investments are there to ensure KiwiSaver funds have something to invest in to help grow the New Zealand economy.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>KiwiSaver has now grown to near $100 billion and is a significant part of New Zealanders&rsquo; assets. The FSC&rsquo;s Blueprint for Growth poses good questions about how Government, the sector and regulators can work together to grow the financial confidence and wellbeing of New Zealanders, and I commend you for this work.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I do want to finish on a reprise.&nbsp; The FMA and the New Zealand financial services sector, at its best, has always been open, engaged, part of a two-way conversation about how we achieve our objectives to ensure the financial sector is working well for all New Zealanders.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let&rsquo;s keep that in mind for 2024, and I suspect it will serve us well.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for your time.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<title>We're Not There Yet: Current Regulation Around AI May Not Be Sufficient - Keynote Address By ASIC Chair Joe Longo At The At UTS Human Technology Institute Shaping Our Future Symposium, 31 January 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>KEY POINTS</h2>
<ul>
<li>ASIC Chair Joe Longo spoke at the UTS Human Technology Institute Shaping Our Future Symposium on the current and future state of AI regulation and governance.</li>
<li>All participants in the financial system have a duty to balance innovation with the responsible, safe, and ethical use of emerging technologies &ndash; and existing obligations around good governance and the provision of financial services don&rsquo;t change with new technology.</li>
<li>ASIC will continue to act, within our remit, to deter bad behaviour whenever appropriate and however caused. Our focus is &ndash; and will always be &ndash; the safety and integrity of the financial system and positive outcomes for consumers and investors.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Existing laws likely do not adequately prevent AI-facilitated harms before they occur, and more work is needed to ensure there is an adequate response to harms after they occur.&rdquo;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/we-re-not-there-yet-current-regulation-around-ai-may-not-be-sufficient/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>[1]</span></a></p>
<p>These words are from the Federal Government&rsquo;s interim report on AI regulation. I&rsquo;m sure most of you are familiar with it. It&rsquo;s clear, then, that a divide exists between our current regulatory environment and the ideal. Today&rsquo;s theme of &lsquo;bridging the governance gap&rsquo; presupposes such a divide. It invites us to consider what AI governance and regulation might look like in the ideal, how great the divide is between that ideal and current circumstances &ndash; and, of course, how we might go about bridging that divide.</p>
<p>But it all hinges on that first question: what would need to be addressed for the regulatory framework to &lsquo;fit the bill&rsquo;? Or, to put it another way: in what way might the current regulatory framework inadequately prevent AI-facilitated harms? This question is key. We can only bridge the gap &ndash; and create our best approximation to the ideal &ndash; if we know where that gap lies.</p>
<p>So my purpose today is to look for that gap. But first, I want to make it very clear that any future AI regulatory changes should not be taken to mean that AI isn&rsquo;t already regulated. It is. And I will devote the first part of my speech to making that clear.</p>
<h2>AI is not the Wild West</h2>
<p>Earlier this month Microsoft&rsquo;s AI Tech &amp; Policy Lead in Asia said that &ldquo;2024 will be the year that we start to build sensible, safe, and expandable regulation around the use of AI technologies.&rdquo;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/we-re-not-there-yet-current-regulation-around-ai-may-not-be-sufficient/#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span>[2]</span></a></p>
<p>While I agree with the sentiment, statements like this imply that AI is some kind of &lsquo;Wild West&rsquo;, without law or regulation of any kind. Nothing could be further from the truth. As the interim report noted, &ldquo;businesses and individuals who develop and use AI are already subject to various Australian laws. These include laws such as those relating to privacy, online safety, corporations, intellectual property and anti-discrimination, which apply to all sectors of the economy.&rdquo;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/we-re-not-there-yet-current-regulation-around-ai-may-not-be-sufficient/#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><span>[3]</span></a></p>
<p>For example, current directors&rsquo; obligations under the&nbsp;<em>Corporations Act</em>&nbsp;aren&rsquo;t specific duties &ndash; they&rsquo;re principle-based. They apply broadly, and as companies increasingly deploy AI, this is something directors must pay special attention to, in terms of their directors&rsquo; duties.</p>
<p>In 2022, the Federal Court found that RI Advice breached its license obligations to act efficiently and fairly by failing to have adequate risk management systems to manage its cybersecurity risks.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/we-re-not-there-yet-current-regulation-around-ai-may-not-be-sufficient/#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><span>[4]</span></a>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s certainly not a stretch to apply this thinking to the use and operation of AI by financial services licensees. In fact, ASIC is already pursuing an action in which AI-related issues arise, where we believe the use of a demand model was part of an insurance pricing process that led to the full benefit of advertised loyalty discounts not being appropriately applied.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/we-re-not-there-yet-current-regulation-around-ai-may-not-be-sufficient/#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><span>[5]</span></a></p>
<p>The point is, the responsibility towards good governance is not changed just because the technology is new. Whatever may come, there&rsquo;s plenty of scope right now for making the best use of our existing regulatory toolkit. And businesses, boards, and directors shouldn&rsquo;t allow the international discussion around AI regulation to let them think AI isn&rsquo;t already regulated. Because it is. For this reason, and within our remit, ASIC will continue to act, and act early, to deter bad behaviour whenever appropriate and however caused.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re willing to test the regulatory parameters where they&rsquo;re unclear or where corporations seek to exploit perceived gaps. Among other things, that means probing the oversight, risk management, and governance arrangements entities have in place. We&rsquo;re already conducting a review into the use of AI in the banking, credit, insurance, and advice sectors. This will give us a better understanding of the actual AI use cases being deployed and developed in the Australian market &ndash; and how they impact consumers. We&rsquo;re testing what risks to consumers licensees are identifying from the use of AI, and how they&rsquo;re mitigating against these risks.</p>
<h2>Is this enough?</h2>
<p>But just because existing regulation can apply to AI, that doesn&rsquo;t mean there&rsquo;s nothing more to do. Much has already been made of 2024 as &lsquo;the year AI grows up&rsquo;. Phrases like &lsquo;leaps forward&rsquo;, &lsquo;rapid progress,&rsquo;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/we-re-not-there-yet-current-regulation-around-ai-may-not-be-sufficient/#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><span>[6]</span></a>&nbsp;and others abound, suggesting an endless stream of benefits to consumers and businesses in the wake of AI&rsquo;s growth.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re right. AI continues to be an astonishing development. The potential benefits to businesses and individuals are enormous &ndash; with an estimated &lsquo;additional $170 billion to $600 billion a year to Australia&rsquo;s GDP by 2030.&rsquo;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/we-re-not-there-yet-current-regulation-around-ai-may-not-be-sufficient/#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><span>[7]</span></a>&nbsp;But that very rapidity brings with it a host of questions.</p>
<p>In 1991, after the launch of the World Wide Web, it took seven years for it to gain 100 million users. When Myspace was launched 12 years later, it hit that milestone in three years. Facebook, YouTube, and Spotify all took four years, and Uber &ndash; that great disruptor &ndash; took five. Since then, times have decreased dramatically. When TikTok was launched in 2017, it took just nine months to reach 100 million users, while ChatGPT took&hellip; just two months.</p>
<p>The open question here is how regulation can adapt to such rapidity. As food for thought, it took two years for the Fair Work Ombudsman to determine that Uber drivers are not employees.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/we-re-not-there-yet-current-regulation-around-ai-may-not-be-sufficient/#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><span>[8]</span></a>&nbsp;This isn&rsquo;t through any fault or delay &ndash; it&rsquo;s the natural pace of any deliberative and considered regulatory organisation. But there&rsquo;s a clear question here about whether our current regulatory framework is enough to meet the rapidity of that challenge.</p>
<p>So, even as AI &lsquo;leaps forward,&rsquo; at a rate never seen before, questions around transparency and explainability become paramount if we&rsquo;re to protect consumers from harm &ndash; intended or not. Let me consider several questions and risks around the use of AI.</p>
<p>One question may be, will the &lsquo;rapid progress&rsquo; of AI carry along with it the vulnerable man or woman struggling to pay their bills in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis, whose credit score is at the whim of AI-driven credit scoring models that may be inadvertently biased?</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t fanciful to imagine that credit providers using AI systems to identify &lsquo;better&rsquo; credit risks could (potentially) unfairly discriminate against those vulnerable consumers. And with &lsquo;opaque&rsquo; AI systems, the mechanisms by which that discrimination occurs could be difficult to detect. Even if the current laws are sufficient to punish bad action, their ability to prevent the harm might not be.</p>
<p>In such a case, will that person struggling have recourse for appeal? Will they even know that AI was being used? And if they do, who&rsquo;s to blame? Is it the developers? The company? And how would the company even go about determining whether the decision was made because of algorithmic bias, as opposed to a calculus based on broader data sets than human modelling? Dario Amodei, CEO of the AI company Anthropic, admits freely that &ldquo;we, humanity, do not know how to understand what&rsquo;s going on inside these [AI] models.&rdquo;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/we-re-not-there-yet-current-regulation-around-ai-may-not-be-sufficient/#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"><span>[9]</span></a>&nbsp;So if even the experts can&rsquo;t explain how a particular system works &ndash; and it seems this is often the case &ndash; how can we justify using it? How can we be sure that vulnerable consumers are part of that great leap forward?</p>
<p>Or let&rsquo;s consider the use of AI in fraud detection and prevention, with algorithms analysing patterns and anomalies in transactions to detect potentially fraudulent activities in real-time. What happens to the customer who&rsquo;s debanked when an algorithm says so? What happens when they&rsquo;re denied a mortgage because an algorithm decides they should be? When that person ends up paying a higher insurance premium, will they know why, or even that they&rsquo;re paying a higher premium? Will the provider?</p>
<p>And what if a provider lacks adequate governance or supervision of an AI investment manager? When, as a system, it learns to manipulate the market by hitting stop losses, causing market drops and volatility&hellip; when there&rsquo;s a lack of detection systems&hellip; yes, our regulations around responsible outsourcing may apply &ndash; but have they prevented the harm? Or a provider might use the AI system to carry out some other agenda, like seeking to only support related party product, or share offerings in giving some preference based on historic data. The point is, there's a need for transparency and oversight to prevent unfair practices &ndash; accidental or intended. But can our current regulatory framework ensure that happens? I&rsquo;m not so sure.</p>
<p>Does it prevent blind reliance on AI risk models without human oversight that can lead to underestimating risks? Does it prevent failure to consider emerging risks that the models may not have encountered during training?</p>
<p>In addition to these questions I&rsquo;ve just posed, the Australian Signals Directorate last week outlined several further challenges around AI use, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>Data poisoning;</li>
<li>Input manipulation;</li>
<li>AI &lsquo;hallucinations&rsquo;; and</li>
<li>Privacy and intellectual property concerns<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/we-re-not-there-yet-current-regulation-around-ai-may-not-be-sufficient/#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><span>[10]</span></a></li>
</ol>
<p>The first three in particular present a governance challenge to any entity using AI, not to become over-reliant on any model that can&rsquo;t be understood, examined, and explained.</p>
<p>In response to these various challenges, some may suggest solutions such as red-teaming, or &lsquo;AI constitutions&rsquo; &ndash; the suggestion that AI can be better understood if it has an in-built constitution which it must follow. But even these have been shown to be vulnerable, with one team of researchers breaking through the control measures of several AI models simply by adding random characters on the end of their requests.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/we-re-not-there-yet-current-regulation-around-ai-may-not-be-sufficient/#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"><span>[11]</span></a>&nbsp;Another possibility, echoing the EU approach, might be the requirement to complete an &lsquo;AI risk assessment&rsquo; before implementing AI in any case.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/we-re-not-there-yet-current-regulation-around-ai-may-not-be-sufficient/#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"><span>[12]</span></a>&nbsp;But even here, questions like those I&rsquo;ve already asked need to be considered to ensure the risk assessment is actually effective in preventing harm.</p>
<p>My point is, these questions of transparency, explainability, and rapidity deserve careful attention. They can&rsquo;t be answered quickly or off-hand. But they must be addressed if we&rsquo;re to ensure the advancement of AI means an advancement for all. And as far as financial markets and services are concerned, it&rsquo;s clear there&rsquo;s a way to go in answering them.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>To sum up: AI, as everyone here knows, is a rapidly and constantly evolving space. But ASIC&rsquo;s interest is &ndash; and will always be &ndash; two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The safety and integrity of the financial system;</li>
<li>Positive outcomes for consumers and investors.</li>
</ol>
<p>AI may be able to help us achieve these ends; it can &lsquo;create new jobs, power new industries, boost productivity and benefit consumers&rsquo;.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/we-re-not-there-yet-current-regulation-around-ai-may-not-be-sufficient/#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"><span>[13]</span></a>&nbsp;But, as yet, no clear consensus has emerged on how best to regulate it. Business practices that deliberately or accidentally mislead and deceive consumers have existed for a long time &ndash; and are something we have a long history of dealing with. But this risk is exacerbated by the availability of vast consumer data sets and the use of tools such as AI and machine learning which allow for quick iteration and micro-targeting. As new technologies are adopted, monitoring consumer outcomes is crucial.</p>
<p>For now, existing obligations around good governance and the provision of financial services don&rsquo;t change with new technology. That means all participants in the financial system have a duty to balance innovation with the responsible, safe, and ethical use of emerging technologies.</p>
<p>Bridging the governance gap means strengthening our current regulatory framework where it&rsquo;s good, and shoring it up where it needs further development. But above it all, it means asking the right questions. And one question we should be asking ourselves again and again is this: &ldquo;is this enough?&rdquo;</p>

<div> Keywords: Citi, lawsuit, online banking security, fraud, reimbursement
Summary: The New York Attorney General Letitia James has filed a lawsuit against Citi, alleging lax online protections, misleading customers about fraud, and denial of reimbursement. Citi's negligence has resulted in millions of dollars being stolen from customers, with some losing their entire life savings. The bank has failed to respond adequately to fraudulent activity, leaving customers vulnerable to scammers. Summary: <br /><br />Attorney General Letitia James has filed a lawsuit against Citi, citing lax online protections, fraudulent activity, and denial of reimbursement. Citi's negligence has led to millions being stolen from customers, with some losing their entire life savings. The bank has failed to respond to fraudulent activity, leaving customers vulnerable to scammers. <div>
<p>New York Attorney General Letitia James today&nbsp;<a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2024-01/citi-complaint.pdf">sued Citibank, N.A. (Citi) for failing to protect and refusing to reimburse victims of fraud</a>. The lawsuit alleges that Citi does not implement strong online protections to stop unauthorized account takeovers, misleads account holders about their rights after their accounts are hacked and funds are stolen, and illegally denies reimbursement to victims of fraud. The Office of the Attorney General (OAG) has found that the bank fails to respond to fraudulent activity appropriately and quickly. As a result of Citi&rsquo;s lax security, New York customers have lost millions of dollars, and in some instances, their entire lifesavings, to scammers and hackers. Attorney General James is seeking to hold Citi accountable for failing to protect its customers and require the company to pay back defrauded New Yorkers with interest, pay penalties, and adopt enhanced anti-fraud defenses to prevent scammers from stealing consumers&rsquo; funds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Banks are supposed to be the safest place to keep money, yet Citi&rsquo;s negligence has allowed scammers to steal millions of dollars from hardworking people,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>Attorney General James</span>. &ldquo;Many New Yorkers rely on online banking to pay bills or save for big milestones, and if a bank cannot secure its customers&rsquo; accounts, they are failing in their most basic duty. There is no excuse for Citi&rsquo;s failure to protect and prevent millions of dollars from being stolen from customers&rsquo; accounts and my office will not write off illegal behavior from big banks.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Harm to New York Customers</span></p>
<p>Citi is one of the largest banks in the United States and maintains checking and savings accounts for millions of consumers nationwide, including through online and mobile banking. The lawsuit alleges that scammers are able to steal tens of thousands of dollars from Citi customers because the bank does not implement strong data security and anti-breach practices. As a result of Citi&rsquo;s lax security protocols and procedures, ineffective monitoring systems, and failure to respond in real-time and properly investigate fraud claims, New Yorkers have lost millions to scammers. Customers have lost their life savings, their children&rsquo;s college funds, or even money needed to support their day-to-day lives as a result of Citi&rsquo;s illegal and deceptive acts and practices.</p>
<p>One New Yorker had $40,000 stolen from her retirement savings account. In October 2021, the customer received a text message that appeared to be from Citi instructing her to log onto a website or call her local branch. The customer clicked the link in the message but did not provide additional information as requested in the text message. Afterwards, the customer called her local branch to report the suspicious activity but was told not to worry about it. Three days later, the customer discovered that a scammer changed her banking password, enrolled in online wire transfers, transferred $70,000 from her savings to her checking account, and then electronically executed a $40,000 wire transfer, none of which was consistent with her past account activity. For weeks, the customer continued to contact the bank and submit affidavits, but in the end, she was told that her claim for fraud was denied.</p>
<p>Another New Yorker had $35,000 stolen from her account. She was reviewing her online account and found a message that her account had been suspended and was instructed to call a phone number. She called the number provided and a scammer told her that he would send her Citi codes to verify recent suspicious activity. The scammer then transferred all of the money in the customer&rsquo;s three savings accounts into her checking account, changed her online passwords, and attempted a $35,000 wire transfer. Citi attempted to verify the wire transfer by calling the customer, but she was working and did not see the call at the time. Less than an hour later, the scammer attempted another $35,000 wire transfer, which Citi approved without ever having made direct contact with the customer. She lost nearly everything she had saved, and Citi refused to reimburse her.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Insufficient Online Banking Security</span></p>
<p>The OAG found that Citi&rsquo;s systems do not respond effectively to red flags, such as scammers who are using unrecognized devices, are accessing accounts from new locations, or are changing banking passwords or usernames. Additionally, Citi systems do not flag and stop efforts to transfer funds from multiple accounts into a single account and then send tens of thousands of dollars out the door in minutes. Citi also does not automatically initiate investigations or report fraudulent activity to police or law enforcement authorities when consumers first report it to Citi.</p>
<p>In addition, Citi fails to appropriately respond to notifications of fraud by its customers. When victims contact the bank to report fraud, Citi leaves them on lengthy telephone holds, allowing scammers to continue their fraud. Additionally, Citi does not implement sufficient measures to protect consumers from future unauthorized transactions until they visit a local branch. Citi representatives falsely told consumers that their accounts were secure and often promised that their money would be returned, although the bank did not take immediate steps to recover stolen funds. Citi also falsely tells consumers that they need to visit local branches and execute special affidavits detailing the scams that led to their losses &mdash; information Citi then used to blame consumers and deny their claims.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attorney General James alleges that because Citi makes wire transfers available to consumers online and through mobile banking apps, Citi must reimburse victims of fraud under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA), similar to when banks reimburse victims of electronic credit or debit card fraud. Under EFTA, banks such as Citi are required to reimburse their customers for money in their accounts that is lost or stolen through unauthorized electronic payments. However, Citi illegally exploited a narrow exception in these laws to deny consumer claims for reimbursement, resulting in millions of dollars in losses for New York consumers. Through this lawsuit, Attorney General James is seeking to stop Citi&rsquo;s deceptive practices and to collect restitution for victims who were denied reimbursement in the last six years, penalties, and disgorgement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attorney General James encourages all consumers who have lost money to scammers who hacked into their online or mobile banking, whether the bank accounts were with Citi or any other bank, to report their experiences to&nbsp;<a href="https://formsnym.ag.ny.gov/OAGOnlineSubmissionForm/faces/OAGCFCHome;jsessionid=VDRYAmzfy5Vvu_Lafni57NWQjworpA60Z2Y7u5I7rBxBU8iVj-AN!513712777">OAG&rsquo;s Consumer Frauds Bureau</a>.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s lawsuit is the latest action by Attorney General James to hold big banks accountable. Last month, Attorney General James&nbsp;<a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2023/attorney-general-james-works-hold-big-banks-accountable-violating-state-laws">led a coalition of 20 attorneys general in submitting&nbsp;letters</a>&nbsp;to the federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau urging both agencies to ensure that national banks cooperate with investigations being conducted by state attorneys general. In April 2022, Attorney General James led a multistate coalition of attorneys general in calling on the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, U.S. Bank, and Wells Fargo to&nbsp;<a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2022/attorney-general-james-leads-multistate-coalition-calling-consumer-banks">eliminate all overdraft fees</a>&nbsp;on consumer bank accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This matter is being handled by Assistant Attorney General Chris Filburn with the Consumer Frauds and Protection Bureau. The Consumer Frauds and Protection Bureau is led by Bureau Chief Jane Azia and Deputy Bureau Chief Laura Levine, and is a part of the Division of Economic Justice, which is overseen by Chief Deputy Attorney General Chris D&rsquo;Angelo and First Deputy Attorney General Jennifer Levy.</p>

<div> EC, ISDA, GFMA, FIA, BMR <br />
The joint response by ISDA, GFMA, and FIA to the European Commission's Call for Feedback on the BMR highlights the recognition of problems caused by the current drafting of the Benchmarks Regulation, supports the aim of establishing a sustainable third-country regime, and overall considers the proposal to result in a more proportionate and protective regime for users and administrators of benchmarks. <br /><br />Summary: The associations welcome the EC's recognition of the problems caused by the current drafting of the Benchmarks Regulation, strongly support the aim of establishing a sustainable third-country regime, and overall consider that the proposal will result in a more proportionate regime for users and administrators of benchmarks. <div>
<p><span>On Tuesday 23rd January 2024, ISDA submitted a joint response to the European Commission&rsquo;s (EC) Call for Feedback on the review of the scope and regime for non-EU benchmarks alongside GFMA and FIA. The response sets out the Associations&rsquo; comments on the EC&rsquo;s proposal, along with potential draft amendments where possible, as well as some additional revisions that were considered to also support the EC&rsquo;s aims. In summary, the Associations welcome the EC&rsquo;s recognition of the problems caused by the current drafting of the Benchmarks Regulation (BMR), and the careful thought and consideration that has been given to addressing them. They strongly support the aim of establishing a third-country regime that is sustainable in the long term once the current transitional regime expires, and overall consider that the proposal will result in a more proportionate regime for users and administrators of benchmarks, that still provides vital protections.</span></p>

<div> Committee Meeting, Rare Earth Minerals, Derivatives Market, Basel III, Energy Infrastructure<br />
Summary:<br />
The Energy and Environmental Markets Advisory Committee will hold a public meeting in Colorado to discuss the role of rare earth minerals in energy transition, the impact of Basel III proposals on derivatives markets, and updates on traditional energy infrastructure. Members of the public can attend in person or virtually and submit written statements. <div>
<p>CFTC Commissioner Summer K. Mersinger, sponsor of the Energy and Environmental Markets Advisory Committee (EEMAC), today announced the EEMAC will hold a public meeting from 9:00 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. (MST) on Tuesday, February 13 at the Colorado School of Mines in Golden, Colorado. Members of the public may also attend the meeting virtually or in person, if space permits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this meeting, the EEMAC will explore the role of rare earth minerals in transitional energy and electrification, including the potential development of derivatives products to offer price discovery and hedging opportunities in these markets. Additionally, a presentation and discussion on the federal prudential financial regulators proposed rules implementing Basel III and the implications for and impact on the derivatives market.&nbsp;Finally, the two EEMAC subcommittees will offer an update on their continued work related to traditional energy infrastructure and metals markets.</p>
<p>The meeting agenda may change to accommodate other EEMAC priorities. A formal agenda for this meeting is forthcoming. For agenda updates and more information about this advisory committee, including its members, visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/About/CFTCCommittees/EnergyEnvironmentalMarketsAdvisory/emac_meetings.html">EEMAC</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am excited to explore the lesser known world of rare minerals and how these unique commodities are central to the transition from thermal energy to more renewable forms of energy.&rdquo; said Commissioner Mersinger. &ldquo;It is important to investigate the role dynamic, robust derivatives markets could play in these markets. I am equally interested in hearing more about the potential impacts of the Basel III proposals on the derivatives markets, specifically around impacts on our energy derivatives markets and the resulting implications for household energy costs across the U.S.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Members of the public may watch a live webcast or listen to the meeting via conference call using a domestic or international number to connect to a live, listen-only audio feed. People requiring special accommodations to attend the meeting because of a disability should notify Lauren Fulks, the EEMAC Secretary, at (816) 787-6297 or&nbsp;<a href="mailto:Lfulks@cftc.gov">Lfulks@cftc.gov</a>.</p>

<title>ESMA Steps Up Its Monitoring Of EU Alternative Investment Funds And Sees Potential Risks In Funds Exposed To Leverage And Liquidity Mismatches</title>

<div> regulator, supervisor, ESMA, real estate funds, liquidity mismatches
Summary:<br /><br />The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) published a report highlighting the risks posed by real estate funds, particularly in the context of declining volumes and falling prices. The report also addressed risks posed by leveraged alternative investment funds (AIFs) and outlined measures taken by authorities to address these risks. ESMA will continue to work with National Competent Authorities (NCAs) to meet its financial stability objective. <div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, today published a<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-01/ESMA50-524821-3095_EU_Alternative_Investment_Funds_2023.pdf">&nbsp;report on the EU alternative investment funds (AIFs)&rsquo; market</a>&nbsp;and an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-01/ESMA60-1389274163-2572_TRV_article_-_Assessing_risks_posed_by_leveraged_AIFs_in_the_EU.pdf">article on the risks posed by leveraged AIFs in the EU</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify">ESMA confirms the risks posed by real estate (RE) funds, in a context of declining volumes of transactions and falling prices in several jurisdictions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify">Existing liquidity mismatches in AIFs are particularly heightened by the high share of open-ended RE funds, some of which offer daily liquidity. This vulnerability could be systemically relevant in jurisdictions where RE funds own a large share of the RE market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify">Looking at the full sector and specifically at the risks posed by leveraged AIFs, ESMA finds that:&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>the size of the sector declined slightly (-3%) to EUR 6.8tn in 2022 and AIFs account for 36% of the EU fund industry,&nbsp;</li>
<li>the fall in value was mainly driven by valuation losses for funds exposed to bonds and equities amid adverse market developments in 2022,&nbsp;</li>
<li>RE funds face multiple risks related to leverage, market footprint, valuation discrepancies and liquidity mismatches&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>leverage for hedge funds remains very high, and this may pose a risk of market impact. However, most of them also dispose of large levels of cash to address potential margin calls, which limits the risk of fire sales,&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>NCAs have reported risks posed by the Liability-Driven Investment (LDI) funds, which gain leveraged exposures to the UK government bond market. Risks have remained elevated, and the limits set after the severe stress experienced in September 2022 remain appropriate.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</div>
<br />
<div>
<p>In light of these findings, ESMA reports on the measure taken by authorities to address the risks identified, and will continue to work with the NCAs to meet ESMA&rsquo;s financial stability objective.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Background</span></h4>
</div>
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify">The two documents contribute to ESMA&rsquo;s financial stability objective. They are part of ESMA&rsquo;s monitoring framework on AIFs, including market development and key risk metrics, such as leverage and liquidity. They foster a common supervisory approach of the data reported under AIFMD between ESMA and the NCAs.</p>

<title>Statement On The Denial Of A Rulemaking Petition Regarding The Commission’s No-Admit/No-Deny Policy, SEC Chair Gary Gensler, Jan. 30, 2024</title>

<div> denied, Petition, Rulemaking, no-admit/no-deny policy, settlement
<br />
The Commission denied a Petition for Rulemaking to amend the no-admit/no-deny policy, citing its importance in avoiding false impressions of guilt. Settlements are significant for both the SEC and defendants, and altering the policy would diminish the impact of enforcement settlements and undermine the value provided by public recitation of the facts. The Commission's discretion in regulatory agenda is crucial.
<br /><br />Summary: The Commission denied a Petition for Rulemaking to amend the no-admit/no-deny policy, citing its importance in avoiding false impressions of guilt. Settlements are significant for both the SEC and defendants, and altering the policy would diminish the impact of enforcement settlements and undermine the value provided by public recitation of the facts. The Commission's discretion in regulatory agenda is crucial. <div>
<p>Today, the Commission denied a Petition for Rulemaking<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-denial-rulemaking-petition-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;to amend Rule 202.5(e), more commonly known as the Commission&rsquo;s no-admit/no-deny policy. I was pleased to support the Commission&rsquo;s decision.</p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s no admit/no deny policy was adopted in 1972. As the Commission said at the time: &ldquo;The Commission has adopted the policy that in any civil lawsuit brought by it or in any administrative proceeding of an accusatory nature pending before it, it is important to avoid creating, or permitting to be created, an impression that a decree is being entered or a sanction imposed, when the conduct alleged did not, in fact, occur.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-denial-rulemaking-petition-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>As the Commission under then-Chair Bill Casey said at the time of the adoption: &ldquo;a refusal to admit the allegations is equivalent to a denial, unless the defendant or respondent states that he neither admits nor denies the allegations.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-denial-rulemaking-petition-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Entering into a settlement is a consequential choice for both the SEC and the defendant. The Commission, in agreeing to settle a case, is relinquishing the opportunity to present the case in court. The defendant, on the other hand, relinquishes the right to defend the case in court, in the press, and in the eyes of the public. Both parties are agreeing to a set of terms based upon this 1972 policy.</p>
<p>More than 50 years on, I think this policy has served the public and the Commission well. I believe that amending this policy in the manner proposed by the Petitioner would alter the impact of enforcement settlements if defendants could deny any wrongdoing in the court of public opinion and dismiss sanctions as the cost of doing business without the Commission being able to revive its ability to have its day in court.</p>
<p>Further, an essential component of settlements is the public recitation of the facts. It informs the market as to what conduct is violative of the securities laws. It alerts investors that the Commission seeks to deter that conduct, and it helps other market participants comply with the law. A settlement that allows the denial of wrongdoing undermines the value provided by the recitation of the facts, and it muddies the message to the public.</p>
<p>Finally, an important part of the Commission&rsquo;s responsibility is determining how best to deploy the resources that Congress entrusts to us. We thoughtfully consider the timing and priorities of our regulatory agenda and how to best utilize our talented and hardworking staff. Discretion to determine the priorities of our regulatory agenda, especially with respect to discretionary rulemaking like that requested by the Petitioner, is a critical element of our ability to faithfully execute Congress&rsquo;s mandate. It is important that the Commission maintain discretion to direct focus to whichever parts of the capital markets need updated regulation.</p>

- The Firms' cooperation and early admission of breaches resulted in a 45% reduction in the fine.
- The Bank of England and the PRA published revised enforcement policies to speed up investigations and incentivize early admissions.
- Both HBUK and HBEU were found to have breached multiple rules and procedures, leading to the second largest fine imposed by the PRA. <br /><br /> <div>

<p>The PRA has fined&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk156809611"></a>HSBC Bank plc (<strong>HBEU</strong>) and HSBC UK Bank plc (<strong>HBUK</strong>) (together, the<strong>&nbsp;Firms</strong>) &pound;57,417,500 for historic depositor protection failings arising from the Firms&rsquo; failures over many years to properly implement the requirements set out in the Depositor Protection Rules. These included the failure to accurately identify deposits that were eligible for Financial Services Compensation Scheme (<strong>FSCS</strong>) protection. The failings occurred for HBEU between 2015 and 2022, and for HBUK between 2018 and 2021. This fine, the second highest imposed by the PRA, reflects the seriousness of the failings.</p>
<h3>HSBC Fine</h3>
<p>The Depositor Protection Rules require firms to put in place adequate systems and controls, and governance, to ensure the integrity of critical information which the FSCS relies upon to make prompt payments to depositors in the event of a firm failure. HBEU&rsquo;s depositor protection failings were so significant the PRA determined that it had materially undermined the firm&rsquo;s readiness for resolution.</p>
<p>HBEU also failed to be duly open and cooperative with the PRA in not alerting the PRA over an approximately 15-month period about problems identified in the incorrect marking of accounts as &ldquo;eligible&rdquo; for FSCS protection. This was clearly information which the PRA would expect firms to share fully and in a timely way.</p>
<p>This meant the Firms breached Fundamental Rules 2 and 6, as well as Depositor Protection Rules 11, 12 and 14. HBEU was also found to have breached Depositor Protection Rule 50, and Fundamental Rules 7 and 8. This is the first PRA enforcement action in relation to Fundamental Rule 8, which states that firm must prepare for resolution so, if the need arises, it can be resolved in an orderly manner with a minimum disruption of critical services.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Woods, Deputy Governor for Prudential Regulation and Chief Executive Officer of the PRA, said:</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;The serious failings in this case go to the heart of the PRA&rsquo;s safety and soundness objective. It is vital that all banks comply fully with our requirements around preparedness for resolution. HBEU fell far short of its obligations in this area, and failed to disclose its failings to us in a timely manner. These failures led to today&rsquo;s action, including the significant fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Firms&rsquo; failings included:</p>
<ul>
<li>The failure to assign clear ownership for the processes required under the Depositor Protection Rules; and</li>
<li>The failure to ensure that a senior manager, under the Senior Managers and Certification Regime, was allocated responsibility for these processes and the integrity of the information required under the Depositor Protection Rules.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>HBEU&rsquo;s failings further included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incorrectly marking 99% of its eligible beneficiary deposits as &lsquo;ineligible&rsquo; for FSCS protection;</li>
<li>Providing an incorrect attestation to the PRA confirming its systems satisfied certain requirements of the Depositor Protection Rules; and</li>
<li>Failing to produce finalised versions of annual reports required to be signed by its board of directors that confirmed compliance with the requirements of the Depositor Protection Rules for multiple years.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>The Firms&rsquo; cooperation throughout the investigation, including the early admission of certain rule breaches, resulted in a 15% reduction to the penalty. The Firms agreed to resolve the matter and therefore qualified for a further 30% reduction in the fine. Without these reductions, the fine imposed by the PRA would have been &pound;96.5m. The PRA does not consider that the Firms&rsquo; breaches were deliberate or reckless.</p>
<h3>The Bank of England publishes new enforcement policies</h3>
<p>Following a period of consultation, the Bank of England (<strong>Bank</strong>) and the PRA today have also published Policy Statement PS1/24, which sets out the revised approach to enforcement for both PRA firms and financial market infrastructure firms. This includes revisions to the procedures of the Bank&rsquo;s Enforcement Decision Making Committee (<strong>EDMC</strong>). The revised policies set out a new path for early cooperation and greater incentives for early admissions with the aim of speeding up investigations in appropriate cases. PS1/24 further sets out the PRA&rsquo;s policies and procedures for making supervisory and non-enforcement statutory notice decisions. Today&rsquo;s fine imposed by the PRA on HBEU and HBUK was under the PRA&rsquo;s pre-existing penalty policy.</p>
<p>The Bank expects to consult on further amendments to its enforcement policies in 2024, reflecting the additional powers granted under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2023.</p>

<title>Unsettling Silence: Dissent From Denial Of Request For Rulemaking To Amend 17 C.F.R. § 202.5(e), SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, Jan. 30, 2024</title>

<div> Keywords: Commission, settlement, denial, First Amendment, enforcement actions

Summary:<br />
- The Commission's gag rule prevents individuals from criticizing government actions during settlements, raising First Amendment concerns.
- The necessity and justification for the gag rule are questionable as it lacks firm footing in terms of protecting the Commission's reputation.
- The policy results in content-specific and permanent restraints on speech, potentially shielding the Commission's allegations from legitimate criticism.
- The requirement that defendants must either admit wrongdoing or promise not to deny the allegations as a condition of settlement has not been widely adopted by federal agencies, raising concerns about fairness and due process.
- The mandatory nature of the no-deny clause presents defendants with no real choice, undermining their constitutional rights.
- The ambiguity in the language of the no-deny clause creates uncertainty about what constitutes a prohibited action or statement, further restricting free speech. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>I dissent from the Commission&rsquo;s denial of a petition to amend Rule 202.5(e), our so-called gag rule.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp; This&nbsp;<i>de facto</i>&nbsp;rule follows from the Commission&rsquo;s enforcement of its policy, adopted in 1972, that it will not &ldquo;permit a defendant or respondent to consent to a judgment or order that imposes a sanction while denying the allegations in the complaint or order for proceedings.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp; In that same policy, the Commission articulated its belief &ldquo;that a refusal to admit the allegations is equivalent to a denial, unless the defendant or respondent states that he neither admits nor denies the allegations.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp; These two strands&mdash;the refusal to settle with persons who deny the allegations and the belief that refusing to admit is a denial&mdash;converge in the requirement that to settle with the Commission, a person must either (1) admit the allegations underlying the Commission&rsquo;s enforcement action or (2) state that she neither admits nor denies the allegations.</p>
<p>To compel compliance with the no-deny prong of the policy, the Commission requires settling defendants to agree that they &ldquo;will not take any action or make or permit to be made any public statement denying, directly or indirectly, any allegation in the complaint or creating the impression that the complaint is without factual basis&rdquo; and also &ldquo;will not make or permit to be made any public statement to the effect that Defendant does not admit the allegations of the complaint, or that this Consent contains no admission of the allegations, without also stating that Defendant does not deny the allegations.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp; The Commission further requires the settling defendant to &ldquo;withdraw[] any papers filed in this action to the extent that they deny any allegations in the complaint.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp; Finally, the Commission&rsquo;s mandatory language states that &ldquo;[i]f Defendant breaches this agreement, the Commission may petition the Court to vacate the Final Judgment and restore this action to its active docket.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp; The net result is that the settling defendant, for the action to stay settled, must agree both to rescind her past in-court statements contesting the truth of the Commission&rsquo;s allegations and promise never again to contest the truth of the Commission&rsquo;s allegations herself, or even permit others to contest the allegations.</p>
<p>In October 2018, the New Civil Liberties Alliance (NCLA) asked us to revise Rule 202.5(c) to read as follows:</p>
<p>The Commission has adopted the policy that in any civil lawsuit brought by it or in any administrative proceeding of an accusatory nature pending before it, a defendant or respondent may consent to a judgment or order in which he admits, denies, or states that he neither admits nor denies the allegations in the complaint or order for proceedings.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>I agree with the petitioner that this issue warrants a spot on our rulemaking agenda.&nbsp; One thing I love about this country is that Americans can and often do criticize their government. &nbsp;Without fearing reprisal, a person can condemn specific government actions, broad government policies, or the officials who carry out those actions and make those policies. &nbsp;This freedom to speak against the government and government officials is essential in a free society committed to the preeminence of the people. &nbsp;Of course, some criticisms of government policies, practices, or personnel may be baseless, but the American public, not government censors, should be the arbiters of validity. &nbsp;Our prohibition on denials prevents the American public from ever hearing criticisms that might otherwise be lodged against the government, let alone assessing their credibility.&nbsp; The policy of denying defendants the right to criticize publicly a settlement after it is signed is unnecessary, undermines regulatory integrity, and raises First Amendment concerns.</p>
<h2>I.</h2>
<p>When the Commission adopted the policy in 1972, it included a brief statement explaining why it needed the policy: &ldquo;it is important to avoid creating, or permitting to be created, an impression that a decree is being entered or a sanction imposed, when the conduct alleged did not, in fact, occur.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp; This concern seems largely theoretical.&nbsp; Even if the concern is real, the imprudent policy adopted in November 1972 is not the right way to protect the Commission&rsquo;s reputation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Commission devoted significant resources to evaluating its enforcement program in 1972.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp; In January 1972, Chairman William Casey created a three-member committee to &ldquo;examine the SEC&rsquo;s enforcement policy and practices, engage in frequent dialogue with the members of the Commission and with our staff, seek and sift the suggestions of the bar and make recommendations to the Commission for worthwhile improvements to our time-honored ways.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp; The June 1, 1972 Report of the Advisory Committee on Enforcement Policies and Practices&mdash;now commonly referred to as the Wells Report&mdash;included a lengthy discussion about the settlement of Commission enforcement actions, and made several recommendations related to the settlement process.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp; The Commission had decades of experience settling cases, through both settlements on a no-admit/no-deny basis and settlements allowing defendants to deny wrongdoing.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to some of these settlements, defendants issued flat denials of wrongdoing.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp; But neither the Wells Report nor Chairman Casey&rsquo;s lengthy ruminations on it discuss problems arising from settling defendants later denying the factual basis of the Commission&rsquo;s case.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp; Given the broad remit of the Committee and its public comment process,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;if problematic denials were common, the Committee and Commission would have heard about them.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>&nbsp; In the intervening years, when defendants have made denials contrary to the policy,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>&nbsp;such denials do not seem to have undermined the Commission&rsquo;s enforcement program. &nbsp;The absence of a public record specific to the adoption of the policy, the conclusory explanation of its necessity, and the absence of actual evidence of a problem weigh in favor of reexamining the policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The requirement that defendants must either admit or at least promise not to deny the government&rsquo;s allegations of wrongdoing as a condition of settlement has not been widely adopted by federal agencies.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a>&nbsp; Some agencies even explicitly allow settling defendants to deny the allegations of wrongdoing.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>&nbsp; As the Federal Trade Commission noted when approving one such settlement in 2012, it was confident in the work of its staff:</p>
<p>it is the evidentiary record developed by FTC staff during the course of its investigation, not any ensuing settlement agreement, that forms the basis for the action by Commission.&nbsp; A respondent&rsquo;s denial of liability in a consent agreement does not diminish staff&rsquo;s extensive investigation or the ability of the Commission to find a reasonable basis to finalize a settlement or to enforce an order that results from settlement negotiations.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></p>
<p>The FTC&rsquo;s Consent Order Procedures explicitly allow settlement agreements to &ldquo;state that the signing thereof is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by any party that the law has been violated as alleged in the complaint.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our staff&rsquo;s investigative work likewise would stand on its own even if we permitted defendant denials.</p>
<h2>II.</h2>
<p>Even apart from the scant factual basis for the Commission&rsquo;s given reason for needing the no-deny policy, it should be reexamined because a regulatory policy that prevents people from speaking against government action necessarily raises First Amendment concerns. &nbsp;Prohibiting a person from taking &ldquo;any action to make . . . any public statement that the complaint is without factual basis&rdquo; is a plain prior restraint on speech.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a>&nbsp; Prohibiting that same person from &ldquo;permit[ting] to be made any public statement that the complaint is without factual basis&rdquo; only exacerbates the problem by imposing on the defendant an obligation to restrain speech by others.&nbsp; Moreover, this content-specific and permanent restraint on speech effectively shields the Commission&rsquo;s allegations from criticism: as long as you live, you are bound not only to say nothing that the Commission believes &ldquo;directly or indirectly&rdquo; denies the complaint's allegations, but you also must never say anything that even &ldquo;create[s] the impression&rdquo; of a denial.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the obvious First Amendment ramifications of the no-deny policy, it is unsurprising that a court recently characterized the Commission&rsquo;s use of the no-denial provision as &ldquo;at a minimum . . . inconsistent with the spirit of the First Amendment and our Nation&rsquo;s time-honored tradition of protecting free expression.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a>&nbsp; The court continued by observing that:</p>
<p>[H]ere, the Provision is used by an agency of the federal government to shield itself from public view. This may inflict precisely the kind of societal harm the Founders adopted the First Amendment to protect against . . . . &nbsp;The upshot: so long as a defendant says what the SEC wants to hear (or says nothing at all), he does not violate the No-Admit-No-Deny Provision. This is quintessential viewpoint discrimination.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a></p>
<p>In its letter denying the NCLA&rsquo;s rulemaking petition, the Commission sidesteps First Amendment concerns. &nbsp;The Commission explains that &ldquo;a defendant can waive constitutional rights as part of a civil settlement.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a>&nbsp; In the Commission&rsquo;s telling, &ldquo;[a]s part of the settlement process, the Commission and a defendant negotiate terms,&rdquo; and &ldquo;if either party disagrees with terms that the other party views as necessary, [it] can decline to settle, and the Commission must bear its burdens of proof and persuasion in court.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission even suggests that&nbsp;<i>it</i>&nbsp;is the party making a sacrifice in settling instead of litigating because it is &ldquo;thereby forgoing its ability to prove its case in court.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a>&nbsp; Never mind that forgoing its day in court yields great benefits for the Commission.&nbsp; When it settles, the Commission does not need to prove the allegations in court&mdash;which is expensive, time-consuming, and difficult&mdash;and it gets a benefit it could never obtain through litigation&mdash;the permanent silence of the defendant.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s questionable claim that it is the party making significant concessions is not the most concerning aspect of the Commission&rsquo;s reasoning.&nbsp; That distinction goes to its casual assumption that defending litigation with the Commission is just like defending against any other plaintiff in a civil action.&nbsp; One suspects that defendants in Commission enforcement actions might view the matter differently.&nbsp; For most individuals, and even for many well-resourced corporate defendants, the time, expense, and difficulty of litigating against the federal government makes settling the only economically viable option to resolve Commission enforcement actions. &nbsp;Commission investigations preceding the settlement negotiations are themselves long and costly.&nbsp; Retaining counsel to respond to the Commission&rsquo;s document requests and subpoenas, to represent witnesses during sworn testimony, and to prepare and submit a response to a Wells notice (which allows defendants to respond to charges the staff is planning to recommend to the Commission) consumes enormous financial resources.&nbsp; Add to that monetary cost, the intangible yet often even more onerous emotional, physical, and relational tolls of litigation, and it is unremarkable that nearly all defendants in Commission actions settle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The inevitable mismatch between the Commission and most defendants in its enforcement actions carries through to the settlement process.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a>&nbsp; Even when the disparities in bargaining power between the Commission and the defendant are less pronounced, the no-deny clause is a mandatory, non-negotiable term.&nbsp; The Commission admits as much in its denial letter: &ldquo;[t]he policy binds the Enforcement staff&rdquo; and the Commission &ldquo;will not agree to a settlement . . . unless the defendant agrees not to publicly deny the allegations in the complaint.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a>&nbsp; As one judge recently put it, the mandatory nature of the no-deny policy presents defendants with no real choice; it demands: &ldquo;If you want to settle, . . . &lsquo;Hold your tongue, and don&rsquo;t say anything truthful&mdash;ever&rsquo;&mdash;or get bankrupted by having to continue litigating with the SEC.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a></p>
<p>The demand by the government that a defendant waive a fundamental constitutional right as a condition of settlement ought to be supported by a compelling rationale. &nbsp;Yet, as discussed above, the Commission&rsquo;s rationale of record&mdash;that the no-deny policy is necessary to &ldquo;avoid creating, or permitting to be created, an impression that a decree is being entered or a sanction imposed, when the conduct alleged did not, in fact occur&rdquo;&mdash;lacks firm footing.&nbsp; It would look bad if the SEC&rsquo;s settlements were shown to be baseless, unfairly negotiated, or legally flawed. The most logical solution to that concern, however, is to make sure that settlements are rooted in fact, are fairly negotiated, and are legally sound.&nbsp; Employing superior bargaining power to extract an agreement that defendants agree not to denigrate the settlement is a suboptimal solution.</p>
<p>In the end, far from shoring up the Commission&rsquo;s integrity, the reliance on these no-denial conditions undermines it. More than a decade ago, a court aptly explained the problematic perceptions that flow from the Commission&rsquo;s practice of settling without admissions and prohibiting denials:</p>
<p>[H]ere an agency of the United States is saying, in effect, &ldquo;Although we claim that these defendants have done terrible things, they refuse to admit it and we do not propose to prove it, but will simply resort to gagging their right to deny it. &rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a></p>
<p>Why should the public put much weight on allegations so flimsy that they need the protection of a contractual obligation not to deny them? &nbsp;Stated differently, &ldquo;What is the SEC so afraid of?&nbsp; Any criticism, apparently&mdash;or, rather, anything that may even &lsquo;create the impression&rsquo; of criticism&mdash;of that government agency.<a name="_Hlk157406302">&rdquo;</a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The public cannot be sure what to believe if the government actively seeks to squelch contrary voices. &nbsp;As the FTC has observed, a government regulator that is confident in its investigative work, procedural practices, and legal analysis does not need to demand silence on the part of settling defendants.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a>&nbsp; Other commentators have pointed out that &ldquo;[d]efendants who have been through an agency&rsquo;s enforcement process are often the most informed and in the best position to raise red flags about that process,&rdquo; so, by silencing them, &ldquo;the agencies insulate themselves from criticism and the public scrutiny that accountability demands.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowing people to talk freely about their experiences with the Commission would aid us in carrying out our mission.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a></p>
<h2>III.</h2>
<p>Because no-admit/no-deny settlements are the most common resolution of SEC enforcement actions, the rule at issue affects countless potential speakers. &nbsp;Given that all of these silenced speakers have been on the wrong end of an enforcement action, we can assume that some might have negative things&mdash;whether accurate or not&mdash;to say about the government. &nbsp;The gravity of silencing this subset of people weighs heavily on me. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Defenders of our policy might take comfort in the scope of the policy&mdash;after all, you can say bad things about the agency, just not about your settlement.&nbsp; To the contrary, the Commission&rsquo;s mandatory language is so ambiguous as to only aggravate my concerns. &nbsp;Defendants must agree that they will not &ldquo;indirectly&rdquo; deny &ldquo;any allegation in the complaint.&rdquo;&nbsp; What is an &ldquo;indirect&rdquo; denial?&nbsp; Defendants must also agree not to &ldquo;take any action&rdquo; that &ldquo;create[s] the impression that the complaint is without factual basis.&rdquo;&nbsp; What is an action that &ldquo;create[s] the impression&rdquo; that the complaint lacks a factual basis?&nbsp; A defendant looking at this language is not going to have any idea where it ends.&nbsp; Could she say that &ldquo;The Commission&rsquo;s enforcement process is a joke.&nbsp; Nobody should trust it to produce just results.&rdquo;? &nbsp;What if she stands outside the Commission&rsquo;s headquarters with a pile of salt, a copy of the complaint, and a sign that states &ldquo;Take these together.&rdquo; &nbsp;What if she places on a billboard the message &ldquo;SEC = Seriously Erroneous Complaints&rdquo;?&nbsp; In either case, has she &ldquo;create[d] the impression that the complaint is without factual basis&rdquo;?&nbsp; Can a defendant tell a post-settlement joke: &ldquo;How many SEC Commissioners does it take to screw in a lightbulb? &nbsp;Zero, because they prefer to let the truth languish in the dark.&rdquo;? &nbsp;What if she publishes a book with additional facts that were not included in the complaint, and those facts cast the entire case in an entirely different light?&nbsp; Has she then &ldquo;create[d] the impression&rdquo; that the complaint lacked a factual basis?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s requirement that a defendant agree not to &ldquo;permit&rdquo; denials of the allegations in the complaint is equally problematic.&nbsp; This language suggests that defendants have an affirmative obligation to stop other people from saying things that might cast doubt on the complaint&rsquo;s allegations.&nbsp; Must a settling defendant stop her husband from posting on social media his disagreement with the charges in his wife&rsquo;s settlement with the Commission?&nbsp; Must a defendant require subsequent employers to link to the settlement in the otherwise flattering profiles they post on their websites?&nbsp; Probably not, but the mandatory language nevertheless is troublingly nebulous.&nbsp; To obtain Commission authorization to file an enforcement action in district court, the Division of Enforcement is required to submit to the Commission an action memorandum that &ldquo;provides a comprehensive explanation of the . . . factual and legal foundation&rdquo; for the recommended civil action.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-nand-013024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Enforcement Manual, however, does not require that the Division include with the action memorandum a copy of the district court complaint.</p>
<p>The petitioner is correct that reconsideration of the rule is a pressing matter that belongs on the Commission&rsquo;s current notice-and-comment rulemaking agenda. &nbsp;Or, if my colleagues have concluded that our agenda is too packed with other projects, perhaps we can just drop the no-deny rule in the same unceremonious way we adopted it.</p>

<div> priorities, market structures, corporate governance, CCPs, ESG issues
Summary: 
The World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) has announced the 2024 priorities for the exchange and clearing industry. These include fostering better corporate governance, ensuring the stability of central clearing, leading on ESG issues, providing educational qualifications, and addressing new technologies such as crypto market design and AI. The WFE aims to advocate for these priorities and promote sustainable growth. <br /><br /> <div>
<p><span>The World Federation of Exchanges (WFE), the global industry group for exchanges and CCPs, today announces the 2024 priorities for the exchange and clearing industry.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>As the foundation of the financial system, regulated market infrastructure providers seek to engender the trust of all those who depend on neutral, responsible public markets. Each new year offers an opportunity to underscore this mandate and reaffirm this commitment.</span><br /><br /><span>In 2024, the WFE&rsquo;s priorities will focus on fostering efficient market structures that are resilient, robust, fair, transparent and stable in the midst of both uncertainty and innovation.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>The priorities:</span><br /><span>1. Fostering better corporate governance in the entire financial ecosystem. At present, scrutiny focuses largely on those entities that are already regulated and within legal parameters.</span><br /><br /><span>2.&nbsp;The CCPs&rsquo; reassurance promise. Fifteen years on from the biggest financial crisis in living memory, and four years after a global pandemic, central clearing remains the steadying influence in markets. The WFE&rsquo;s focus in 2024 will be on procyclicality, recovery &amp; resolution and transparency and proportionate capital rules.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>3. How market infrastructures can lead on ESG issues such as standardization, harmonization and reporting frameworks, as has been the case with the creation of the WFE Green Equities principles.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>4. WFE Education: As the WFE&rsquo;s&nbsp;</span><a href="https://world-exchanges.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=48ddcbc11eb58f141a51219ea&amp;id=1010433407&amp;e=979576350c" target="_blank">Market Infrastructure Certificate</a><span>&nbsp;continues to gather momentum, entering its second year, we&rsquo;ll focus on rolling out the educational qualifications that will be vital to the next generation of leaders.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>5. New technologies, including the evolution of crypto market design, as these new markets begin to grow closer to regulated exchange markets, and the role of AI. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>As the global association for the industry, the WFE unites its members as one voice to work towards achieving these priorities, underpinned by our four strategic pillars of advocacy, education, emerging markets and post-trade. The WFE, which represents more than 250 market infrastructures worldwide, will build on its policy and research work across all the priority areas, and will continue to develop industry consensus positions, best practice, standards and industry guidance, in addition to working on emerging trends.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>The WFE seeks to engage in, and promote, market development that leads to optimal outcomes in the future and fosters sustainable growth. Our longer-term work around understanding, defining and quantifying the economic and social role of exchanges and CCPs continues, so that we ensure the industry remains close to the issues that affect its stakeholders.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><strong>Nandini Sukumar, CEO at the WFE</strong><span>, said: &ldquo;The WFE Board has determined the key priorities and issues we will focus on this year. With the WFE&rsquo;s unique position and global view of market structures, our access to data and information, reinforced by our own analysis &amp; research, and the expertise we have built up through experience, we look forward to engaging with stakeholders in 2024 and championing the role of public markets and market-based finance.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Home finance remains a needlessly fragmented process,&rdquo; Bowler added. &ldquo;Fortunately, ICE has a proven playbook for streamlining and connecting complex financial transactions through digitization. Our significant investments in mortgage technology and data are allowing us to automate and accelerate elements of the process from start to finish &ndash; all to the benefit of the American home buyer or owner.

<p>On 17 January 2024, the National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) of the Hansa capacity calculation region requested a six-month extension from ACER to agree on the Transmission System Operators&rsquo; (TSOs&rsquo;) proposed cross-zonal capacity calculation methodology for the balancing timeframe in the Hansa region.</p>
<p>The Hansa region comprises 6 countries: Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, and Sweden.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Founder Of $1.7 Billion “HyperFund” Crypto Pyramid Scheme And Top Promoter with Fraud - Promoter Brenda Chunga (aka Bitcoin Beautee) Agrees To Settle Fraud And Unregistered Offering Charges</title>

<div> charged, fraudulent, pyramid scheme, crypto asset, investors
<br />
The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Xue Lee and Brenda Chunga for their involvement in a fraudulent crypto asset pyramid scheme known as HyperFund, which raised over $1.7 billion from investors. Lee and Chunga promoted membership packages, guaranteeing high returns, but the scheme collapsed in 2022, leaving investors unable to make withdrawals.
<br /><br />Summary: The SEC charged Xue Lee and Brenda Chunga for their involvement in a fraudulent crypto asset pyramid scheme, known as HyperFund, which raised over $1.7 billion. Lee and Chunga promoted membership packages, guaranteeing high returns, but the scheme collapsed in 2022, leaving investors unable to make withdrawals. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Xue Lee (aka Sam Lee) and Brenda Chunga (aka Bitcoin Beautee) for their involvement in a fraudulent crypto asset pyramid scheme known as HyperFund that raised more than $1.7 billion from investors worldwide.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, from June 2020 through early 2022, Lee and Chunga promoted HyperFund &ldquo;membership&rdquo; packages, which they claimed guaranteed investors high returns, including from HyperFund&rsquo;s supposed crypto asset mining operations and associations with a Fortune 500 company. As the complaint alleges, however, Lee and Chunga knew or were reckless in not knowing that HyperFund was a pyramid scheme and had no real source of revenue other than funds received from investors. In 2022, the HyperFund scheme collapsed and investors were no longer able to make withdrawals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As alleged in our complaint, Lee and Chunga attracted investors with the allure of profits from crypto asset mining, but the only thing that HyperFund mined was its investors&rsquo; pockets,&rdquo; said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;This case illustrates yet again how noncompliance in the crypto space facilitates schemes where promoters capitalize on the promise of easy money, without providing the detailed investor protection disclosures required by the registration provisions of the federal securities laws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in federal district court in the District of Maryland, charges Lee and Chunga with violating the anti-fraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, conduct-based injunctions preventing the defendants from participating in multi-level marketing or crypto asset offerings, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. Chunga agreed to settle the charges, to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the charged provisions and certain other activity, and to pay disgorgement and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a future date. The settlement is subject to court approval. The charges against Lee will be litigated.</p>
<p>In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the District of Maryland today announced criminal charges against Lee and Chunga. Chunga pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s ongoing investigation is being conducted by David Snyder and Assunta Vivolo of the SEC&rsquo;s Crypto Assets &amp; Cyber Unit (CACU). It is being supervised by David Hirsch and Jorge Tenreiro of the CACU and Nicholas Grippo and Scott Thompson of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be conducted by Judson Mihok and Gregory Bockin of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the District of Maryland; the Department of Justice, Fraud Section;&nbsp;Homeland Security Investigations New York; and the IRS.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy directs investors to resources on detecting and avoiding pyramid schemes. Investors can find additional information about pyramid schemes at Investor.gov.</p>

Rodney Burton, 54, of Miami, and Brenda Chunga, 43, of Severna Park, Maryland, were promotors of HyperFund.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The defendants are charged with defrauding investors to the tune of $1.89 billion. As alleged in court documents, the defendants falsely represented that investors would receive substantial returns paid from cryptocurrency mining operations, which did not in fact exist,&rdquo; said Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri&nbsp;of the Justice Department&rsquo;s Criminal Division. &ldquo;With our partners in Homeland Security Investigations and IRS Criminal Investigation, we are committed to uncovering sophisticated frauds involving cryptocurrency and digital assets and bringing those who perpetrate them to justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The level of alleged fraud here is staggering,&rdquo; said U.S. Attorney Erek L. Barron for the District of Maryland. &ldquo;Whether it&rsquo;s cryptocurrency fraud, or any other financial frauds, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. This office and our law enforcement partners will hold perpetrators accountable for these and other fraud schemes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to court documents, from June 2020 to November 2022, Lee and his co-conspirators allegedly offered and sold investment contracts to the public through HyperFund&rsquo;s online investment platform. HyperFund&rsquo;s promotional materials allegedly made various false claims, including that investors who purchased HyperFund &ldquo;memberships&rdquo; would receive between 0.5% to 1% daily in passive rewards until the company either doubled or tripled the investor&rsquo;s initial investment. To convince investors that HyperFund could make such payments, HyperFund allegedly claimed that its payments would be disbursed in part from its revenues from large-scale crypto mining operations, when in truth, HyperFund did not have such operations. Beginning in at least July 2021, HyperFund allegedly began to block investor withdrawals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s charges are a testament to the incredible work of HSI New York&rsquo;s El Dorado Task Force,&rdquo; said Acting Special Agent in Charge Erin Keegan of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) New York. &ldquo;I commend our law enforcement partners, including those at HSI Baltimore, for their outstanding collaboration. HSI will continue to protect American investors from financial predators.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The illegal activity alleged in this case is precisely the type of conduct IRS Criminal Investigation and our law enforcement partners are committed to deterring,&rdquo; said Acting Special Agent in Charge David Meisenheimer of the IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS:CI) Washington, D.C. Field Office. &ldquo;These charges send a clear message that we have the tools and internal fortitude to protect our financial systems by diligently investigating, prosecuting, and holding accountable those who seek to defraud the American public.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lee is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison. Burton is charged by criminal complaint with one count of conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business and one count of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. He also faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison on each count. Chunga pleaded guilty today to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud. She faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p>
<p>HSI New York&rsquo;s El Dorado Task Force and IRS:CI are investigating the case.</p>
<p>Trial Attorney Tian Huang of the Criminal Division&rsquo;s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Aaron S.J. Zelinsky and Spencer Todd for the District of Maryland are prosecuting the case. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you believe you are a victim in this case, please contact the Fraud Section&rsquo;s Victim Witness Unit toll-free at (888) 549-3945 or by email at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:victimassistance.fraud@usdoj.gov">victimassistance.fraud@usdoj.gov</a>.

<p><em>An indictment is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</em></p>

<div> Keywords: U.S. economy, GDP, labor market, inflation, housing markets
Summary: 
- U.S. economy showing strong growth, elevated labor force participation
- Real GDP growth at 3.3% in Q4 2023, personal consumption expenditure remained strong
- Labor markets exhibited solid gains but slowing job openings
- Headline and core inflation both cooled considerably
- New home construction and housing sales continued to support economic activity
- Risks to the economic outlook remain amid geopolitical tensions and a potential consumer slowdown
- The Administration is focused on expanding the economy's productive capacity through investments in clean energy, manufacturing, and infrastructure.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>Over the past three months, incoming data have remained consistent with a soft landing for the U.S. economy.&nbsp; Elevated labor force participation and the resolution of pandemic-era supply chain challenges have strengthened our economy&rsquo;s productive capacity, helping create space for strong economic growth while inflation continues to cool.&nbsp; Just last week, the Bureau of Economic Analysis&rsquo;s (BEA) advance estimate of gross domestic product (GDP) in the fourth quarter of 2023 surprised on the upside.&nbsp;While median forecasts expected annualized growth around 2.0 percent, the initial read of GDP growth was 3.3 percent at an annual rate.&nbsp; Real GDP rose 3.1 percent over the four quarters of 2023, the third strongest calendar year rate since before the Global Financial Crisis.&nbsp; In addition, employment growth moderated in the fourth quarter but remained well above rates needed to accommodate population growth.&nbsp;Importantly, labor supply remained elevated, allowing the unemployment rate to hold at low levels without adding inflationary pressures.&nbsp; Headline inflation cooled further as energy prices decreased on balance over the quarter, though further progress is needed to bring core inflation to a level consistent with the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s target.</p>
<p>Still, encouraging economic news in the fourth quarter does not assure similar performance in the current quarter.&nbsp; The economic situation can change quickly due to geopolitical and domestic events.&nbsp; Yet, despite many uncertainties and headwinds, the U.S. economy proved resilient and strong in 2023 and remains well-positioned as we move into 2024.&nbsp; The Administration remains focused on further expanding our economy&rsquo;s productive capacity as we implement significant investments in our nation&rsquo;s clean energy, manufacturing capacity, and infrastructure.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>REAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDP)</h3>
<p>Real GDP growth remained strong in the fourth quarter of 2023, rising by 3.3 percent at an annual rate, after exceptionally strong growth in the third quarter of 4.9 percent (see Table 1 &ndash; Real Gross Domestic Product).&nbsp; Significantly, growth in the fourth quarter was largely driven by underlying private domestic demand, including sustained momentum in personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and faster growth in business fixed investment.&nbsp;Over the four quarters of 2023, real GDP growth accelerated to 3.1 percent&mdash;the fastest annual pace this Administration and the third fastest annual pace since before the Global Financial Crisis.</p>
<p>Decomposing GDP into smaller components can be helpful in tracking the economy&rsquo;s performance.&nbsp; The four components we consider are: (1) private domestic final purchases (PDFP), the most persistent and stable components of output: personal consumption, business fixed investment, and residential investment; (2) government consumption and investment; (3) net international purchases (U.S. exports less U.S. imports); and (4) intermediate demand (or the change in private inventories).&nbsp;Examined separately, each component delivers specific information about activity in various sectors that can be useful in predicting the future path of growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first component, PDFP, is particularly important to analyze: it measures the private sector&rsquo;s capacity to drive self-sustaining growth and, therefore, may signal the direction of future economic performance.&nbsp; In the fourth quarter, real PDFP growth was a strong 2.6 percent at an annual rate, which accounted for 2.2 percentage points of total GDP growth.&nbsp; Although slowing modestly, personal consumption expenditure (PCE) growth remained close to the third quarter pace, as household finances were underpinned by strong labor market conditions and rising incomes in real terms.&nbsp; Spending on goods and services grew solidly.&nbsp; Household purchases of goods rose at a slower rate than in the third quarter.&nbsp; By contrast, the growth rate for consumption of services accelerated in the fourth quarter, driven by larger contributions from most components, save for expenditures on rent of rent of housing, food services, and financial service.&nbsp; On net, household spending on services accounted for roughly 55 percent of PCE&rsquo;s contribution to GDP growth.</p>
<p>Business fixed investment accelerated in the fourth quarter, reflecting growth in all three major components.&nbsp; Investment in equipment turned positive in the fourth quarter, while spending on intellectual property products grew for the fourteenth consecutive quarter.&nbsp; Meanwhile, investment in structures slowed sharply in the fourth quarter, dropping from 11.2 percent annualized in the third quarter to 3.2 percent&mdash;largely driven by less investment in commercial and health care buildings, as well as other structures.</p>
<p>Residential investment, the final component of PDFP, posted growth in the fourth quarter, marking this sector&rsquo;s first back-to-back quarters of expansion in three years.&nbsp; Although growth slowed to 1.0 percent in the final quarter of 2023 from 6.7 percent in the third quarter, the slower growth largely reflected weakness in brokers&rsquo; commissions and other types of residential investment, which partially offset a gain in single-family construction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other three components of GDP (government spending, net exports, and inventory changes) all made positive contributions to fourth quarter growth.&nbsp; Total government spending contributed solidly to growth in the fourth quarter, but paces of growth were softer at all levels of government&mdash;though state and local government expenditures accounted for more than two-thirds of the increase.&nbsp; International trade was a net positive contributor to real GDP growth as the increase in exports outweighed import growth, resulting in a narrower trade deficit in the fourth quarter.&nbsp; The change in private inventories, which can exhibit wide swings from quarter to quarter, added only slightly to growth in third quarter after a large contribution in the third quarter.&nbsp; Notably, this decline in the contribution from the change in private inventory investment explains most of the deceleration in real GDP growth from the third to the fourth quarters.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>LABOR MARKETS</h3>
<p>In the final quarter of 2023, the U.S. labor market exhibited solid employment gains, low unemployment, and stable labor force participation near post-pandemic highs.&nbsp; In addition, signs of cooling pointed to continuing realignment between labor demand and labor supply (see Table 2 &ndash; Labor Market Indicators).</p>
<p>The average pace of payroll job creation slowed in the fourth quarter to 165,000 per month.&nbsp; Although down from the third quarter average of 221,000 per month, the fourth quarter pace was still well above that needed to accommodate population growth.&nbsp; The unemployment rate also trended lower over the quarter and ended the year at 3.7 percent, down 0.1 percentage points from September.&nbsp; A broader measure of labor underutilization is the underemployment rate, which includes those working part-time for economic reasons and those marginally attached to the labor force.&nbsp; Although the underemployment rate stepped up to 7.1 percent at the end of the fourth quarter, it remains historically low; for comparison, the underemployment rate in 2019&mdash;a period generally viewed as a full-employment environment&mdash;averaged 7.2 percent throughout the year.&nbsp; Indeed, weekly unemployment insurance claims since late November have come in persistently below 2018 and 2019, when labor markets were likely at full employment.&nbsp; On average, initial unemployment claims (NSA) during the weeks ending January 13 and 20 were 12.0 percent below corresponding weeks in 2018 and 2019.&nbsp; Continuing claims data also have fallen below comparable 2018 and 2019 readings and are consistent with strong labor markets.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, labor supply and demand continued to realign in the fourth quarter.&nbsp; Labor supply held at or near post-pandemic highs: at 62.7 percent in the fourth quarter, total labor force participation was unchanged from the third quarter average.&nbsp; Although total LFPR edged down a bit in December, the year-end rate still was 62.5 percent&mdash;or 0.2 percentage points higher than a year earlier&mdash;while the prime-age (ages 25 to 54) LFPR was 83.2 percent, up 0.7 percentage points over the year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, demand for labor continued to ease.&nbsp; Job openings (or vacancies) have trended lower since peaking at 12.0 million in March 2022.&nbsp; This downtrend continued during the first two months of the fourth quarter (latest available data), during which the average number of job openings fell to 8.8 million, down 435,000 from the third quarter average.&nbsp; As a result, the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has declined from a peak of 2.0 in March 2022.&nbsp; As of November, there were 1.4 job openings per unemployed worker, down by 0.1 from the corresponding month in the third quarter.&nbsp; Although the ratio still is above the pre-pandemic high of 1.2, the downtrend since March 2022 confirms that labor demand and supply are realigning.</p>
<h3>INFLATION</h3>
<p>Headline inflation slowed considerably during the fourth quarter and, by the end of the quarter, was down on a year-over-year basis by nearly two-thirds of its peak in June 2022.&nbsp; Core inflation, meanwhile, maintained a steady pace throughout the third and further quarters; by the end of the year, core inflation was down roughly 40 percent from its peak in autumn of 2022.</p>
<p>As measured by the consumer price index (CPI), the average rate of monthly inflation during the fourth quarter was 0.1 percent, down from an average of 0.4 percent during the third quarter (see Table 3 &ndash; Inflation and Wage Growth Indicators).&nbsp; Headline inflation was held down by falling energy prices, which declined an average of 1.5 percent per month in the fourth quarter, after rising 2.4 percent on average in the third quarter.&nbsp; Despite the decline in energy prices in the fourth quarter, recent developments suggest upside price risk to energy and headline inflation.&nbsp; Geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and the Middle East, as well as OPEC+ production cuts, have added uncertainty to the energy outlook&mdash;though OPEC+ oil production cuts have encouraged output growth among non-OPEC+ countries, including the United States, and mitigated the price impact.&nbsp; For the other non-core components of inflation, average monthly food inflation was stable in the fourth quarter, remaining at the third quarter&rsquo;s average pace of 0.2 percent&mdash;that is, near rates seen prior to the pandemic.</p>
<p>Excluding energy and food, core CPI inflation remained stable in the second half of 2023&mdash;though inflation rates of core components diverged.&nbsp; Over the fourth quarter, core inflation averaged 0.3&nbsp;percent per month, unchanged from the third quarter.&nbsp; Core goods prices decreased for the second consecutive quarter&mdash;though the pace of deflation was roughly half that in the third quarter.&nbsp; By contrast, core services inflation remained elevated.&nbsp; Sustained upward pressure from rent of housing services (rent of primary residential and owners&rsquo; equivalent rent)&mdash;which is the largest share of core inflation&mdash;sets a high floor to core services inflation, though it has eased slowly.&nbsp; The fourth quarter pace of inflation for rent of housing services matched that of the previous two quarters but was 6.4 percent on a year-over-year basis in December, the slowest pace twelve-month pace since July 2022.&nbsp; For non-housing core services, inflation held steady&nbsp;at an elevated pace in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Inflation as measured by the PCE price index&nbsp;assigns different weights for different components and uses a different methodology in its calculation than the CPI.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the drivers of both measures of inflation and the patterns in the fourth quarter are broadly similar.</p>
<h3>HOUSING MARKETS</h3>
<p>New Residential Construction: On net, new home construction supported economic activity in the fourth quarter, with growth rates of all but the early stages of home building improving relative to the third quarter (see Table 4 &ndash; Housing Market Indicators).&nbsp; The pace of growth of total building permits&mdash;which precede future home construction&mdash;slowed slightly due to more moderate growth in the single-family sector.&nbsp; Multi-family permits, meanwhile, declined at a slower pace, extending the downtrend that began in the latter half of 2022.&nbsp; Meanwhile, growth of total housing starts turned positive in the fourth quarter, owing to a renewed growth in multi-unit starts.&nbsp; For the next two stages of production, the inventory of homes under construction was unchanged at the end of the fourth quarter, but home completions returned to positive growth.&nbsp; On a year-over-year basis, total home completions rose at the fastest pace since before the pandemic, signaling favorable developments for housing supply throughout 2023.</p>
<p>Homes Sales and Inventories: Ongoing housing affordability challenges&mdash;stemming from both high home prices and elevated, though declining, mortgage rates&mdash;continued to constrain existing home sales in the fourth quarter (see Table 4 &ndash; Housing Market Indicators).&nbsp; Sales of total existing homes declined for the third consecutive quarter and were down by 6.2&nbsp;percent over 2023.&nbsp; Even so, the pace of decline over 2023 was less than a fifth of that in 2022.&nbsp; Meanwhile, inventories of homes for sale fell to a 21-month low in December 2023, likely reflecting in part the reluctance of owners of existing homes to sell when they may be locked into low mortgages.</p>
<p>Accordingly, prospective homeowners have maintained their focus on the new home market, where sales of single-family units rose for five consecutive quarters before pulling back in the fourth quarter: sales of new single-family homes declined 1.6 percent per month, on average, after rising 0.7 percent in the third quarter.&nbsp; Starting in the summer of 2022, the strength of new home sales had weighed on the inventory-to-sales ratios (the number of months of sales that current inventories can support) but in the last two quarters, inventories for new homes have increased, from a low of 7.1 months in July 2023 to an average 8.3 months in the fourth quarter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Home Prices and Rents: Home prices maintained a rapid pace of growth during the early part of the fourth quarter, but some measures moderated significantly (see Table 5 &ndash; Home Price and Rent Indicators).&nbsp;Although&nbsp;growth in the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller&rsquo;s national home price index slowed modestly in October (last available data as of January 29),&nbsp;the pace of house price growth in the FHFA purchase only-index was nearly 60 percent lower than in the third quarter.&nbsp; Nonetheless, according to both home price measure, house prices set fresh record highs at the start of the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>For renters, measures of shelter cost growth were mixed in the fourth quarter.&nbsp; The CPI for rent of primary residence rose 5.7 percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter&mdash;though both rates were marginally slower than in the second quarter.&nbsp;However, measures of new rental agreements continue to suggest a favorable outlook for the rent CPI, which is a lagged measure and trails prices from rental unit listing services by about a year.&nbsp; Listing services data indicate that after slowing significantly in the third quarter, rental inflation turned negative in the fourth quarter, which may suggest further progress bringing down shelter inflation in coming quarters.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>RISKS TO THE OUTLOOK</h3>
<p>Even amid substantial economic growth and a gradual easing of labor markets, inflation has fallen substantially from the highs of mid-2022.&nbsp;We expect this trend to continue over the next year and anticipate that inflation will return to historical norms.&nbsp;However, there are risks to this outlook on both sides.&nbsp; Geopolitical risks or persistently strong demand growth without comparable supply expansion could push inflation above consensus forecasts.&nbsp; Alternatively, a significant cooling in the labor market could bring inflation down faster&mdash;but with greater cost for American workers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Geopolitical instability and supply chain disruptions:&nbsp; Russia&rsquo;s war in Ukraine continues to add uncertainty to the medium-term outlook.&nbsp; In addition, the ongoing conflict in the Middle East and drought conditions at the Panama Canal create further concerns of supply chain disruptions and could renew upward pressures on energy and goods prices.&nbsp; Fortunately, major impacts to the U.S. economy have not materialized to date, but these remain important risks to monitor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consumer slowdown and labor market cooling:&nbsp; Strong consumption in 2023 supported the economy, fueled by real income growth and a reduced saving rate.&nbsp; Households have drawn down much of their excess savings from the pandemic period, but household net worth as a share of disposable personal income remains high relative to historical levels.&nbsp; Households should be able to continue to grow consumption from growth in real incomes, but a risk remains that a slowdown in consumption could cool the labor market quickly, which could again reduce consumption and further slow the economy.&nbsp;This concern is particularly notable in areas with rising delinquency and default rates.&nbsp; In general, however, higher delinquency rates still reflect normalization from the low levels that persisted following pandemic income support programs.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
<p>The American economy remains strong, with rising incomes, a healthy labor market, and easing inflation.&nbsp; Going forward, we must continue to invest in expanding our economy&rsquo;s productive capacity in ways that benefit all Americans&mdash;what Secretary Yellen has called &ldquo;modern supply-side economics.&rdquo; The Biden-Harris Administration&rsquo;s investments in our clean energy and manufacturing sectors, as well as in our public infrastructure, are oriented toward this goal.&nbsp; The Administration remains committed to helping foster continued improvements like those we saw in 2023.</p>

<div> Treasury, borrowing, marketable debt, cash balance, financing<br />
Summary: The U.S. Department of the Treasury announced estimates of privately-held net marketable borrowing for the first two quarters of 2024. For January – March 2024, borrowing is expected to be $760 billion, and for April – June 2024, borrowing is expected to be $202 billion. The estimates are based on projected fiscal flows and cash balances. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced its current estimates of privately-held net marketable borrowing<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2054#ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;for the January &ndash; March 2024 and April &ndash; June 2024 quarters.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Sources-and-Uses-January-qtr12024.pdf">Sources and Uses Table</a></p>
<ul>
<li>During the January &ndash; March 2024 quarter, Treasury expects to borrow $760 billion in privately-held&nbsp;net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-March cash balance of $750 billion.<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2054#ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;The borrowing estimate is $55 billion lower than announced in October 2023, largely due to&nbsp;projections of higher net fiscal flows and a higher beginning of quarter cash balance.<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2054#ftn3">[3]</a></li>
<li>During the April &ndash; June 2024&nbsp;quarter, Treasury expects to borrow $202 billion in privately-held &nbsp;net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-June cash balance of $750 billion.<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2054#ftn4">[4]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the October &ndash; December 2023&nbsp;quarter, Treasury borrowed $776 billion in privately-held&nbsp;net marketable debt and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $769 billion. In October 2023, Treasury estimated borrowing of $776 billion and assumed an end-of-December cash balance of $750 billion. There was no change in privately-held net market borrowing although the ending cash balance was $19 billion higher due primarily to other sources of financing including lower than projected discount on marketable borrowing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Additional financing details relating to Treasury&rsquo;s Quarterly Refunding will be released at 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, January 31, 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2054#_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Privately-held net marketable borrowing excludes rollovers (auction &ldquo;add-ons&rdquo;) of Treasury securities held in the Federal Reserve System Open Market Account (SOMA) but includes financing required due to SOMA redemptions.&nbsp; Secondary market purchases of Treasury securities by SOMA do not directly change net privately-held marketable borrowing but, all else equal, when the securities mature and assuming the Federal Reserve does not redeem any maturing securities, would increase the amount of cash raised for a given privately-held auction size by increasing the SOMA &ldquo;add-on&rdquo; amount.</p>

<div> proposal, update, rules, business combinations, national banks <br />
Summary:<br />

The proposal includes a policy statement that provides guidance on the OCC's review process for applications under the Bank Merger Act, discussing general principles, statutory factors, and the decision process for public comment periods or meetings. The OCC aims to improve bank merger outcomes for the benefit of communities, competition, and a diverse banking system. <div>

<li>The OCC&rsquo;s consideration of the financial stability; managerial and financial resources and future prospects; and convenience and needs statutory factors under the BMA;</li>
<li>The OCC&rsquo;s decision process for extending the public comment period or holding a public meeting.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This notice of proposed rulemaking follows the OCC&rsquo;s comprehensive review of bank merger policy and regulations that included a public Symposium on Bank Mergers in February 2023,&rdquo; said Acting Comptroller Michael J. Hsu. &ldquo;The OCC continues to work with our interagency peers to update our analytical frameworks to best improve bank merger outcomes to benefit communities, enhance competition, and support a diverse banking system and looks forward to reviewing comments on the proposal.&rdquo;</p>

<div> ISDA-Clarus Adoption Indicator, Q4 2023, RFR-linked IRD, DV01, trading activity<br />
Summary:<br />
The ISDA-Clarus RFR Adoption Indicator increased to 61.8% in Q4 2023 compared to 51.7% in Q4 2022. RFR-linked IRD DV01 increased to $73.2 billion. Total IRD DV01 grew to $118.4 billion. RFR-linked IRD traded notional rose to $391.6 trillion. The percentage of trading activity in SOFR increased to 72.3%. CHF and GBP RFR-linked IRD DV01 accounted for 100% and 99.8% respectively in Q4 2023. <div>
<p>This is the final publication of the ISDA-Clarus Adoption Indicator, which was first published in July 2022. The indicator was developed by ISDA and Clarus Financial Technology to track how much global trading activity (as measured by DV01) is conducted in cleared over-the-counter and exchange-traded interest rate derivatives (IRD) that reference risk-free rates (RFRs) in eight major currencies. In this last report, ISDA provides a comparison of Q4 2023 vs. Q4 2022 trading activity instead of a monthly snapshot.</p>
<p>The ISDA-Clarus RFR Adoption Indicator increased to 61.8% in Q4 2023 compared to 51.7% in Q4 2022. On a traded notional basis, the percentage of RFR-linked IRD rose to 58.3% from 47.4% over the same period.</p>
<p>Key highlights for Q4 2023 vs. Q4 2022 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>RFR-linked IRD DV01 increased to $73.2 billion from $46.5 billion.</li>
<li>Total IRD DV01 grew to $118.4 billion compared to $90.1 billion.</li>
<li>RFR-linked IRD traded notional rose to $391.6 trillion from $243.3 trillion.</li>
<li>Total IRD traded notional grew to $672.0 trillion compared to $513.4 trillion.</li>
<li>The percentage of trading activity in SOFR increased to 72.3% of total USD IRD DV01 in Q4 2023 compared to 59.9% in Q4 2022.</li>
<li>CHF and GBP RFR-linked IRD DV01 accounted for 100% of total CHF IRD DV01 and 99.8% of total GBP IRD DV01, respectively, in Q4 2023.</li>

<div> Keywords: EBA, industry survey, credit institutions, ESG risks, methodologies <br />
Summary: The European Banking Authority (EBA) has launched an industry survey to gather information from credit institutions on their approaches to classifying exposures to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks and the accessibility of ESG data. Participation is voluntary, and findings will be presented anonymously. The EBA aims to assess the availability and feasibility of standardizing ESG risk identification and qualification. Additionally, they may organize an industry workshop for further discussion on the topic. <br /> <div>
<p class="body">The European Banking Authority (EBA) today launched an industry survey to receive input from credit institutions on their methodologies to classify exposures to environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, as well as on the accessibility and availability of ESG data for this purpose. The objective of the survey is to collect qualitative information on credit institutions&rsquo; current practices to inform the EBA&rsquo;s work on the feasibility of introducing a standardised methodology to identify and qualify exposures to ESG risks. The deadline to respond to the industry survey is 29 March 2024.</p>
<h4>Survey process</h4>
<p class="body">Institutions willing to take part in the survey should contact the EBA and express their interest via the address&nbsp;<a href="mailto:eba-esg-risks-classification@eba.europa.eu">eba-esg-risks-classification@eba.europa.eu</a>. These institutions will be granted access to the survey accordingly. While the file containing all questions is available on the EBA website&nbsp;for convenience, replies to the survey should be submitted directly to the EBA via the dedicated survey tool.</p>
<p class="body">Participation in the survey is voluntary. However, the EBA strongly encourages credit institutions to take part in this important exercise. No confidential information will be disclosed and the findings will be presented anonymously at an aggregated level. The EBA reserves the right to follow-up bilaterally with institutions participating in the survey.</p>
<h4>Background and next steps</h4>
<p class="body">As part of the revised banking package, the EBA will receive new mandates under Article 501c of amended Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (see&nbsp;<a href="https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-15883-2023-INIT/en/pdf">provisional agreement</a>).</p>
<p class="body">This survey is launched with a purpose to respond to points (a) and (b) of that article, which request the EBA to assess the following:</p>
<ul>
<li class="body">availability and accessibility of relatable and consistent ESG data; </li>
<li class="body">feasibility of introducing a standardised methodology to identify and qualify exposures [subject to ESG risks], based on a common set of principles for ESG risk classification, using:    
<ul>
<li class="body">information on transition and physical risk indicators made available by sustainability disclosures reporting frameworks (EU and internationally); </li>
<li class="body">guidance and conclusions coming from the supervisory stress-testing or scenario analysis of climate-related financial risks conducted by the EBA or the competent authorities; </li>
<li class="body">relevant ESG score of the ECAI credit risks rating by a nominated ECAI, if appropriately reflecting the ESG risks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="body">The mandate complements the initial discussion and findings presented in the&nbsp;<a href="https://eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-recommends-enhancements-pillar-1-framework-capture">EBA Report on the role of environmental and social risks in the prudential framework</a>&nbsp;published on 12 October 2023.</p>
<p class="body">The EBA may organise an industry workshop with institutions participating in the survey for further dialogue on this topic and to exchange on the findings.</p>

Summary:<br />2023 was a challenging year for the European economy, with inflationary pressures and geopolitical uncertainties leading to stagnant growth. European capital markets saw slow increases in market capitalisation, struggling primary markets, and decreased lit trading. However, ETF volumes normalised, while fixed-income trading on exchanges, including ESG bonds, resurged. <div>
<p><span>Global Overview</span></p>
<p>2023 was a challenging year for the European economy. The continent faced multiple headwinds, including inflationary pressures and geopolitical uncertainties. These factors weighed on economic activity, leading to stagnant growth. Developments in European capital markets reflected these economic trends. Market capitalisation slowly increased while primary markets struggled and lit trading decreased.</p>
<p>ETFs volumes normalised to pre-pandemic levels, but the listed investment funds market continued its downtrend. Beyond equities, trading in exchange-traded derivatives stabilised and fixed-income trading on exchanges, including ESG bonds, resurged.</p>

<div> Securities, Markets, ESMA, Guidelines, Crypto-assets
<br />
ESMA seeks input on reverse solicitation exemption and classification of crypto-assets as financial instruments. The proposed guidance clarifies conditions for reverse solicitation exemption and aims to provide structured criteria for classifying crypto-assets as financial instruments. Consultation closes on April 29, 2024, with the final report expected in Q4 2024.
<br /><br />Summary: ESMA is seeking feedback on guidelines for reverse solicitation and the classification of crypto-assets as financial instruments. The aim is to provide clear conditions and criteria for the application of the reverse solicitation exemption and to ensure consistency across the EU. The consultation closes on April 29, 2024, with a final report expected in Q4 2024. <div>
<p class="text-align-justify">The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, today publishes two&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/consultations/consultation-reverse-solicitation-and-classification-crypto-assets">Consultations Papers on guidelines under Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA)</a>, one on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-01/ESMA35-1872330276-1619_Consultation_Paper_on_the_draft_guidelines_on_reverse_solicitation_under_MiCA.pdf">reverse solicitation</a>&nbsp;and one on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-01/ESMA75-453128700-52_MiCA_Consultation_Paper_-_Guidelines_on_the_qualification_of_crypto-assets_as_financial_instruments.pdf">classification of crypto-assets as financial instruments</a>.</p>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">ESMA invites comments from stakeholders by 29 April 2024.</p>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Consultation paper on guidelines on reverse solicitation</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify">In this consultation, ESMA is seeking input on proposed guidance relating to the conditions of application of the reverse solicitation exemption and the supervision practices that&nbsp;National&nbsp;Competent&nbsp;Authorities&nbsp;(NCAs) may take to prevent its circumvention.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">The proposed guidance confirms&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-10/ESMA74-449133380-441_Statement_on_MiCA_Supervisory_Convergence.pdf">ESMA&rsquo;s previous message</a>&nbsp;that the provision of crypto-asset services by a third-country firm is limited under MiCA to cases where the client is the exclusive initiator of the service. This exemption should be understood as very narrowly framed and must be regarded as the exception. A firm cannot use it to bypass MiCA.</p>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Consultation paper on guidelines on&nbsp;conditions and criteria for the classification of crypto-assets as financial instruments</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify">In this consultation paper, ESMA is seeking input on establishing clear conditions and criteria for the qualification of crypto-assets as financial instruments. This initiative, which follow on from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/esma50-157-1391_crypto_advice.pdf">previous work by ESMA</a>, is aimed at bridging the MiCA regulation and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II) and ensuring consistency across the EU.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">The proposed guidelines aim at providing NCAs and market participants with structured but flexible conditions and criteria to determine whether a&nbsp;<a>crypto-asset</a>&nbsp;can be classified as a financial instrument.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">To do so, the draft strikes a balance between providing guidance and avoiding establishing a one-size-fits-all approach. Once finalised, these guidelines will provide much-needed clarity and contribute to the global standards in crypto-asset regulation.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span>Next Steps</span></h4>
<p>The consultation closes on 29 of April 2024. ESMA will consider the feedback it receives to the consultation in Q2 2024 and expects to publish a final report in Q4 2024.</p>

<p>The European Energy Exchange (EEX) expands its product offering on the EEX natural gas derivatives markets with new, financially settled EEX TTF Natural Gas Month Futures denominated in US$/MMBtu, from 15 April 2024.</p>
<p>Steffen Koehler, COO of EEX, comments: &ldquo;<em>In recent years, TTF in US$/MMBtu has become the pricing benchmark of choice for European LNG imports as well as being used outside of this region for LNG-related trading strategies. We therefore believe that our new extended offering will be ideal to meet the growing needs of this market, by enabling wider hedging opportunities for the LNG trading community.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new products will be available with up to 72 monthly expiries, complementing EEX&rsquo;s existing offering for the LNG market, which currently comprises the EEX JKM LNG Natural Gas Futures.</p>
<p>LNG is a fast-growing global commodity, and in the first half of 2023 LNG imports to the UK and Europe exceeded pipeline delivery for the first time. In 2023, LNG made up 42% of the EU&rsquo;s total gas imports.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<span>European Energy Exchange (EEX)</span>&nbsp;is the leading energy exchange which builds secure, successful and sustainable commodity markets worldwide &ndash; together with its customers.

<li><span><i>Increased client participation deepens liquidity and further strengthens price discovery function</i></span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CME Group, the world's leading derivatives marketplace, today announced its Mexican peso and Brazilian real FX futures contracts reached all-time average daily volume (ADV) and open interest (OI) records in 2023. The increased trading is resulting in deeper liquidity and broader client participation, which in turn, strengthens reliance on these markets as the premier source of price discovery for the broader FX marketplace.</p>
<p>2023 LatAm FX futures trading highlights include:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Mexican peso futures reached a record&nbsp;$1.8 billion&nbsp;in equivalent notional value ADV.</li>
<li>Brazilian real futures achieved a record&nbsp;$300 million&nbsp;in equivalent notional value ADV.&nbsp;</li>
<li>CME Group's&nbsp;LatAm FX futures complex hit an all-time ADV record of 82,000 contracts (+7.4% year-over-year) and an all-time OI record of 304,000 contracts (+20.4% year-over-year).&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The continued growth of the Mexican and Brazilian economies combined with the current interest rate environment, is driving more clients to trade CME Group FX futures," said&nbsp;
Paul Houston, Global Head of FX Products,&nbsp;CME Group. "As client participation continues to grow, we are focused on building and maintaining consistent liquidity that will support the long-term development of the electronic FX markets in&nbsp;Latin America."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"CME Group's&nbsp;liquidity in Mexican peso futures has been a key element to enhance our hedging activities, and thus to be able to heighten our client's product offering,"&nbsp;said&nbsp;
Alejandro Vigil, Head of FX BBVA M&eacute;xico.</p>
<p>"CME Group&nbsp;offers its clients unique access to liquidity from local onshore market markers which are particularly valuable in futures and options for non-deliverable currencies. These are markets that require cumbersome local vehicles for direct access or higher costs from global market makers," said&nbsp;
Bernardo Gattass, Head of Ita&uacute;&nbsp;Unibanco's Options trading desk. "It's the case for the Brazilian real which is a large market with relevant local liquidity and large local market makers such as&nbsp;Ita&uacute;, its largest bank by assets. Many large global institutional investors would do well to add&nbsp;CME Group&nbsp;to their price provider list for LatAm currencies and tap into the liquidity of both global and local market makers, such as&nbsp;Ita&uacute;&nbsp;for the real and many others."</p>

<title>CISI Launches Mental Health And Addiction Awareness e-Learning Modules</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cisi-launches-mental-health-and-addiction-awareness-e-learning-modules/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cisi-launches-mental-health-and-addiction-awareness-e-learning-modules/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Financial services professionals globally are being offered the opportunity to learn how to boost their wellness, both personally and in the workplace and recognise, and seek help for, potentially addictive behaviour.</p>
<p>Members of charity and professional body, the Chartered Institute for Securities &amp; Investment (CISI) can access the two new e-learning modules, free, through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisi.org/cisiweb2/cisi-website/startaconversation?section=wellbeing" target="_blank">CISI mental health portal</a>. The modules, 30 minutes each, are interactive and test knowledge based around real-life scenarios. The combined learning between the two modules qualifies for one hour of CISI CPD.</p>
<p>The two e-learning modules were designed and produced for CISI members by&nbsp;Synergy Health, a specialist medical and care management consultancy practice&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.bwrsynergyhealth.com/" target="_blank">www.bwrsynergyhealth.com</a>).</p>
<p><b><i>Mental Health Awareness &ndash; Boosting Your Brain and Wellness in the Workplace</i></b><b>&nbsp;</b>focuses on creating a mentally healthy workplace, with strategies for maintaining wellness. Module no 2,&nbsp;<b><i>Addiction Awareness, Stamping Out The Stigma and the Road to Recovery&nbsp;</i></b>focuses on understanding addiction, how to recognise signs of addictive behaviour and where to seek help.</p>
<p>The CISI was one of the first sector professional bodies to create a mental health portal, following the results of its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisi.org/cisiweb2/cisi-website/about-us/press-release/2018/12/21/off-the-scale-workloads-and-out-of-touch-senior-management-identified-as-key-causes-of-financial-services-staff-stress-and-mental-ill-health-says-cisi-survey" target="_blank">first-ever mental health survey</a>&nbsp;and feedback from members.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisi.org/cisiweb2/cisi-website/startaconversation" target="_blank">The portal</a>&nbsp;was launched to encourage the conversation around mental health in financial services and to help end the stigma around discussing mental health issues. In 2021 the CISI examined the effect the pandemic had on the&nbsp;<a href="https://financialplanning.cisi.org/cisiweb2/cisi-website/about-us/press-release/2021/07/21/pandemic-leaves-its-mark-as-55-of-women-finance-workers-have-suffered-stress-in-the-last-year-says-cisi" target="_blank">mental health of finance workers</a>, and in 2022 it looked at the&nbsp;<a href="https://financialplanning.cisi.org/cisiweb2/cisi-website/about-us/press-release/2022/08/10/banter-negatively-impacting-97-of-financial-services-professionals-while-hr-departments-have-an-image-problem-says-cisi-survey" target="_blank">effect of banter</a>&nbsp;on finance professionals&rsquo; mental health. Last year the professional body surveyed members to look at workplace support for women senior leaders&nbsp;<a href="https://financialplanning.cisi.org/cisiweb2/cisi-website/about-us/press-release/2023/02/06/almost-a-quarter-of-financial-services-firms-have-no-measures-in-place-to-support-women-experiencing-menopause" target="_blank">going through the menopause.</a></p>
<p>Tracy Vegro, CISI Chief Executive said: &ldquo;More than ever, we all need to know support and strategies are available to help us maintain a level of positive mental health, to cope with the stresses and strains of both personal and professional life. These two new modules are an important resource for CISI&rsquo;s membership community to navigate and understand some of these mental health challenges, whether it be developing mental health resilience or recognising the signs of potential addiction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Synergy Health are delighted to be partnering with the CISI to provide CISI Members with training and awareness on mental health, well-being and addiction with a particular focus on these issues in the workplace. Dr Simone Yule, Clinical Director of Synergy Health said: &ldquo;'We hope to make a difference to people's lives by raising awareness on these crucial topics and look forward to discussing our content in the forthcoming webinar&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The CISI is running a webinar on the two module topics of mental health awareness and addiction awareness on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisi.org/cisiweb2/shop/event-details?eventid=86855262" target="_blank"><b>8 February 2024</b></a>&nbsp;at 12:30 pm.</p>

<title>NovaSparks Expands Its Coverage Of The Wireless Market - Leading FPGA-Powered Market Data Company Adds Quincy QED Wireless Feed To NovaTick[TM]</title>

<div> FPGA, Market Data, NovaSparks, Quincy Data, QED Feed
Summary: 
NovaSparks and Quincy Data collaborated to integrate the QED feed into NovaTickTM, providing ultra-low latency market data support for electronic trading platforms worldwide. This partnership allows customers to benefit from faster, more efficient trading and simplified architecture, solidifying NovaSparks' leading position in market data solutions. 
<br /><br /> <div>
<p>Quincy Data, powered by McKay Brothers, and NovaSparks, the leading field programmable gate array (FPGA) market data company, have worked together to add the support of the Quincy Extreme Data (QED) Feed to NovaTick<sup>TM</sup>.</p>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NovaTick<sup>TM</sup> is NovaSparks&rsquo; ultra-low latency ticker-plant based on a powerful FPGA matrix architecture. It handles the high-performance requirements of electronic trading platforms with the speed and determinism that only FPGAs can bring. NovaTick<sup>TM</sup> converts the QED feed into NovaSparks&rsquo; normalized wire format in 400ns and can also provide the QED wireless market data through its software C++ Application Programming Interface (API), NSMDA, or its hardware API, NovaLink<sup>TM</sup>. Arbitration between the QED wireless feed and the QED fiber feed can also be added in front of the feed handler in NovaTick<sup><sup>TM</sup></sup> to provide a reliable normalized stream of market data.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The vast majority of our customers are trading across geographies and asset classes. Often, they rely on wireless services to transport market data at the fastest speed. This collaboration will not only simplify their trading architecture, but it will also give them an opportunity to further reduce the overall latency of market data sent abroad via wireless services. The addition of the QED feed brings our global feed total to 75, confirming our leading position among all the FPGA-centric market data solutions providers. This puts us in a unique position to offer unparalleled service,&rdquo; said Luc Burgun, NovaSparks&rsquo; chief executive officer and president.</p>
<p>"Today, FPGA technology is an essential component of any high-speed trading infrastructure. FPGAs are able to handle very large market data bursts while maintaining a deterministic latency profile. The Quincy Extreme Data service distributes a normalized feed of select market data sourced from financial exchanges globally to many points of presence (PoPs) in the U.S., Europe, India, and Asia. We welcome NovaSparks into our ecosystem. This new solution will give all NovaSparks customers a very efficient way to use market data from our wireless service directly into their trading platforms," says St&eacute;phane Tyc, Quincy Data co-founder.</p>
<p>NovaTick&rsquo;s pure FPGA processing architecture is incredibly fast and deterministic, yielding one to two orders of magnitude faster than traditional software solutions. NovaSparks&rsquo; pure-FPGA feed handlers have a normalized output format across markets, enabling NovaSparks customers to integrate new feeds with minimum effort.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Support of the QED feed by NovaTick<sup>TM</sup> allows us to benefit from the tight integration we already have between NovaTick<sup>TM</sup> and our trading platform," says Alain Katchouni, Managing Director, Head of ETF and Electronic Trading at National Bank Financial Inc.,<b> </b>one of Canada's six systemically important banks. "This new addition simplifies and accelerates our trading environment when we use Quincy Extreme Data service,&rdquo; added Katchouni.</p>

However, it registered a jump in deal value and improvement in its ranking by value in 2023 compared to 2022. Rothschild &amp; Co went ahead from occupying the sixth position by value in 2022 to top the chart in 2023.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Temenos (SIX: TEMN) today announced that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.temenos.com/community/partners/nagarro/" target="_blank">Nagarro</a>, a global digital engineering leader, has signed an agreement to license and further develop Temenos&nbsp;<a href="https://www.temenos.com/products/country-model-banks/" target="_blank">Country Model Banks</a>&nbsp;for financial institutions in Romania and Poland. The agreement opens new opportunities for growth for Temenos with enhanced local functionality and service capability provided by Nagarro in these markets.</p>
<p>Country Model Banks are a key differentiator for Temenos and through such licensing agreements, Temenos is able to scale this competitive advantage with partners further developing and also building new model banks compatible with the banking solutions on Temenos&rsquo; composable platform and SaaS offerings on Temenos Banking Cloud.</p>
<p>As part of this new agreement, Nagarro is committed to invest in and develop regulatory and business-specific localized functionality to enhance the Temenos Model Banks for financial institutions in Romania and Poland.</p>
<p>Nagarro, which has over 19,000 experts in 36 countries, has been operating in Romania since 1998 and in Poland since 2014 across 7 delivery centers. The Country Model Bank agreement enables Temenos customers in these markets to benefit from Nagarro&rsquo;s already well-established presence and regional expertise.</p>
<p>With over 25 years of experience in the industry, Nagarro supports the end-to-end banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) spectrum, including core banking, payments, lending and leasing, mobility and cognitive services, and financial services (investment banking, asset and wealth management).</p>
<p>This agreement builds on the strong existing relationship between the two companies, which has seen Nagarro complete more than 43 successful projects involving Temenos Transact implementation and transformation, along with 20 Temenos upgrades, and engage in 350 projects across diverse Temenos solutions. Nagarro was also awarded the&nbsp;&lsquo;APAC&nbsp;Temenos&nbsp;Delivery&nbsp;Partner of the&nbsp;Year&rsquo;&nbsp;award&nbsp;in 2023.</p>
<p><b>Ross Mallace,</b><b>&nbsp;EVP and&nbsp;</b><b>Global Head of SaaS &amp; Partner Ecosystem, Temenos, said:</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;We are excited to announce this agreement with Nagarro, which opens new opportunities for Temenos with financial institutions in Romania and Poland. Nagarro will become a trusted partner for the development and maintenance of Country Model Banks for these two countries and help customers in their progressive technology renovation. Such agreements bring additional value to our platform, which benefits our clients and ultimately delivers incremental growth for Temenos.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Vishwanath Rajashekarappa, a co-founder, Nagarro, commented:</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;We are delighted to be granted this license by Temenos to develop Country Model Banks to drive growth and customer success. This agreement is a testament to our capabilities as a long-standing partner of Temenos and our knowledge of local market practices and regulations. We look forward to helping clients in Romania and Poland scale and optimize their businesses on the Temenos banking platform.&rdquo;</p>

<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>In the October 2023 Monetary Policy Statement (MPS), MAS maintained the rate of appreciation of the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER) policy band, with no change to the width of the band or level at which it was centred. Since then, the S$NEER has strengthened in line with the appreciating policy band</span><span>.</span></p>

<h2>GROWTH BACKDROP</h2>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Economic activity in Singapore&rsquo;s major trading partners was resilient in the last quarter of 2023. In the near term, global growth is expected to be impacted by the lagged effects of elevated interest rates in the advanced economies. However, global final demand should pick up later this year, as lower inflation sustains private consumption expenditure, and monetary policy settings in the major economies turn more supportive. This outlook is subject to uncertainties, particularly stemming from ongoing geopolitical conflicts which could precipitate negative global supply and demand shocks.</span></p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>MTI&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Advance Estimat</em>es show that growth in the Singapore economy picked up to 1.7% on a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis in the last quarter of 2023, from 1.3% in Q3 and an average of &minus;0.1% in the first half of the year. This strengthening in momentum was mainly attributable to the external-facing sectors. For 2023 as a whole, the Singapore economy is estimated to have expanded by 1.2%.</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prospects for the Singapore economy should continue to improve in 2024, with GDP growth projected to come in between 1&ndash;3%. The recovery in the manufacturing and financial sectors should be supported by the turnaround in the electronics cycle and anticipated easing in global interest rates, respectively, even as growth in the domestic-oriented sectors further normalises towards pre-pandemic rates. Consequently, the slightly negative output gap in 2023 will narrow in the second half of 2024.</span></p>
<h2>INFLATION OUTLOOK</h2>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS Core Inflation<span>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/monetary-policy-statements/2024/mas-monetary-policy-statement-29jan24#1">[1]</a></span>&nbsp;</span>continued to decline in year-on-year terms in Q4 2023, though by less than expected. Inflation for food and retail goods moderated, offsetting firmer electricity &amp; gas inflation. Travel-related services inflation, which is largely determined by conditions in tourism markets abroad, was stronger as hotel room rates and package tour prices saw steep increases. For 2023 as a whole, MAS Core Inflation came in at 4.2%, slightly higher than the 4.1% in 2022. However, excluding the impact of the GST increase, core inflation would have fallen by an estimated 0.6%-point in 2023 compared to 2022.</p>
<div>
<div id="edn1"></div>
</div>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>CPI-All Items inflation likewise edged down in Q4 2023 from the preceding quarter. Accommodation inflation eased as the supply of completed housing units increased. This helped to offset rising private transport inflation amid higher petrol prices. CPI-All Items inflation averaged 4.8% in 2023, down from 6.1% in the preceding year.</span></p>
<p>7.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span>MAS Core Inflation is expected to rise in the current quarter due in part to the one-off impact of the 1%-point hike in the GST from January this year, as well as the increase in the carbon tax. Water prices will rise from Q2 this year amid increases in production costs. Inflation for certain services components, including public transport and healthcare, could also stay elevated as less frequently-adjusted prices rise to catch up with higher cost levels.</span></p>
<p>8.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Setting aside the transitory impact of the GST increase, core inflation is forecast to decline gradually over 2024. Lower imported costs and a slower pace of domestic cost increases should underpin the moderating trend in inflation. Global energy and food commodity prices have fallen and are expected to remain broadly stable, while imported costs of most intermediate and final goods should be tempered by favourable global supply conditions. On the domestic front, wage growth should ease this year&nbsp;</span><span>as labour market tightness dissipates</span><span>, while productivity is also projected to pick up. Consequently, unit labour costs will rise at a slower pace.</span></p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>MAS Core Inflation is projected to slow to an average of 2.5&ndash;3.5% for 2024 as a whole, unchanged from the October 2023 MPS. Excluding the impact of the increase in the GST rate this year, core inflation is forecast at 1.5&ndash;2.5%.</span></p>
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Amid the declines in COE premiums since November and the larger COE supply this year compared to 2023, CPI-All Items inflation in 2024 is now forecast to be lower at 2.5&ndash;3.5%, down from the previous range of 3&ndash;4%. Excluding the effects of the increase in the GST rate, headline inflation is forecast at 1.5&ndash;2.5%.</span></p>
<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Both upside and downside risks to the inflation outlook remain. Shocks to global food and energy prices or domestic labour costs could bring about additional inflationary pressures. However, an unexpected weakening in the global economy could induce a faster easing of cost and price pressures.</span></p>
<h2>MONETARY POLICY</h2>
<p><span>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;Barring any further global shocks, the Singapore economy is expected to strengthen in 2024, with growth becoming more broad-based. MAS Core Inflation is likely to remain elevated in the earlier part of the year, but should decline gradually and step down by Q4, before falling further next year.</span></p>
<p><span>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, current monetary policy settings remain appropriate. The sustained appreciation of the policy band will continue to dampen imported inflation and curb domestic cost pressures, thus ensuring medium-term price stability.</span></p>
<p><span>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span><span>MAS will therefore maintain the prevailing rate of appreciation of the S$NEER policy band. There will be no change to its width and the level at which it is centred.</span></span>&nbsp;MAS will closely monitor global and domestic economic developments, and remain vigilant to risks to inflation and growth.</span></p>

<title>China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) Bans Securities Lending During Restricted Periods</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In an effort to stabilize the country's stock markets, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has announced the suspension of lending restricted shares, effective from Monday. This move comes after recent sharp falls in the market and is part of a series of supportive policies implemented by Beijing.</p>
<p>Restricted shares, which are subject to limits on sale, are often offered to company employees or certain investors. However, they can be lent for trading purposes, putting additional pressure on markets during a downward trend.</p>
<p>The CSRC's decision aims to promote fairness and reasonableness, reduce the efficiency of securities lending, and level the playing field for investors. The regulator also intends to crack down on illegal activities that exploit securities lending to reduce holdings and cash out.</p>
<p>To further regulate the market, the CSRC will also limit the efficiency of securities lending in the securities refinancing market starting March 18.</p>
<p>Although the blue-chip CSI300 Index has seen some recovery, China's stock market continues to struggle. As a result, small Chinese investors are seeking alternatives to the domestic economy, driving up premiums on global index funds.</p>
<p>China's economy grew slightly above the government's target in 2023, but the recovery has been inconsistent. December data revealed weak consumption and a significant decline in home prices, indicating a deep crisis in the property market.</p>
<p>To align with the CSRC's measures, both the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges will suspend securities lending by strategic investors during lockup periods starting January 29.</p>
