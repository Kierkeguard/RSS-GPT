<p><span>Droit and FINBOURNE come together to deliver a joint, full-stack solution to enable sell-side and buy-side institutions to manage disclosure obligations for long, short and takeover panel reporting. This new offering leverages FINBOURNE&rsquo;s financial data management platform LUSID, embedded with Droit&rsquo;s Position Reporting product which delivers clear determination of reporting obligations based on consensus interpretations of requirements from&nbsp;<a href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3xrADAH/1/0102018f2e133e9a-12434c0c-42ec-45ae-ba80-6ee43aceba3f-000000/yIZHwhRfCN4_ZcCFSAySGCfmMJI=371" target="_blank"><span>Endoxa</span></a>, a consortium of six global financial institutions.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>The unified approach ensures consistency around complex regulatory interpretations, regulatory clarity and accuracy of reporting. As part of the joint solution, Droit translates and processes detailed guidelines from all major global jurisdictions, automating the decision-making process for shareholder disclosure reporting eligibility. For complete accountability, a traceable audit record is generated for each evaluated position.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>With FINBOURNE's advanced data transformation capabilities, the new end-to-end solution seamlessly maps the multiple data inputs needed to evaluate rules. Moreover, it simplifies workflow interactions via an intuitive interface, effectively mitigating operational, cost, and complexity challenges.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Integrating Droit into LUSID means that together we are able to deliver a complete solution for position reporting. This partnership enhances our ability to safeguard asset managers by making sense of shareholder disclosure data when it comes to complex trading books and provide a level of granular reporting detail that is unmatched in the industry." added Thomas McHugh, CEO and Co-founder, FINBOURNE Technology.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;By partnering with FINBOURNE, we are able to leverage consensus interpretation and industry best practice for position reporting for all market participants.&nbsp; The asset management industry can directly benefit from the experience of their sell-side counterparties.&rdquo; said Brock Arnason, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Droit. &ldquo;FINBOURNE&rsquo;s platform, built specifically to support the volume and complexity of data that characterizes position reporting, integrated with our consensus-driven eligibility rules, offers firms unrivaled traceability, transparency, and auditability."</span></p>

<div> Labor market, inflation, real GDP, housing markets, supply-side improvements
Summary:
Robust labor market
Inflation easing
GDP slowed but solid
Housing tight
Supply-side growth vital <div>
<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>Over the past three months, incoming U.S. economic data continue to show robust growth in the labor market, household consumption, and business investment, even as inflation remains well below its peak.&nbsp; Although headline GDP growth slowed more than expected in the first quarter, underlying demand from households and businesses remained remarkably strong.&nbsp; Moreover, the pace of job growth picked up in early 2024, prime-age labor supply improved, and the unemployment rate continued to remain low.&nbsp; It is likely that the health of the labor market is buttressing private demand and, with it, economic growth in 2024.</p>
<p>Inflation has been slower to come down than expected after the rapid decline observed in 2023.&nbsp; Although headline inflation is down nearly two-thirds from its peak in 2022, it remains too high for American families, and the effects of elevated prices compared with the pre-pandemic era may be weighing on consumer sentiment. &nbsp;Continued progress is needed to bring core inflation to a level consistent with the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s target while allowing our economy to continue to grow. &nbsp;The Biden Administration remains committed to helping this effort over the long term by expanding our economy&rsquo;s productive capacity through significant investments in clean energy, manufacturing capacity, and infrastructure.</p>
<h3>REAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDP)</h3>
<p>Real GDP growth slowed to 1.6 percent in the first quarter of 2024, following strong advances in the second half of 2023.&nbsp; The slower growth rate was largely attributable to drag from net exports and the change in private inventories, whereas private domestic final demand (PDFP) maintained a solid pace of growth, attesting to underlying momentum in the domestic economy (see Table 1 &ndash; Real Gross Domestic Product).</p>
<p>PDFP&mdash;composed of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), business fixed investment (BFI), and residential investment&mdash;captures the most stable and persistent components of economic growth.&nbsp; Although PCE and BFI growth slowed somewhat in the first quarter, stronger residential investment bolstered real PDFP growth.&nbsp; All told, PDFP added 2.6 percentage points to topline real GDP growth, only modestly less than the fourth quarter&rsquo;s 2.8 percentage point contribution.</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal consumption of goods and services slowed in the first quarter but still made the largest contribution to GDP growth of any component.&nbsp; Purchases of goods declined outright&mdash;shaving 0.1 percentage points from GDP growth&mdash;while the contribution from PCE of services strengthened to 1.8 percentage points.</li>
<li>BFI grew at a solid, if somewhat slower pace, in the first quarter. &nbsp;Investment in real equipment and intellectual property products strengthened while spending on business structures stalled.&nbsp; Notably, investment in manufacturing structures persisted for the eleventh consecutive quarter, but factory investment growth in early 2024 was offset by less investment in other sectors&rsquo; structures.</li>
<li>Residential investment, the final component of PDFP, accelerated sharply to a double-digit pace, marking the third consecutive quarter of growth since early 2021.&nbsp; Construction of single-family residences contributed to residential investment, as did other structures (including brokers&rsquo; commissions)&mdash;partly reflecting the upturn in housing sales throughout the first quarter.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of the remaining main components of GDP, government spending and investment made a positive contribution to economic growth in the first quarter, owing to the state and local sector.&nbsp; By contrast, net exports and inventory changes subtracted from growth, accounting for over one-half of the slowdown in GDP growth in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter of 2023.&nbsp; The drag posed by the change in private inventories, which can exhibit wide swings from quarter to quarter, was only slightly smaller than that posed in the final quarter of 2023. &nbsp;Meanwhile, the trade deficit widened by $55 billion, as the pace of import growth more than tripled.&nbsp; Net exports, which subtracted 0.9 percentage points from real GDP growth in the first quarter, was the single largest factor in slowing economic growth.</p>
<h3>LABOR MARKETS</h3>
<p>During this year&rsquo;s first quarter, the average pace of payroll job creation accelerated, while indicators in the household employment survey&mdash;such as the unemployment rate and the labor force participation rate (LFPR)&mdash;held close to their 2023 fourth quarter averages.&nbsp; Even so, there was further progress in correcting imbalances between labor supply and demand (see Table 2 &ndash; Labor Market Indicators).</p>
<ul>
<li>After slowing to 212,000 jobs per month in the final quarter of 2023, the average pace of payroll job creation accelerated to 276,000 per month in this year&rsquo;s first quarter.&nbsp;Recent analysis suggests that above-trend immigration&mdash;which was postponed during the pandemic&mdash;has increased the breakeven pace of job growth needed to sustainably maintain a stable unemployment rate with population growth.&nbsp; Current estimates are above 200,000 jobs, roughly double the estimated breakeven pace before the pandemic.</li>
<li>The unemployment rate ticked up 0.1 percentage points over the first quarter to 3.8&nbsp;percent in March; a broader measure, which captures underemployment of the workforce, rose 0.2 percentage points to 7.3 percent that month.&nbsp; Despite the modest increases, both rates remain relatively low by historical standards.&nbsp; As of the latest releases for mid-April, the level of initial unemployment claims has increased by about 12 percent from the end of December, while continuing unemployment claims have drifted up by less than 3 percent.&nbsp; Nonetheless, recent readings are still in line with those in February 2020, just before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.</li>
<li>The overall labor force participation rate ticked down on average over the first quarter&mdash;though the LFPR for prime-age (ages 25-54) workers edged higher with increased participation by women.&nbsp; Labor demand, as measured by job openings (or vacancies) fell modestly during the first quarter through February, continuing the downward trend seen since March 2022.&nbsp; The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has gradually declined since the spring of 2022; as of February, there were 1.36 job openings per unemployed worker&mdash;significantly down from the high of 2.03 vacancies but still marginally above the pre-pandemic high of 1.24 vacancies.&nbsp;The combination of improving supply (via above-trend immigration) and declining job openings attests to an ongoing rebalancing of labor supply and demand, but the vacancies ratio suggests further adjustment may be needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>INFLATION</h3>
<p>Headline inflation picked up during the first quarter of 2024 but, by March, was still about 60 percent below the peak in June 2022 on a year-over-year basis.&nbsp; As measured by the consumer price index (CPI), the average monthly rate of inflation during the first quarter was 0.4 percent (or 4.6 percent at an annual rate), up from an average 0.2 percent per month (1.9 percent annualized) during the fourth quarter of 2023 (see Table 3 &ndash; Inflation and Wage Growth Indicators).</p>
<ul>
<li>Energy price inflation turned positive in the first quarter, rising 0.8 percent per month on average, after declining steadily throughout the fourth quarter.&nbsp; Since January, energy prices have been bolstered by geopolitical tensions, repeated extensions of OPEC+ production cuts, and the expectation that an improving global macroeconomic outlook will boost oil demand.</li>
<li>Average monthly food inflation remained stable in the first quarter at 0.2 percent, matching the average pace in the third and fourth quarters of 2023.&nbsp; In short, food price inflation appears to have stabilized near rates observed prior to the pandemic.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, core inflation accelerated in the first quarter to 0.4 percent on average per month (4.5 percent at an annual rate), up from 0.3 percent per month (3.2 percent annualized) in the latter half of last year.&nbsp; Even so, twelve-month core inflation in March was down by more than 40 percent from its peak in the autumn of 2022.</p>
<ul>
<li>Core goods prices decreased for the third consecutive quarter, but the pace of deflation stabilized at 0.1 percent on average in the first quarter of 2024.&nbsp; On a year-over-year basis, however, core goods prices were down 0.7 percent in March 2024, the steepest decline since June 2020.</li>
<li>Inflation for rent of housing services (primary rent and owners&rsquo; equivalent rent) ticked up in the first quarter but remained in the 0.4 percent to 0.5 percent range observed since May 2023.</li>
<li>For non-housing core services, inflation accelerated significantly in the first quarter, largely reflecting higher prices for medical care services and motor vehicle insurance, among other components.&nbsp; Price growth of automotive insurance alone accounted for nearly 60 percent of non-housing core services inflation.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inflation as measured by the PCE price index has notable differences in weights and methodologies.&nbsp; Historically, twelve-month CPI inflation has exceeded PCE inflation by about 0.4&nbsp;percentage points on average.&nbsp; In the first quarter, however, the wedge increased to 0.7&nbsp;percentage points.&nbsp;The excess wedge was more than explained by differences between the two inflation measures in the weight assigned to owners&rsquo; equivalent rent (OER).&nbsp; The CPI weighs OER more heavily, and persistently strong growth in OER since the autumn of 2021 has accounted for a significant portion of the excess wedge between the CPI and PCE measures of inflation.</p>
<h3>HOUSING MARKETS</h3>
<p>Housing markets remained tight in the first quarter with high home prices, limited supply, and elevated mortgage rates.&nbsp; In addition, new residential construction weakened in the first quarter, but a few other measures of housing activity suggested an upturn.</p>
<p>Growth rates of various aspects of new residential construction declined outright in the first quarter, following moderate growth in the fourth quarter of 2023 (see Table 4 &ndash; Housing Construction).</p>
<ul>
<li>Total building permits&mdash;which precede future home construction&mdash;declined on average throughout the first quarter, as growth in both the single-family and multi-family permits turned negative.&nbsp; The decrease in the multi-family sector extended a downtrend that began in the latter half of 2022.</li>
<li>Total housing starts also turned negative in the first quarter on average, partly reflecting a double-digit decline in the volatile multi-unit sector.&nbsp; Single-family starts also fell, but more modestly.</li>
<li>The inventory of homes under construction fell modestly at the end of the first quarter, reflecting the transition of multifamily units from being under construction into the completed status. &nbsp;Single-family home completions, meanwhile, declined substantially on average over the quarter.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both existing and new home sales increased over the first quarter and, on balance, outpaced the increase in homes available for sale.&nbsp; As a result, housing markets remained tight, and the inventory-to-sales ratio for existing homes declined further from an already-depressed level (see Table 5 &ndash; Home Sales &amp; Inventories).</p>
<ul>
<li>Sales of total existing homes turned positive after three consecutive quarters of decline but still were down 3.7 percent over the year through March 2024. &nbsp;Although the inventory of homes for sale rose by 12 percent from the end of 2023, the faster pace of sales eroded the inventory of existing homes for sale over the quarter to an average of 3.0 months of sales.&nbsp; In the five years before the pandemic, the average inventory-to-sales ratio was 4.2 months.</li>
<li>New home sales rebounded in the first quarter after the last quarter of 2023 interrupted a 5-quarter growth trend.&nbsp; Despite the resumption of sales growth, the inventory-to-sales ratio for new homes increased slightly to an average of 8.4 months, remaining well above the pre-pandemic (2015-2019) average of 5.6 months.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shelter price developments in the first quarter were mixed but, on balance, indicated still-elevated growth in home purchase prices and rental inflation (see Table 6 &ndash; Shelter Prices).</p>
<ul>
<li>The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller&rsquo;s national home price index accelerated in January (last available data as of April 29), while&nbsp;the pace of house price growth in the FHFA purchase-only index turned negative, after slowing considerably in the fourth quarter.&nbsp; Despite the divergence in growth rates, price levels remained elevated.</li>
<li>For renters, the CPI for rent of primary residence slowed at the margin in the first quarter, but the pace remained rapid.&nbsp; After turning negative in the fourth quarter, listing services data on rental inflation accelerated sharply, a trend which the rent CPI may eventually reflect&mdash;though the timing and magnitude of passthrough to the primary rent CPI is uncertain.&nbsp; By contrast, a new research series created by the Bureau of Labor Statistics&mdash;which has been shown to lead the CPI for primary rent by about a year&mdash;suggests an upcoming slowdown in renters' shelter costs.&nbsp; This quarterly series better reflects prices renters would face if they changed housing units every quarter; it grew by just 0.4&nbsp;percent over the year ending in the first quarter.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>RISKS TO THE OUTLOOK</h3>
<p>Even with substantial economic growth and a strong labor market, inflation has fallen considerably from its mid-2022 peak, though it remains above the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s target. &nbsp;We expect continued, gradual disinflation over the next year accompanied by continued economic growth and a gradually easing labor market.&nbsp; However, there are risks to this outlook on both sides.</p>
<p>Geopolitical risks or persistently strong demand growth without comparable supply expansion could push inflation above consensus forecasts.&nbsp; Russia&rsquo;s war in Ukraine continues to add uncertainty to the medium-term outlook.&nbsp; In addition, the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, drought conditions at the Panama Canal, and the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore create further concerns of supply chain disruptions and could renew upward pressures on energy and goods prices.&nbsp; Fortunately, major impacts to the U.S. economy have not materialized to date, but these remain important risks to monitor.</p>
<p>Although we expect price pressures from housing and other core services to continue to gradually ease, core services inflation remains elevated, and there is a risk of persistent inflation and associated financial distress. &nbsp;Rent of housing inflation remains well above historical norms and continues to set a high floor for core inflation.&nbsp; Although year-over-year growth rates for rents on new leasing agreements suggest future easing, the timing of passthrough to further disinflation for rent of housing is uncertain.</p>
<p>A significant cooling in the labor market could bring inflation down faster&mdash;but with greater cost for American workers. &nbsp;Strong consumption in 2023 supported the economy, fueled by real income growth and a reduced saving rate.&nbsp; Households have drawn down much of their excess savings from the pandemic period, but household net worth as a share of disposable personal income remains high relative to historical levels.&nbsp; A healthy labor market continues to support consumption, but saving rates remain historically low and suggest recent consumption growth may be unsustainable.&nbsp;A slowdown in consumption could cool the labor market quickly, which could again reduce consumption and further slow the economy in 2024.</p>
<p>On the other hand, additional supply-side improvements could support continued strong economic growth without price pressures.&nbsp; Strong labor supply and productivity growth both contributed to the robust economic performance in 2023, and more expansion of the supply-side of the economy could allow for faster monetary policy easing in 2024.</p>
<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
<p>The American economy remains strong, with a healthy labor market and inflation well below the 2022 peak.&nbsp;Going forward, investments in expanding our economy&rsquo;s productive capacity in ways that benefit all Americans&mdash;what Secretary Yellen has called &ldquo;modern supply-side economics&rdquo;&mdash;will help to continue to grow the economy in ways that avoid significant price pressures.&nbsp;The Administration remains committed to helping foster continued improvements such as those we saw in 2023.</p>

<div> borrowing, Treasury, marketable, privately-held, cash balance
<br />
During the April – June 2024 and July – September 2024 quarters, the U.S. Department of the Treasury expects to borrow $243 billion and $847 billion in privately-held net marketable debt, respectively, to fund its operations. Additionally, it plans to release additional financing details relating to its Quarterly Refunding on May 1, 2024. The borrowing estimate for the April – June 2024 quarter has increased by $41 billion compared to the January 2024 estimate due to lower cash receipts offset by a higher beginning of the quarter cash balance. The Treasury's borrowing estimate for the July – September 2024 quarter is $847 billion, assuming an end-of-September cash balance of $850 billion. The January – March 2024 borrowing was $12 billion lower than estimated, largely due to higher cash receipts and lower outlays, partially offset by a $25 billion higher ending cash balance.
<br /><br />Summary: 
During April – June 2024, borrowing is estimated at $243 billion. For the July – September 2024 quarter, borrowing is estimated at $847 billion. Additional financing details will be released on May 1, 2024. <div>

<div> AGM, digital transformation, NGX Group, shareholders, capital raise
<br /><br />Summary:
NGX Group's 63rd AGM approved a dividend, re-elected directors, and announced a digital transformation strategy to enhance market operations and raise capital. <div>
<p>Nigerian Exchange Group Plc (NGX Group), a leading integrated market infrastructure group in Africa, convened its 63rd annual general meeting at the Nigerian Exchange Group House on Monday, April 29, 2024. During the gathering, the Group concluded on ordinary and special business matters, while also unveiling plans to embark on a comprehensive digital transformation strategy to expand its business operations in line with its overarching strategy.<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The meeting&rsquo;s agenda, approved by The Board of Directors, included the declaration of a final dividend, ratifying the appointment of Temi Popoola as the Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of NGX Group, presenting financial statements to shareholders, re-electing non-executive directors retiring by rotation, authorizing, and disclosing remuneration, among other undertakings.</p>
<p>Notably, NGX Group, subject to regulatory approval, discussed its authorization on a rights issue to raise capital of up to N10 billion with a subjoined resolution to increase its share capital to sufficiently accommodate the rights issue. All resolutions were approved by shareholders just as appointment and reelections of directors were ratified.</p>
<p>Following substantial authorization across its agenda, NGX Group introduced plans to propel the markets with a digital transformation journey that includes an online platform for public offers and deep investments in its technology stack amongst others. The platform will provide a smarter and efficient way for Issuers to raise capital and enhances the subscription process and operational workflow of POs in the capital market including initial public offerings (IPOs), rights issues and other public offers.</p>
<p>Commenting on the development, the Group Chairman, NGX Group, Alhaji (Dr.) Umaru Kwairanga said, &ldquo;I am particularly grateful to our shareholders for their assent to the critical business we conducted today. As the Board oversees the strategic direction and gives management the necessary support and guidance, we believe that the coming year will be a better one in terms of value created for our shareholders. NGX Group is positioned to capitalize on opportunities amid the positive and forward-looking reforms by the government and our stakeholders should rest assured we will deliver excellently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, NGX Group, Mr. Temi Popoola, said, &ldquo;As we complete our 63<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;AGM, I extend my sincere gratitude to our shareholders, customers, employees, regulators, and directors for their steadfast support. In a year that underscored NGX Group's strategic agility and operational excellence, we witnessed growth stemming from our dynamic revenue streams. We are optimistic and well-positioned to forge a future marked by success, resilience, and prosperity.</p>
<p>Addressing the digital transformation agenda, Popoola stated, "The future of our business and the capital markets hinges on technology. That is why we are driving this digital transformation journey across our subsidiaries through the Group. NGX Group's digital transformation will democratize access to public issuances for every Nigerian with a mobile phone, supporting capital-raising efforts for companies. Additionally, we aim to commercialize our technology solutions and expand our footprint across Africa&rdquo;.</p>

<div> Opinion, payment fraud, new types, EBA, regulatory measures
Summary:
The EBA published an Opinion assessing new payment fraud data, proposing additional security measures to mitigate evolving fraud types, and firmly supporting forthcoming legislative frameworks. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today an Opinion, in which it assesses payment fraud data that has recently become available to the EBA, identifies new types and patterns of payment fraud, and develops proposals to mitigate them. This Opinion aims at further strengthening the forthcoming legislative framework under the Third Payment Services Directive (PSD3) and Payment Services Regulation (PSR), as it will enshrine anti-fraud requirements for several years to come and needs to be as future-proof as possible.</span></p>
<p>In the Opinion, the EBA confirms that regulatory measures such as the Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) that the revised Payment Service Directive (PSD2) and the EBA&rsquo;s Technical Standards have imposed on the payments industry have been successful in achieving the aim of significantly reducing fraud that involves the stealing of customers&rsquo; credentials. However, fraudsters have adapted their techniques and are using more complex types of fraud, such as those based on what is commonly referred to as &lsquo;social engineering&rsquo;.</p>
<p>To mitigate these dynamic new fraud types, the Opinion is proposing that new security measures are prescribed that are in addition to those articulated in the EU Commission&rsquo;s welcome proposals for the PSD3 and a PSR as well as the provisions that recently entered into force through the Instant Payments Regulation (IPR).&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Legal basis</h4>
<p>The competence of the EBA to deliver this opinion is based on Articles 1(5), 8(2)(g), 9(4) and 16a(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, which mandate the EBA to &lsquo;achiev[e] a coordinated approach to the regulatory and supervisory treatment of new or innovative financial activities&rsquo; and &lsquo;upon a request from the European Parliament, from the Council or from the Commission, or on its own initiative, provide opinions to the European Parliament, to the Council and to the Commission on all issues related to its area of competence&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>

<div> consultations, ESMA, reverse solicitation, crypto-assets, MiCA
Summary:<br />FESE supports ESMA's reverse solicitation proposal but suggests less strict requirements.

<p>FESE welcomes the opportunity to contribute its views to the ESMA consultations on reverse solicitation and the classification of crypto-assets under MiCA.</p>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FESE is generally in line with ESMA&rsquo;s proposal on the reverse solicitation. However, the proposed requirements might be too strict. Certain sub-outsourcing elements from third-country providers should not be seen as a reverse solicitation. Regarding the draft guidelines on the classification of crypto-assets, FESE agrees with the approach that crypto-assets qualifying as financial instruments should not fall under the scope of MiCA and be subject to already existing financial market rules, such as MiFID II/R. Furthermore, FESE welcomes the hierarchical approach for hybrid-type tokens&rsquo; classification. When crypto-assets have characteristics of financial instruments, these characteristics should take precedence in the classification.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), the leading global financial centre in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia (MEASA) region, is a trusted, global hub for many of the world&rsquo;s wealthiest families and individuals. Home to more than 120 of the world&rsquo;s wealthiest families and individuals, with a total net worth exceeding USD 1trn, DIFC has helped position Dubai as the number one city in MEASA, and among the top 22 cities globally in terms of wealthiest populations.</span><br /><br /><span>According to data published by the World&rsquo;s Wealthiest Cities Report 2023, Dubai&rsquo;s population includes over 68,500 HNWIs, or individuals with at least USD 1mn in liquid assets, 206 centi-millionaires, or those with a net worth of at least USD 100mn, and 15 billionaires.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>DIFC&rsquo;s status as the deepest financial centre between London and Singapore, with a workforce of over 41,500 and more than 5,500 active registered companies is underpinned by 20 years of consistent growth and a record-breaking year in 2023, which has further encouraged wealth flows to the Centre and Dubai.</span><br /><br /><span>Industry leaders convene to celebrate Family Wealth Centre Anniversary<br /></span><br /><span>Last year, DIFC launched the first Family Wealth Centre of its kind in the world to advance and grow its thriving ecosystem for global family wealth, and support family businesses as they future proof their growth ambitions and succession plans in Dubai and beyond.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>To mark the occasion and the tremendous progress made in just over 12 months, His Excellency Abdulla bin Touq Al Marri, Cabinet Member and UAE Minister of Economy; His Excellency Essa Kazim, Governor, DIFC; and Arif Amiri, Chief Executive Officer of DIFC Authority, welcomed leading family businesses and advisors to mark the 1-year anniversary of the DIFC Family Wealth Centre at its inaugural &lsquo;A Legacy of Excellence&rsquo; exclusive luncheon.</span><br /><br /><span>"The UAE has long been the primary and preferred destination for business and investment in the GCC and winder MENA region. Similarly, the UAE aims to become the regional centre for family businesses,&rdquo; said&nbsp;</span><span>H.E. Al Marri</span><span>&nbsp;in his keynote remarks addressing DIFC&rsquo;s growing community of family businesses and related entities.</span><br /><br /><span>"Dubai stands as a pivotal hub for family wealth, offering unparalleled opportunities and resources for growth and preservation. In just one year, the DIFC Family Wealth Centre has played a crucial role in nurturing this ecosystem. Recognising Dubai's significance as a global centre for family wealth, the Centre's swift impact underscores its commitment to fostering prosperity and security for generations to come,&rdquo; Minister Al Marri added.</span><br /><br /><span>His Excellency Essa Kazim, Governor, DIFC</span><span>, said: &ldquo;Dubai and DIFC have rapidly positioned themselves as the premier destination for family businesses worldwide.

We remain dedicated to providing best-in-class resources to our esteemed members, nurturing enduring legacies and empowering families for generations to come, as we together shape the future of finance&rdquo;.</span><br /><br /><span>Top choice for regional and international family businesses</span><br /><br /><span>During his welcome address,&nbsp;</span><span>Arif Amiri, Chief Executive Officer of DIFC Authority</span><span>, said: &ldquo;DIFC&rsquo;s rise as a global hub for family wealth stems from its commitment to fostering a growth ecosystem for the wider financial sector. With a strong pursuit of transparency, regulation, and knowledge-building, DIFC has earned the trust of 230 banks, including 27 of the top 29 globally systemic banks, and more than 350 highly reputable wealth and asset management firms. This momentum is further fuelled by an influx of family businesses and related entities drawn to DIFC's lifestyle offerings and its world-class DIFC Family Wealth Centre, which is built for innovation, succession planning, and future prosperity.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>With more than 440 registered foundations and over 600 active entities affiliated with top family businesses and individuals, DIFC has seen a surge in interest for family wealth management. Primarily driven by interest for prescribed companies, or private companies which can be established by a qualifying applicant or for a qualifying purpose, the Centre&rsquo;s commitment towards regulatory transparency and family confidentiality supported an 81 per cent surge in single family offices, followed by a 12 per cent increase in holding companies, year-on-year in 2023.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>To further support this growth DIFC also announced its new comprehensive guide &lsquo;</span><a href="https://edge.sitecorecloud.io/dubaiintern0078-difcexperie96c5-production-3253/media/project/difcexperiences/difc/difcwebsite/documents/media-section/publications/difc-business-sector-publications/family-wealth-guide_prosperity-across-generations.pdf">Prosperity Across Generations: Unlocking the Power of DIFC for Families</a><span>&rsquo; to empower families with access to knowledge and expertise on structures, governance, wealth management, succession and estate planning in Dubai and DIFC.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>Innovative and future-forward jurisdiction&nbsp;<br /></span><br /><span>Aligned with the UAE&rsquo;s vision to help family businesses maximise their contribution to the economy, the DIFC Family Arrangements Regulations were introduced on 31 January 2023 to replace or repeal the Single Family Office (SFO) Regulations. Benefits under the new regulations include a private registry option, which provides families and their Ultimate Beneficial Ownership&rsquo;s (UBOs) with the highest levels of privacy and confidentiality. The same regulations also provide certification for family businesses in DIFC to support benefits and incentives planned for family businesses in the UAE under UAE Family Business Law.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>DIFC Family Wealth Centre &ndash; A global knowledge hub for family wealth&nbsp;<br /></span><br /><span>In addition to the revised regulatory framework for family businesses, the launch and development of DIFC Family Wealth Centre in 2023 has helped empower families preserve their wealth and legacies for the future, through best-in-class tailored solutions including asset allocation and portfolio management, governance, succession planning, Sharia compliance as an option, Will registration and philanthropy.</span><br /><br /><span>The Centre is further fortified by its work with the Innovation Hub, which supports next generation owners remain at the forefront of technological mechanisms and applications.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>Benefitting from DIFC&rsquo;s internationally recognised legal system, which is based on English common law and includes a variety of structures and regimes, family businesses also gain direct access to accredited advisors, networking opportunities, educational programmes, and a wide range of experiential events, all within the Centre&rsquo;s diverse and cosmopolitan community, which includes some of the city&rsquo;s top eateries, venues, cultural centres, and lifestyle destinations.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>Recently, DIFC Family Wealth Centre and STEP Arabia signed an MOU to foster the common interests in relation to guiding family businesses on their journey to achieve multi-generational success, and to enhance the know-how of advisers to achieve that purpose.</span><br /><br /><span>As a societal mechanism for wealth distribution, the DIFC Family Wealth Centre is also a win for the local economy since family businesses are responsible for 60 per cent of the UAE&rsquo;s GDP, 80 per cent of its workforce and 90 per cent of its private companies.</span></p>

<br /><br />Summary: The FSB RCG Asia discussed financial market developments, crypto-assets, climate-related risks, cross-border payments, and regional collaboration. <div>
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) Regional Consultative Group for Asia (RCG Asia) met today in Colombo.</p>
<p>Members discussed recent financial market developments and vulnerabilities that warranted closer monitoring. Members also received an update on the FSB&rsquo;s work programme and discussed how they could contribute to the FSB&rsquo;s emerging market and developing economies-focused work. The group discussed ways to promote the implementation of FSB regulatory framework for crypto-asset activities across the region and recent developments in artificial intelligence, its growing use in the financial sector, and implications for financial stability.</p>
<p>Members reviewed progress being made within the region on addressing financial risks from climate change. This year, the FSB will focus on deepening its analysis of climate-related financial risks to financial stability and examining the relevance of transition plans for financial stability. Members discussed their work in supervising climate-related financial risks and how transition planning was feeding into this work.</p>
<p>Members also discussed progress on enhancing cross-border payments and the key challenges in making them faster, cheaper, and more transparent and inclusive. The FSB&rsquo;s work under the G20 Roadmap has moved to a new phase focused on implementation and includes efforts to strengthen engagement with the private sector.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;The group discussed initiatives being undertaken in their jurisdictions and within the region to address current frictions in cross-border payments, including technological innovations. The group also exchanged views on areas where greater private- and public-sector collaboration could be of most benefit in the region.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>

<title>ICE Redefines Mortgage Servicing For Industry Professionals With New Intelligent, Conversational Interface - ICE Launches MSP Digital Experience, Giving Servicing Professionals A More Intuitive, Dynamic And Conversational Approach To Working In MSP, The Industry’s Leading System Of Record For Mortgage Servicing</title>

<div> ICE, MSP DX, mortgage, escrow, technology
<br />
Summary:<br />
ICE introduces MSP DX, a conversational interface for mortgage servicing. It streamlines workflows, automates tasks, and enhances user experience. <div>
<p><a href="https://www.ice.com/index" rel="nofollow" shape="rect"><span>Intercontinental Exchange</span>&nbsp;<span>, Inc.</span>&nbsp;</a>(NYSE: ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today officially introduced the MSP&reg; Digital Experience (MSP DX). MSP DX is a new conversational interface for working in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com/products/msp-mortgage-servicing-system" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">MSP<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;</a>, ICE&rsquo;s mortgage loan servicing system.</p>
<p>MSP DX is an intuitive way of interacting with the full power of the MSP servicing system. It is designed to streamline workflows, increase efficiencies, and ease the training of servicing team members. ICE launched this new interface with escrow, historically one of the most-costly aspects of mortgage servicing. This functionality was previewed at ICE Experience 2024 and received positive reviews by leaders in the mortgage servicing industry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mortgage escrow is inherently complex, and the technology lift to handle the many moving parts is significant,&rdquo; said Tim Bowler, President of ICE Mortgage Technology. &ldquo;But with the introduction of MSP DX we are helping servicers manage the escrow process more efficiently. This will enhance workflow management for servicers and improve the household experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>MSP DX gives end users the sort of conversational interaction they have come to expect in other aspects of their lives. Rather than sorting through multiple screens or reaching out to different departments for information, servicing professionals can now ask the system for what they need using everyday language.</p>
<p>&ldquo;MSP DX represents a significant leap forward for the industry and serves up what users need, when they need it,&rdquo; Bowler said. &ldquo;It automates routine tasks so users can focus on more strategic and meaningful work. While we started with escrow, we will continue to make further investments to enhance workflow and flatten learning curves throughout the mortgage servicing process.&rdquo;</p>

<div> Luxembourg Stock Exchange, NMB Bank, sustainability bond, Tanzania, gender bond
Summary:
LuxSE lists NMB Bank's sustainability bond, supporting social and environmental projects in Tanzania, with strong local and international investor demand. <div>
<p><b>Just over a year after listing the first Sub-Saharan Africa gender bond on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, Tanzania-based NMB Bank returns to the exchange with East Africa&rsquo;s first sustainability bond.</b></p>
<p>During an official visit by NMB Bank Plc representatives to the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (LuxSE) last Friday, the two institutions celebrated the listing of the Tanzania-based bank&rsquo;s dual-currency sustainability bond on LuxSE. Known as the NMB Jamii bond, meaning &ldquo;community&rdquo; in Swahili, the bond aims to deliver positive environmental and social impacts to the communities that customers, employees, shareholders, and all stakeholders of the bank live in. The Jamii bond is displayed on the Luxembourg Green Exchange (LGX), the world&rsquo;s leading platform for sustainable securities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mobilising financing for sustainable development in Africa has become a key priority for our exchange. We are delighted to mark this landmark sustainability bond listing with NMB, and we are committed to continuing in our shared mission of fostering sustainable finance in the region and contributing to closing the funding gap,&rdquo; </i>said Julie Becker, CEO of LuxSE.</p>
<p>The bond comprises of a USD tranche and a TZS tranche and raised a total of approximately USD 157 million. The proceeds of the bond will be used to strengthen resilience against climate change and for investments in renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, gender equality and youth empowerment, among other key social and environmental projects.</p>
<h4><b>Financing an inclusive transition</b></h4>
<p>NMB Bank is one of the largest commercial banks in Tanzania and has been instrumental in the country&rsquo;s socio-economic development for 26 years. The bank has implemented initiatives that contribute to the Tanzania National Development Plan 2025/2050 and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals within the fields of the green and blue economy, agriculture, education, health, gender equality, and industrialisation.</p>
<p>NMB&rsquo;s CEO Ruth Zaipuna commented &ldquo;<i>The issuance of the first Gender Bond in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2022, the NMB Jasiri Bond, and now the first sustainability bond in East Africa, the NMB Jamii Bond, that we are cross-listing today at the LuxSE and LGX, attest to our commitment of advancing sustainable development and promoting responsible investment practices, with the assurance of rigorous impact assessment and transparent reporting.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ms. Zaipuna also added that &ldquo;<i>Being a domestic bond with both retail and institutional investors&rsquo; participation, the NMB Jamii bond has provided investment opportunities for retailers to invest and trade in the bond in lower denomination. This has not only stimulated the development of our local capital markets but also provided the much-needed financial inclusion and access.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sustainability bond, which is dual-listed on LuxSE and the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE) in Tanzania&rsquo;s capital city, will finance eligible projects set out in the bank&rsquo;s Sustainable Financing Framework, published in August 2023.</p>
<p>The bond was met with strong demand from both local and international investors, with leading development finance institutions such as the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Netherland&rsquo;s FMO and the UK&rsquo;s British International Investment (BII) having made significant investments in the Jamii bond.</p>
<h4><b>Gender finance beyond borders</b></h4>
<p>On 8 March 2023, LuxSE celebrated International Women&rsquo;s Day by marking the admission of the NMB Bank&rsquo;s gender bond on LuxSE and LGX. Known as the &ldquo;Jasiri&rdquo; bond, meaning brave in Swahili, the gender bond was NMB Bank&rsquo;s inaugural social bond issuance and raised the equivalent of USD 32 million.</p>
<p>The bond made history as the first ever gender bond issued in Sub-Saharan Africa, and the proceeds of the bond provided nearly 3,000 women in Tanzania with access to the financing necessary to start or grow their own business.</p>

<div> Advice, Investment Restrictions, GBP LDI Funds, ESMA, AIFMD
Summary:
ESMA advises CBI and CSSF on investment restrictions for GBP LDI funds to ensure resilience, effective from 29 April 2024. ESMA encourages monitoring and invites other competent authorities to adopt similar measures. <div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, has issued its advice to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-04/ESMA50-43599798-9491_Advice_under_article_25_AIFMD_CBI_measure.pdf">Central Bank of Ireland (CBI)</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-04/ESMA50-43599798-9492_Advice_under_article_25_AIFMD_CSSF_measure.pdf">Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF)</a>&nbsp;on investment restrictions for GBP Liability-Driven Investment (LDI) funds to ensure their resilience.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify">The advice follows the notification from the CBI and the CCSF of their intention to impose an investment restriction on Alternative Investment Fund Managers (AIFMs) established in Ireland and Luxembourg and managing GBP-denominated AIFs pursuing a LDI funding strategy. These funds are typically set up by defined benefits pension schemes that provide guaranteed returns to future pensioners.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify">The measure consists in requiring GBP LDI funds to be able to resist a rise in GBP yields of at least 300 basis points (so called &ldquo;yield buffer&rdquo;).&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify">ESMA&rsquo;s analysis concludes that the conditions for taking actions under the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD) are met and the measures proposed by the CBI and the CSSF are justified and should contribute to improving the resilience EU GBP LDI. ESMA also encourages both regulators to monitor the evolution of the GBP LDI funds and to assess the necessity to recalibrate the yield buffer.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify">The measure applies from 29 April 2024. GBP LDI funds established on or after this date must comply with the measure immediately while existing GBP LDI funds have a three-month transitional period to comply. The measure is not limited in duration. &nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify">Finally, ESMA also invites other competent authorities of AIFMs managing such funds to adopt similar measures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Background</span></h4>
</div>
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify">On 4 March 2024, the CBI and the CSSF notified ESMA and the ERSB of their intention to introduce investment restrictions on AIFMs established in their jurisdiction and managing GBP LDI funds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify">According to Art. 25(3) of the AIFMD, ESMA must provide advice to the CSSF and the CBI, assessing whether the conditions for acting appear to be met and whether the proposed measures are appropriate.</p>

<p>Dr. Muhammad Al Jasser said, &ldquo;Under this MOU, the Securities Commission Malaysia and IsDB will collaborate to enhance Islamic fintech, social finance, and attract foreign investment in private markets. This will enhance the Islamic capital markets not only in Malaysia but also across IsDB Member Countries. This partnership prioritises support for MSMEs and private markets, which are crucial for economic empowerment.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dato&rsquo; Seri Dr. Awang Adek added that this MOU is also in line with the key strategic initiatives for the Malaysian ICM under the Capital Market Master Plan 3 (2021 &ndash; 2025), including expanding the reach of ICM to the broader stakeholders of the economy and embracing collaboration and innovation for growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To that end, the SC together with its affiliate, Capital Markets Malaysia recently engaged with various stakeholders in Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Riyadh. This includes lending Malaysia&rsquo;s voice to reinforcing ICM&rsquo;s impact and enhancing Malaysia&rsquo;s global thought leadership.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In several panel sessions in the region, the SC's Executive Director of Islamic Capital Market, Sharifatul Hanizah Said Ali spoke about how ICM can be harnessed to structure innovative financing instruments to further advance social impact investing, sukuk issuances and Islamic asset management.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2023, the Malaysian ICM grew 4.5% to RM2.4 trillion while sukuk outstanding rose by 7.4% and Shariah-compliant equities by 1.5%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Malaysia remains the global leader in ICM, particularly in sukuk outstanding as well as Islamic fund management, securing top rankings in global indices including Islamic Fintech Index, the Global Islamic Economy Indicator and the global Islamic Finance Development Indicator for the 10th consecutive year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ACER is organising a webinar to present the results of a consultancy study on how ACER&rsquo;s (2020)&nbsp;<a href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtUAgZQAAUAB0xdUFZQHVZbAQUdCgwAAxpXUAYFV1FWVgAAVQYdBVVUAg1TAVYdVF0DBR0GWgFeGgwHVgQZUQFVB1QGUFlUBgEHRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" target="_blank">methodology for adequacy metrics</a>&nbsp;is being implemented. The methodology serves as a basis for determining the reliability standards of European countries.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">When?</span></p>
<p>Wednesday, 5 June 2024, from 10:00 &ndash; 11:30 CET, online</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is resource adequacy and reliability standard?</span></p>
<p>A stable and ample energy supply is crucial for European consumers. Electricity security of supply depends on having adequate resources in the power system to meet the demand.</p>
<p>To maintain this level of security, Member States continuously monitor adequacy to ensure that the expected risk remains below the acceptable level. The power system is considered to have adequate resources when the risk level does not exceed the reliability standard. Member States define this acceptable or adequate level as a national reliability standard, based on the common methodology for adequacy metrics.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why is this ACER methodology important for EU security of supply?</span></p>
<p>The EU methodology for adequacy metrics, developed by ENTSO-E and approved by ACER in 2020, is mandated by Europe&rsquo;s 2019&nbsp;<a href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsABwVQUFhSU0xcAwUFHVZcAgAdCgAIXhoGU1UGDQMGBFcBVQQdBVVUAg1TAVYdVF0DBR0GWgFeGgwHVgQZUQFVB1QGUFlUBgEHRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" target="_blank">Clean Energy Package legislation</a>. It facilitates Member States in setting their electricity reliability standards based on how much consumers are willing to pay to ensure the security of electricity supply.</p>
<p>In line with the EU methodology, Member States determine their socio-economically efficient reliability standard based on:</p>
<ul>
<li>the value of lost load (VOLL), which represents the value that consumers place on an uninterrupted service; and</li>
<li>the cost of new entry (CONE), which represents the cost of adding incremental capacity in the system to reduce the level of demand disconnections.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reliability standards are calculated based on these two values as a balance between the costs of additional capacity in the system and the benefits of reduced power outages.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is the study about?</span></p>
<p>Through its&nbsp;<a href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtVBFVUUAQGVUxdVAcBHVYNDVcdCw4CABoDUwNRUQAMVlMABFQdBVVUAg1TAVYdVF0DBR0GWgFeGgwHVgQZUQFVB1QGUFlUBgEHRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" target="_blank">monitoring of EU electricity supply security</a>, ACER observed substantial discrepancies in the calculated metrics. The reasons of such discrepancies are not straightforward. To understand the underlying factors and to determine if further methodological coordination is needed, ACER commissioned consultants, Johannes Kepler Universit&auml;t Linz and RWTH Aachen University, in August 2023 to conduct a consultancy study on the topic.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the webinar&rsquo;s objectives?</span></p>
<p>The aim of this webinar is to present and discuss with stakeholders the main findings of ACER&rsquo;s consultancy study, focusing on:</p>
<ul>
<li>understanding the relevance of Europe&rsquo;s adequacy metrics in assessing the security of Europe&rsquo;s electricity supply;</li>
<li>exploring key divergences in deriving adequacy metrics in different Member States;</li>
<li>drawing input from interested stakeholders on possible ACER recommendations to facilitate the calculation of adequacy metrics in Europe.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the next steps?</span></p>
<p>The consultancy study will be published on the ACER webinar page on 29 May 2024 as a pre-reading material for webinar participants.</p>
<p>ACER will analyse the study recommendations and the input from the webinar to identify potential improvements in how Member States determine adequacy metrics. This analysis will be included in the ACER security of supply report, scheduled for publication in Q4 2024.</p>

<div> indictment, fraud, CFTC, forex, judgment
Summary:<br />Former Miami resident and firm ordered to pay $5.9 million for forex scheme, with parallel criminal action pending. CFTC issues forex fraud advisory. <div>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced Judge Linda V. Parker of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan issued an order of default judgment and a permanent injunction against&nbsp;<span>Darren Robinson</span>, a former resident of Miami, Florida, and his firm&nbsp;<span>The QYU Holdings Inc.</span>&nbsp;(QYUHI), a Wyoming corporation with a purported principal place of business in Dallas, Texas. The order bans Robinson and QYUHI from trading in any CFTC-regulated markets and registering with the CFTC. It also requires them to pay, jointly and severally, $5,923,515.37 in restitution to defrauded victims and a $5,923,515.37 civil monetary penalty in connection with a fraudulent foreign currency (forex) scheme.</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Additionally, the order finds from approximately January 1, 2017 to September 28, 2023 (the relevant period), QYUHI acted as a commodity pool operator (CPO) without being registered with the CFTC as a CPO as required, and Robinson acted as an associated person (AP) of a CPO without being registered with the CFTC as an AP of a CPO as required. Also, QYUHI failed to comply with CPO regulations.</span></span></span></span></span><br /><span><span><span><span><span>The order resolves the CFTC&rsquo;s enforcement action Robinson and QYUHI. [See CFTC Press Release&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8792-23"><span>8792-23</span></a><span>.]</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Case Background</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The order stems from a CFTC complaint filed on September 28, 2023. The order finds that during&nbsp;</span><span>the relevant period, Robinson and QYUHI engaged in a multimillion-dollar fraudulent scheme through which Robinson, individually and as the agent of QYUHI, solicited and Robinson and QYUHI accepted $7,196,365.37 from 38 people to participate in a commodity pool operated by QYUHI for the purpose of trading in commodity interests, including forex pairs on a leveraged, margined, or financed basis with participants who&nbsp;</span><span>were&nbsp;</span><span>not eligible contract participants (retail forex) and forex futures contracts. Instead of trading pool participants&rsquo; funds, Robinson and QYUHI misappropriated all of the pool participants&rsquo; funds by depositing them directly into QYUHI&rsquo;s corporate bank account that Robinson controlled, rather than depositing the funds directly into an account in the name of the pool at a futures commission merchant and/or a retail foreign exchange dealer. Robinson and QYUHI misappropriated participants&rsquo; funds to pay Robinson&rsquo;s personal expenses, including, but not limited to luxury cruises, airfare, luxury vehicle purchases, real property purchases, credit cards payments, and other daily living expenses. Additionally, Robinson used not less than $1,272,850 of later-in-time participants&rsquo; funds to pay earlier-in-time participants purported &ldquo;profits&rdquo; and/or &ldquo;redemptions&rdquo; in the&nbsp;</span><span>manner of a Ponzi scheme.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Parallel Criminal Action</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>On January 11, in the Eastern District of Michigan, Robinson was charged in a 12-count indictment alleging 11 counts of wire fraud and one count of money laundering, for conduct similar to that alleged in the CFTC&rsquo;s complaint. [See&nbsp;<i>United States v. Robinson</i>, Case No. 2:24-cr-20025-NGE-KGA-1 (E.D. Mich. Jan. 11, 2024).]&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Robinson is currently&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/wcc/darren-anthony-robinson"><span>a fugitive from U.S. law enforcement</span></a><span>&nbsp;with an active warrant for his arrest that has yet to be executed.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The CFTC cautions that orders requiring repayment of funds to victims may not result in the recovery of any money lost because the wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Eastern District of Michigan and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this case are Timothy J. Mulreany, George H. Malas, Kassra Goudarzi, and Paul G. Hayeck.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>CFTC&rsquo;s Forex Fraud Advisory</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The CFTC has issued several customer protection&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/index.htm"><span><span>Fraud Advisories and Articles</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;that provide the warning signs of fraud, including the&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/ConsumerProtection/FraudAwarenessPrevention/CFTCFraudAdvisories/fraudadv_forex.html"><span><span>Foreign Currency Trading (Forex) Fraud Advisory</span></span></a><span><span>, which alerts customers to forex fraud and lists simple ways to spot forex scams.</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The CFTC also strongly urges the public to verify an individual or company&rsquo;s registration with the CFTC before committing funds. If unregistered, a customer should be wary of providing funds to that individual or entity. A company&rsquo;s registration status can be found using&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/Exit/index.htm?http://www.nfa.futures.org/basicnet" target="_blank"><span>NFA BASIC</span></a><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Customers and other individuals can report suspicious activities or information, such as possible violations of commodity trading laws, to the Division of Enforcement via a toll-free hotline 866-FON-CFTC (866-366-2382),&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/complaint"><span>file a tip or complaint online</span></a><span><span>, or contact the&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://www.whistleblower.gov/"><span>Whistleblower Office</span></a><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<div> EU, AMLR, CASPs, cryptocurrency, fraud
Summary:<br />
EU passed stricter AMLR rules for financial institutions, including CASPs and cryptocurrency, in response to rising financial fraud cases. Compliance is crucial. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p><span>This week the EU passed a broad set of </span><a href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.europarl.europa.eu%2Fnews%2Fen%2Fpress-room%2F20240419IPR20586%2Fnew-eu-rules-to-combat-money-laundering-adopted/1/0102018f199d98f4-38549129-a759-4bae-b5b7-c76a5de8e54e-000000/_E93JethbBpB9sppxEsFP20xXls=371" target="_blank"><span>Anti-Money Laundering Regulations (AMLR)</span></a><span>, which enforce stricter rules for Know Your Customer (KYC) processes at financial institutions. These aim to protect against money laundering and the financing of sanctioned individuals and organisations.</span></p>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs) are included in the AMLR, and will be obligated to verify the identity of all customers, store data on cross border transactions, and report suspicious activity to the relevant authorities.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Although the EU&rsquo;s AMLR isn&rsquo;t new to the financial industry, this latest update clarifies the requirements for CASPs. This presents a particular challenge for the cryptocurrency industry who&rsquo;ll have to deliver more rigorous compliance standards when verifying customers and their payment beneficiaries. Sumsub&rsquo;s research shows that in 2023:</span></p>
<ul>
<li> <em><span>88% of all financial fraud cases targeted cryptocurrency.</span></em> </li>
<li> <em><span>Deepfakes attempts in the crypto sector increased by 128%.</span></em> </li>
<li> <em><span>70% of crypto companies reported a rise in deepfake fraud.</span></em> </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Cryptocurrency faces the lion&rsquo;s share of financial fraud, where users attempt to fool CASPs with fake identities to avoid detection, according to </span><a href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fsumsub.com%2Ffiles%2Fsumsub_identity_fraud_report_2023.pdf/1/0102018f199d98f4-38549129-a759-4bae-b5b7-c76a5de8e54e-000000/fgTZRsRhYGfrUufNdZh5C9_8xPY=371" target="_blank"><span>findings from leading transaction monitoring and verification platform Sumsub.</span></a><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Ilya Brovin, Chief Growth Officer at&nbsp; </span></strong><a href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fsumsub.com%2F/1/0102018f199d98f4-38549129-a759-4bae-b5b7-c76a5de8e54e-000000/_cXg-TY2sShWR1QoGEwHN6zjQSo=371" target="_blank"><strong><span>Sumsub</span></strong></a><span>, comments: &ldquo;</span><em><span>The EU&rsquo;s latest AMLR regulations are a welcome response to the advantages that technology is gifting criminals. It takes us a step closer to the safe and transparent crypto industry we all want, which is to be celebrated.</span></em><em><span><br /></span></em></p>
<p><em><span>"Businesses are facing a rising regulatory tide where properly preparing for compliance is crucial. There is now a simple choice, whether to implement solutions that can deliver this, or instead risk significant financial and reputational damages. These solutions should also be able to determine the recipient CASP, carry out counterparty due diligence, and screen for sanction breaches. The onus is also on crypto platforms to pay attention to whether the Travel Rule solution provider can ensure data protection during transmission.&rdquo;</span></em></p>

<div> scholarship, HKEX, Laura M Cha, capital markets, CUHK Business School
Summary:<br />
HKEX and CUHK Business School launch annual postgraduate scholarship in honor of Laura M Cha, to support students in global finance and capital markets. <div>
<ul>
<li class="spanHeading"><span>New annual HKEX scholarship launched for exceptional postgraduate students looking to further their knowledge in global finance and capital markets</span></li>
<li class="spanHeading"><span>Scholarships recognise the considerable contribution of outgoing HKEX Chairman, Laura M Cha, to the development of capital markets in Hong Kong, Mainland China and globally</span></li>
<li class="spanHeading"><span>Programme to be run in partnership with The Chinese University of Hong Kong Business School</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="spanHeading">Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing Limited (HKEX) is today (Friday) pleased to announce that it has established a new postgraduate scholarship programme in partnership with The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) Business School. The annual scholarship programme has been launched to honour Laura M Cha, recognising her considerable contribution to the development of capital markets in Hong Kong, Mainland China and globally over her distinguished career, most recently as HKEX Chairman.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">Mrs Cha has played a major role in the growth of Hong Kong&rsquo;s and Mainland China&rsquo;s financial markets, including the introduction of H-Shares and the development of the Connect programmes, supporting ever greater connectivity and access to the region for investors and corporates alike.&nbsp; She has also been a long-term advocate of corporates taking an active role in their communities, including overseeing the establishment of the HKEX Foundation, which has donated more than HK$440 million to charitable projects since it was established in 2020.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">HKEX Chairman, Carlson Tong, said:&nbsp; "This scholarship is a tribute from HKEX to celebrate Laura's remarkable leadership and unwavering commitment to the sustained growth of our capital markets. Her instrumental involvement in establishing Hong Kong as a dynamic and globally significant international financial centre, coupled with her pivotal contributions towards fostering the accessibility of China's markets over the past three decades, exemplify her exceptional achievements. Laura has become a beacon of inspiration for an entire generation of finance professionals, particularly women, who aspire to forge successful careers in capital markets. I am confident that she will continue to make a lasting impact as a dedicated mentor and trusted advisor for many years to come."</p>
<p class="spanHeading">Laura M Cha said: &ldquo;I am honoured that HKEX has launched this new postgraduate scholarship programme in my name. Supporting and encouraging the best and brightest minds from the next generation is something that I am passionate about. As capital markets across Hong Kong, Mainland China and globally continue to evolve, embracing new ideas, technologies and ever greater interconnectivity, this new scholarship will add to the swell of expertise and knowledge in the region, in turn fueling growth and opportunity. It has been a privilege to chair HKEX over the last six years, and I look forward to continuing to contribute to the future of the company and the region&rsquo;s markets, as both an advisor and advocate. I look forward too, to meeting the scholarship awardees and hearing their ideas in the years to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="spanHeading">Dean of CUHK Business School, Professor Zhou Lin, said: &ldquo;We extend our sincere gratitude to HKEX for their continued support and generous donation in establishing the new Laura M Cha Capital Markets Scholarship. This initiative underscores our shared vision to nurture the next generation of global talent in finance, strengthening our international position as leading institution in business education and bolstering Hong Kong&rsquo;s status as a premier international financial centre. With this scholarship, we hope to empower the best talent to make meaningful contributions to the industry and drive positive change in the capital markets in our region and beyond.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="spanHeading">The Laura M Cha Capital Markets Scholarship will be awarded each year to an individual or individuals looking to advance their postgraduate studies in finance at CUHK Business School. HKEX will contribute HK$200,000 to the annual scholarship fund, for a period of six years. The scholarship programme, which is expected to launch later this year, will be administered by CUHK Business School, and it is envisaged that a secondment or project work with HKEX will be arranged as part of the programme. This new scholarship programme, which will be funded by the Group, complements the annual university scholarships and research funding grants that the HKEX Foundation already runs as part of its charitable work, supporting students and academics in Hong Kong.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> revenues, global, market data, technology, AI <br />
The global spending on financial market data and news reached a record $42 billion in 2023, driven by advanced technology and AI. Despite the dominance of Bloomberg, Moody's Analytics reported the sharpest revenue growth. The use of AI and advanced analytical technologies has elevated the value of market data, driving higher growth rates in 2023. The largest share of revenue is earned in the Americas, with Bloomberg, LSEG Data & Analytics, and S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence leading the market. <br /><br />Summary: <br />The global spending on financial market data hit a record $42 billion in 2023, with advanced technology and AI driving growth. <div>
<ul>
<li><b>Total spending hit a record $42 billion in 2023, driven by advanced technology</b></li>
<li><b>According to a new report by Burton Taylor, a division of Parameta Solutions (owned by TP ICAP)</b></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Global spending on financial market data and news continued its decade-long growth streak with revenues jumping 12.4% to a record $42 billion in 2023. Although real-time trading and data spending accounted for the largest share of total revenues, strong demand for Pricing, Reference and Valuation data drove spending according to a new report published today by Burton Taylor International Consulting, a division of Parameta Solutions.</p>
<p>Slightly more than one-half of revenue is earned in the Americas, up from 48% just five years ago. Earnings among the three major geographic regions have changed little in the past year, with EMEA generating 31% of the total and Asia owning just short of 19%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bloomberg continues to claim the largest share of the global market data business, followed by LSEG Data &amp; Analytics and S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, which are the only three providers that claim double-digit market share. Moody&rsquo;s Analytics reported the sharpest revenue growth in 2023, followed by FactSet and S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;The rapid growth of AI and similar advanced analytical technologies have elevated the value of market data beyond the level we&rsquo;ve seen in recent years, driving notably higher growth rates in 2023,&rdquo;</i>&nbsp;says&nbsp;<b>Hadley Weinberger, Sr. Analyst at Burton-Taylor</b>. &ldquo;<i>Financial institutions are already using generative AI and other artificial intelligence tools across all areas of their operation, driving demand for data not only for trading and risk but also to extract intelligence in other operational areas of the business</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<div> Regulation, AI, CFTC, Market, Manipulation
Summary:<br /><br />Regulating AI in CFTC markets, concerns about market manipulation and fraud, inter-agency task force proposal, oversight measures, and examination questionnaire expansion. <div>
<p>Introduction&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good morning. Thank you very much to the Futures Industry Association, President and Chief Executive Officer Walt Lukken, and Yvette Valdez for the generous invitation for me to join you this morning. I delivered my very first keynote address as a Commissioner at the FIA IDX conference in London in June of 2022 and my first public appearance as a Commissioner was here at FIA L&amp;C. Commissioner Summer Mersinger and I shared details of the road to serving as a CFTC Commissioner.</p>
<p>During my tenure as a Commissioner, conversations among global regulators, market participants, customers, and investors have reached a fever pitch. Innovations such as generative AI have the power and the potential to alter many aspects of our markets and lives. These innovations offer exciting hope for more effective disease screening, more accurate and timely disease diagnosis and mapping, and exceptional potential to solve complex questions that have posed challenges in math, science, and medicine for centuries. At the same time, without appropriate guardrails that ensure responsible adoption of AI, the risks of integrating this technology may outweigh the benefits in some contexts.</p>
<p>For the last several years, I have advanced international dialogue regarding the best approach for addressing the significance of AI in our markets. In a series of speeches over the last few months, I have publicly advocated as a Commissioner for the Commission to consider three specific interventions.</p>
<p>First, to ensure unequivocal commitment as an independent federal regulator to our obligation to supervise markets and ensure the effectiveness of the rule of law, I have advocated for heightened penalties for the use of AI to engage in fraud or market manipulation. Policing derivatives markets is one of the cornerstones of the CFTC&rsquo;s mission. We must adapt our surveillance technologies and enforcement penalties to keep pace with the rapidly evolving innovation that characterizes global financial markets.</p>
<p>Second, the CFTC should adopt a principles-based regulatory framework for addressing the increasing prevalence of AI in our markets. In January of this year, the CFTC launched initiatives to begin to better understand the use cases for AI in our markets, including by issuing a Request for Comment (RFC) to the market. The RFC is an excellent beginning and we anticipate receiving critical information regarding the uses and potential uses of AI in our markets. We should not, however, rest on our laurels. Our first step as a Commission is simply that &ndash; a first step.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, the Market Risk Advisory Committee that I sponsor met and announced that the Future of Finance Subcommittee would proceed with developing several specific, targeted initiatives to support the CFTC, but also to enable the Commission to come into compliance with the October 30, 2023 Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence.</p>
<p>The Executive Order calls for transparency in the integration of AI. To achieve this goal, we must survey markets to successfully achieve a full understanding of the integration of AI models in our markets and to effectively address threats to critical infrastructure resources in our markets.</p>
<p>Finally, I have called for an inter-agency task force to consider the adoption of parallel, harmonized safeguards that will focus on ensuring the stability and integrity of our markets.</p>
<p>As recent reports by international standard setting bodies indicate, automation and complex algorithms&nbsp;have&nbsp;existed &ldquo;for many years&rdquo;&nbsp;but&nbsp;recent, significant advances in the ability of such tools to handle complex tasks and to expand their capabilities without explicit human instruction may deeply impact how our markets operate and how we supervise our markets.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson13?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Considering each of these suggestions in turn may be useful.</p>
<p>Evolving Markets and Existing Regulatory Authority</p>
<p>For years, traders in CFTC-regulated markets have deployed algorithm and AI-based tools, and we expect their use to only increase in scope and sophistication going forward.</p>
<p>At present, AI is being used in CFTC markets in a number of different ways:<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson13?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2">[2]</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Trading (e.g., market intelligence, robo-advisory, sentiment analysis, algorithmic trading, smart routing, and transactions)</li>
<li>Risk Management (e.g., margin and capital requirements, trade monitoring, fraud detection)</li>
<li>Risk Assessments and Hedging</li>
<li>Resource Optimization (e.g., energy and computer power)</li>
<li>RegTech &ndash; Applications that enhance or improve compliance and oversight activities (e.g., surveillance, reporting)</li>
<li>Compliance (e.g., identity and customer validation, anti-money laundering, regulatory reporting)</li>
<li>Books and Records (e.g., automated trade histories from voice or text)</li>
<li>Data Processing and Analytics</li>
<li>Cybersecurity and Resilience</li>
<li>Customer Service</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proactively addressing AI&rsquo;s use in CFTC-regulated markets will likely involve a combination of applying existing regulations and developing new rules tailored to these new technologies. Many areas of our market, such as risk management, that integrate AI models may be subject to existing regulation. Consequently, AI models are already subject to regulation. We must ensure that existing regulation is fit for purpose, effectively addresses risks, and aligns with existing compliance obligations.</p>
<p>Existing governance requirements can also help facilitate effective oversight of AI applications. CFTC regulations, for example, introduce important governance obligations for registered market participants. Designated Clearing Organizations must establish a Risk Management Committee &ldquo;comprised of clearing members and customers of clearing members on matters that could materially affect the risk profile of the DCO&rdquo; and Risk Management Working Groups composed of market participants.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson13?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3">[3]</a>&nbsp;Enhanced risk management oversight and governance best practices will play an important role in managing the development and implementation of this new technology.</p>
<p>(En)Visioning A New Regulatory Framework</p>
<p>In my keynote remarks at a recent event hosted by New York University, I have noted that it is important for the CFTC to develop a principles-based regulatory framework that takes into account the integration of AI in our markets. Some of the critical questions that the framework may address&nbsp;include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Promoting the explainability of AI models.&nbsp;Many AI models are &ldquo;black-box&rdquo; models, meaning that it may be difficult,&nbsp;and in some cases impossible, to explain their decision-making processes. Accordingly, FSOC, IOSCO, the FSB, and FINRA have all emphasized the importance of addressing the explainability challenge.&nbsp;As FINRA put it, [i]ncorporating explainability [is] a key consideration in the model risk management process for AI-based applications.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson13?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4">[4]</a></li>
<li>The need for data controls.&nbsp;Data quality,&nbsp;security and privacy are central concerns for regulators as market participants adopt AI models. A recent FSOC report notes, &ldquo;data controls like data quality, suitability, security, privacy, and timeliness are vital to sound AI use.&rdquo;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson13?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5">[5]</a>&nbsp;Similarly, FINRA calls for &ldquo;data governance efforts&rdquo; including: &ldquo;data review for potential bias,&rdquo; &ldquo;data source verification,&rdquo; &ldquo;data integration,&rdquo; &ldquo;data security,&rdquo; and &ldquo;data quality benchmarks and metrics.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson13?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6">[6]</a></li>
<li>Implementing measures to address bias.&nbsp;In 2019, I testified before Congress and voiced my concerns that AI models trained on incomplete or inaccurate data may engender biased results. FSOC has similarly noted that &ldquo;specific requirements to prevent discrimination or bias that apply to tools, models, or processes used in consumer compliance also apply to AI. This is an important consideration because without proper design, testing, and controls, AI can lead to disparate outcomes, which may cause direct consumer harm and/or raise consumer compliance risks.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson13?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7">[7]</a></li>
<li>A focus on the governance of AI models.&nbsp;We also need clear governance frameworks with documented lines of accountability as well as testing and monitoring for effectiveness. For example, FSOC &ldquo;recommends monitoring the rapid developments in AI, including generative AI, to ensure that oversight structures keep up with or stay ahead of emerging risks to the financial system while facilitating efficiency and innovation.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson13?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8">[8]</a></li>
<li>Testing and monitoring output.&nbsp;Protecting against bias, promoting explainability, and implementing governance strategies are only possible where models are properly tested and monitored.&nbsp;FSOC notes the responsibility of financial institutions to &ldquo;monitor the quality and applicability of AI&rsquo;s output&rdquo; &ndash; and the ability of regulators to &ldquo;help to ensure that they do so.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson13?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9">[9]</a>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proposed Interventions</p>
<p>Based on years of critical thinking and dialogue regarding these issues, I am advocating for the following interventions.</p>
<p>Interagency Task Force</p>
<p>I have the privilege of serving as the CFTC&rsquo;s executive representative of the Administrative Conference of the United States. Serving alongside executives across federally regulated markets, I have the opportunity to see the benefit of convening regulators and our interagency dialogue. In my previous role, I supported the development of several of the earliest, most comprehensive and groundbreaking reports on AI.</p>
<p>Consequently, I am advocating for the Commission to lead in creating a financial markets interagency task force focused on information sharing and composed of market and prudential regulators including the CFTC, SEC, Federal Reserve System, OCC, CFPB, FDIC, FHFA, and NCUA. The task force would support the AI Safety Institute, housed in the&nbsp;National Institute of Standards and Technology,&nbsp;in developing guidelines, tools, benchmarks, and best practices for the use and regulation of AI in the financial services industry. It may also provide recommendations to the AI Safety Institute as well as evaluate proposals coming out of the Institute.</p>
<p>Combatting AI-enabled Market Manipulation and Fraud</p>
<p>As I mentioned at the start, we also need to take action to combat AI-enabled manipulation and fraud in CFTC-regulated markets. Before we get to that however, a basic overview of the relevant statutory and regulatory structure is in order.</p>
<p>Prior to Dodd-Frank, the CFTC charged manipulation under Sections 6(c) and 9(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA).<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson13?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10">[10]</a>&nbsp;Section 6(c) &ldquo;authorize[d] the CFTC to bring an action &lsquo;[i]f the Commission has reason to believe that any person ... has manipulated or attempted to manipulate the market price of any commodity.&rsquo; 7 U.S.C. &sect; 9 (2006). Section 9(a)(2) similarly prohibit[ed] any person from &ldquo;manipulat[ing] or attempt[ing] to manipulate the price of any commodity ... on or subject to the rules of any registered entity.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson13?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11">[11]</a>&nbsp;To prevail on such claims, the CFTC had to show: &ldquo;(1) Defendants possessed an ability to influence market prices; (2) an artificial price existed; (3) Defendants caused the artificial prices; and (4) Defendants specifically intended to cause the artificial price.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson13?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12">[12]</a><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in 2010, included new statutory provisions addressing manipulation in CFTC-regulated markets. Section 6 of the CEA, as amended by Dodd-Frank, makes it:</p>
<p>unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, to use or employ, or attempt to use or employ, in connection with any swap, or a contract of sale of any commodity in interstate commerce, or for future delivery on or subject to the rules of any registered entity, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance, in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission shall promulgate by not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson13?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13">[13]</a></p>
<p>Guided by similarities between the language in the relevant statutes, the Commission enacted an implementing rule &ldquo;modeled on SEC Rule 10b&ndash;5,&rdquo; which targets fraud in securities markets.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson13?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14">[14]</a>&nbsp;For our purposes, I want to focus on one key aspect of the statutory provisions and regulation&mdash;that a party engaging in the prohibited activities must have a culpable state of mind, known as scienter.</p>
<p>Under Regulation 180.1, the level of scienter required to plead a cause of action for manipulation is &ldquo;intentionally or recklessly.&rdquo; 17 C.F.R. &sect; 180.1(a). In its notice of final rule making regarding Regulation 180.1, the CFTC stated that &ldquo;a showing of recklessness is, at a minimum, necessary to prove the scienter element of final Rule 180.1. Consistent with long-standing precedent under the commodities and securities laws, the Commission defines recklessness as an act or omission that &lsquo;departs so far from the standards of ordinary care that it is very difficult to believe the actor was not aware of what he or she was doing.&rsquo;&rsquo;&rsquo;&nbsp;<i>Final Rule,</i>&nbsp;76 Fed. Reg. at 41,404.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson13?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15">[15]</a></p>
<p>Courts have accepted both &ldquo;direct evidence of intent&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;circumstantial evidence showing intent&rdquo; to meet Rule 180.1&rsquo;s scienter element.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson13?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16">[16]</a></p>
<p>The scienter requirement raises interesting questions in the context of algorithm and AI-based trading. Attributing a &ldquo;mental state&rdquo; in the context of fraud or manipulation perpetrated using AI may create new challenges for enforcement.</p>
<p>As Michael Barr and Michael Wellman and their co-authors explain, &ldquo;[t]he problem with scienter flows from manipulation law&rsquo;s emphasis on intent but an autonomously developing algorithm&rsquo;s lack of any mental state attributable directly to a designer.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson13?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17">[17]</a></p>
<p>Most of us here likely remember the 2010 &ldquo;Flash Crash&rdquo; in which,&nbsp;&nbsp;within minutes on a trading day, &ldquo;major equity indices in both the futures and securities markets . . . suddenly plummeted . . . 5&ndash;6%&rdquo; and then rebounded.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson13?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18">[18]</a>&nbsp;In 2015, Department of Justice and CFTC investigations revealed that a rogue London-based futures trader&mdash;Navinder Singh Sarao&mdash;had manipulated the E-Mini S&amp;P 500 by using an algorithm to flood the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) with sell orders.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson13?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19">[19]</a>&nbsp;In entering a Consent Order, under which Sarao admitted to spoofing and manipulation in violation of the CEA, the court noted that Sarao&rsquo;s communications with programmers &ldquo;demonstrated an intent to use the programs to place orders (1) with no intention of executing those orders; and (2) with an intention to affect E-mini S&amp;P market prices.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson13?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20">[20]</a>&nbsp;These communications&nbsp;included design requests to&nbsp;&ldquo;make [the program] workable in terms of me moving the market like we discussed&rdquo; and an email indicating that &ldquo;when [Sarao] was &lsquo;short,&rsquo; he wanted to &lsquo;spoof&nbsp;[the market] down.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson13?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21">[21]</a></p>
<p>This example illustrates risk management and enforcement concerns that may arise if an algorithm is intentionally designed or deployed order to engage in prohibited conduct.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, the Future of Finance Subcommittee of the Market Risk Advisory Committee (MRAC) and the MRAC, which I sponsor, voted to approve and adopted a working plan for advancing the Commission&rsquo;s oversight of market integration of AI.</p>
<p>MRAC-Led AI Interventions</p>
<p>Among other forthcoming proposals, the MRAC Subcommittee will examine the possibility of:</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;A Survey on the Use of AI in CFTC-regulated Markets. The Subcommittee believes that it may be useful for the Commission to conduct a survey of CFTC registrants&rsquo; use of AI in CFTC-regulated markets, including possibly integrating the survey in the examinations and other oversight and monitoring tools of the Commission. The survey would be designed to inform the Commission and its staff on how different types of AI are being integrated and details regarding relevant risks and risk mitigation.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson13?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn22">[22]</a></li>
<li>Recommendations on New Guidance, Advisories or Rulemaking. The Subcommittee may advance a recommendation that the staff should consider new guidance, advisories or formal rulemaking, based on how CFTC market participants are using AI to conduct regulated activities and any gaps identified in existing regulations and guidance. Areas of focus may include, without limitation, framing the risk of AI models; robust monitoring and testing of AI models, including to address cybersecurity, data controls, bias, privacy, and output consistency; and oversight and of AI models.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will work to improve and refine the working plan in the coming months, and I look forward to what the Future of Finance Subcommittee will produce.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, in January, the Commission issued an RFC on the use of artificial intelligence in CFTC-regulated markets.&nbsp;FIA, CME and ICE recently provided a joint response to the RFC, which noted that &ldquo;this request for comment should be the first amongst many steps that Staff and the CFTC take to better understand any potential, risks, and use cases for AI.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson13?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn23">[23]</a><br /><br />I have proposed a specific next step, encouraging greater visibility and transparency regarding our registrants&rsquo; use of AI by expanding our annual systems examination questionnaire to incorporate questions that directly inquire about the adoption of AI and related risks.&nbsp;An expansion of our annual systems examination questionnaire is an appropriate next step to advance our understanding.</p>
<p>Conclusion&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you so much for allowing me to share these remarks on AI today. I look forward to our discussion.&nbsp;</p>

<div> countries, copyright, market, USTR, Special 301 Report
Summary:
The IIPA acknowledges the release of the 2024 Special 301 Report, which lists countries on the Priority Watch List and Watch List.<br /><br /> <div>
<p>The following is a statement from the International Intellectual Property Alliance&reg; (IIPA&reg;) on the release today of the 2024 Special 301 Report:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The IIPA&reg; congratulates the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) on the release today of the&nbsp;<b><i>2024 Special 301 Report</i></b>. This congressionally mandated annual report importantly identifies obstacles to expanding legitimate global commerce in creative works. IIPA thanks Ambassador Katherine Tai, the USTR team, and their interagency colleagues for diligently working to open foreign markets to American creative content, which helps to support the livelihoods of U.S. creators and workers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This year&rsquo;s Report once again highlights key priorities of the U.S. creative industries, including calling on U.S. trading partners to eliminate barriers that undermine the competitiveness of lawful services, especially in online and mobile marketplaces. IIPA welcomes the Report&rsquo;s discussion of online and broadcast piracy, including stream ripping and illicit IPTV services; collective management problems that impede right holders from receiving compensation for their works; and the need to improve IP enforcement. The Report also notes the importance of freedom of contract for the transfers of exclusive rights, which allows copyright owners &ldquo;to freely and separately transfer their economic rights by contract and to fully enjoy the benefits derived from those rights,&rdquo; a critical factor for the healthy growth of a dynamic digital marketplace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Principally, the Special 301 Report identifies overseas markets where trade barriers, including inadequate copyright protection and enforcement and other market access restrictions, should be addressed. Progress on elimination of these barriers not only supports U.S. creators but also helps our trading partners to develop their domestic creative industries and nurture their own creators.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The U.S. government&rsquo;s regular engagement with U.S. trading partners as part of the Special 301 review process remains a key trade policy tool for advancing these priorities. The U.S. copyright industries appreciate USTR&rsquo;s commitment to preserving this tool&rsquo;s integrity and effectiveness, as well as all the work by USTR and the interagency to help open markets for U.S. creative content over the past year. IIPA looks forward to working with USTR and with agencies across the U.S. government to encourage our trading partners to continue to make concrete progress toward stronger and more open copyright marketplaces.</p>
<p>On January 30, IIPA made a detailed submission to USTR with its recommendations for the 2024 Special 301 Report. IIPA&rsquo;s full submission can be found at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iipa.org/files/uploads/2024/01/Final-PDF-for-Website-1.pdf" target="_blank"></a><a href="https://www.iipa.org/files/uploads/2024/01/Final-PDF-for-Website-1.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.iipa.org/files/uploads/2024/01/Final-PDF-for-Website-1.pdf</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s announcement:</p>
<p>∙ USTR lists 7 countries on the Priority Watch List, including key copyright markets like Argentina, Chile, China, India, Indonesia, and the Russian Federation;</p>
<p>∙ USTR lists 20 countries on the Watch List, including key markets for creators like Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Mexico, Thailand, and Vietnam.&nbsp;</p>

Summary:<br />
SEC meeting discusses Reg CF and angel investing to improve access to early-stage capital. Examines successes, challenges, and potential changes. Explores state of angel investing. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/page/small-business-capital-formation-advisory-committee">Small Business Capital Formation Advisory Committee</a>&nbsp;today released the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/sbcfac-agenda-050624">agenda</a>&nbsp;for its meeting on Monday, May 6, 2024. The meeting will include a discussion of Regulation Crowdfunding (Reg CF) and activity and trends in angel investing. Members of the public can watch the live meeting via webcast on www.sec.gov.</p>
<p>The Committee, which provides advice and recommendations to the Commission on rules, regulations, and policy matters relating to small businesses, will start the morning session by continuing to explore ways to expand access to early-stage capital raising, with a deep dive into Reg CF. The Committee will discuss successes to-date, challenges, and whether there are potential changes that could improve the exemption. SEC staff will share background information on the regulatory framework, and Committee members will hear from an invited guest about her recent academic report and about the experiences and outcomes of women and under-represented entrepreneurs who participated in Reg CF.</p>
<p>In the afternoon session, following remarks from the Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Office of Strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology, the Committee will explore the state of angel investing. Angel investors play a critical role in supporting early-stage companies, yet angel investments have slowed over the past year. Members will share their experiences on how capital raising trends and the current market are affecting angel investors, angel funds, and the companies they support. As part of this discussion, the Committee will explore how angel investors make decisions, their views on investment risk, and consider whether there are ways to encourage more angel investment activity.</p>
<p>The full&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/sbcfac-agenda-050624">agenda</a>, meeting materials, and information on how to watch the meeting are available on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/page/small-business-capital-formation-advisory-committee">Committee webpage</a>.</p>

<title>US Acting Comptroller Of The Currency Issues Statement On The FDIC’s Proposals Related To Change In Bank Control Act</title>

<div> proposals, bank ownership, control, governance, interagency coordination
Summary:<br />Acting Comptroller of the Currency Hsu discusses evolving bank ownership and control, highlighting the need for interagency coordination and further research.<br /> <div>
<p>Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael J. Hsu today issued the following statement at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation&rsquo;s (FDIC) board meeting concerning the FDIC memorandum and resolution for proposals related to Change in Bank Control Act:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I want to thank Directors Chopra and McKernan for these proposals. They shine much needed light on the evolving nature of bank ownership, control, and corporate governance.</em></p>
<p><em>As noted by my colleagues, the rise of index investing has changed the composition of bank ownership. This raises a host of important questions for bank regulators given the potential implications for safety and soundness, consumer protection, and resolvability.</em></p>
<p><em>These questions are relevant to all three of the federal banking agencies, not just the FDIC. To put this in context, of the more than 600 publicly traded banks, nearly all &ndash; over 95% &ndash; issue voting securities via a holding company, which is supervised by the Federal Reserve. In aggregate, of the 4,577 insured depository institutions (IDI) in the U.S., less than 20 are publicly traded and issue voting securities directly from the IDI. The statistics for OCC-supervised institutions tell a similar story of bank ownership via holding companies, with the addition that the FDIC also has backup supervisory authority for all OCC banks with insured deposits.</em></p>
<p><em>Thus, this issue of bank ownership and control is shared across the FDIC, OCC, and Federal Reserve. We are inextricably linked on it given how banking organizations have structured themselves. To address this effectively requires interagency coordination and, ideally, a shared understanding and approach to bank control, notices, and passivity agreements. In short, I believe we should work together to strengthen bank control assessments, instead of creating more process and opportunities for turf battles or fragmentation.</em></p>
<p><em>In addition, the issues at hand are novel and complex. The distinctions between proxy voting, stewardship, and control can be blurry. Opinions differ as to the impact and effectiveness of passivity mechanisms, such as mirror voting and choice voting. For us, as regulators, the key question centers on how these things impact the safety, soundness, and resolvability of banks. Further research, analysis, and debate are clearly needed. I believe any proposed rulemaking &ndash; which should be done on an interagency basis &ndash; would benefit from such discussion and debate occurring prior to its issuance, or prompted by an interagency Request for Information (RFI) or advanced notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR).</em></p>
<p><em>Finally, to the extent the federal banking agencies are not coordinated or aligned on the issue of bank control, reallocating FDIC resources away from supervising banks to monitoring asset manager compliance with passivity commitments would be, at best, inefficient at this time.</em></p>
<p><em>For these reasons, I do not support either proposal.</em></p>
<p><em>To be clear, asset managers should continue their work of ensuring that their ownership stakes in banking organizations are truly passive and promote safety, soundness, and resolvability. Any evidence to the contrary will compel me to reconsider my posture on this issue.</em></p>

<title>SIFMA AMG Statement On FDIC Postponing Rule Proposals On “Control”</title>

<div> statement, SIFMA AMG, FDIC, rule proposals, asset managers
Summary: SIFMA AMG appreciates the postponement of FDIC rule proposals on asset managers. They believe the current approach is effective and caution against unintended consequences. They support a transparent and public process. <div>
<p>SIFMA&rsquo;s Asset Management Group (SIFMA AMG) today issued the following statement from Lindsey Keljo, managing director and head of the AMG, related to the postponement of rule proposals from the FDIC on asset managers regarding &ldquo;control&rdquo;:</p>
<p>&ldquo;SIFMA AMG appreciates Director McKernan and Director Chopra&rsquo;s decision to table their proposals that would revise the FDIC&rsquo;s approach to passivity agreements and assessments of noncontrolling investments in FDIC-supervised institutions.&nbsp; &nbsp;As we note in our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sifma.org/resources/submissions/potential-reevaluation-of-certain-asset-managers-passive-investments-in-fdic-supervised-institutions-sifma-amg/">letter</a>&nbsp;filed with the FDIC earlier this week, we believe the FDIC&rsquo;s current approach has worked well and is not in need of reevaluation.&nbsp; We also noted that some of the suggestions that were under consideration could have serious unintended consequences, including a detrimental impact on bank capital, as noted by Vice Chair Hill at today&rsquo;s meeting. By withdrawing the proposals today, we believe the FDIC will have the opportunity to further engage with industry and more thoughtfully consider proposed changes before determining whether to proceed.&nbsp; We also think it is important to consider Acting Comptroller of the Currency Hsu&rsquo;s concerns regarding ensuring any regulatory process includes all relevant regulatory agencies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Millions of Americans save for retirement and other financial goals with the help of funds managed by asset managers. Investors benefit from economies of scale and are paying lower fees than ever before, largely due to the lower costs of index investing. Such funds provide investors with exposure to many sectors of the economy including banking and as such are an important source of capital for the sector. Any reevaluation of asset managers&rsquo; investments in FDIC-supervised institutions should be done through a thoughtful, transparent and public notice-and-comment process that is designed to avoid limiting banks&rsquo; access to capital and risk unduly disincentivizing investment in banks and increasing the cost of investment for retail investors in the United States. We stand ready to work with the FDIC and its Directors as it considers what changes, if any, are necessary that would address concerns without negatively impacting our markets.&rdquo;</p>

<title>B.C. Securities Commission Issues Notice To Reinforce Expectations For Investor Relations Disclosure</title>

<div> Securities Commission, promotional disclosure, investor relations, social media, clarity and candor
Summary:
The B.C. Securities Commission issued a decision about promotional disclosure, stating that investor relations materials must clearly and conspicuously disclose their affiliation and be in plain language. Enforcement will continue. <div>
<p>The B.C. Securities Commission (BCSC) issued a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/securities-law/law-and-policy/instruments-and-policies/5-ongoing-requirements-for-issuers-insiders/current/51-703/51-703-bcn-april-25-2024">BC Notice</a>&nbsp;today to raise awareness of a 2023 Commission decision about promotional disclosure, and how it must be presented to comply with the law.</p>
<p>The decision,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/-/media/PWS/New-Resources/Decision-and-Orders/Decisions/2023/2023-BCSECCOM-52.pdf?dt=20230131225522" target="_blank"><em>Re Stock Social Inc.</em></a>, interpreted a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/96418_01#section52" target="_blank"><em>Securities Act</em>&nbsp;provision</a>&nbsp;that investor relations records must &ldquo;clearly and conspicuously&rdquo; disclose if they are disseminated by or on behalf of an issuer or security holder. This applies to promotional and marketing materials, including social media posts by &ldquo;influencers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The BCSC panel&rsquo;s interpretation of the Act&rsquo;s requirement for clear and conspicuous disclosure was the first of its kind in Canada, and is binding on issuers and promoters in B.C.</p>
<p>The panel said an investor relations communication that aims to promote the purchase or sale of securities of a particular company &ndash; or reasonably could be expected to do that &ndash; must disclose it was issued on behalf of the issuer (when an issuer has engaged a person to do this activity), and must be in plain language. For example, the communication should say that it was &ldquo;disseminated on behalf of&rdquo; the company, or is a &ldquo;paid advertisement on behalf of&rdquo; the company.</p>
<p>The disclosure, the panel said, must appear in a prominent spot, &ldquo;at or very close to the beginning of&rdquo; the communication, &ldquo;or at least close to the substantive portion.&rdquo; It &ldquo;should not be buried in legalistic standard terms and conditions that readers often skip.&rdquo; It also must appear in a prominent font.</p>
<p>The disclosure should be designed to catch the attention of the reader. A link to another website containing the required disclosure requires readers &ldquo;to take an extra step,&rdquo; the panel said. A link to the required disclosure is ordinarily not sufficient &ndash; it must be part of the communication.</p>
<p>The Stock Social decision found that the B.C. marketing company and its CEO repeatedly violated the Act by not adequately disclosing that it distributed advertorials and social media posts on behalf of five companies involved in mining, technology and cannabidiol (CBD) products.</p>
<p>The advertorials &mdash; which were disseminated on newswires, websites and social media &mdash; were usually written like news articles but did not disclose risks or any other negative factors about the issuers that one would expect from objective reporting. None of the advertorials made clear that they were on behalf of the issuers, and although some indicated a fee had been paid for dissemination, they did not say on whose behalf. When disclaimers did appear, they were not placed in a prominent place for the reader to easily notice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Commission panel laid out specific expectations for the level of clarity and candor it expects to see in promotional material,&rdquo; said Brenda Leong, the BCSC&rsquo;s Chair and CEO. &ldquo;The integrity of our investment market depends on that clarity and candor, because investors need to be able to assess the objectivity of the information they&rsquo;re receiving. Companies and promoters should be aware of these expectations, which the BCSC will continue to enforce.&rdquo;</p>

<div> disclosure, investment fund industry, CRM2, fees, performance
Summary: The Canadian Securities Administrators published two reports on the impact of CRM2 amendments on the investment fund industry. The reports show a decrease in fees and improved investment performance. Disclosure-based regulations may be effective in changing industry and investor behavior. The study period was limited to 2013-2020 to isolate the impact of CRM2 amendments. Other factors may have contributed to the changes in industry behavior. <div>
<p><span>The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) today published two&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.asc.ca/-/media/ASC-Documents-part-2/Research/CRM2---Executive-Summary.ashx">research reports</a><span>&nbsp;that examined the investment fund industry and investor behaviour following the implementation of the Client Relationship Model Phase 2 (CRM2) Amendments.</span><br /><br /><span>CRM2 improved how financial information is disclosed to investors by requiring greater transparency about the cost and performance of client accounts.</span><br /><br /><span>The&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.asc.ca/en/Registrant-and-Market-Regulation/Registrant-Toolkit/Research">research findings</a><span>&nbsp;suggest that overall industry behaviour has been shifting in directions that are consistent with the study hypothesis on the impact of these regulations. The findings also provide evidence that disclosure-based regulations may be an effective tool in changing industry and investor behaviour.</span><br /><br /><span>&ldquo;The main findings of the reports reflect positively on investment fund industry trends, as both average fees declined and investment performance improved over the study period,&rdquo; said Stan Magidson, CSA Chair and CEO of the Alberta Securities Commission.</span><br /><br /><span>Over the 2013-2020 study period, research on investment fund fees found management expense ratios (MERs) and management fees decreased for both mutual funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs). The distribution of investment assets shifted towards funds that charged lower fees, and investment fund managers reduced the fees they charged investors. The research also documented improvements in risk-adjusted, gross investment performance based on the study&rsquo;s model benchmarks. These results are in line with the anticipated effects of the CRM2 amendments, which provided investors with better information on the costs and performance of their investments. The research found no evidence that investment fund managers and product distributors shifted to products that were not subject to the CRM2 requirements.</span><br /><br /><span>The study period was limited to 2013-2020 to isolate the impact of the amendments and reduce the influences of other regulatory and market developments on the analysis. The CRM2 amendments to&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.asc.ca/securities-law-and-policy/regulatory-instruments/31-103">National Instrument 31-103</a><span>&nbsp;</span><em>Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations</em><span>&nbsp;that came into effect in 2016, were designed to ensure investors receive clear and complete annual disclosure of both the performance of their investments and of all fees associated with their accounts, including registrant compensation.</span><br /><br /><span>It is important to note that the changes in industry behaviour cannot be directly attributed to the CRM2 amendments. Other factors, which could not practically be accounted for in the analysis, may have contributed to the changes.</span><br /><br /><span>The CSA, the council of securities regulators of Canada&rsquo;s provinces and territories, coordinates and harmonizes regulation for the Canadian capital markets.</span></p>

<li><span>Company plans to transition digital asset derivatives trading and clearing into existing derivatives and clearing business lines</span></li>
<li><span>Plans to wind down Cboe Digital Spot Market in third quarter 2024</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe: CBOE), the world's leading derivatives and securities exchange network, today announced plans to refocus its digital asset business to leverage its core strengths in derivatives, technology and product innovation while realizing operating efficiencies for both Cboe and its clients. These changes are being made as part of Cboe&rsquo;s strategic review, taking into consideration the lack of regulatory clarity in the digital space, and are aligned with Cboe&rsquo;s longer term strategy.</p>
<p>Cboe plans to transition and fully integrate its digital asset derivatives, currently offered by Cboe Digital, into its existing Global Derivatives and Clearing businesses. This move is expected to create efficiencies for Cboe and clients, while enabling Cboe to harness the power of its broader global derivatives franchise and global technology platform to support and fuel growth of the exchange-traded digital asset derivatives market.</p>
<p>Additionally, the company plans to wind down operations of the Cboe Digital Spot Market, the company&rsquo;s spot digital asset trading platform, in the third quarter of 2024, subject to regulatory review. John Palmer, President of Cboe Digital, will become Head of U.S. Derivatives Market Development, under the leadership of Cathy Clay, EVP, Head of Global Derivatives.</p>
<p>Cboe plans to transition its cash-settled bitcoin and ether futures contracts, currently available for trading on the Cboe Digital Exchange to the Cboe Futures Exchange (CFE) in the first half of 2025, pending regulatory review and certain corporate approvals. This move will consolidate all Cboe U.S. futures products, including digital asset futures, onto one exchange powered by world-class technology, creating efficiencies for clients across the globe. By transitioning digital asset derivatives to CFE, this product set will benefit from the holistic support of the Cboe Global Derivatives business, including global derivatives sales and distribution, product development, market structure and investor education expertise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Refocusing our digital asset business enables us to refine our strategy, leveraging our core strengths in derivatives, technology excellence and product innovation to help maximize opportunities for our business and deliver efficiencies for Cboe and our clients,&rdquo; said Fred Tomczyk, Chief Executive Officer of Cboe Global Markets. &ldquo;We believe these changes enable greater optimization and strategic alignment for our business across geographies and asset classes, further supporting our long-term growth strategy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition, Cboe will maintain ownership and operation of Cboe Clear Digital, the clearing arm of Cboe Digital, and plans to align Cboe Clear Digital with Cboe Clear Europe, its European clearing house, under unified leadership. Cboe Clear Digital will continue to facilitate the clearing of bitcoin and ether futures. Cboe Clear Europe will continue to serve as the pan-European central clearing party (CCP) for Cboe&rsquo;s European equities and derivatives exchanges across the EU, UK and Switzerland. Vikesh Patel, the current President of Cboe Clear Europe, will now also oversee U.S. clearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bringing digital asset derivatives and clearing into our existing business lines enables us to leverage the full breadth of our global derivatives team and unlock the full value of Cboe to our clients around the world,&rdquo; said David Howson, Global President of Cboe. &ldquo;We expect to continue to see greater demand for exchange-traded derivatives to help manage crypto exposures, hedge risk and enhance capital and operational efficiencies. Optimizing our derivatives and clearing business operations and product development across borders and asset classes enables us to better serve our diverse client base and sharpen our strategic focus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The company anticipates that the wind down of the Cboe Digital Spot Market operations will have an immaterial impact on Cboe&rsquo;s net revenue in 2024. The company estimates that expense savings will be in the range of $2 million to $4 million in 2024, with savings expected to be in the $11 million to $15 million range on a normalized annual basis. Cboe will provide more details about these strategic changes during its forthcoming first-quarter 2024 earnings call on May 3, 2024. A conference call with remarks by the company's senior management will begin at 7:30 a.m. CT (8:30 a.m. ET). A live audio webcast for the conference call and the presentation that will be referenced during the call will be available on the Investor Relations section of Cboe's website at ir.cboe.com under Events.</p>

<div> Fraud, CFTC, Precious Metals, Lawsuit, Enforcement
<br />
The CFTC announced a consent order against Red Rock, Kelly, and Spencer for fraudulent precious metals investments, requiring restitution, disgorgement, and penalties. The defendants are banned from trading.<br /><br />Summary: The CFTC announced a consent order against Red Rock, Kelly, and Spencer for fraudulent precious metals investments, requiring restitution, disgorgement, and penalties. The defendants are banned from trading. <div>
<p><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced Judge R. Gary Klausner of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a consent order against&nbsp;<span>Red Rock Secured, LLC</span>&nbsp;(Red Rock),&nbsp;<span>Sean L. Kelly f/k/a Shade L. Kelly-Johnson</span>&nbsp;(Kelly), and&nbsp;<span>Anthony &ldquo;Tony&rdquo; Spencer</span>&nbsp;(Spencer) on April 23. The order finds the defendants liable for making fraudulent misrepresentations to customers and rendering unlawful investment advice in connection with the purchase and sale of precious metals.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The order requires the defendants collectively to pay $38,984,313.90 in restitution to those defrauded, disgorge $5.1 million in ill-gotten gains, and pay $12.25 million in civil monetary penalties. Additionally, the order enjoins the defendants from further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), CFTC regulations, and state law provisions, as charged, and imposes permanent trading bans in any CFTC-regulated markets as well as registration bans against the defendants. It also bars Spencer and Kelly from acting as investment advisers, broker-dealers, or commodity advisers in California and Hawaii.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The order resolves the lawsuit filed on May 15, 2023 by the CFTC and its co-plaintiffs, the California Department of Financial Protection &amp; Innovation (DFPI) and the State of Hawaii Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, Securities Enforcement Branch (SEB). [See CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8704-23">8704-23</a>]</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&ldquo;The defendants preyed upon elderly victims to liquidate their retirement savings to invest in a precious metals scam,&rdquo; said Director of Enforcement Ian McGinley. &ldquo;The CFTC remains steadfast in ridding the precious metals industry of fraud; this significant resolution announced in conjunction with state partners in California and Hawaii is yet another example of the results.&rdquo;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Case Background</span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The order finds the defendants executed a nationwide fraud, from approximately November 2019 through approximately June 2022, in which the defendants convinced at least 950 people to pay over $69 million for silver and gold Canadian Red-Tailed Hawk (RTH) coins worth only $30 million, reflecting mark-ups of between 91.89% and 129.97% over Red Rock&rsquo;s cost to acquire the coins. Most of these customers used tax-deferred or other retirement funds to purchase the RTH coins from Red Rock. The order finds Red Rock did not disclose these mark-ups to customers, but rather Spencer (and other Red Rock salespersons) effectively engaged in bait-and-switch conduct: Spencer discussed the lower mark-up on one category of products Red Rock offered (i.e., 1% to 5% mark-up on common bullion products) but then sold customers the supposedly &ldquo;premium&rdquo; RTH coins, which carried the exponentially higher mark-ups.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>According to the order, Red Rock sales staff, including Spencer, a senior salesperson, told customers that because Red Rock had a &ldquo;direct relationship&rdquo; with the Royal Canadian Mint (RCM) which produced the RTH coins, Red Rock was able to buy the coins &ldquo;at wholesale&rdquo; and &ldquo;pass the savings&rdquo; onto its customers. In fact, the order finds Red Rock did not have a direct relationship with the RCM, but bought all of its RTH coins from a wholesaler. The order also finds Red Rock marketed the RTH coins as &ldquo;limited quantity,&rdquo; when there was no mintage limit on the RTH coins. The order further finds Kelly, as Red Rock&rsquo;s CEO, controlled the company&rsquo;s operations and was responsible for the actions of its agents, including Spencer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Parallel Civil Action</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>On May 15, 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed suit against the defendants and another individual for violations arising from the fraudulent precious metals scheme and rendering unlawful investment advice. [See SEC Press Release No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-93">2023-93</a>]</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The CFTC thanks and acknowledges the assistance of the SEC. The CFTC also thanks its co-plaintiffs, the California DFPI and Hawaii SEB, for their assistance.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The CFTC cautions that orders requiring payment of funds to victims may not result in the recovery of any money lost because wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The Division of Enforcement (DOE) staff responsible for this action are James Garcia, Dan Jordan, Kelly Folks, Michael Loconte, Rick Glaser, and Erica Bodin.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>CFTC&rsquo;s Precious Metals Customer Fraud Advisory</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The CFTC has issued several customer protection&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/index.htm">Fraud Advisories and Articles</a>&nbsp;that provide the warning signs of fraud, including the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/CFTCFraudAdvisories/fraudadv_preciousmetals.html">Precious Metals Fraud Advisory</a>, which alerts customers to precious metals fraud and lists simple ways to spot precious metals scams.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The CFTC also strongly urges the public to verify a company&rsquo;s registration with the CFTC before committing funds. If unregistered, a customer should be wary of providing funds to that entity. A company&rsquo;s registration status can be found at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nfa.futures.org/BasicNet/basic-search-landing.aspx">NFA BASIC</a>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Customers and other individuals can report suspicious activities or information, such as possible violations of commodity trading laws, to the Division of Enforcement via a toll-free hotline 866-FON-CFTC (866-366-2382),&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cftc.gov/ConsumerProtection/FileaTiporComplaint/index.htm">file a tip or complaint</a>&nbsp;online, or contact the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whistleblower.gov/">Whistleblower Office</a>. Whistleblowers may be eligible to receive between 10 and 30 percent of the monetary sanctions collected paid from the Customer Protection Fund financed through monetary sanctions paid to the CFTC by violators of the CEA.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><br />*Pro forma results are presented assuming AxiomSL and Calypso were included in the prior year quarterly results. Pro forma growth excludes the impacts of foreign currency except for AxiomSL and Calypso, which are not yet calculated on an organic basis.<br />**Net revenues includes&nbsp;$9 million&nbsp;of Other Revenues which primarily reflect revenues associated with the European power trading and clearing business which is pending sale.</p>
<p><span>
Adena Friedman, Chair and CEO</span>&nbsp;said, &ldquo;Nasdaq delivered another quarter of solid results, with double digit revenue growth in our Solutions businesses including strong Financial Technology results and exceptional Index performance. We continue to make progress on our Integrate, Innovate, and Accelerate strategic priorities with ongoing momentum across our integration work streams and the One Nasdaq go-to-market strategy.</p>
<p>As we look toward the remainder of the year, we are well positioned to deliver on our next phase of scalable, profitable, and durable growth.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>
Sarah Youngwood, Executive Vice President and CFO</span>&nbsp;said, &ldquo;Nasdaq&rsquo;s financial performance in the first quarter underscores the growth profile and durability of our business model. We are making disciplined investments while achieving meaningful progress executing on our expense synergy target and our deleveraging plan.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>FINANCIAL REVIEW</span></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>First quarter 2024 net revenues were&nbsp;$1.1 billion, an increase of&nbsp;$203 million, or 22%, versus the prior year period with 6% organic growth or 7% growth on a pro forma basis. Revenue growth includes a&nbsp;$150 million&nbsp;net benefit primarily related to the acquisition of Adenza and a&nbsp;$2 million&nbsp;increase from the impact of changes in FX rates.</li>
<li>Solutions revenue was&nbsp;$871 million&nbsp;in the first quarter of 2024, an increase of&nbsp;$227 million, or 35%, versus the prior year period with organic growth of 11% or 13% growth on a pro forma basis, reflecting strong growth from Index and Financial Technology.</li>
<li>ARR grew 29% year over year, 5% organically, or 7% on a pro forma basis in the first quarter with 12% pro forma ARR growth for Financial Technology and 1% ARR growth for Capital Access Platforms.</li>
<li>Market Services net revenues were&nbsp;$237 million&nbsp;in the first quarter of 2024, a decrease of&nbsp;$23 million, or 9%, versus the prior year period. The&nbsp;$23 million&nbsp;organic decrease was primarily driven by an&nbsp;$11 million&nbsp;decrease in&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;equity derivatives revenue, an&nbsp;$8 million&nbsp;decline in&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;tape plan revenue, and a&nbsp;$3 million&nbsp;decline in&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;cash equities revenue.</li>
<li>First quarter 2024 GAAP operating expenses were&nbsp;$707 million, an increase of&nbsp;$205 million, or 41%, versus the prior year period. The increase for the first quarter of 2024 is due to the inclusion of&nbsp;$86 million&nbsp;in amortization expense of acquired intangible assets,&nbsp;$68 million&nbsp;of other AxiomSL and Calypso operating expenses, a one-time charge of&nbsp;$23 million&nbsp;associated with the settlement of our pension plan, and organic growth driven by increased investments in technology and our people to drive innovation and long-term growth. The increase also reflected&nbsp;$8 million&nbsp;of restructuring charges associated with the programs we initiated to optimize our efficiencies as a combined organization as well as integrating the Adenza acquisition.</li>
<li>First quarter 2024 non-GAAP operating expenses were&nbsp;$524 million, an increase of&nbsp;$88 million, or 20%, versus the prior year period with 4% organic growth or 5% on a pro forma basis. The increase for the first quarter of 2024 is primarily due to the inclusion of&nbsp;$68 million&nbsp;of AxiomSL and Calypso non-GAAP operating expenses. The organic and pro forma increases reflect growth driven by increased investments in technology and our people to drive innovation and long-term growth.</li>
<li>First quarter 2024 cash flow from operations was&nbsp;$530 million, enabling the company to continue to make meaningful progress on its deleveraging plan. The company returned&nbsp;$127 million&nbsp;to shareholders through dividends and repaid the remaining&nbsp;$340 million&nbsp;term loan balance and a net&nbsp;$67 million&nbsp;in commercial paper. We did not repurchase shares during the first quarter of 2024. As of&nbsp;March&nbsp;31, 2024, there was&nbsp;$1.9 billion&nbsp;remaining under the board authorized share repurchase program.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>2024 EXPENSE AND TAX GUIDANCE UPDATE</span><span><span>6</span></span></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>The company is updating its 2024 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to a range of&nbsp;$2,125 million&nbsp;to&nbsp;$2,185 million, and maintaining its 2024 non-GAAP tax rate guidance to be in the range of 24.5% to 26.5%.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>STRATEGIC AND BUSINESS UPDATES</span></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><span>March 5th&nbsp;Investor Day highlighted Nasdaq&rsquo;s strategy to deliver its next phase of resilient and scalable growth.&nbsp;</span>Approximately 500 investors and analysts participated in Nasdaq&rsquo;s 2024 Investor Day, where Nasdaq highlighted its strategic initiatives of Integrate, Innovate, and Accelerate, introduced the One Nasdaq go-to-market strategy, and outlined its capital allocation priorities to support organic revenue growth and leverage reduction.</li>
<li><span>AxiomSL and Calypso achieved 15% combined pro forma ARR growth.</span>&nbsp;AxiomSL and Calypso had 45 upsells and signed 2 new clients. Combined gross revenue retention<span>7</span>&nbsp;was 96% and net revenue retention<span>8&nbsp;</span>was 111%. Excluding the impact of a significant 2023 bankruptcy first noted last quarter, gross revenue retention was 98% and net revenue retention was 113%.</li>
<li><span>Verafin&nbsp;had solid growth in SMB customers while launching a new AI-based copilot capability.&nbsp;</span>Within Financial Crime Management Technology,&nbsp;Verafin&nbsp;had 24% ARR growth in the first quarter. This included the addition of 28 new SMB clients, underscoring the continued growth within its core client base. Additionally, after an extensive Beta program, the business rolled out its first copilot feature, the integrated Entity Research Copilot, to its customer base of more than 2,500 financial institutions. Verafin&rsquo;s solutions, combined with the integrated copilot, significantly improve investigator efficiency with up to a 90% reduction in alert review time compared to legacy approaches.</li>
<li><span>Exchange-traded product (</span><span>ETP) assets under management (AUM) linked to Nasdaq indices reached record levels, surpassing&nbsp;$500 billion&nbsp;at quarter-end, with growth in derivatives volumes.</span>&nbsp;Market performance and&nbsp;$46 billion&nbsp;in net inflows in the trailing twelve-month period, including&nbsp;$21 billion&nbsp;in the first quarter, resulted in record quarter-end ETP AUM linked to Nasdaq indices at&nbsp;$519 billion. This quarter also marked the 25th anniversary of the launch of the&nbsp;Invesco QQQ Exchange Traded Fund, which tracks the Nasdaq-100, highlighting the longstanding relationship between Nasdaq and Invesco. Nasdaq futures and options volumes increased 5% year-over-year, also contributing to revenue growth.</li>
<li><span>Launched Dynamic Midpoint Extended Life Order (M-ELO) for&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;cash equities on&nbsp;April 15th.</span>&nbsp;Nasdaq launched Dynamic M-ELO, the first&nbsp;SEC&nbsp;approved AI-powered order type designed to improve fill rates and create greater efficiency in equities markets. This new order type analyzes more than 140 data points every 30 seconds on a symbol-by-symbol basis to detect market conditions and optimize the holding period prior to which a trade is eligible to execute.</li>
<li><span>Nasdaq maintained its leadership among exchanges in&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;multi-listed options.</span>&nbsp;In the first quarter of 2024, Nasdaq led all exchanges during the period in total volume traded for&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;multi-listed equity options. Nasdaq also achieved record revenue in its proprietary index options franchise, driven by record trading volumes.</li>
<li><span>Investor demand underpinned the success of</span>&nbsp;<span>the Borse Dubai secondary offering.</span>&nbsp;Nasdaq successfully coordinated the secondary offering of 31 million shares offered by Borse Dubai. Borse Dubai remains a strategic shareholder of Nasdaq with over 10% ownership and representation on Nasdaq&rsquo;s board. The transaction priced on&nbsp;March 19th&nbsp;and closed on&nbsp;March 22nd&nbsp;with strong investor demand resulting in an oversubscribed transaction.</li>

<p><span>____________</span><br /><span>1&nbsp;</span>Represents revenues less transaction-based expenses.<br /><span>2&nbsp;</span>Refer to our reconciliations of&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP to non-GAAP net income, diluted earnings per share, operating income, operating expenses and organic impacts included in the attached schedules.<br /><span>3&nbsp;</span>Pro forma results are presented assuming AxiomSL and Calypso were included in the prior year quarterly results. These results are not calculated in a manner consistent with the pro forma requirements in Article 11 of Regulation S-X. Pro forma growth excludes the impacts of foreign currency except for AxiomSL and Calypso, which are not yet calculated on an organic basis.<br /><span>4&nbsp;</span>Constitutes revenues from our Capital Access Platforms and Financial Technology segments.<br /><span>5</span>&nbsp;Annualized&nbsp;Recurring&nbsp;Revenue&nbsp;(ARR) for a given period is the current annualized value derived from subscription contracts with a defined contract value. This excludes contracts that are not recurring, are one-time in nature or where the contract value fluctuates based on defined metrics. ARR is currently one of our key performance metrics to assess the health and trajectory of our recurring business. ARR does not have any standardized definition and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those items. For AxiomSL and Calypso recurring revenue contracts, the amount included in ARR is consistent with the amount that we invoice the customer during the current period. Additionally, for AxiomSL and Calypso recurring revenue contracts that include annual values that increase over time, we include in ARR only the annualized value of components of the contract that are considered active as of the date of the ARR calculation. We do not include the future committed increases in the contract value as of the date of the ARR calculation. ARR is not a forecast and the active contracts at the end of a reporting period used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers.<br /><span>6&nbsp;</span>U.S.&nbsp;GAAP operating expense and tax rate guidance are not provided due to the inherent difficulty in quantifying certain amounts due to a variety of factors including the unpredictability in the movement in foreign currency rates, as well as future charges or reversals outside of the normal course of business.<br /><span>7&nbsp;</span>Gross Retention: As used herein for AxiomSL and Calypso, ARR in the current period over ARR in the prior year period for existing customers excluding price increases and upsells and excluding new customers.<br /><span>8&nbsp;</span>Net Retention: As used herein for AxiomSL and Calypso, ARR in the current period over ARR in the prior year period for existing customers including price increases and upsells and excluding new customers.</p>

<p><span>NON-GAAP INFORMATION</span></p>
<p>In addition to disclosing results determined in accordance with&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP, Nasdaq also discloses certain non-GAAP results of operations, including, but not limited to, non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP operating expenses, that include certain adjustments or exclude certain charges and gains that are described in the reconciliation table of&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP to non-GAAP information provided at the end of this release. Management uses this non-GAAP information internally, along with&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP information, in evaluating our performance and in making financial and operational decisions. We believe our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and supplemental data relating to our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of results as the items described below in the reconciliation tables do not reflect ongoing operating performance.</p>
<p>These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to,&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate such measures differently, which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. This information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant as a substitute for our operating results in accordance with&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP. We recommend investors review the&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP financial measures included in this earnings release. When viewed in conjunction with our&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide greater transparency and a more complete understanding of factors affecting our business than&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP measures alone.</p>
<p>We understand that analysts and investors regularly rely on non-GAAP financial measures, such as those noted above, to assess operating performance. We use these measures because they highlight trends more clearly in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our ongoing operating performance.</p>
<p><span>Organic revenue and expense growth, organic change and organic impact</span>&nbsp;are non-GAAP measures that reflect adjustments for: (i) the impact of period-over-period changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and (ii) the revenues, expenses and operating income associated with acquisitions and divestitures for the twelve month period following the date of the acquisition or divestiture. Reconciliations of these measures are described within the body of this release or in the reconciliation tables at the end of this release.</p>
<p><span>Foreign exchange impact:</span>&nbsp;In countries with currencies other than the&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;dollar, revenues and expenses are translated using monthly average exchange rates. Certain discussions in this release isolate the impact of year-over-year foreign currency fluctuations to better measure the comparability of operating results between periods. Operating results excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations are calculated by translating the current period&rsquo;s results by the prior period&rsquo;s exchange rates.</p>
<p><span>Restructuring programs</span>: In the fourth quarter of 2023, following the closing of the Adenza acquisition, our management approved, committed to and initiated a restructuring program, &ldquo;Adenza Restructuring&rdquo; to optimize our efficiencies as a combined organization. In connection with this program, we expect to incur pre-tax charges principally related to employee-related costs, contract terminations, real estate impairments and other related costs. We expect to achieve benefits primarily in the form of expense and revenue synergies. In&nbsp;October 2022, following our September announcement to realign our segments and leadership, we initiated a divisional alignment program with a focus on realizing the full potential of this structure. In connection with the program, we expect to incur pre-tax charges principally related to employee-related costs, consulting, asset impairments and contract terminations over a two-year period. We expect to achieve benefits in the form of both increased customer engagement and operating efficiencies. Costs related to the Adenza restructuring and the divisional alignment programs will be recorded as &ldquo;restructuring charges&rdquo; in our consolidated statements of income. We will exclude charges associated with this program for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures as they are not reflective of ongoing operating performance or comparisons in Nasdaq's performance between periods.</p>

<title>FSB Introduces New Global Standard To Support The Orderly Resolution Of A Central Counterparty (CCP)</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fsb-introduces-new-global-standard-to-support-the-orderly-resolution-of-a-centra/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fsb-introduces-new-global-standard-to-support-the-orderly-resolution-of-a-centra/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li> <em><strong>New standard aims to ensure that resolution authorities have ready access to a set of resolution-specific financial resources and tools, as well as any unused recovery resources, to support the orderly resolution of a central counterparty (CCP).</strong></em> </li>
<li> <em><strong>Standard requires that adequate liquidity, loss-absorbing, and recapitalisation resources and tools are available to maintain the continuity of a CCP&rsquo;s critical functions and mitigate adverse effects on financial stability should resolution become necessary.</strong></em> </li>
<li> <em><strong>FSB will monitor implementation for CCPs that are systemically important in more than one jurisdiction and publish findings in its annual Resolution Report.</strong></em> </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) published today a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/04/financial-resources-and-tools-for-central-counterparty-resolution/">report on financial resources and tools for CCP resolution</a>.</p>
<p>The availability of adequate resources and tools for CCP resolution remains critical for financial stability and for ensuring confidence in the financial system. Progress in implementing the G20 regulatory reforms agreed after the 2008-09 financial crisis, including the central clearing mandate, has increased the systemic importance of CCPs. While material advances have been achieved to enhance the resilience and recovery of CCPs, it is also necessary to ensure that adequate financial resources and tools are available in resolution to maintain the continuity of critical functions and safeguard financial stability, should resolution become necessary.</p>
<p>Consequently, the FSB has developed a global standard for financial resources and tools to facilitate the orderly resolution of systemically important CCPs with two expectations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Resolution authorities of systemically important CCPs should have access to a set of resolution-specific resources and tools, in addition to recovery resources and tools where these are available to the resolution authority. The resolution toolbox should include a combination of resolution-specific resources and tools from the list of seven in the report. Not all seven resources and tools need to be included. Financial resources and tools have different strengths and weaknesses, and no single resource or tool would be sufficient by itself to meet the resolution objectives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jurisdictions should make their approach to calibrating the resolution-specific resources and tools in the toolbox transparent.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The FSB will monitor implementation for CCPs that are systemically important in more than one jurisdiction through the FSB&rsquo;s regular monitoring tools. The findings will be aggregated and published in the FSB&rsquo;s annual&nbsp;<em>Resolution Report</em>.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In March 2022, the FSB, the Bank for International Settlements&rsquo; Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI), and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) published a joint report on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2022/03/central-counterparty-financial-resources-for-recovery-and-resolution/">CCP Financial Resources for Recovery and Resolution</a>. Following the publication of the joint report, the FSB decided, in April 2022, to undertake further qualitative work on financial resources and tools for systemically important CCP resolution and published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/09/financial-resources-and-tools-for-central-counterparty-resolution-consultation-report/">consultation report</a>&nbsp;on its proposals in September 2023.</p>
<p>Implementation of the toolbox approach would be achieved through amendments to the Financial Market Infrastructure Annex to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/work-of-the-fsb/market-and-institutional-resilience/post-2008-financial-crisis-reforms/effective-resolution-regimes-and-policies/key-attributes-of-effective-resolution-regimes-for-financial-institutions/">Key Attributes</a>&nbsp;and to the 2020&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2020/11/guidance-on-financial-resources-to-support-ccp-resolution-and-on-the-treatment-of-ccp-equity-in-resolution/">Guidance on Financial Resources to Support CCP Resolution and on the Treatment of CCP Equity in Resolution</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Resolution Report is prepared annually by the FSB Resolution Steering Group, which is the primary global forum for the development of standards and guidance for resolution regimes, planning, and execution for systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs).</p>
<p>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. The FSB also conducts outreach with approximately 70 other jurisdictions through its six Regional Consultative Groups.</p>
<p>The FSB is chaired by Klaas Knot, President of De Nederlandsche Bank. The FSB Secretariat is located in Basel, Switzerland and hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>

<title>ETC Group Launches “BTC1”:  A Unique Core Bitcoin ETP - A Best-In-Class Bitcoin ETP Designed For Benchmark-Focused Long-Term Investors</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/etc-group-launches-btc1-a-unique-core-bitcoin-etp-a-best-in-class-bitcoin/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/etc-group-launches-btc1-a-unique-core-bitcoin-etp-a-best-in-class-bitcoin/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Launch, ETP, Bitcoin, Liquidity, Benchmark<br />
Summary:<br />ETC Group launches BTC1, a cost-efficient, benchmark-focused Bitcoin ETP with global primary market liquidity and secure custody solution. <div>
<p>ETC Group (www.etc-group.com) is announcing the launch of its latest Exchange-Traded Product (ETP) on Deutsche B&ouml;rse XETRA. The <b>ETC Group Core Bitcoin ETP</b> (ticker <b>BTC1</b>; ISIN <b>DE000A4AER62</b>) has been tailored specifically for benchmark-conscious, long-term buy-and-hold investors, and global institutional investors with extended liquidity and risk management needs. BTC1 complements the existing product range of ETC Group, which includes, among other, the most liquid and <a href="https://etc-group.com/products/etc-group-physical-bitcoin/">largest crypto ETP</a> in Europe.</p>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>Key Highlights of BTC1:</b></h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Cost-efficient:</b> With a Total Expense Ratio (TER) of 0.30%, BTC1 offers a competitive edge in cost-efficiency.</li>
<li><b>Benchmark-Focused:</b> BTC1 tracks the institutional-grade Bitcoin price benchmark by CF Benchmarks, ensuring accuracy and reliability in tracking Bitcoin's price movements.</li>
<li><b>Broader and Wider Primary Market Liquidity:</b> As the first regulated global spot Bitcoin product, BTC1 provides unparalleled primary market liquidity, bridging US, European, and Asian spot BTC liquidity during the trading windows used by global, regulated institutional capital.</li>
<li><b>Tri-NAV Methodology:</b> BTC1 introduces a unique Tri-NAV methodology, offering institutional investors an extended primary market liquidity window covering U.S., European, and Asian BTC spot liquidity. Therefore, in addition to stock exchange trading hours, the issuer provides three price determinations throughout the day (instead of just one) to expand primary market liquidity across additional time zones. This means that institutional investors can trade their holdings over the longest period compared to any other regulated Bitcoin spot vehicle worldwide on the primary market. As a result, BTC1 can be considered the first globally oriented Bitcoin spot ETP.</li>
<li><b>Robust ETP Structure:</b> BTC1 uses the same trusted product structure as ETC Group&rsquo;s other products, including German domicile with primary listing on XETRA, 100% physical backing, and full fungibility with the underlying. Furthermore, BTC1 also features an independent administrator, a unique ETP structural attribute first introduced by ETC Group in 2020. This administrator entity holds legal veto rights on any asset or securities movements of the ETP issuer, monitors custody balances, and overall adds an extra layer of security to the issuer&rsquo;s product ecosystem.</li>
<li><b>Secure Custody Solution: </b>Assets are securely kept with Zodia Custody, a leading European institutional-grade provider of cold-storage custody, featuring a bank-grade compliance &amp; governance framework.<b>&nbsp;</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Why Benchmark and Liquidity matter</b></p>
<p>Bitcoin's liquidity is vast but fragmented across multiple exchanges, complicating price determination for investors. CF Benchmarks has developed the most robust benchmark to capture and aggregate this liquidity, the BRR index and its US and Asian variants - BRRY and BRRAP which have collectively become the most widely adopted benchmark used by regulated institutional capital, including the majority of US spot ETFs and CME Futures. BTC1 leverages all three regional variants of this benchmark, allowing institutional investors to track Bitcoin's fair price accurately and confidently. Ultimately, allowing access to three liquidity pools / valuation points across 14 hours (compared to valuation point and an 8-hour window for all other ETFs and ETPs globally).</p>
<p>BTC1 addresses the liquidity challenges institutional investors face with existing Bitcoin ETPs, which are confined by traditional stock exchange trading hours. With Bitcoin trading around the clock and Bitcoin Futures trading 23/5, BTC1 offers institutional investors a global and regulated spot Bitcoin ETP, with currently the broadest primary market liquidity for Bitcoin ETPs globally. This extended liquidity window enhances price transparency and risk management capabilities for institutional investors.</p>
<p>Chanchal Samadder, Head of Product at ETC Group, commented, "BTC1 represents a significant milestone in the evolution of Bitcoin investment products. Designed with benchmark-conscious and long-term investors in mind, BTC1 offers a unique blend of cost-efficiency, accuracy, and extended primary market liquidity, setting a new standard in the Bitcoin ETP market."</p>
<p>Julian Sawyer, CEO of Zodia Custody added: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s breakthrough after breakthrough with our fellow innovators at ETC Group. The newly launched BTC1 represents exactly what institutions have long sought as they have increased their adoption of digital assets, and we&rsquo;re playing our part to ensure they can do so with the utmost security and compliance through bank-grade custody. Together, we continue to be at the very forefront of building a truly robust ecosystem for a mature digital asset industry.&rdquo;<b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<h4><b>Continuously paving the way as Germany&rsquo;s first Crypto ETP issuer</b></h4>
<p>Tim Bevan, CEO commented: &ldquo;At ETC Group, we want to drive the crypto investment industry forward and the launch of BTC1 represents a unique proposition.&nbsp; With BTC1, we are bringing the first globally orientated Bitcoin ETP to market, with the extended liquidity and risk management features that our clients need. We are proud to be launching yet another market first and we believe that BTC1 has the potential to uniquely serve institutional investors with best-in-class attributes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>BTC1 will be tradable on XETRA and many other platforms and will be added to HANetf&rsquo;s Pan-European ETP distribution platform.</p>
<p>Recent additions to ETC Group's institutional product line-up include <a href="https://etc-group.com/products/etc-group-ethereum-staking/">ET32</a>, the unique total return Ethereum staking ETP linked to a transparent staking benchmark, and <a href="https://etc-group.com/products/etc-group-digital-assets-select-20/">DA20</a>, the only broad-market Crypto Basket ETP tracking an MSCI digital assets benchmark of the top 20 investable cryptocurrencies.</p>

<div> Gender equality, emerging markets, index, partnership, diversity & inclusion
Summary:
- Solactive and Equileap launch a gender equality index for emerging markets
- Index tracks firms with strong gender equality performance
- Outperforms parent index on risk-adjusted basis
- Offers strong financial returns and promotes gender diversity
- Provides investors with a tool to align portfolios with gender equality values<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p><strong>Solactive today announced the launch of a unique emerging markets index focusing on gender equality in partnership with Equileap, a leading data and insights company focused on advancing gender equality and diversity &amp; inclusion in the corporate sector.</strong></p>
<p>The index tracks firms from emerging markets that exhibit a strong performance with regard to gender equality. Equileap evaluates firms on gender equality criteria based on their comprehensive methodology, which takes into account factors such as the percentage of women in leadership and on the board, equality of compensation and work-life balance policies, gender pay gap and anti-sexual harassment policies. By applying a best-in-class approach across sectors, the index fosters a more balanced and equitable investment landscape in emerging markets while maintaining a similar risk profile compared to a standard broad emerging markets benchmark.<br /><br />Historically, the index has outperformed its parent index, the Solactive GBS Emerging Markets Large &amp; Mid Cap Index, on a risk-adjusted basis. While showing a similar risk profile, the annualized average return is approximately 3.87 percentage points higher compared to the parent index (based on the Net Total Return version).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Timo Pfeiffer, Chief Markets Officer at Solactive, said</span>:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;We are delighted to partner with Equileap on this index, which provides investors with an impactful tool to integrate social matters into their investment decision and promote gender diversity through their emerging markets exposure. By offering strong financial returns alongside meaningful consideration of important social issues, the index exemplifies our commitment to designing innovative solutions at the intersection of finance and sustainability.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Diana Van Maasdijk, CEO at Equileap, commented:</span>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;We are proud to collaborate with Solactive on launching a benchmark for Gender Equality in Emerging Markets, a testament to our commitment to advancing gender equality globally. By providing investors with a groundbreaking tool to align their portfolios with their values, we are not only driving positive social change but also tapping into the immense potential of emerging markets. This index not only offers impressive financial performance but also fosters a more inclusive and equitable workplace. We encourage investors to seize this opportunity to invest in gender equality and contribute to a more sustainable and prosperous future for all.</em><em>&rdquo;</em></p>

<title>National Bank Of Iraq Goes Live With Temenos Core Banking And Payments - With Award-Winning Implementation, National Bank Of Iraq Completes Move From Legacy System In Under 12 Months</title>

<div> Iraq, Temenos, core banking, Capital Bank, digital transformation
Summary:
NBI, part of Capital Bank Group, successfully implemented Temenos core banking and payments, leading to enhanced operational efficiency and improved customer experience. Temenos supports Capital Bank's digital transformation journey. <div>
<p>Temenos (SIX: TEMN) today announced that&nbsp;<a href="https://nbi.iq/" target="_blank">National Bank of Iraq</a>&nbsp;(NBI), part of the Capital Bank Group, has successfully gone live with Temenos core banking and payments.</p>
<p>NBI, which has 27 branches across Iraq, offers a comprehensive range of services to individuals and businesses in the country. Since 2005, NBI has been majority owned by Capital Bank, one of the top financial institutions operating in the Jordanian and regional markets, with assets of approximately JOD 7.6 billion<a href="https://mailhost.mondovisione.com/WorldClient.dll?Session=PVGJ85AXFELGX&amp;View=BlankMessageBody#_ftn1"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a>.</p>
<p>With this implementation, NBI moved from its legacy systems onto the same core banking platform as other entities in the Capital Bank Group. This will enable NBI to&nbsp;operate&nbsp;more efficiently and integrate seamlessly with other systems to develop new products faster and deliver an improved customer experience.</p>
<p>Capital Bank Group is a long-standing Temenos customer with other entities in the Group including Capital Bank of Jordan, Bank Audi, Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale Bank Jordan and NBI Saudi Arabia, already on the Temenos platform.</p>
<p>NBI also becomes the first part of the group to adopt Temenos Payments, which enabled the bank to process more than 100,000 transactions of incoming and outgoing domestic and international payments in the first&nbsp;15 days&nbsp;of operation, with a 99% straight-through processing rate.</p>
<p>The migration to the Temenos platform for core banking and payments at NBI was completed in under 12 months thanks to Temenos&rsquo; pre-configured banking and payments capabilities and&nbsp;APIs&nbsp;which reduced the need for complex customizations, as well as close collaboration between Temenos, NBI, Capital Bank and delivery partner&nbsp;ITSS. This success was recently recognized in the&nbsp;<a href="https://ibsintelligence.com/ibs-intelligence-announces-its-global-fintech-innovation-awards-2023-results/" target="_blank">IBS Intelligence Innovation Awards</a>, with Capital Bank winning &lsquo;Best Implementation of Core Banking Services'.</p>
<p>The implementation at NBI follows several other successful transformation projects with Temenos for Capital Bank in the last few years, including the launch of NBI&rsquo;s branch operations in Saudi Arabia in just&nbsp;45 days, as well as the integration of Bank Audi and the former Jordanian operations of Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale, each of which was achieved in under four months.</p>
<p>Collectively, these projects helped Capital Bank to increase operational efficiency by more than 50% within three years, bringing significant cost savings and an improved customer experience. With faster, more&nbsp;accurate&nbsp;processing and immediate service requests, the bank has&nbsp;maintained&nbsp;high customer retention rates and a reputation for service excellence.</p>
<p><b>Izzidin Abusalameh, Chief Operations Officer, Capital Bank Group, commented:</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;This achievement marks a significant milestone in our digital transformation journey and positions us as a leading player in the banking industry.&nbsp;We have seamlessly transitioned the National Bank of Iraq to a cutting-edge core banking system which will not only enhance operational efficiency but also support providing our customers with a superior digital banking experience.&nbsp;Our continued partnership with Temenos has not only provided us with an advanced technological platform but has also&nbsp;facilitated&nbsp;a culture of flexibility and adaptability, enabling us to execute our ambitious growth plans.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Lee Allcorn, Managing Director, Middle East &amp; Africa, Temenos, said:&nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Congratulations to National Bank of Iraq and the Capital Bank team on this successful implementation that gives NBI business agility and the same modern technology platform and ability to deploy fast with pre-configured banking capabilities as the rest of the group. With Temenos, Capital Bank Group is future-ready, and we are proud to support them as they continue to innovate and&nbsp;leverage&nbsp;our platform to grow sustainably and enhance the banking experience for customers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Temenos is the global market leader in banking software, consistently ranked #1 by IBS Intelligence for core banking and payments, including in the most recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.temenos.com/insights/white-papers-reports/ibs-slt-2023/" target="_blank">IBSi Sales League Table 2023</a>.</p>

<div> Q1, growth, Microsoft, partnership, buyback<br />
Summary:
LSEG CEO Schwimmer reports solid Q1 growth, strong division performance, progress in Microsoft partnership, and active capital allocation. Buybacks and acquisitions contribute to growth. <br /><br /> <div>
<div class="tr-VerticalSpacing tr-VerticalSpacing--l">
<div class="tr-RichText tr-RichText--large tr-Typestack--subline2  ">
<p><span>David Schwimmer, CEO said:</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;We have started the year well, delivering another quarter of solid growth consistent with our plans. We drove the strongest performances in FTSE Russell, Risk Intelligence and Tradeweb, and our Equities business returned to growth. The rapid pace of innovation continues, with new product launches across LSEG throughout 2024.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We continue to make strong progress in our Microsoft partnership, with a number of products expected to be in external pilot or general release this half. We are now picking up the pace of migrating our datasets onto the Microsoft platform, which will transform access to our data for customers. We look forward to further progress in the rest of the year.&rdquo;</p>

Organic ASV growth expected to remain around these levels throughout 2024 despite further Credit Suisse impact.</li>
<li><span>Active capital allocation:</span>&nbsp;&pound;500 million directed buyback completed in Q1, targeting &pound;1 billion of total buybacks in 2024; refinancing of $1.25 billion in 3-year and 10-year bonds; acquisitions of ICD by Tradeweb and minority stakes in LCH Group.</li>

<li><span>Analytics&nbsp;</span>was up 6.5%, primarily driven by growth in Yieldbook&rsquo;s fixed income analytics and loan data.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>FTSE Russell&nbsp;</span>was up 9.5%, with inflows and more favourable year-on-year market trends driving a stronger contribution from asset-based revenues (+16.4%). Strong demand for flagship equity products continued to support good growth in underlying subscription revenues, adjusting for one-time revenues in the prior year period.</li>
<li><span>Risk Intelligence</span>&nbsp;was up 12.5% driven by strong business momentum and customer demand in our screening business, World-Check. Growth in our digital identity and fraud businesses continues to build as the expansion in distribution partnerships over recent years feeds though to increased usage.&nbsp;</li>
<li><span>Annual Subscription Value (ASV)</span>: Period-end organic ASV growth of 6.0% reflects an increasing impact from Credit Suisse contract losses, as expected, plus the near-term step-down following entry into an attractive long-term agreement with a major bank noted above. We expect ASV growth to remain around these levels throughout 2024 despite further Credit Suisse cancellations.&nbsp;</li>
<li><span>Capital Markets</span>&nbsp;was up 14.4%, driven by growth at Tradeweb.  
<ul>
<li><span>Equities&nbsp;</span>returned to growth, up 1.6%, with gains in secondary trading partly offset by lower market activity.</li>
<li><span>Fixed Income, Derivatives &amp; Other&nbsp;</span>was up 21.3% with a record quarter for Tradeweb. Average Daily Volume (ADV) of $1.9 trillion in Q1 reflected continued share gains, including a record 17.6% share of fully electronic US high-grade bond volumes, complemented by strong market activity across Tradeweb&rsquo;s global asset classes. Tradeweb also expanded its capabilities in algorithmic execution in Q1 with the acquisition of R8fin.&nbsp;</li>
<li><span>FX&nbsp;</span>was down 2.2%. Good volume growth in FXall was offset by a less favourable product mix. We saw strong demand for our innovative Forward First Fixing capability launched last year, with $64 billion traded using the automated multi-dealer trading protocol in Q1. Matching was affected by weakness in interbank volumes.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>Post Trade</span>&nbsp;was flat on an organic basis, and up 5.0% in constant currency including the benefit of the Acadia acquisition. Underlying OTC Derivatives revenues grew strongly driven by higher clearing volumes and price increases for LCH members and clients, with realised organic growth flat due to the &pound;8 million of one-time revenues from reference rate reform in the prior year period. Net Treasury Income was slightly lower (-2.6%) with higher treasury margins largely offsetting the impact of a 21.5% decline in cash collateral balances. Following the acquisition of minority interests in Q1, our ownership of LCH Group rose to 85.9%.</li>
<li><span>Group cost of sales</span>&nbsp;was up 2.8%, below the growth rate in revenue reflecting business mix and the partially fixed nature of the costs.&nbsp;</li>
<li><span>Gross profit</span>&nbsp;was up 6.9%, with growth slightly ahead of Total Income (excl. recoveries) as a result of the lower growth in cost of sales.&nbsp;</li>

<title>Sterling To Add Fixed Income Support To Risk &amp; Margin Service, Continues Product Innovation In Anticipation Of Client Risk And Regulatory Mandates</title>

<div> Securities, Sterling, Risk & Margin, Fixed Income, Analytics <br />
Summary: Sterling Trading Tech plans to support fixed income securities by Q2 2024, extending SRM coverage to include advanced analytics and FINRA reporting. Mutual fund capabilities are also set to expand. <div>
<p><span>Sterling Trading Tech (&lsquo;Sterling&rsquo;), a leading global provider of technology in order management, risk and margin, and trading, today announced plans to support fixed income securities by the end of Q2 2024.</span></p>
<p><span>As Sterling grows its OMS and Risk &amp; Margin System offerings, this latest in a series of strategic initiatives across the product suite advantages clients by extending Sterling Risk &amp; Margin&rsquo;s (SRM) already broad and deep asset coverage. Current covered assets include US and international equities and options; US and international futures and futures options; FX, and crypto.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In addition to its multi-asset coverage, SRM delivers advanced analytics as a RaaS (Risk-as-a-Service) solution. This allows firms to monitor client Reg T, portfolio margin and custom house policy requirements in real-time and includes the ability to view advanced post-execution risk analytics for US and global equities, options and futures as well as secure FINRA reporting. Clients can also combine Sterling's risk capability with its OMS.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once delivered, Sterling clients will be able to view fixed income securities in the SRM UI. This capability will allow them to ascertain how the securities contribute to portfolio values and margin requirements and, in addition, stress their fixed income securities within interest rate shocks to determine their contribution to portfolio risk. Sterling will use standard FINRA margin requirements for fixed income securities, while allowing for overrides at the company or account level.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Said&nbsp;<strong>Brian Saldeen, CFA, Senior Product Manager &ndash; Risk &amp; Margin, at Sterling</strong>: &ldquo;Firms must have the tools to effectively manage their risk across all asset classes. As yields rise, we see more exposure from clients in the fixed income space. We understand their need to measure and mitigate risk in a highly regulated environment.&nbsp; Our approach accounts for asset classes, risk exposure, and regulation in one service offering.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Continuing its commitment to innovation and excellence across its product suite, Sterling will also expand capabilities to include mutual funds later this year.<em>&nbsp;</em></span></p>

<title>FIA Cautions CFTC On Regulation Of AI</title>

<div> regulation, technology-neutral, CFTC, AI, derivatives<br />
<br />
FIA, CME, ICE, and FIA PTG letter urges CFTC to take a technology-neutral approach, focus on outcomes, and use cases for AI regulation.<br />Summary: FIA recommends a technology-neutral approach, focus on outcomes and use cases, and consider existing rules for AI regulation. <div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><em>FIA recommends &ldquo;technology-neutral&rdquo; approach to regulation&nbsp;</em></li>
<li><em>FIA says CFTC should focus on "outcomes and use cases" rather than AI itself&nbsp;</em></li>
<li><em>FIA letter joined by CME, ICE and FIA PTG</em>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<p>FIA today&nbsp;<a href="https://email.fia.org/c/128x3dkdRiQqHXuBwj6YmcPMThgGV7">responded</a>&nbsp;to a request for comment from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on the uses of artificial intelligence in derivatives markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>FIA welcomed the CFTC's decision to seek feedback from the public before determining whether additional regulation is needed, and encouraged the agency to continue gathering information to help it better understand the current and potential uses for AI as well as the risks that may arise.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>FIA urged the CFTC to take a "technology-neutral" approach and focus on "outcomes and use cases" rather than the technology itself.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>FIA also urged the CFTC to consider the applicability of its existing rules and regulations before presupposing that new, AI-specific regulations are needed. &nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>"In many instances, existing CFTC rules and guidance provide the controls and oversight needed for the CFTC to promote and protect the integrity and resilience of our markets," the letter said. "We believe that the CFTC&rsquo;s risk-based approach to developing a regulatory framework around outcomes and use cases, rather than the underlying technology, likely means that the CFTC&rsquo;s existing rule sets already address perceived risks."&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>FIA's letter was co-signed by CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange, which are the parent companies for several exchanges regulated by the CFTC, and the FIA Principal Traders Group, which represents firms that trade their own capital in exchange-traded markets. &nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The CFTC's&nbsp;<a href="https://email.fia.org/c/128x3dNSrmJ86kedXNUErmOOk5zuI0" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">request for comment</a><span>&nbsp;</span>was issued in January. CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam said when the request was issued that it would allow the agency "to better align our supervisory oversight and evaluate the need for future regulation, guidance or other Commission action."&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>FIA is the leading global trade organization for the futures, options and centrally cleared derivatives markets, with offices in Brussels, London, Singapore and Washington, D.C. FIA&rsquo;s membership includes clearing firms, exchanges, clearinghouses, trading firms and commodities specialists from about 50 countries as well as technology vendors, law firms and other professional service providers. FIA&rsquo;s mission is to support open, transparent and competitive markets; protect and enhance the integrity of the financial system; and promote high standards of professional conduct. &nbsp;</p>

<div> Registered Fund Statistics, SEC, report, Form N-PORT, investment management <br />
Summary:<br /> SEC published a new report of Registered Fund Statistics based on aggregated Form N-PORT data, providing public with a regular and detailed picture of registered funds industry. <div>
<p>The staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission today published a new report of&nbsp;<em>Registered Fund Statistics</em>, which is based on aggregated data reported by SEC-registered funds on Form N-PORT. The new report, which will be updated on a quarterly basis, is designed to provide the public with a regular and detailed picture of the registered funds industry&mdash;with its more than 12,000 funds and more than $26 trillion in total net assets under management. The report provides key industry statistics and shows trends over time, including information and trends related to portfolio holdings, flows and returns, interest rate risk, and other exposures across U.S. mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and other registered funds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Providing data to the public is one of the more consequential things a government agency does,&rdquo; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. &ldquo;This new report will give the public a view into the registered fund industry. Investors, issuers, economists, academics, and the public at large benefit from such regularly published economic data.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Registered Fund Statistics</em>&nbsp;contains the first aggregated report that reflects both the public and non-public information filed on Form N-PORT, and most of the aggregated data in the more than 70 separate tables of the report is being made public for the first time. Also, the public may download the statistics reported in Registered Fund Statistics in a structured format, which will provide the historical statistical series of information with each publication of the report.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The publication of this data will provide valuable information to a wide range of users,&rdquo; said SEC Chief Economist Jessica Wachter. &ldquo;Data that is accessible and useable by the public provides greater transparency into our capital markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This report provides the public an unprecedented view of the composition and activities of registered funds,&rdquo; said Tim Husson, head of the Division of Investment Management&rsquo;s Analytics Office. &ldquo;We welcome feedback on the report, which we believe will assist the public dialogue on issues pertaining to the asset management industry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Division of Investment Management has primary responsibility for administering the Investment Company Act of 1940 and Investment Advisers Act of 1940, including oversight of investment companies, such as mutual funds, money market funds, and ETFs, and for investment advisers. The Division&rsquo;s Analytics Office provides the Division and the SEC with practical reviews and actionable analyses of the asset management industry.</p>
<p>The report is available on the SEC&rsquo;s website&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/investment/analytics-office">here</a>.</p>

<title>The EBA Consults On Draft Technical Standards On The Specification Of Long And Short Positions Under The Derogations For Market And Counterparty Risks</title>

<div> consultation, EBA, draft RTS, market risk, CRR3
Summary:<br /> The EBA launched a public consultation on draft RTS for identifying risk drivers and position determination. It includes a simplified method for small banks. <div>
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today launched a public consultation on its draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on the method for identifying the main risk driver and determining whether a transaction represents a long or a short position. These RTS are part of the Phase 1 deliverables of the EBA roadmap on the implementation of the EU banking package in the area of market risk. The consultation runs until 24 July 2024.</span></p>
<p>The Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) includes some derogations for the calculation of the capital requirements for market and counterparty credit risks, for small trading book business, derivative business or business subject to market risk. The CRR3 specifies that the size of the business shall be equal to the absolute value of the aggregated long position, summed with the absolute value of the aggregated short position. A position can be considered as long or short depending on how movements in its main risk driver affect the market value.</p>
<p>The proposed general method to identify the main risk driver hinges on sensitivities defined under the market risk standardised approach (FRTB-SA) or on add-ons defined under the standardised approach for counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR). For the determination of the direction of the positions, the methodology is aligned with the one set out in the RTS on SA-CCR.</p>
<p>Considering that small banks are, and have always been, exempted from using the FRTB SA or SA-CCR, a simplified method has also been included. The simplified method covers relatively simple instruments which are normally traded by small banks (fixed-rate bonds, floating-rate notes, stocks, forwards, futures, simple swaps and plain vanilla options).</p>
<h4>Consultation process</h4>
<p>Comments to this consultation can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the "send your comments" button on the consultation page. Please note that the deadline for the submission of comments is 24 July 2024.</p>
<p>The public hearing on these draft RTS will take place via conference call on 2 July 2024 from 15.30 to 17.00 CEST. The EBA invites interested stakeholders to register using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/public-hearing-rts-specification-long-and-short-positions">this link</a>&nbsp;by 28 June 2024 at 16:00 CEST.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<p>The draft RTS on the specification of long and short positions have been developed according to Article 94(10) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR), as amended by the revised Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR3), which mandates the EBA to specify the method for identifying the main risk driver of a position and for determining whether a transaction represents a long or a short position as referred to in Art. 94(3), 273a(3) and 325a(2). In developing these draft RTS, the EBA shall take into consideration the method for determining whether a transaction is a long or short position in the primary risk driver or in the most material risk driver, developed for the RTS on SA-CCR in accordance with Art. 279a(3), point (b), of the CRR.&nbsp;</p>

<div> Securities and Exchange Commission, Registered Fund Statistics, transparency, government agency, aggregated economic data<br />
<br />
Summary: The SEC starts publishing Registered Fund Statistics report, providing aggregated data on the $25 trillion registered fund industry, enhancing transparency and accessibility. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission staff today began publishing a new report, the&nbsp;<i>Registered Fund Statistics</i>&nbsp;report,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-nport-report-04242024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;which aggregates data about the more than $25 trillion registered fund industry. This will give the public a view into the registered fund industry, which includes more than 12,000 mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and closed-end funds.</p>
<p>Providing such data to the public is one of the more consequential things a government agency does. Such transparency creates a public good.</p>
<p>Our founders understood such public goods when they embedded data collection in the Constitution itself with the decennial census,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-nport-report-04242024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;the first of which began in 1790.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-nport-report-04242024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Many government agencies, from the Department of Agriculture<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-nport-report-04242024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;to the Department of Labor<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-nport-report-04242024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;to the Energy Information Agency,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-nport-report-04242024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;provide important aggregated economic data to the public.</p>
<p>The SEC also has had a history of publishing aggregate data with regard to the securities markets. Such disclosures by the SEC and other government agencies help us better understand who we are as a people and how our economy and securities markets function. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The new&nbsp;<i>Registered Fund Statistics</i>&nbsp;report includes more than 70 data tables reflecting aggregated and anonymized public and non-public information filed on Form N-PORT. It is the first time the SEC has made such information public.</p>
<p>The new report builds on the aggregated data the SEC has been producing for the last decade. Since 2014, we have published quarterly aggregated trading information data, sourced from the Market Information Data Analytics System (MIDAS),<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-nport-report-04242024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;as well as monthly money market fund statistics.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-nport-report-04242024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">[8]</span></span></a>&nbsp;In 2015, we began publishing quarterly private fund statistics.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-nport-report-04242024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;Since 2022, we have been publishing data on the security-based swaps market twice a year.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-nport-report-04242024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p>In addition, the SEC has made data more accessible and usable.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-nport-report-04242024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;Since 2015, the Commission has published data sets from structured disclosures by individual registrants. Currently, the Commission publishes 12 such data sets, and we will begin publishing a Form N-PORT data set in the near future.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-nport-report-04242024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>
<p>Further, since 2021, the Commission has made available Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that provide public access to financial statements and other disclosures made by publicly traded companies.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-nport-report-04242024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p>Investors, issuers, economists, academics, and the public at large benefit from such regularly published economic data. The SEC also benefits from the feedback we receive on how to improve the accessibility and usefulness of aggregate data.</p>
<p>I want to thank the talented analytic and economic staff who have worked on the&nbsp;<i>Registered Fund Statistics&nbsp;</i>report so that the public can better understand the markets and broader economy, including:</p>

Summary:<br />
Nium and Thredd expand partnership to issue virtual cards in APAC, enabling efficient, secure, and cost-effective B2B travel payments. <div>
<p><a href="https://www.nium.com/" target="_blank">Nium</a>, the global leader in real-time cross-border payments, today announced the expansion of its partnership with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thredd.com/" target="_blank">Thredd</a>, a leading global payments processor, to issue virtual cards in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region.</p>
<p>Nium&rsquo;s virtual card solution is used by travel intermediaries to effectively pay hotels, airlines, and other global travel suppliers with enhanced security, efficiency, and reduced costs. The expansion comes as global B2B travel transaction volumes are projected to reach $1.7 trillion by 2027, according to Thredd&rsquo;s latest&nbsp;<a href="https://bit.ly/49NYmZq" target="_blank">report,</a>&nbsp;with the APAC region the fastest-growing market expected to reach $480 billion in the same year.</p>
<p>By integrating Thredd APIs into its single platform for instant global payments, Nium has been able speed up transactions to 200 milliseconds when issuing and loading virtual cards in nearly 30 countries worldwide. Certified by Visa and Mastercard to process credit, debit, and prepaid card transactions globally on one platform, via the partnership Thredd also enables Nium to increase acceptance rates and guarantee card scheme protection for its travel intermediary customers. Together, the fintech duo have issued 86 million virtual cards globally since 2018.</p>
<p>Powered by Thredd&rsquo;s global processing capabilities, Nium has successfully launched local issuing in Singapore as part of its strategic&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nium.com/newsroom/nium-expands-b2b-travel-payments" target="_blank">expansion</a>&nbsp;in B2B travel payments across APAC. In the last 12 months, Nium has doubled APAC travel customer revenue and seen a 75% increase in virtual card transaction volumes in the region.</p>
<p>&ldquo;APAC presents a substantial opportunity for global travel intermediaries that will in turn spur robust competition, a boon for consumers, and accelerated growth for the global travel ecosystem. Fuelling this unmistakeable growth is the rise of innovative B2B travel payment solutions, like that offered by Nium. Our long-standing collaboration is a great example of how fintech partnerships are propelling other industries forward,&rdquo;&nbsp;<b>said Jim McCarthy, CEO at Thredd.</b></p>
<p>&ldquo;With a world of travel options now available in the palm of your hand, travel intermediaries and their hotel partners are under&nbsp;increasing pressure to reduce costs whilst maintaining a compelling customer experience. Virtual card payments are a game-changer for the travel industry, enabling intermediaries to improve cash flow for their hotel partners, in turn driving better prices and deeper connections with consumers. With Thredd&rsquo;s technology, we can continue to meet the evolving needs of the travel ecosystem on a global scale, now and in the future,&rdquo;&nbsp;<b>said Spencer Hanlon, Global Head of Travel Payments at Nium.</b><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>Nium and Thredd were joined by Hong Kong-based payment platform TripLink on stage at Money 20/20 Asia, debating how China has impacted global travel trends in a fireside chat titled: &lsquo;Travel in China: The Next Big Niche?&rsquo; on Tuesday 23<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;April at 10am ICT in Bangkok.</p>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>ZERO13, the COP28 award-winning international carbon exchange, registry and aggregation hub ecosystem, part of GMEX group, is collaborating with Decarb.earth,<span>&nbsp;<a href="https://info.therealizationgroup.com/e3t/Ctc/I6+113/cWmHt04/VXg_tT2_FRJhW4XnVqF33KdcwW2dmkKk5dgfpdN1sYgYv3lYMRW69sMD-6lZ3l2W1R_kF95lc3B2N3PPf9X1L8FdW4s7kZr92L57yV8mq-D67k-R7W4FxNXZ8fGTwhV4Gl071yKNQnW30zY4b8lMVY8W4yxvm02Gh0_4W2YWL8F7KWzp0W37xGd957_BMNW5_Wjjc2DJRnhW6-Q4_68VM_mGW46V3dg85hJGKN15sTLzxl8wsW8vvNJL2GntrvW8TxK9q2M2WPSW41vLFf1ZsYrgV8pj186wzYCcF6ysj4YnS6cW6V7tBz5-3hgQd_r-sM04" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CarbonCX</a></span>&nbsp;and XTCC, to provide the world&rsquo;s first end-to-end digitally measured, reported and verified carbon credit distribution, trading and settlement solution for renewable energy projects.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The digital climate fintech platform-as-a-service recently enabled 14,591 carbon credits, including those from GoSolr (Pty) Ltd in South Africa, to be successfully distributed, traded and settled via ZERO13 on the SECDEX Marketplace for spot carbon credits and regulated securities markets via XTCC structured products.</span></p>
<p><span>The high-integrity voluntary carbon credit solution maximises market value and distribution in a way which instils trust by digitally verified provenance to address the issues of greenwashing and double-counting through:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Ecosystem connection via the<strong>&nbsp;ZERO13</strong>&nbsp;Asset Settlement Network (ASN) and Hub,</span></li>
<li><span>Project digitisation, data measurement, reporting and carbon credit generation by&nbsp;<strong>Decarb.earth</strong>,</span></li>
<li><span>Digital verification and registry by&nbsp;<strong>CarbonCX,</strong></span></li>
<li><span>Execution via the&nbsp;<strong>XTCC</strong>&nbsp;exchange-listed structured investment products,</span></li>
<li><span>Listings on regulated securities exchanges such as&nbsp;<strong>Deutsche Borse</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Vienna Stock Exchange&nbsp;</strong>and<strong>&nbsp;SECDEX</strong>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Hirander Misra, Chairman and CEO of GMEX Group and ZERO13,</strong>&nbsp;commented: &ldquo;With a multi-blockchain network-of-networks approach encompassing the diverse capabilities of our partners Decarb.earth, CarbonCX and XTCC, the ZERO13 ecosystem enables digital carbon credits, backed by smart contracts, to be officially accredited, issued, traded and settled to support the advancement of renewable energy technologies that are crucial for a sustainable future.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Marco Funk, CEO of Decarb.earth,</strong>&nbsp;added: &ldquo;There cannot be a just and swift energy transition without transparency. The carbon credit market has been fraught with controversies of low-quality credits and doubtful existence. In this context, working with ZERO13, we are absolutely delighted to offer this first of its kind fully digital end-to-end carbon credit solution for renewable energy projects. With these VCCs having now been credited, audited, verified, registered and sold, a low-carbon energy future - within time - looks ever more likely.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Dave Tims, Founder and Head of Strategy for CarbonCX Inc</strong>. said: &ldquo;CarbonCX is pleased to announce the completion of this first sale of digital carbon credits from African solar energy projects registered to its next-generation carbon credit platform. The sale occurred on the ZERO13 distribution platform into the SECDEX Marketplace, which is setting the global standard for&nbsp;efficient trading, exchange matching and real-time settlement of traditional and digital carbon credits.&nbsp;Working closely with ZERO13 and its industry-leading project partner, Decarb.earth, we are also setting&nbsp;the standard for data recording, security and transparency related to digital carbon credits in multiple regions.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Scott Levy, Founder of XTCC,</strong>&nbsp;said: &ldquo;Decarb.earth represents a perfect example of the circularity benefits which came from investing with XTCC.&nbsp;By creating liquidity for the high-integrity carbon credits, Decarb.earth will also be encouraged to further their efforts to deliver impact in the social housing sector for example. Measurable community benefits are crucial to investor confidence and transparency; XTCC, ZERO13 and Decarb.earth are a unique example of how connecting to the capital markets liquidity can transform lives.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>ZERO13 is an infrastructure-agnostic and cloud-native platform that ensures flexibility in deployment. Functioning as a decentralised hub, the ecosystem orchestrates workflows across multiple exchanges, participants, custodians, registries and climate fintech services. It seamlessly integrates digital monitoring, reporting and verification providers delivering real-time asset checks on carbon offset supplies and project provenance analysis. It also enables end-to-end multi-market distribution across multiple blockchains and APIs to ensure successful trading and settlement, interconnecting silos and addressing the inadequacies of the stand-alone voluntary carbon market (VCM) model.</span></p>
<p><span>Since its launch, ZERO13 has expanded its interoperable &lsquo;network of networks&rsquo; and grown its partnerships and customer base, bridging climate tech and climate fintech firms to over 60 participants, with continued rapid expansion and increased transaction flows through the platform and its associated network.&nbsp;</span></p>

<div> derivatives, commodities, trading volumes, IPO pipeline, revenue<br />
Summary:<br />HKEX's Q1 showed strong derivatives and commodities performance, high ADT for Connect programs, and new CEO appointment. Revenue slightly lower. <div>
<p>Bonnie Y CHAN, Chief Executive Officer said: HKEX demonstrated its strength and resilience in the first quarter of the year. Despite a fragile global backdrop, the Group&rsquo;s derivatives and commodities business performed strongly &ndash; the former achieving record quarterly volumes. Whilst the cash market reflected broader macro sentiment and remained soft, there was a notable uptick in Headline ADT in March and April, indicating growing investor confidence. The Connect programmes, including Northbound Stock Connect and Bond Connect, saw significant growth in trading volumes, with Bond Connect reaching a fresh record for the quarter. Recent initiatives announced by the China Securities Regulatory Commission, such as the expansion of eligible ETFs and the inclusion of Real Estate Investment Trusts in Stock Connect, the addition of RMB-denominated stocks in Southbound Stock Connect, as well as supporting leading Mainland companies to list in Hong Kong, will further elevate the attractiveness of Hong Kong&rsquo;s capital markets. Looking ahead, despite the prevailing backdrop, we are optimistic about HKEX&rsquo;s ability to capitalise on the long-term growth of China, the considerable opportunities to connect with the fastgrowing capital hubs of Southeast Asia and the Middle East, and the continuing exciting developments in technology in our industry and beyond.</p>
<h4>Strategic Highlights</h4>
<ul>
<li>Appointment of new Chief Executive Officer, Ms Bonnie Y Chan, with effect from 1 March 2024&nbsp;</li>
<li>Record quarterly high for ADV of derivatives contracts traded&nbsp;</li>
<li>Record quarterly high for ADT of Northbound Bond Connect&nbsp;</li>
<li>Record quarterly highs for OTC total clearing volume and clearing volume under Swap Connect&nbsp;</li>
<li>Introduction of Self-Match Prevention service in the Securities Market&nbsp;</li>
<li>IPO pipeline remained healthy with 85 active applications as at 31 March 2024&nbsp;</li>
<li>First batch of Covered Call ETFs launched&nbsp;</li>
<li>Announcement of new LME organisational design to enhance transparency, accountability, operational resilience and effectiveness&nbsp;</li>
<li>Average trading and clearing fee increment of 13 per cent, effective 1 January 2024, implemented by the LME and LME Clear&nbsp;</li>
<li>New Closing Price methodology for five major contracts implemented by the LME, bringing greater determinism, transparency and standardisation&nbsp;</li>
<li>List of funded projects under the HKEX Impact Funding Scheme 2023 announced by HKEX Foundation</li>
</ul>
<h4>Financial Highlights</h4>
<ul>
<li>Q1 2024 revenue and other income of $5,201 million was 6 per cent lower than Q1 2023 (a quarter which benefitted from the strong recovery of economic activity post-COVID), and was 7 per cent higher than Q4 2023:&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>Core business revenue was down 7 per cent against Q1 2023, reflecting lower trading and clearing fees from lower Headline ADT, lower net investment income from Margin Funds and Clearing House Funds, and lower listing fees. The decrease was partly offset by higher LME trading and clearing fees driven by both volume and fee increases.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Net investment income from Corporate Funds was $535 million (Q1 2023: $549 million), due to lower net fair value gains on the externally-managed investment funds (External Portfolio) (Q1 2024: $169 million; Q1 2023: $195 million).&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Operating expenses were 8 per cent higher than Q1 2023 (7 per cent lower than Q4 2023), attributable to higher staff costs, partly offset by lower professional fees and lower charitable donations made by HKEX Foundation.&nbsp;</li>
<li>EBITDA margin<sup>1</sup> was 72 per cent, 4 percentage points lower than Q1 2023 (4 percentage points higher than Q4 2023).&nbsp;</li>
<li>Profit attributable to shareholders was $2,970 million, 13 per cent lower than Q1 2023 (14 per cent higher than Q4 2023).</li>

<p>
<hr />
</p>
<ol>
<li>For the purposes of this announcement, EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest expenses and other finance costs, taxation, depreciation and amortisation. It excludes the Group&rsquo;s share of results of the joint ventures. EBITDA margin is calculated based on EBITDA divided by revenue and other income less transaction-related expenses. EBITDA and EBITDA margin are non-HKFRS measures used by management for monitoring business performance and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.</li>

<br />
SIFMA expresses concern over final FTC non-compete rule, appreciates exemptions for business sales and senior executives, worries about impact on competition and economy.
<br /><br />Summary: SIFMA expresses concerns over final FTC non-compete rule, appreciates exemptions, worries about impact on competition and economy, underestimation of compliance costs, lack of clear benefits. <div>
<p>SIFMA today issued the following statement from president and CEO Kenneth E. Bentsen, Jr. regarding the final Federal Trade Commission (FTC) non-compete rule:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are carefully reviewing the final rule released today and appreciate that the FTC carved out the sale of businesses and the existing agreements for senior executives. We however, remain concerned that the near-categorical prohibition on non-compete clauses would hurt competition and the economy by terminating long-established practices of using non-compete clauses to protect a business&rsquo;s sensitive information. The proposal also greatly underestimated its compliance costs, while failing to establish a clear record on its benefits or necessity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the supplement to this edition of the GGFI, we review the current and potential future of the hydrogen economy as an element of the transition to sustainable fuels, and in particular its use in industry and transport. Respondents to the GGFI survey predict that hydrogen is most likely to replace fossil fuels in steel production and the chemical industries.</p>
<p>We researched 127 financial centres for GGFI 13. The number of centres in the index has increased to 96 (94 in GGFI 12), with the addition of Lugano and Kaunas.

<p><strong><i>The Rt Hon The Lord Mayor Of London, Alderman Professor Michael Mainelli [on sabbatical from being Chairman of Z/Yen], said:</i></strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;Competition among leading financial centres in green finance is healthy. Gaps are closing as competition intensifies. It is great to see Montreal joining the top 10, another sign that green finance has spread from Europe worldwide. Looking forward, we expect to see progress on adaptation finance through continuing international cooperation, and new products particularly from the insurance and public debt markets.&rdquo;</p>

<div> SEF Confirmation Final Rule, temporal impossibility, block trades, CFTC staff, regulatory requirements <br />
Summary:<br /> 
Support for SEF Confirmation Final Rule resolving temporal impossibility, acknowledging CFTC staff relief, encouraging continuous improvement of regulatory frameworks. <div>
<p>I support the Final Rule on Swap Confirmation Requirements for Swap Execution Facilities (SEF Confirmation Final Rule) because it resolves the temporal impossibility of requiring SEF confirmations at the time of execution for block trades, which are in fact executed away from the SEF and then submitted to the SEF afterwards. I would like to thank Roger Smith, Nora Flood, and Vince McGonagle in the Division of Market Oversight for their work on the SEF Confirmation Final Rule.</p>
<p>Conflicting or impossible regulatory requirements can make compliance with our rules nonsensical.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement042324?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;That is clear from the years of CFTC staff no-action relief that led to the rule amendments codified today in the SEF Confirmation Final Rule.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement042324?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;I am pleased that the Commission has decided to fix an unworkable aspect of our existing rules, and encourage the Commission to continue to do so promptly when market participants identify these problems in the future. Continuous improvement of our regulatory frameworks, as appropriate, serves the public interest of well-functioning markets that are efficient and effective in providing risk management and price discovery.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Statement Of CFTC Commissioner Summer K. Mersinger In Support Of Final Rulemaking On Confirmation Requirements For Swap Execution Facilities</title>

<div> Rule 37.6(b), derivatives markets, no-action letters, swap execution facility, confirmations <br />
Summary: Commissioner criticizes over-reliance on staff no-action letters, cites example of burdensome rule, supports new rule amendments, advocates for more effective rulemaking processes. <br /> <div>
<p>Workable rules are essential to maintain the confidence of the American public in the integrity of our derivatives markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when we become aware that our rules are not as workable as we thought, or impose substantial operational burdens with little corresponding regulatory benefit, we should address these shortcomings promptly.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, though, the Commission sometimes chooses to &ldquo;kick the can down the road&rdquo; by relying on staff no-action letters instead &ndash; often for many years &ndash; without tackling the root cause of the problem in the rule itself.</p>
<p>I have not been shy about expressing my feelings related to no-action letters during my tenure as a Commissioner.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, there are appropriate reasons for staff to issue no-action letters, and I do see their utility in providing flexibility when needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I believe there has at times been an over-reliance on this practice at the agency, and we must move forward in a manner that respects the role of the Commissioners in agency policy-making.</p>
<p>My point is perfectly illustrated by Commission Rule 37.6(b) regarding confirmations for swaps executed on or pursuant to the rules of a swap execution facility (&ldquo;SEF&rdquo;).&nbsp;&nbsp;The rule requires that a SEF provide each counterparty to a transaction with a written record of all the terms of the transaction.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement042324?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;But things get complicated with respect to uncleared swaps, since the terms of such swaps also may include previously-negotiated agreements between the counterparties (such as an ISDA Master Agreement, and related Schedule and Credit Support Annex).</p>
<p>Accordingly, when the Commission adopted Rule 37.6(b) in 2013, it stated that a SEF&rsquo;s written confirmation of an uncleared swap can incorporate the terms of such agreements by reference, but with a catch &ndash; namely, that such agreements must be submitted to the SEF prior to execution.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement042324?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach imposed on each SEF the virtually impossible (and, frankly, needless) task of building and maintaining a library of every previous bilateral agreement from counterparties to uncleared swap transactions on its platform.</p>
<p>Recognizing the enormous operational problems posed by the Commission&rsquo;s approach to SEF swap confirmations for uncleared swaps, as well as the limited value of that approach, Commission staff issued four successive no-action letters beginning in 2014.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement042324?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3">[3]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it has taken a full decade, I am pleased that the Commission is finally adopting a permanent and practicable SEF confirmation solution. These rule amendments, among other things, will codify the existing staff no-action position that permits SEFs, in an uncleared swap confirmation, to incorporate by reference the terms of previously-negotiated counterparty agreements without obtaining the underlying agreements themselves.</p>
<p>I am pleased to support these rule amendments.&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank Roger Smith and his colleagues in the Division of Market Oversight, as well as staff in the Office of General Counsel and the Chief Economist&rsquo;s Office, for their work on this rulemaking.</p>
<p>But there remains more work to be done in this regard.&nbsp;&nbsp;I will continue to push the agency to act through notice-and-comment rulemaking, rather than relying on perpetual staff no-action relief, with respect to other rules that are not workable for those who must comply with them &ndash; especially where, as here, their asserted benefits are largely illusory.</p>

<div> amendments, uncleared swaps, confirmation requirements, SEFs, Commission regulations
Summary:
The Commission finalized amendments addressing uncleared swap confirmation requirements, allowing SEFs to incorporate terms by reference and clarify trade execution away from SEF or DCM. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>I am very pleased that the Commission voted to finalize necessary amendments to the Commission&rsquo;s regulations addressing longstanding issues with the uncleared swap confirmation requirements under Rule 37.6(b).&nbsp;&nbsp;During the initial implementation of part 37, SEFs informed the CFTC that the confirmation requirement for uncleared swaps was operationally and technologically difficult and impractical to implement.&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of these challenges, the Division of Market Oversight provided targeted no-action positions for SEFs with respect to certain provisions of Commission regulations throughout the last decade.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/behnamstatement042324?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a></p>
<p>As there was no workable solution that could effectuate the original language of the relevant rule, the Commission&nbsp;has voted to amend Rule 37.6(b) to codify the longstanding staff no-action position.&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment enables SEFs to incorporate terms by reference in an uncleared swap confirmation without being required to obtain the underlying, previously negotiated agreements between the counterparties.&nbsp;&nbsp;An amendment to Rule 23.501 will clarify the consistent treatment of trades executed away from a SEF or designated contract market (DCM) and permit confirmation of all terms of a swap transaction as soon as technologically practicable following execution, as opposed to requiring confirmation &ldquo;at the same time as execution.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/behnamstatement042324?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2">[2]</a></p>
<p>This final rule is an example of my continuing focus on providing market participants with clarity and certainty by, where possible, codifying existing staff no-action positions.</p>

<div> Dodd-Frank Act, Final Rule, SEFs, swap confirmation, regulation
Summary:<br /><br />The Final Rule approves swap confirmation requirements for SEFs under the Dodd-Frank Act, allowing incorporation of previously-negotiated agreements and maintaining oversight. <div>
<p>An essential component of the&nbsp;Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) is its framework for the regulation of swaps, including central clearing and trade execution requirements, registration and comprehensive regulation of swap dealers, and recordkeeping and reporting requirements.</p>
<p>I vote to approve today&rsquo;s final rule on Swap Confirmation Requirements for Swap Execution Facilities (Final Rule), which&nbsp;facilitates predictability and consistency in swaps markets by codifying long-standing no-action relief into regulation, while maintaining a robust regulatory regime for swaps and swap execution facilities (SEFs).</p>
<p>The Dodd-Frank Act amended the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) by adding Section 5h, which provides that a person may not operate &ldquo;a facility for the trading or processing of swaps unless the facility is registered as a [SEF] or as a designated contract market.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement042324?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;A SEF&nbsp;allows multiple participants to execute or trade swaps. As such, SEFs&nbsp;facilitate swap transactions in our markets by facilitating the execution of swaps between market participants. Additionally, SEFs play a critical role in price discovery and transparency and policing and reporting swap transactions in an effort to monitor systemic risk.</p>
<p>In 2013, the Commission adopted new rules and principles for SEFs. Under CFTC Regulation 37.6(b), a SEF must provide each counterparty to cleared and uncleared swaps with &ldquo;a written record of all of the terms of the transaction which shall legally supersede any previous agreement and serve as a confirmation of the transaction.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement042324?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;This confirmation is required to &ldquo;take place at the same time as execution,&rdquo; subject to certain exceptions related to bunched orders involving swaps.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement042324?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3">[3]</a></p>
<p>In the adopting release, the Commission noted that a SEF may comply with the swap confirmation requirement for uncleared swaps by incorporating terms set forth in master agreements previously negotiated by counterparties, if such agreements had been submitted to the SEF prior to execution and the counterparties ensure that nothing in the confirmation terms contradict the terms incorporated from the master agreement.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement042324?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4">[4]</a>&nbsp;SEFs and market participants voiced concerns that it was operationally and technologically difficult and impracticable to obtain and store the underlying, bespoke, highly-negotiated swap agreements of SEF members for purposes of satisfying the swap confirmation requirement.</p>
<p>Pursuant to a no-action letter issued in March 2017,&nbsp;which was the last extension of a no-action letter originally issued in August 2014,<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement042324?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5">[5]</a>&nbsp;SEFs were permitted to incorporate by reference the terms of previously-negotiated agreements and were relieved of the obligation to: (1) obtain documents incorporated by reference in a swap confirmation and (2) report confirmation data contained in such agreements. SEFs were required to comply with certain additional conditions, including that their rulebooks require participants to provide copies of the underlying agreements to the SEF upon request.</p>
<p>On August 25, 2023, the Commission released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to codify this no-action relief (Proposed Rule) for uncleared swaps. The Commission did not incorporate the conditions in No-Action Letter 17-17 into new CFTC Regulation 37.6(b)(1). The Commission takes the view that, as noted below, the existing requirements for SEFs under the CEA, particularly Core Principle 5, and the Commission&rsquo;s Part 37 regulations sufficiently account for and obviate the need for these conditions.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement042324?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6">[6]</a></p>
<p>As I noted at that time, the Commission &ldquo;issued guidance and exemptive relief based on concerns that SEFs had been unable to develop a practicable and cost-effective method to request, accept, and maintain a library of the underlying previously negotiated freestanding agreements between counterparties.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement042324?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7">[7]</a></p>
<p>The Final Rule approved today fully adopts the Proposed Rule. In addition to permitting SEFs to incorporate by reference terms of previously-negotiated agreements between counterparties, without having to obtain a copy of such agreements, the Final Rule will amend CFTC Regulation 37.6(b) to permit confirmation of all terms of a swap transaction to take place &ldquo;as soon as technologically practicable&rdquo; after the execution of the swap transaction. Additionally, the Final Rule amends CFTC Regulation 37.6(b) to make clear that the confirmation a SEF provides under CFTC Regulation 37.6(b) legally supersedes&nbsp;<i>only conflicting terms</i>&nbsp;in a previous agreement.</p>
<p>Importantly, as noted above, both SEFs and the Commission will retain the ability to obtain essential information, including copies of the underlying agreements for uncleared swaps. Under SEF Core Principle 5, a SEF must &ldquo;[e]stablish and enforce rules that will allow the facility to obtain any necessary information to perform any of the functions described in section 5h of the [CEA].&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement042324?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8">[8]</a>&nbsp;The SEF must also &ldquo;[p]rovide [this] information to the Commission on request.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement042324?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9">[9]</a>&nbsp;A SEF must also have &ldquo;the authority to examine books and records kept by [its] members and by persons under investigation.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement042324?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10">[10]</a>&nbsp;As the Final Rule notes, given these requirements, a SEF should have &ldquo;the ability and authority to request copies of the underlying agreements that are incorporated by reference into a confirmation for an uncleared swap transaction and to provide such agreements to the Commission upon request.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement042324?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11">[11]</a></p>
<p>I support this Final Rule, which provides a practical approach to implementing our regulatory requirements, while maintaining robust oversight of SEFs and our markets.</p>
<p>Thank you to the staff of the Division of Market Oversight and Roger Smith as well as the Office of the General Counsel, the Market Participants Division, and the Office of the Chief Economist, for their hard work on this Final Rule.</p>

Summary: SIFMA president and CEO Kenneth E. Bentsen, Jr. is examining the final DOL fiduciary rule, which conflicts with existing securities regulation and may limit investor access to advice and education. <div>
<p>SIFMA today issued the following statement from president and CEO Kenneth E. Bentsen, Jr. regarding the final Department of Labor (DOL) fiduciary rule:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are closely examining the details of the final rule released today. As proposed, the rule conflicted with existing federal securities regulation &ndash; specifically Regulation Best Interest &ndash; and would likely limit investors&rsquo; access to advice and education. Stakeholders have been quite explicit on the need to address these conflicts and we will be reviewing the conflict-related text as well as other relevant text on the material flaws we raised in our comments.&rdquo;</p>

<div> Final rules, amendment, SEF regulations, swap confirmation, CFTC

Summary:
The CFTC approved final rules amending SEF regulations regarding uncleared swap confirmations, addressing no-action letters, incorporating terms by reference, and making technical changes.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approved final rules to amend its swap execution facility (SEF) regulations related to uncleared swap confirmations to address issues which have been addressed in CFTC staff no-action letters, including the most recent CFTC No Action Letter No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/csl/17-17/download">17-17</a>, as well as associated conforming and technical changes.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In particular, the final rules amend CFTC Regulation 37.6(b) to enable SEFs to incorporate terms of underlying, previously negotiated agreements between the counterparties by reference in an uncleared swap confirmation without being required to obtain such underlying, previously negotiated agreements.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Further, the final rules amend CFTC Regulation 37.6(b) to require such confirmation to take place &ldquo;as soon as technologically practicable&rdquo; after the execution of the swap transaction on the SEF for both cleared and uncleared swap transactions. The final rules also amend CFTC Regulation 37.6(b) to make clear the SEF-provided confirmation under CFTC Regulation 37.6(b) shall legally supersede any conflicting terms in a previous agreement, rather than the entire agreement.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In addition, the final rules make conforming amendments to CFTC Regulation 23.501(a)(4)(i) to correspond with the amendments to CFTC Regulation 37.6(b). Finally, the final rules make certain non-substantive amendments to CFTC Regulation 37.6(a)-(b) to enhance clarity.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The final rules are effective 30 days after publication in the Federal Register. Upon the effective date of the final rules, CFTC No Action Letter No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/csl/17-17/download">17-17</a>&nbsp;will expire.</span></span></p>

<h4>Speech</h4>
<p>Hello everyone. It is a great pleasure to be with you here today. Thank you very much to UK finance for hosting this event, my first as Executive Director for ARTIS. For those of you who don't know me, or that acronym, I'm Rebecca Jackson, and I&rsquo;m the Executive Director for the PRA&rsquo;s Authorisations, RegTech, and International Supervision Directorate, otherwise known as ARTIS. In this role I&rsquo;m responsible for &ndash; among other things &ndash; the supervision of the banks and designated investment firms that operate in the UK but are headquartered abroad, and it&rsquo;s in that capacity that I&rsquo;m speaking to you today.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m new to this role, I&rsquo;m not entirely new to the world of private equity. Some time ago &ndash; in 2006 &ndash; I wrote a lengthy discussion paper on this very topic &ndash; the Financial Services Authorities&rsquo; DP06/06, if you&rsquo;re interested. And a lot has changed since then. The FSA was replaced by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority. Our personal lives have been transformed by new technology, such as iPhones, social media and ubiquitous connectivity. And the private equity market has changed a huge amount, driven by innovations in banking and finance that while lower profile, may be no less significant. It&rsquo;s those developments in the private equity sector, and their implications for banks&rsquo; safety and soundness, about which I&rsquo;ll be talking to you today.</p>
<h4>Market developments</h4>
<p>Describing any activity in high finance as &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; has always felt like somewhat of a misnomer to me, as if &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; private equity finance was once conducted alongside hand weaving, or blacksmithing. But to the extent &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; private equity markets have ever existed &ndash; and arguably they have, in the form of 13<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century rentiering - a lot has happened to those traditions even since 2006.</p>
<p>First, private equity as an asset class has grown significantly, particularly over the past decade. Global assets under management have grown from around $2 trillion dollars in 2012<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/rebecca-jackson-speech-uk-finance-on-private-equity-focused-thematic-review#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;to around $8 trillion in 2023<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/rebecca-jackson-speech-uk-finance-on-private-equity-focused-thematic-review#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[2]</a></sup>&nbsp;- an annual growth rate of just over 13%. And when I last wrote about private equity, the global fund-raising record was $15.6bn<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/rebecca-jackson-speech-uk-finance-on-private-equity-focused-thematic-review#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[3]</a></sup>. Now, the record stands at almost twice that &ndash; a $29bn fund raised by CVC, in July 2023.</p>
<p>Second, there has been a Cambrian explosion in the variety and complexity of financing products that banks now provide to the private equity industry. When I wrote about the topic in 2006, funds generally weren&rsquo;t leveraged<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/rebecca-jackson-speech-uk-finance-on-private-equity-focused-thematic-review#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[4]</a></sup>, at least not at the fund level. Rather, banks provided financing by facilitating loans and bonds through the capital markets, on behalf of the companies that funds own - portfolio companies - to finance acquisitions and refinance debt.</p>
<p>But since then, this lending to portfolio companies &lsquo;downstream&rsquo; of the fund level has been joined by a material increase in &lsquo;upstream&rsquo; lending, which has recourse to the investors and managers of funds, as well as novel forms of leverage through &lsquo;midstream&rsquo; lending, to the funds that own portfolio companies. Here we see the emergence of complex structures and &lsquo;leverage on leverage&rsquo;, including Net Asset Value (NAV) loans secured by fund assets, which provide leverage to funds against already leveraged portfolio companies. Growth in secured financing facilities, for example, backed by Limited Partner interests, has also been a notable trend. This increase in complexity has been driven by a range of factors, including investors seeking exits from illiquid long-term private assets as Initial Public Offer markets remain weak.</p>
<p>Finally, we have seen the emergence of private credit funds, who both raise financing from banks in a mutually beneficial relationship and compete directly with them to provide both traditional and non-traditional forms of leverage. Competition is the mother of invention, one might say, and we think this competition may be an important driver of the new forms of bank lending that we&rsquo;ve seen. But while such competition has a role to play in ensuring that borrowers can access the funding they need, competition in any market tends to affect the price and quality of whatever is offered in that market, and sometimes not for the better.</p>
<p>The overall result of these developments is that exposures and revenues in banks have grown considerably over this period, as banks charge fees for arranging a variety of transactions and earn interest on the financing they provide.</p>
<p>But reward does not come without risk, so you can see why in August last year, the PRA decided that the scale, breadth, complexity, and interconnectedness of banks&rsquo; private equity related exposures, warranted closer attention. So we conducted a thematic review of these businesses, to assess the adequacy of banks&rsquo; risk management frameworks. And leveraging our role as the world&rsquo;s largest host supervisor, this review covered the exposures and risk management practices of a large cross section of major UK and international banks that have material aggregate exposures to the sector, and also involved other regulators from across the globe. Today I&rsquo;ll be summarising the findings and recommendations of that review, ahead of a Dear CRO letter that we&rsquo;ll be publishing on our website today and sending to the CROs of participating banks, while yesterday my colleague Nat Benjamin covered the macro-prudential implications of these developments.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The finding that I would like to focus on today is that only a very small number of banks can consistently aggregate data in a manner that is appropriate to their exposures to the private equity sector. There were gaps, and often significant gaps, identified in most of the frameworks that we assessed. Nevertheless, there is a great deal of variation across firms, with some demonstrating significantly more developed practices and having clear remediation plans for gaps, while at the other extreme, some firms had almost no ability to aggregate data or even appreciate its crucial importance. Given how the private equity market has developed over the past decade, this isn&rsquo;t terribly surprising &ndash; though it is disappointing.</p>
<h4>Data aggregation and holistic risk management</h4>
<p>Fund managers, investors, and portfolio companies now have very sophisticated and varied needs for both hedging and financing, and their engagement with banks has naturally become more complex as a result.</p>
<p>Many different parts of a bank&rsquo;s business can now touch the sector, not only across different business lines within a division, but also across different divisions within a group. For example, wealth management or corporate banking divisions might offer subscription financing lines; investment banking units may originate leveraged financing underwriting exposures; corporate banking units may hold leveraged loan portfolios; and global markets units might provide derivatives hedging solutions and, in some cases, secured financing facilities too. If that sounded confusing and complex, that&rsquo;s because it is.</p>
<p>This fragmentation in business activity is mirrored by a fragmentation in the view that risk management and control functions have of the associated risks. Counterparty and credit risk functions are usually organised by industry sector, counterparty type, underlying collateral class, or product. And this arrangement makes sense, as it enables the development of business and risk management expertise. But it doesn&rsquo;t readily support the holistic risk management of private equity linked exposures that are generated across separate business units and legal entities.</p>
<p>Our review found that many banks are unable to uniquely identify and systematically aggregate or measure their combined credit and counterparty risk exposures to the private equity sector. And even though a small number of banks have made good progress in identifying and measuring their overall exposures across business lines, most of those banks still did not calculate consolidated exposure amounts for individual financial sponsors or have a risk appetite framework that constrained the size of exposures linked to individual financial sponsors.</p>
<p>In short, banks cannot holistically identify, measure, manage, or monitor the risks emanating from their private equity financing businesses. And this is despite the emphasis that the PRA has repeatedly placed on holistic risk management for some time now, particularly since the default of Archegos Capital Management, and despite the existence of BCBS principles on effective risk data aggregation and risk reporting, that were issued over 10 years ago.</p>
<p>The reason this business needs to be managed holistically is that the exposures it generates may become highly correlated with one another under certain conditions. The performance of a fund is correlated with the performance of its portfolio companies. In turn, the performance of a sponsor is correlated with the performance of its funds. And the performance of legally separate portfolio companies and separate funds is correlated not only with the markets in which they operate and invest, but with broader macro factors such as interest rates and general economic conditions. The prospective correlations are everywhere, and it&rsquo;s not difficult to imagine a scenario, such as malpractice at a financial sponsor or the bankruptcy of multiple portfolio companies, where risk correlations increase significantly, and liquidity evaporates, leaving banks open to severe, unexpected losses. This is a systemic risk too, and one that Nat covered in more detail yesterday.</p>
<p>These findings have two implications that we will also touch upon in our dear CRO letter, in relation to stress testing, and governance.</p>
<h4>Stress testing and Board engagement</h4>
<p>On stress testing, unfortunately I do not have a huge amount to say. Not because we found that firms are excellent at it, or because we think it&rsquo;s unimportant, but because we found that hardly any banks do it well in this context. Very few firms carry out routine, bespoke and comprehensive stress testing for aggregate sponsor related exposures. Most other banks &ndash; as a result of the issues I&rsquo;ve just highlighted &ndash; have not developed comprehensive frameworks, or carry out disaggregated and uncoordinated stress tests solely in individual business unit or product silos.</p>
<p>This is a clear corollary of the findings that I have just outlined. It&rsquo;s hard to conduct a holistic stress test without holistic data. But data aggregation is not the only issue at play. We also found a creeping sense of complacency among firms, especially in relation to the large and growing business of subscription financing, due to a lack of loss history in this type of business. While this means that stress analysis based upon historical performance may not be useful, the lack of a loss history should not preclude other approaches or a thoughtful consideration of what could happen, based on the structural characteristics of this business.</p>
<p>Finally, our findings on Board engagement are also a consequence of our findings on data aggregation. At many firms, there is a notable lack of board level engagement with this business. Even firms with some ability to aggregate private equity exposures had not considered the scale and composition of the risks relative to the overall risk profile of their bank, and many boards have not specifically been informed of the overall scale of their firm&rsquo;s combined exposures linked to the sector, or to individual private equity firms or sponsors.</p>
<p>The overall risk here is that when banks fail to properly measure and assess their aggregate exposures, and in the absence of a defined risk appetite framework and board engagement, it&rsquo;s very easy to develop an outsized and concentrated exposure that leaves one open to the risk of a large loss. And the risk of outsized, illiquid, and unintentionally concentrated exposures is something that we have been pointing out for some time now, and for which we have very little patience.</p>
<h4>How might this risk be addressed?</h4>
<p>How might banks go about addressing this risk? For a start, trade capture and risk management systems should ensure that transaction, exposure, and collateral information is assigned the right metadata. This data is what risk managers require to be able to identify private equity exposures, wherever they may be. And when done right, this is what would allow banks to calculate and monitor not only their exposures linked to individual fund managers, funds, and companies, but also their overall consolidated direct and indirect exposures to the sector as a whole.</p>
<p>Credit and counterparty risk due diligence procedures and management information processes should also recognise where there are overlapping credit exposures, collateral pledges, and financial claims, across the full range of private equity related exposures.</p>
<p>These are important factors to consider when exposures are layered as they are in private equity, and when performance and recovery values are often interlinked. For example, where a bank has a derivatives receivable from a portfolio company, and also provides NAV financing to the fund that owns the portfolio company, the credit risks of both contracts are indirectly linked. The NAV financing facility is secured against a component of collateral that is effectively subordinated to the banks&rsquo; own derivatives receivable claim. And where banks also provide limited partner interest financing to investors in the same fund, the value of the collateral backing this facility would, in turn, be affected, adding a further layer of complexity to credit risk analysis.</p>
<p>On stress testing, well, you should do it. It should be a routine part of your toolkit. And when doing so it&rsquo;s crucial to consider the potential for higher than previously observed default and loss correlations during periods of stress, for all types of exposures linked to the private equity sector. Given the changes to the sector in recent years, and its now macroeconomic importance, it would be frankly foolish to assume that low historical loss rates and correlations will still be meaningful in a world in which they matter. Stress tests should also reflect the highly idiosyncratic risk profile that private equity linked financing structures and hedges can create, both individually and in aggregate, and they should actually be useful for managing counterparty and credit risk exposures linked to individual sponsors or funds.</p>
<p>And last but not least, board engagement is key. For a business that is such a large contributor to the bottom line of many banks, let alone their risk profile, it would be remiss of boards not to be informed of their firms&rsquo; aggregate exposures, and to actively consider the overall business strategy of their group in relation to the sector and their related risk appetite.</p>
<p>We understand that this is difficult. Boards need data to inform such decisions. But data preparation is hard, because historically, most banks haven&rsquo;t flagged exposures as linked to private equity. So downstream risk systems can&rsquo;t aggregate data automatically, and banks need to go about manually identifying relevant exposures in order to aggregate them &ndash; a time consuming and inefficient process. This lack of data impedes the production of dynamic and timely risk reports, and instead, banks are more likely to aggregate exposures as part of one-off periodic exercises &ndash; in response to regulatory thematic reviews, for example. And even when risk exposures can be aggregated, there comes the tricky question of how to aggregate various different exposure measures in a way that is conceptually valid. That too is an extremely tricky task.</p>
<p>But the most forward-thinking firms have realised that aggregating data isn&rsquo;t just a matter of good risk management, it&rsquo;s good for the first line too. The same systems that are used to identify exposures and risks can also be used to identify client touchpoints, doing double duty for both the first line of defence and the second. The challenge for the second line will then be their ability to set exposure limits and constrain what is and will continue to be a materially capital generative revenue stream.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>The strong growth and attractive return profile of private equity over the last 10 years has emerged during a period of relatively benign market, economic and liquidity conditions for the sector. Though the economy has seen some major bumps in the road, particularly during covid, we have avoided extended market and economic downturns. While of course this is a very good thing, it does mean that the sector remains untested. Yet the trends that this review has identified; of creeping leverage, large exposures, complicated structures, and poor risk aggregation, all suggest that banks may not be prepared for such a test, if or when it emerges.</p>
<p>And there is the broader and longer-term question of whether developments in the industry constitute a &lsquo;displacement&rsquo; &ndash; a change in the macro environment or &lsquo;technology&rsquo; of Banking, that would be a necessary albeit not sufficient condition for more systemic issues to emerge.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/rebecca-jackson-speech-uk-finance-on-private-equity-focused-thematic-review#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>In any event, the need for significant improvements in risk management is clear, and it&rsquo;s clear that these need to happen now; it&rsquo;s better, as Shakespeare said, to be 3 hours too soon than a minute too late.</p>

<title>NYSE Surveys Wall Street On 24/7 Stock Trading</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/nyse-surveys-wall-street-on-247-stock-trading/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/nyse-surveys-wall-street-on-247-stock-trading/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> NYSE, 24/7 trading, SEC, retail investing, cryptocurrency<br />
Summary:<br />
NYSE considering 24/7 trading. Driven by crypto markets and retail investing. SEC oversight, concerns on liquidity, settlement risks, and staffing.<br /> <div>
<p>The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is currently engaging market participants in discussions about the potential benefits of transitioning to 24/7 stock trading. This move comes as regulatory bodies examine an application for establishing the first round-the-clock exchange. Conducted by the NYSE's data analytics team, a subsidiary of the Intercontinental Exchange, this survey explores the burgeoning interest in facilitating overnight trades of major stocks like Nvidia or Apple, mainly between 8 pm and 4 am Eastern time.</p>
<p>This interest has been sparked by several factors, including the continuous operation of cryptocurrency markets and a surge in retail investing prompted by COVID-19 lockdowns. Traditionally, stock exchanges have lagged behind other significant markets&mdash;such as US Treasuries, major currencies, and leading stock index futures&mdash;adopting continuous trading from Monday through Friday.</p>
<p>Retail brokers like Robinhood and Interactive Brokers have already offered 24-hour weekday trading for US stocks. These trades are matched internally or executed through "dark pool" trading platforms like Blue Ocean, popular with Asian retail investors during daytime hours. However, an overnight exchange would represent a significant evolution in late trading practices due to its stringent regulatory oversight, in contrast to the less regulated dark pools.</p>
<p>US exchanges operate under the direct supervision of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), requiring rigorous testing for stability and security and approvals for any rule changes. Additionally, exchange trades are included in the official consolidated "tape" of trading prices, thus potentially influencing the opening trends for regular trading hours.</p>
<p>The NYSE's survey probes into whether continuous trading should extend over weekends and weekdays, how to safeguard investors from volatility, staffing for overnight sessions, and if focusing on overnight trading might detract from traditional market hours. This inquiry coincides with 24 Exchange's bid for SEC approval to launch a 24/7 exchange following a previous withdrawal due to operational challenges.</p>
<p>As the SEC reviews the proposal, the future of overnight trading remains uncertain, with discussions on who would bear the costs and how trades would be settled outside traditional operating hours. Despite some scepticism regarding liquidity and settlement risks, especially from institutional investors, there is a clear interest in exploring 24-hour trading, albeit with considerations like staffing and management of out-of-hours events.</p>
<p>The move towards a 24/7 trading environment reflects a broader shift towards accommodating global trading demands and the evolving preferences of modern investors, suggesting a significant transformation in how stock exchanges operate and how investors engage with the market.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>

<div> coordination, cyber incident, financial sector, G7, resilience<br />
The G7 Cyber Expert Group conducted a cross-border cyber coordination exercise to strengthen response capabilities and minimize disruptions in the financial sector.<br /><br />Summary: In the event of a cyber incident, the G7 Cyber Expert Group aims to enhance coordination, resilience, and information sharing across financial authorities to minimize disruptions. <div>
<p>The G7 Cyber Expert Group completed a cross-border coordination exercise on 17 April 2024. G7 authorities routinely exercise to ensure they can effectively coordinate and communicate their response in the event of a widespread cyber incident affecting the financial system.</p>
<p>The primary objective of the exercise was to strengthen the ability of G7 financial authorities in effectively communicating and coordinating their respective responses to facilitate crisis management in the event of a significant cross-border cyber incident affecting the financial sector. The exercise built on previous simulations and workshops, which focused on cyber incident response, recovery management, and crisis communication.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This exercise is another critical opportunity for us to work with our G7 partners in our ongoing effort to combat cyberattacks,&rdquo; commented Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo. &ldquo;These simulations help strengthen the global financial system by ensuring that G7 countries are able to effectively coordinate and respond in the event of a crisis.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>To optimize coordination among G7 financial authorities, the exercise assumed a large-scale cyber attack on financial market infrastructures and entities in all G7 jurisdictions. The exercise brought together 23 financial authorities, including ministries of finance, central banks, bank supervisors, and market authorities, as well as private industry participants.</p>
<p>By conducting such exercises, the G7 Cyber Expert Group aims to bolster the financial sector&rsquo;s resilience and minimise disruptions across all G7 jurisdictions. This exercise allows the G7 financial authorities to continue to integrate the multiple lines of effort necessary to respond effectively to an incident.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an ever-changing and interconnected world, cross-border coordination, incident response preparedness, and information exchanges remain G7 priorities. The G7 Cyber Expert Group continuously collaborates on cybersecurity and stands ready to respond to cyber threats posed to the financial system.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span>About the G7 Cyber Expert Group&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p>The G7 Cyber Expert Group coordinates cybersecurity policy and strategy across the G7 jurisdictions. The G7 Cyber Expert Group seeks to improve the cyber resiliency of the financial sector through preparedness, a consensus of the threat landscape, and a shared approach to mitigating risk and to this end has published various sets of Fundamental Elements, e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/216/G7-FUNDAMENTAL-ELEMENTS-OF-RANSOMWARE-RESILIENCE-FOR-THE-FINANCIAL-SECTOR.pdf">G7 Fundamental Elements of Ransomware Resilience for the Financial Sector</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/216/G7-FUNDAMENTAL-ELEMENTS-FOR-THIRD-PARTY-CYBER-RISK.pdf">G7 Fundamental Elements for Third Party Cyber Risk Management in the Financial Sector.</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/international/g-7-and-g-20/g7-cyber-expert-group">More information about the G7 Cyber Expert Group and publications can be found&nbsp;here</a>.</p>

<p><span>Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures</span></p>
<p>In this news release, the company supplements its reporting of information determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;), such as revenue, operating income, operating margin, net income attributable to Fiserv, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, with &ldquo;adjusted revenue,&rdquo; &ldquo;adjusted revenue growth,&rdquo; &ldquo;organic revenue,&rdquo; &ldquo;organic revenue growth,&rdquo; &ldquo;adjusted operating income,&rdquo; &ldquo;adjusted operating margin,&rdquo; &ldquo;adjusted net income,&rdquo; &ldquo;adjusted earnings per share,&rdquo; &ldquo;adjusted earnings per share growth,&rdquo; and &ldquo;free cash flow.&rdquo; Management believes that adjustments for certain non-cash or other items and the exclusion of certain pass-through revenue and expenses should enhance shareholders' ability to evaluate the company&rsquo;s performance, as such measures provide additional insights into the factors and trends affecting its business. Therefore, the company excludes these items from its GAAP financial measures to calculate these unaudited non-GAAP measures. The corresponding reconciliations of these unaudited non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in this news release, except for forward-looking measures where a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available due to the variability, complexity and limited visibility of the non-cash and other items described below that are excluded from the non-GAAP outlook measures. See pages 14-16 for additional information regarding the company&rsquo;s forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures.</p>
<p>Examples of non-cash or other items may include, but are not limited to, non-cash intangible asset amortization expense associated with acquisitions; non-cash impairment charges; severance costs; net charges associated with debt financing activities; merger and integration costs; gains or losses from the sale of businesses, certain assets or investments; and certain discrete tax benefits and expenses. The company excludes these items to more clearly focus on the factors management believes are pertinent to the company&rsquo;s operations, and management uses this information to make operating decisions, including the allocation of resources to the company&rsquo;s various businesses.</p>
<p>The company adjusts its non-GAAP results to exclude amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets as such amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions. Management believes that the adjustment of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization supplements GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the comparability of operating performance. Although the company excludes amortization from acquisition-related intangible assets from its non-GAAP expenses, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation.</p>
<p>Management believes organic revenue growth is useful because it presents adjusted revenue growth excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions, dispositions and the company&rsquo;s postage reimbursements. Management believes free cash flow is useful to measure the funds generated in a given period that are available for debt service requirements and strategic capital decisions. Management believes this supplemental information enhances shareholders&rsquo; ability to evaluate and understand the company&rsquo;s core business performance.</p>
<p>These unaudited non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, revenue, operating income, operating margin, net income attributable to Fiserv, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities or any other amount determined in accordance with GAAP.</p>

Management believes that the adjustment of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the comparability of operating performance. Although the company excludes amortization from acquisition-related intangible assets from its non-GAAP expenses, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Any future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets.</p>

<p>Reconciliations of unaudited non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in this news release, except for forward-looking measures where a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available due to the variability, complexity and limited visibility of these items that are excluded from the non-GAAP outlook measures. The company&rsquo;s forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures for 2024, including organic revenue growth, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share growth, are designed to enhance shareholders&rsquo; ability to evaluate the company&rsquo;s performance by excluding certain items to focus on factors and trends affecting its business.</p>
<p><i>Organic Revenue Growth&nbsp;</i>- The company's organic revenue growth outlook for 2024 excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions, dispositions and the impact of the company's postage reimbursements. The currency impact is measured as the increase or decrease in the expected adjusted revenue for the period by applying prior period foreign currency exchange rates to present a constant currency comparison to prior periods.</p>

<p><i>Adjusted Earnings Per Share</i>&nbsp;- The company's adjusted earnings per share outlook for 2024 excludes certain non-cash or other items such as non-cash intangible asset amortization expense associated with acquisitions; non-cash impairment charges; non-cash pension plan termination charges; merger and integration costs; severance costs; gains or losses from the sale of businesses, certain assets and investments; and certain discrete tax benefits and expenses. The company estimates that amortization expense in 2024 with respect to acquired intangible assets will decrease approximately 10% compared to the amount incurred in 2023.</p>
<p>Other adjustments to the company&rsquo;s financial measures that were incurred in 2023 and for the three months ended March 31, 2024 are presented in this news release; however, they are not necessarily indicative of adjustments that may be incurred in the remainder of 2024 or beyond.

<title>TradeTech Europe 2024: More Than A Third Of Sell-Side Firms That Are Investing In Blockchain Are Prioritising Trading Operations, Says Broadridge</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Blockchain, AI, Cybersecurity, Legacy systems, Sell-side firms
Summary:
- Blockchain investment to rise by 21%
- AI to transform customer experience, DLT to reduce intermediaries
- Cybersecurity top priority
- Legacy systems hold back digital transformation
- End clients to benefit from technology advancements
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>To mark the start of TradeTech Europe 2024, global fintech Broadridge has released an exclusive cut of its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.broadridge.com/2024-digital-transformation-study" target="_blank">2024 Digital Transformation and Next-Gen Tech Study</a>&nbsp;to reveal the latest trends and attitudes towards next-gen technologies across sell-side firms.</p>
<p>The findings, which canvas the views of 130 sell-side firms including commercial and investment banks, broker-dealers, and universal banks globally with total assets ranging from $1bn to more than $250bn, highlight four key themes:</p>
<p><b>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><b>Blockchain investment is on the rise</b></p>
<p>Firms are planning to increase investment in blockchain by 21% on average over the next two years. Of those investing, more than a third (37%) are currently prioritising their blockchain investment in trading, transactions and loans. This figure is expected to jump to 42% in the next two years. A similar number of respondents (44%) say they plan to prioritise blockchain investment in operations, including clearing and settlement in the next 2 years.</p>
<p><b>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><b>AI will transform customer experience and DLT will reduce the need for intermediaries</b></p>
<p>Half of sell-side firms believe that their strategy and business approach will be radically transformed by technology in the next 5 years. More than a third (38%) say that blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) will reduce the need for financial intermediaries, including custodians and clearing houses. End customers will be the winner with more than three quarters of executives (77%) saying they believe that AI will lead to a significant improvement in the customer experience.</p>
<p><b>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><b>Cyber security is the top priority</b></p>
<p>When asked what the most important things firms want from technology vendors are when it comes to digital transformation, the most popular response (50%) is to ensure their solutions are fully cyber secure. Thirty five percent want providers to launch entirely new solutions that use next-gen technology. A third said they want solutions that integrate easily with existing systems, and more than a quarter (28%) want vendors to build next-gen technology into their existing solutions.</p>
<p><b>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><b>Legacy systems continue to hold the sell side back</b></p>
<p>The top challenges inhibiting digital transformation across the sell side include cybersecurity risks (36%), skill shortages (32%) and insufficient budgets (32%). A quarter of firms (25%) are being held back by inflexible legacy systems and inadequate IT infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commenting on these findings,<b>&nbsp;Ian Mawdsley, Chief Product Officer, Broadridge Trading and Connectivity Solutions,&nbsp;</b>says:</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;The sell-side see huge potential when it comes to next-generation technologies. The majority of firms are in agreement that the ultimate winner of their successful digital transformation will be their end clients, particularly when it comes to AI investments.</i></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Blockchain and DLT is also driving a lot of excitement and rightly so. Many believe these technologies could have a radical impact on their day to day operations, and could potentially eliminate the need for the financial intermediaries that they rely on today.</i></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Unfortunately, legacy systems and outdated IT infrastructure continue to be a big hurdle. To overcome this and to accelerate their digital transformation journey, firms need to invest in fixing this problem and make the shift to modern IT platforms.&rdquo;</i></p>

<div> decline, venture capital funding, UK, Q1 2024, deals volume<br />
<br />Summary: 
UK experienced a decline in VC funding deal volume and value in Q1 2024. However, March showed improvement in deal value. UK remains an important global market for VC funding. Notable deals include Monzo, Exohood Labs, Build A Rocket Boy, and Oxford Quantum Circuits. <div>
<p><span><span>The UK experienced a year-on-year (YoY) decline in venture capital (VC) funding deal volume and value during the first quarter (Q1) of 2024 as investor sentiment remained weak. A total of 281 VC deals of worth $2.7 billion were announced during the quarter. This represents a 21.7% YoY decline in deals volume and 31.2% fall in funding value, respectively. Despite these challenges, March showed improvement in deal value amidst declining volume, observes&nbsp;</span><a href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.b00YhNV2Nr0-2BaZn7eVNAdXV19MDZH7kb0yQVOf6WtC8eObQvQmU18OGm4LpUDS-2BPSWYt_awSuR00uK8EZood8su7v4ItMFr0d7S5MNR1CcvAHRb7u8JiSB5Axp3o6-2Brp7TTn9jFAQeaiwuDUNp6ED3yPnAlc8P6BYb9FHuDe9ygxt5VZvNiU-2BtRuLsvHWqjkM9T7CVkMqyLMEOMa-2F1y-2B-2F2pjf0Ls4HOMt9vNrWMYg1JwhjMy1eop2HeGL5KNq59dvjQl09FNL5-2BZvYWNkxQEj6mlVGiAt5trCrV1-2FWiwRYs2MmjuRrkpEPzKQold56sXelqxwqIi-2FDRw-2FTWKqAN9-2Fd2xrhabo1JGFF4RvVkN0mmHLPKRP7pgh3va8-2BPsHyapuYUoN7SOEoPo1VxMgv01hHQ7nIcw92EL1xcxJj0OALpD2BFU-3D" target="_blank"><span><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GlobalData</span></span></span></a><span>, a leading data and analytics company.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Aurojyoti Bose, Lead Analyst at GlobalData, comments:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;The dent in investor sentiment can be understood from the fact that the average size of VC funding deals fell from $11.1 million in Q1 2023 to $9.7 million in Q1 2024. However, despite this decline, we can see some bright spots, particularly in March when there was an improvement in deal value despite month-on-month decline in deal volume.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&ldquo;Moreover, the UK, apart from being the top European market for VC funding activity, also continues to be a key global market. It ranked among the top markets globally both in terms of VC funding deal volume and value during Q1 2024.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The UK accounted for 6.9% share of the total number of VC deals announced globally during Q1 2024. Meanwhile, its share of the corresponding funding value stood at 4.8% during the quarter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Some of the notable VC funding deals announced in the UK during Q1 2024 include the $430 million raised by Monzo, $112 million raised by Exohood Labs, $110 million raised by Build A Rocket Boy, and $100 million raised by Oxford Quantum Circuits.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: Historic data may change in case some deals get added to previous months because of a delay in disclosure of information in the public domain</span></span></p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Confirms Anti-Greenwashing Guidance And Proposes Extending Sustainability Framework</title>

<div> Guidance, Anti-greenwashing rule, Sustainable finance, Consumer interest, FCA

The FCA provides guidance and rules to tackle greenwashing, ensuring accurate descriptions of sustainable products and meeting consumer demand.<br /><br />Summary:
FCA supports industry with guidance
New rule to protect consumers
Results show consumer interest in sustainable finance
Consulting on extending requirements for portfolio managers
Collaborating with ASA and CMA to tackle greenwashing <div>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>Ahead of the anti-greenwashing rule coming into force on 31 May, the FCA is supporting industry with guidance to help them meet the standard.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>The new rule is designed to protect consumers by ensuring sustainable products and services they are sold are accurately described.</p>
<p>Results from the latest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/financial-lives" title="The Financial Lives survey">Financial Lives survey</a>&nbsp;shows significant consumer interest in sustainable finance&nbsp;as 81% of adults surveyed would like their investments to do some good as well as provide a financial return. This work supports the long-term growth and competitiveness of the sector by helping businesses meet this demand and ensuring consumers who invest in sustainability-related&nbsp;financial products can make informed decisions.</p>
<p>The FCA is also consulting on extending&nbsp;to portfolio managers&nbsp;the requirements on how sustainable investments are labelled and explained, making consumer choice easier. These are firms that manage a group of investments for consumers, which can either be offered as standardised products or tailored services. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The proposed labelling and Sustainability Disclosure Requirements (SDR) for portfolio managers largely mirror those introduced for asset managers in November 2023. They include:</p>
<ul>
<li>product labels to help consumers understand what their money is being used for</li>
<li>naming and marketing requirements so products can only be described as having positive outcomes on the environment and/or society when those claims can be backed up</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Sacha Sadan, Director of Environmental, Social and Governance, FCA, said:</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;Confirming the new anti-greenwashing guidance and our proposals to extend the Sustainability Disclosure Requirements and investment labels regime are important milestones that maintain the UK&rsquo;s place at the forefront of sustainable investment. Our good and poor practice anti-greenwashing examples will help firms market their products in the right way. We continue to work closely with the ASA and CMA to address greenwashing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Consumers care about investing in products that have a positive impact on the planet and people. That&rsquo;s why we want to boost the integrity of the market and ensure people can make informed decisions with their money.&rsquo;</p>

<li>In November 2023 the FCA&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/sustainability-disclosure-and-labelling-regime-confirmed-fca" title="Sustainability disclosure and labelling regime confirmed by the FCA">finalised the Sustainability Disclosure Requirements and investment labels regime</a>, a substantial package of measures to improve trust and transparency of investment products and minimise greenwashing.</li>
<li>The anti-greenwashing rule will come into effect from 31 May 2024. UK-based fund managers can use the investment labels from 31 July 2024. The naming and marketing rules for UK-based fund managers come into effect from 2 December 2024.</li>
<li>The FCA, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) work closely together to tackle greenwashing. While there are separate regulatory responsibilities there are some important areas that overlap. Where appropriate, we will continue to collaborate with the CMA and ASA to address greenwashing.&nbsp;</li>

<div> Whitepaper, ASX, T+1 settlement, Australia, industry stakeholders
<br />
ASX whitepaper explores T+1 settlement in Australia, seeks industry feedback. Global landscape, T+1 benefits and risks, stakeholder input, next steps.
<br /><br />Summary:
ASX released a whitepaper on transitioning to T+1 settlement in Australia. Seeking industry feedback by June 18, with a summary of feedback and next steps to be published in August 2024. <div>
<p>ASX has today released an <a href="https://www.asx.com.au/content/dam/asx/markets/clearing-and-settlement-services/t1-whitepaper-042024.pdf">industry</a><a href="https://www.asx.com.au/content/dam/asx/markets/clearing-and-settlement-services/t1-whitepaper-042024.pdf"> </a><a href="https://www.asx.com.au/content/dam/asx/markets/clearing-and-settlement-services/t1-whitepaper-042024.pdf">whitepaper</a><a href="https://www.asx.com.au/content/dam/asx/markets/clearing-and-settlement-services/t1-whitepaper-042024.pdf"> </a>to facilitate a discussion on the potential move from T+2 to T+1 settlement in Australia and is inviting industry stakeholders to make a submission. The whitepaper outlines how Australia's unique market structure, size, time zone, investment flows, and trading activity necessitates careful industry consideration of the risks, benefits, and costs of transitioning to T+1.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>ASX Group Executive, Securities and Payments, Clive Triance,</b> said: &ldquo;ASX has a critical role to play in facilitating the discussion on whether shortening the settlement cycle promotes the interest of the Australian market as a whole.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moving to T+1 is complex and we know there are a wide range of views. The process to canvass industry feedback will highlight the differing impacts for various stakeholders but the final decision will need to ensure we prioritise outcomes that support strong, secure and fair financial markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In putting together this whitepaper, we recognise there are various factors that will impact a decision to transition to T+1. This includes the type of service an entity provides, its own project pipeline, the cost and resourcing involved, along with potential implementation risks. Of course, this is weighed up against the potential benefit of a prompt implementation through harmonisation of settlement and funding cycles with other leading global markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The publication of the whitepaper follows the establishment of the T+1 Working Group that was formed by the ASX Business Committee in December 2023. The Working Group is comprised of industry experts who have provided input into the preparation of the T+1 whitepaper.</p>
<h4><b>T+1 in the Australian context&nbsp;</b></h4>
<p>The whitepaper highlights the global landscape, noting that countries like the USA, Canada, and Mexico are set to transition to T+1 in late May 2024, while India has been operating on T+1 since 2023. However, significant markets including the United Kingdom and those under European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) supervision are &ndash; like Australia &ndash; actively exploring shorter settlement cycles.</p>
<p>ASX is seeking stakeholder feedback on the whitepaper by 18 June 2024 with the aim of publishing a summary of the feedback in August 2024 which will include next steps.</p>

<div> CBEX Group, Bitget Pro, virtual asset, fraudulent activities, SFC
<br />
The SFC warns of CBEX Group and Bitget Pro for suspected virtual asset frauds, advises vigilance, and states the police have blocked access to relevant websites.
<br /><br />Summary:
The SFC warns of CBEX Group and Bitget Pro for suspected virtual asset frauds. The SFC advises vigilance and states the police have blocked access to relevant websites. <div>
<p>The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) today warns the public of entities operating under the names of &ldquo;CBEX Group&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bitget Pro&rdquo; for suspected virtual asset-related fraudulent activities (Notes 1 and 2).</p>
<p>Investors reported difficulties with virtual asset withdrawals or unauthorised withdrawals. The SFC suspects that the platforms may have deceived investors with fake withdrawal records.</p>
<p>At the SFC&rsquo;s request, the Hong Kong Police Force has taken steps to block access to relevant websites. Notwithstanding the action taken, the public should beware that scammers may continue to create websites with similar domain names.</p>
<p>The SFC also posted CBEX Group and Bitget Pro and their respective websites on the SFC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/alert-list/suspicious-virtual-asset-trading-platforms" target="_blank">Suspicious Virtual Asset Trading Platforms Alert List</a>&nbsp;on 23 April 2024.</p>
<p>Online investment scams may involve any type of assets and are perpetrated through multiple channels, and investors can suffer substantial losses. Therefore, investors should stay vigilant and beware of fraud when making investment decisions.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>CBEX Group operates its website at&nbsp;<a href="https://cbexokl.com/" target="_blank">https://cbexokl.com/</a>. The SFC notes that CBEX Group has adopted a name that is very similar to that of a property rights trading organisation based in China, when in fact they are not associated. CBEX Group claims to be headquartered in Canada and that other CBEX sub-brands operating globally include CBEX Japan&rsquo;s digital asset trading platform. While it also claims that it holds a compliant digital asset license on its website, it does not in fact hold any relevant digital asset licence in Canada or Japan. Hence, it would appear that CBEX Group may give a false and misleading impression that CBEX Group&rsquo;s services and business are properly licensed and legitimate, inducing others to trade on its platform.</li>
<li>Bitget Pro operates its websites at&nbsp;<a href="https://bitgetprokl.com/" target="_blank">https://bitgetprokl.com/</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://bitgetpromc.com/" target="_blank">https://bitgetpromc.com</a>.</li>

<title>Start Preparing Now: Early ASIC Guidance On The Mandatory Climate Disclosure Regime - Keynote Speech By ASIC Chair Joe Longo At The Deakin Law School International Sustainability Reporting Forum, 22 April 2024.</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/start-preparing-now-early-asic-guidance-on-the-mandatory-climate-disclosure-reg/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/start-preparing-now-early-asic-guidance-on-the-mandatory-climate-disclosure-reg/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h4>KEY POINTS</h4>
<ul>
<li>As we move to join the ever-growing ranks of jurisdictions with mandatory climate disclosure, entities should start putting into place the systems, processes and governance practices that will be required to meet new climate reporting requirements.</li>
<li>As with any new regulatory regime, ASIC will take a pragmatic approach to the supervision and enforcement of the regime, and we will develop and issue guidance to help entities meet their new obligations.</li>
<li>We will also work with the Government and the other Council of Financial Regulators (CFR) agencies on supporting implementation of the regime, including on broader initiatives that will assist entities meet their new obligations.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More than 6,000 entities will be required to report under new climate-related disclosure requirements in the next few years. They need to start preparing for the future, now.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve said before, the growing interest in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues is driving the biggest changes to financial reporting and disclosure standards in a generation. This is a transformational issue for global markets, and we need to be ready to meet that change at every step of its development. To do that, we must maintain high standards of governance and disclosure.</p>
<p>In the face of this change, I know many of you have questions about how ASIC will administer the new standards around the climate disclosure regime. In fact, 31% of respondents to the recent AICD director sentiment index survey said that their main concern in relation to mandatory climate disclosure is the complexity of reporting requirements. Though this is mitigated somewhat by only 11% saying climate change keeps them awake at night, and only 5% naming climate and sustainability reporting as a key concern.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the potential complexity of climate-related reporting is clearly an important question on many people&rsquo;s minds. And rightly so. Given the recent introduction of the climate reporting bill, it&rsquo;s only reasonable to be asking questions around how to meet climate-related financial disclosure obligations.</p>
<p>That said, I&rsquo;m not going to give you a step-by-step roadmap. That&rsquo;s simply not possible. Similarly, it would be getting ahead of ourselves for ASIC to talk about enforcement strategy. That&rsquo;s not the focus of what we&rsquo;re here to talk about today. As with any new legislation, we can expect more clarity as things firm up over time.</p>
<p>Instead, I am going to talk to you about&nbsp;<span>how ASIC will administer this ambitious new once-in-a-generation change</span>. And so today, I would like to give you some insights into the approach ASIC will take &ndash; our expectations &ndash; and why you need to be preparing for these changes today.</p>
<h4>The regulatory transition</h4>
<p>As you&rsquo;ll be aware, following Treasury&rsquo;s public consultation, the legislation proposing mandatory climate-related disclosure was introduced into Parliament last month. The Australian Accounting Standards Board (<span>AASB</span>) has recently consulted on an exposure draft of the Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards (<span>ASRS</span>). The final version will be the standards that entities will be required to report against under the Government&rsquo;s proposed mandatory climate reporting regime.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re right on the cusp of this potentially becoming domestic Australian law. There&rsquo;s still a lot of work ahead of us to work through what the standards will look like in the Australian context. ASIC supports aligning the Australian standards to international standards as much as possible. This is of course a matter for the Parliament and for the AASB, but minimising divergent climate reporting requirements between different jurisdictions would likely improve market efficiency, the competitiveness of Australian companies, and reduce the regulatory burden for reporting entities.</p>
<p>In any case, as we move to join the ever-growing ranks of jurisdictions with mandatory climate disclosure, many larger entities have been preparing for this for some time. Nearly 75% of the ASX200 have committed to or are already voluntarily reporting climate-related information against the TCFD framework.<sup>1 T</sup>he same is not necessarily true of some of the smaller entities. But for both the smaller and the larger entities, there is some understandable apprehension, because now the legislation is actually upon us.</p>
<p>And this is a crucial point: you have to do this now. It&rsquo;s simply not an option to put this off until after legislation has passed, and then scramble to comply. You have to figure out how you're going to marshal data, support and capabilities and start keeping the necessary records&nbsp;<span>now</span>&nbsp;&ndash; today.</p>
<p>Now, ASIC will be responsible for administering the mandatory climate reporting regime, and this necessarily includes enforcement. But we understand that there will obviously be a period of transition as industry works to build the capability required to meet these new obligations. For this reason, we support Treasury&rsquo;s phased approach to the implementation of the disclosure and assurance requirements. This allows time for the necessary uplift. Treasury is also aware that some are concerned about making forward-looking statements under the regime: they&rsquo;ve responded by introducing the legislation alongside&nbsp;<span>modified liability settings</span>&nbsp;which will restrict private actions against certain protected statements for a period of three years.</p>
<p>Now, as with any new regulatory regime, ASIC will take a pragmatic approach to the supervision and enforcement of the climate reporting regime. We will consider what support and guidance we can give to help entities meet their new obligations. We will also work with the Government and the other Council of Financial Regulators (<span>CFR</span>) agencies on supporting implementation of the climate reporting regime, including on broader initiatives that will assist entities meet their new obligations, such as ongoing work on addressing data challenges.</p>
<p>In the meantime, ASIC continues to encourage listed companies to report voluntarily under the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board&rsquo;s Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. This has been ASIC&rsquo;s position since 2018. We also encourage entities to start developing the necessary organisational and governance structures to support future reporting requirements, including any additional sustainability-related topics that may be introduced in future years.</p>
<p>As we release this guidance, we will no doubt get some people saying they&rsquo;ve covered too much &ndash; or that they cover too little &ndash; others saying that they&rsquo;re too prescriptive or not prescriptive enough &ndash; and so on. But we&rsquo;re focusing on where we think we can be the most helpful in our guidance, within our remit. And we consult and monitor in response, and come back and adapt the guidance to better suit the need.</p>
<p>In short, I want to make it clear that ASIC is listening. We know there are a lot of moving parts, we understand the complexity and the challenge &ndash; and we&rsquo;re here to administer the new standards in a way that benefits us all.</p>
<h4>Compliance equals good business</h4>
<p>Which brings me to another important point: while there will be a cost for entities to report, those entities will also benefit. New mandatory reporting requirements don&rsquo;t necessarily make it harder to balance the scales between profit and legal requirements.</p>
<p>Yes, new climate-related reporting requirements will impose new obligations on directors and reporting entities. But they also create opportunities. More reporting requirements mean you benefit from greater visibility of the physical and transitional risks. You can also benefit from climate-related opportunities of other entities in your value chain, and more visibility on these issues across the entire economy. This will support companies to manage their own climate-related risk and opportunities over the short, medium and long term, in the best financial interests of the entity and its shareholders.</p>
<p>This is an important point to remember. In particular, the Australian Government has legislated Australia's commitment to be net zero by 2050 and to reduce emissions by 43% below 2005 levels by 2030. On top of that, the Paris agreement remains afoot. That means more than 190 countries globally agree to reducing the sources and enhancing the sinks of greenhouse gases to limit warming to two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The point is, it&rsquo;s pretty apparent that these issues will only become more pronounced over time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, while we acknowledge the step up in capability required, and we note the complexity in some aspects of the proposed standards &ndash; such as setting net zero targets, undertaking scenario analysis and creating transition plans &ndash; nevertheless it&rsquo;s important to consider the benefits that will also accrue from more transparency in this area right across capital markets.</p>
<p>We at ASIC think good practice in thinking about reforms like this is to look at both sides of the equation &ndash; both the benefits and the challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>ASIC&rsquo;s expectations</h4>
<p>But what will that look like? Since &ndash; as we&rsquo;ve seen &ndash; it&rsquo;s far too early to talk about an enforcement strategy on standards that haven&rsquo;t even passed yet, what can we say in terms of administering this change?</p>
<p>First, we need to recognise that the proposed standards for climate-related disclosures constitute what might be a called a prescriptive regime. Whenever this is the case, ASIC &ndash; and other regulators &ndash; need to be helpful in providing some guidance as to how we think about what compliance might look like with those rules.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To fulfil that need, ASIC will develop and issue regulatory guidance on climate-related financial disclosures. This will include:</p>
<ol>
<li>A new,&nbsp;<span>regulatory guide&nbsp;</span>for the climate reporting regime which will address ASIC&rsquo;s approach to relief from those obligations, and interaction of the regime with existing legal and regulatory requirements.</li>
<li><span>Resources on ASIC&rsquo;s website</span>&nbsp;for both those who prepare and use sustainability reports. This will include information on the new sustainability reporting obligations, ASIC&rsquo;s regulatory functions in relation to the regime and the types of information found in sustainability reports.</li>
</ol>
<p>The above will all be housed under a single dedicated page on the ASIC site that&rsquo;s dedicated to climate-related financial disclosures. This will allow for easy updates as things firm up in this space over time.</p>
<p>At the same time, there will be some aspects of CRFD where ASIC may need to wait and observe market practice and regulatory developments before we can provide more detailed guidance.</p>
<p>ASIC reviews climate and sustainability disclosures made by entities in financial reports as part of our annual financial reporting surveillance program. We will utilise this program to monitor progress and market practice in this area before and during the implementation of the mandatory regime. We will also undertake proactive surveillance of the first reporters, the largest firms, to identify any learnings that we can share for the benefit of the entire market.</p>
<p>And this is something I want to emphasise here: this is an evolving space. In a sense, ASIC is learning alongside you. While some guidance holds up well over time, things like court decisions can obviously affect how it&rsquo;s presented. The point is, we&rsquo;re having to develop that in context &ndash; and this will play out for years to come. I mean, even when standards are passed and implemented, there is as yet no international consensus around assurance. At this very early stage we&rsquo;re working very hard with industry and at the international level to get a grip on this subject. But the point is we&rsquo;re a long way from calling it a day. To coin a phrase, the implementation of mandatory climate disclosure isn&rsquo;t the end &ndash; it&rsquo;s the beginning.</p>
<h4>Start today</h4>
<p>But don&rsquo;t wait until climate-related financial disclosure requirements actually become mandated and the AASB finalises Australian standards based on those issued by the ISSB. As I suggested earlier, ASIC considers that those entities reporting under the TCFD will be well placed to report under any future mandatory reporting regime. This is particularly the case since the ISSB&rsquo;s standards are founded on the four pillars of the TCFD framework.</p>
<p>So start there. While companies may continue to use the voluntary TCFD framework, it may also be useful for them to begin engaging with the ISSB standards through the report preparation process to test and/or assess capabilities, data availability and requirements against the new standard. This will help inform the company of future requirements.</p>
<p>In addition to climate change, momentum is gaining pace in relation to disclosure on other sustainability-related topics, including nature and biodiversity. ASIC will continue to monitor these developments as they progress and encourages entities to ensure that any systems and processes they adopt for the purposes of climate-related financial disclosures be sufficiently agile to incorporate additional sustainability topics in future years.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve said, the data tells us that markets and investors are increasingly relying on this information in order to make decisions. That&rsquo;s why climate and sustainability disclosures and statements need to be rigorous, robust, and comprehensive. And it should go without saying, they cannot be misleading or deceptive under law. This is nothing new &ndash; it has never been okay to be misleading or deceptive.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>In conclusion, while it&rsquo;s too early to talk about enforcement strategy, that should not be taken to mean it&rsquo;s too early to be prepared. This means considering and putting into place the systems, processes and governance practices that will be required to meet new climate reporting requirements. It means ensuring you adopt the necessary practices to avoid greenwashing.</p>
<p>Doing this now will allow the best transition &ndash; and it will provide a surer foundation for a more profitable business &ndash; because a compliant business&nbsp;<span>is</span>&nbsp;a profitable business. As things firm up, ASIC will provide further guidance. But in the meantime, you need to start preparing for the future, now.</p>

<title>SGX RegCo Wants Boards To Help Enable Shareholder-Requisitioned Meetings</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sgx-regco-wants-boards-to-help-enable-shareholder-requisitioned-meetings/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sgx-regco-wants-boards-to-help-enable-shareholder-requisitioned-meetings/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>To improve board-shareholder engagements, Singapore Exchange Regulation (SGX RegCo) is proposing a rule change to require listed issuers to assist shareholders who have requisitioned a general meeting so that the meeting can take place as soon as practicable. Issuers are to commence facilitative efforts within 21 days of deposit of the requisition notice. An issuer who disputes the validity of the requisition notice must apply for a court ruling within the same timeline.</p>
<p>Some areas in which SGX RegCo envisages the issuer should provide help to requisitionists include:</p>
<ul>
<li>releasing announcements and documents, such as notices, circulars and proxy forms, on SGXNet;</li>
<li>sending documents, such as notices, circulars and proxy forms, to shareholders;</li>
<li>collating any proxy forms submitted by shareholders at the issuer&rsquo;s registered office;</li>
<li>securing the board&rsquo;s attendance at the shareholder-requisitioned meeting;</li>
<li>enabling the appointed scrutineer to discharge its duties; and</li>
<li>instructing its agents, including its share registrar and company secretary, to provide any necessary assistance such as preparing the mailing labels for the purposes of sending documents to shareholders and attending the shareholder-requisitioned meeting.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The requisition notice must meet the procedural requirements of the Companies Act 1967 of Singapore, including that requisitionists must hold at least 10% of the total number of paid-up shares. To facilitate the board&rsquo;s assessment on the validity of the requisition notice, the requisition notice should minimally encompass the names and shareholdings of the requisitionists and a description of the resolutions proposed to be tabled at the shareholder-requisitioned meeting. When the board receives a requisition notice, it should immediately inform shareholders via SGXNet. Any subsequent material developments, including any application filed to court, should also be immediately announced.</p>
<p>"If investors have a stronger say, companies will be more motivated to consider their interests by improving both operational performance and shareholder returns. By enabling the convening of general meetings, we empower shareholders to drive change and exercise market discipline," said Tan Boon Gin, CEO of SGX RegCo.<br /><br />In addition to&nbsp;encouraging&nbsp;market discipline, we are working on two other areas to&nbsp;spur companies to increase shareholder value: the strengthening of the board&nbsp;to enhance company performance&nbsp;and a reduction in market friction. Initiatives to improve the quality of boards and amplify shareholder voice have already been put in place; other measures are still in development and we will keep the market updated," he added.</p>
<p>The public consultation is open till 23 May 2024 and can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://regco.sgx.com/public-consultations">here</a>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has commenced proceedings in the Market Misconduct Tribunal (MMT) against Ms Cynthia Chen Si Ying, Mr Wen Lide, Mr Sit Yuk Yin and Ms Choi Ban Yee for suspected insider dealing in the shares of Asiasec Properties Limited (formerly known as Dan Form Holdings Company Limited) (Dan Form) (Notes 1 and 2).</p>
<p>On 22 September 2016, Dan Form, Tian An China Investments Company Limited (Tian An) (Note 3) and a wholly owned subsidiary of Tian An, Autobest Holdings Limited (Autobest), made a joint announcement. The announcement included the conditional agreement for Autobest to acquire 36.45% of Dan Form&rsquo;s total issued share capital from Mr Dai Xiaoming, the then chairman, chief executive and executive director of Dan Form, at $2.75 per share.</p>
<p>At the material time, Chen was the company secretary of Dan Form and Wen is her relative. &nbsp;Sit was a driver responsible for providing services to the family members of Tian An&rsquo;s chairman and Choi is his wife (Note 4).</p>
<p>The SFC alleges that prior to the aforesaid announcement, both Chen and Sit were in possession of inside information about the acquisition. Chen counselled or procured Wen to acquire 400,000 Dan Form shares via the securities accounts of him and his spouse respectively between 8 September and 19 September 2016, while Sit counselled or procured Choi to acquire 166,000 Dan Form shares via her securities account on 14 September 2016.</p>
<p>After the announcement was made on 22 September 2016, Wen and Choi disposed of their entire holdings in Dan Form shares, earning profits of about $218,593 and $106,968 respectively.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dan Form shares were listed on the Main Board of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited on 28 February 1973. Its name was changed to Asiasec Properties Limited with effect from 9 June 2017.</li>
<li>The SFC instituted proceedings in the MMT against Chen, Wen, Sit and Choi for alleged insider dealing under section 270 of the Securities and Futures Ordinance. A copy of the SFC&rsquo;s Notice of the MMT proceedings is available on the MMT&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mmt.gov.hk/en/" target="_blank">website</a>.</li>
<li>Tian An shares were listed on the Main Board of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited on 18 March 1987.</li>
<li>Sit was employed by Allied Group Limited, the parent of Tian An.</li>

<title>ASIC: No-Action Position On Financial Reporting Obligations Of Special Purpose Financing Subsidiaries And Their Guarantors</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-no-action-position-on-financial-reporting-obligations-of-special-purpose-f-1/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-no-action-position-on-financial-reporting-obligations-of-special-purpose-f-1/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In response to stakeholder feedback, ASIC has adopted a no-action position on the financial reporting obligations of special purpose financing subsidiaries or other wholly-owned subsidiaries that issue debentures to sophisticated or professional investors, and their guarantors, that may have been relying on relief under&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2016L01538/latest/details">ASIC Corporations (Wholly-Owned Companies) Instrument 2016/785</a>&nbsp;(ASIC Instrument 2016/785).</p>
<p>Under ASIC Instrument 2016/785, certain wholly-owned&nbsp;companies may be relieved from financial reporting obligations under Chapter 2M of the&nbsp;<em>Corporations Act 2001</em>, where they enter into a deed of cross guarantee with their holding entity and meet certain other conditions. Wholly-owned companies that are &lsquo;borrowers in relation to debentures&rsquo;, or &lsquo;a guarantor of such a borrower&rsquo;, are excluded from relief under ASIC Instrument 2016/785.</p>
<p>ASIC has been made aware that some corporate groups with special purpose financing subsidiaries or other wholly-owned subsidiaries that issue debentures to sophisticated or professional investors for the purpose of providing finance to other companies in the group may have been of the view that the exclusions do not apply to their special purpose financing vehicle or any of its guarantors.</p>
<p>The no-action position means that we will not take enforcement action against special purpose financing subsidiaries or other wholly-owned subsidiaries that issue debentures to sophisticated or professional investors, or their guarantors, for not preparing and lodging annual reports where, apart from the exclusions mentioned above, they otherwise comply with the requirements of ASIC Instrument 2016/785.</p>
<p>The no action position applies for financial years ending on or after 28 September 2016 (when ASIC Instrument 2016/785 was issued). The no-action position does not apply where there was or is a requirement under the Corporations Act for a trust deed and trustee in relation to the offer of the debentures.</p>
<p>ASIC adopted the no-action position in response to technical and policy considerations raised by stakeholders. The no-action position will remain in place until 1 October 2026 or earlier if we decide to remake the relief after consulting with industry.</p>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>Currently, wholly-owned companies that are &lsquo;borrowers in relation to debentures&rsquo; and their guarantors are excluded from financial reporting relief under&nbsp;ASIC Instrument 2016/785 &ndash; see subparagraphs 6(1)(b)(ii) and (iii).</p>
<p>In our Corporate Finance Update &ndash; Issue 14 in September 2023, we reminded entities that borrowers in relation to debentures and their guarantors are excluded from financial reporting relief under ASIC Instrument 2016/785. We advised then that ASIC did not intend to provide a formal or informal no-action position or other relief in response to this issue. However, we decided to&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">adopt</span>&nbsp;a no-action position in relation to this issue following further consideration and feedback from stakeholders.</p>
<p>Any affected companies may wish to consider seeking their own legal advice on other potential remedies, such as relief from the court under section 1322 of the&nbsp;<em>Corporations Act</em>. We do not express any views in relation to any potential application to the court for relief under section 1322 at this time. ASIC does not have power to grant retrospective financial reporting relief.</p>
<p><span>Status of ASIC&rsquo;s &lsquo;no-action&rsquo; positions</span></p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s general policy on &lsquo;no-action&rsquo; positions and their status is set out in Regulatory Guide 108 No-action letters. In particular, it should be noted:</p>
<ul>
<li>a no-action letter is an expression of regulatory intention about how to exercise ASIC&rsquo;s powers. The purpose of a no-action letter is to provide an indication as to the future regulatory action that we might take. Entities do not need to apply to ASIC to avail themselves of this no-action position.<br /><br /></li>
<li>an ASIC no-action letter does not necessarily preclude third parties (including the Office of Director of Public Prosecutions) from taking legal action in relation to the same conduct or conduct of that kind. Nor does it prevent a court from holding that particular conduct infringes the relevant legislation. ASIC does not represent that the conduct covered by the no-action letter will not be held to contravene the relevant legislation. Nor does ASIC undertake to intervene in an action brought by third parties in respect of such conduct.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>ASIC is Australia&rsquo;s corporate, markets and financial services regulator.</span></p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority Underlines Importance Of Effective Liquidity Risk Management For Fund Managers</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW231858637 BCX8">The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; has published its guide for Managed Investment Scheme (MIS) managers and their supervisors for effective liquidity risk management (LRM), following consultation. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW231858637 BCX8">Fund liquidity is about how fund assets can be sold without negatively impacting the price of those assets. Good management of fund liquidity is important to help ensure investors are treated equitably, and that funds operate in line with the information given to investors. This capability and skill plays an important role in supporting orderly and stable markets, especially during volatile conditions. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW231858637 BCX8">This guide updates and replaces the FMA&rsquo;s 2020 Best practice guide for liquidity management and stress testing. It focuses on managed funds but is intended to assist all MIS managers, and supervisors of those schemes, to consider LRM at all stages of fund management &ndash; from fund design to day-to-day liquidity management and contingency planning &ndash; and particularly at times of heightened market uncertainty and volatility.  &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW231858637 BCX8">The law requires managers and supervisors to exercise a professional standard of care, diligence, and skill. The law also requires managers to treat scheme participants equitably, and both managers and supervisors to act in the best interests of scheme participants. Given these clear statutory duties and the importance of managing liquidity, all managed funds should have appropriate LRM policies, processes and tools. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW231858637 BCX8">The guide contains the FMA&rsquo;s view of the features of effective LRM, based on international frameworks adapted to New Zealand&rsquo;s markets. Managers must consider how these features apply to their operations and each of their funds. Following feedback during the consultation, the guide emphasises that managers retain discretion about how they manage liquidity in the context and scale of their own business.​ &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW231858637 BCX8">John Horner, FMA Director of Markets, Investors and Reporting, said: &ldquo;Effective liquidity risk management is a fundamental capability managers need to implement, maintain and enhance. Failure to do so may breach the law. The guide is designed to assist managers and supervisors effectively manage and oversee liquidity risk. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW231858637 BCX8">&ldquo;The guide does not impose any additional burden, to the contrary, it explains how the FMA views liquidity risk management as an essential component of professional standards. In doing so, it recognises the diverse range of MIS manager businesses and funds on offer. We do not expect all managers to implement the guide word for word, but we do want firms to review their systems against the guide and tailor their LRM approach to suit their specific funds.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="button-link--green-dark"><a href="https://www.fma.govt.nz/business/focus-areas/consultation/consultation-proposed-liquidity-risk-management-guidance/" title="Link to Consultation: Proposed liquidity risk management guidance "><span class="TextRun SCXW231858637 BCX8">View the Consultation: Proposed liquidity risk management guidance</span></a></span></p>

<ul>
<li><span>Proven Solutions with Integrated GenAI Copilot Features Significantly Improve Investigator Efficiency with up to 90% Reduction in Alert Review Time Compared to Legacy Approaches</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="xn-org">Verafin</span>, a Nasdaq company, renowned for its expertise in applying artificial intelligence (AI) and big data technologies to fight crime, announces the launch of Entity Research Copilot, the first of its integrated Copilot capabilities, bolstering its suite of financial crime management solutions. Building on 20 years of technology expertise for anti-money laundering, countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) and fraud detection,&nbsp;<span class="xn-org">Verafin</span>&nbsp;continues its commitment to innovation with the introduction of integrated Copilot features designed to further optimize compliance workflows and streamline operations for financial institutions worldwide.</p>
<p>Following an extensive Beta program,&nbsp;<span class="xn-org">Verafin</span>&nbsp;is rolling out availability of its first copilot feature, the integrated Entity Research Copilot, to its customer base of more than 2,500 financial institutions. With the powerful combination of its targeted AI-based analytics, consortium data, and robust visual investigation tools, enhanced with new copilot capabilities,&nbsp;<span class="xn-org">Verafin</span>&nbsp;significantly improves investigator efficiency with up to 90% reduction in alert review time compared to legacy approaches.</p>

INT is a merchant pipeline, previously known as Interconnector (UK) Limited (&lsquo;IUK&rsquo;).</p>
<p>The report analyses the proposed reference price methodology, consulted upon&nbsp;by the Transmission System Operator (TSO) to set the tariffs for the INT pipeline.</p>

<p>This interconnector falls under the regulatory jurisdiction of Ofgem, the British National Regulatory Authority (NRA), and CREG, the Belgian federal regulatory authority for electricity and gas.</p>
<p>As a merchant pipeline, INT differs from regulated assets built or operated by TSOs, including the absence of:</p>

<p>Accordingly, INT (formerly IUK) was granted a derogation (in 2018) by the British and Belgian NRAs from a number of provisions of the EU Network Code on Harmonised Transmission Tariff Structures (<a href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsPBlIJUVgFAUwMAQMGHVZYBQYdUAwAAhoCV1YHAQsFUw5QAAAdUQZaVl0DBlsdVwwDAB0GXVBUGgxVAA4ZAVAHV1IGAFIHBlQARQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" target="_blank">NC TAR</a>).</p>
<p>INT&rsquo;s proposed methodology aims at setting transmission tariffs that can be adjusted to market conditions in the UK and Belgium.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What does ACER say?</span></p>
<p>ACER&rsquo;s report on the proposed reference price methodology finds that the information provided by INT in the consultation document is insufficient for ACER to conduct a complete compliance analysis of the proposed tariff methodology with the EU gas tariffs Network Code. Furthermore, the ACER report refers to the requirements in the EU Network Code that are applicable to the INT pipeline.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the next steps?</span></p>
<p>CREG shall take a motivated decision on the methodology to set the tariff methodology for INT.</p>

<title>ICE First Look At Mortgage Performance: Serious Delinquencies At Lowest Since Mid-2006 As Foreclosures Drop, Prepayments Rise</title>

<div> delinquency rate, foreclosure starts, prepayment rate, non-current percentage, 90+ days delinquent percentage 
Summary:
The national delinquency rate decreased in March, with serious delinquencies hitting lowest level since 2006. Foreclosure starts rose, but active foreclosure and prepayment activity improved. Non-current percentage varied by state.ICE’s loan-level database provided the data. <div>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li>The national delinquency rate ticked down 14 basis points (bps) to 3.20% in March, holding 27 bps higher than the record low in March 2023</li>
<li>Historically, delinquencies fall an average -10.4% in March; conversely, months that end on Sundays &ndash; e.g., March 2024 &ndash; experience an average, if mostly temporary, upward pull of +6.9%</li>
<li>Only the third such convergence in the last two decades, this March&rsquo;s 4.2% drop in the delinquency rate is in line with the previous cases in which March ended on a Sunday</li>
<li>Serious delinquencies (loans 90+ days past due but not in active foreclosure) dropped 24K (-5.2%) from February to hit their lowest level since June 2006</li>
<li>March saw less inflow of past-due payments as well as fewer rolls to later stages of delinquency, with total cures up 9% as early-, mid- and late-stage delinquencies all saw improvement</li>
<li>Even accounting for the 5.3% month-over-month rise in foreclosure starts, the month&rsquo;s 26K starts was still below the average for the past 12 months</li>
<li>The number of loans in active foreclosure fell to 205K in March &ndash; the fewest since January 2022 and still 28% below (-77K) pre-pandemic levels &ndash; with 5.8K foreclosures completed in the month</li>
<li>Prepayment activity rose to its highest level in seven months driven by the lower rate environment of January and early February combined the start of the spring homebuying season</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, reports the following &ldquo;first look&rdquo; at March 2024 month-end mortgage performance statistics derived from its loan-level database representing the majority of the national mortgage market.</p>

Market participants prepare for T+1 settlement cycle. Prime brokers and investment managers show high affirmation rates. Custodians improve affirmation rates. Automation crucial for T+1 success. Reputational damage and additional costs if T+1 deadlines missed.<br /> <div>
<p>Today, April 22, 2024, DTCC issued the following statement:</p>
<p>The implementation of a T+1 settlement cycle in the U.S. is a little over one month away, and market participants continue to prepare for the May 28, 2024, deadline. As firms consider their implementation approach, many are focusing on the importance of achieving same-day affirmation.</p>
<p>Our latest analysis shows that in March 2024, 74.95% of transactions were affirmed by the DTC cutoff time of 9:00PM ET on trade date, an increase from 74.5% in February. When considering specific market segments as of the end of March 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Prime Broker Affirmation Rate</span>: 83% (flat from February)  
<ul>
<li>As more Prime Brokers move to real time affirmation, this rate is expected to increase in April.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Investment Manager Auto Affirmation (central match) Rate</span>&nbsp;91% (up 2% from 89% in February)  
<ul>
<li>In March, DTCC&rsquo;s Institutional Trade Processing (ITP) added 30 new Investment Managers to the CTM auto affirmation workflow, bringing the current total of Investment Managers using this capability to 399. 280 of these Investment Managers are enabled for CTM&rsquo;s Match to Instruct (M2i) workflow.</li>
<li>As Investment Managers continue to on-board and configure their Brokers, this rate will continue to increase.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Custodian or Investment Manager (self) Affirmation Rate&lt;</span>: 55% (up from 53% in February)  
<ul>
<li>DTCC continues to work closely with the Custodian community to advocate for improvements in affirmation rates. To increase operational efficiency, Custodians are advised to encourage their clients to get their own TradeSuite IDs rather than relying on their Custodian&rsquo;s omnibus account.</li>
<li>Over 1,370 TradeSuite IDs were added in Q1 2024, providing Investment Managers with greater transparency into affirmation rates. Additionally, an Investment Manager that is already live on CTM can activate Auto Affirmation and enable M2i. This helps achieve significantly higher affirmation rates. We strongly encourage continued collaboration between Investment Managers and their Custodians.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a little over one month left until the T+1 deadline, market participants must accelerate their preparations and readiness. Improvement in affirmation rates &ndash; aided by technology &ndash; can reduce the likelihood of trade failure and provide needed efficiency to achieve accelerated settlement timelines.<em>&nbsp;</em>Leveraging automation to optimize settlement workflows and implementing straight through post trade processing better positions firms to achieve T+1 settlement.</p>
<p>Should firms be unable to make T+1 deadlines, they run the risk of reputational damage and additional costs due to trade fails or settling trades via more costly delivery orders. Further, firms should note the recent SEC Division of Examination&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/risk-alert-tplus1-032724.pdf">Risk Alert</a>, &ldquo;Shortening the Securities Transaction Settlement Cycle.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<div> NYSE:ICE, carbon allowance, trading activity, EUA futures, Mini EUA futures
Summary:<br />Record participation and trading activity in global environmental markets, including launch of Mini EUA futures, CORSIA futures, and expansion into North American markets. ICE offers most liquid energy and environmental markets worldwide. <div>
<ul>
<li><span><i>EUA Markets Reach Record Participation Through 2023 and Q1 2024 with Record Trading Activity in North American Environmental Markets in 2023</i></span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced that 2023 marked the third consecutive year where ICE carbon allowance volumes traded the equivalent to $1 trillion in notional value.</p>
<p>Trading activity in ICE&rsquo;s global environmental markets is up over 30% year-over-year (y/y) with open interest up 20% y/y.</p>
<p>ICE&rsquo;s EU Carbon Allowance (EUA) futures and options, the world&rsquo;s most liquid carbon market and the global benchmark price for emissions, reached record participation throughout 2023 and during Q1 2024.</p>
<p>To complement this market, ICE has today launched Mini EUA futures, in a lot size of 100 tons versus the 1000 ton lot size in the benchmark EUA futures. The smaller contract size is designed to support the shipping industry in managing emissions price risk and will sit alongside ICE&rsquo;s existing contracts across Marine Fuels, Wet Freight, LNG and LPG Freight and Low Sulphur Gasoil futures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Built over the past two decades and counting, our global network of exchanges and data now sit at the heart of the world&rsquo;s most important energy transition where the benchmark prices for energy and carbon are formed every day,&rdquo; said Gordon Bennett, Managing Director, Utility Markets at ICE.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the biggest and most liquid carbon market in the world, the EU will continue to influence international carbon markets and, with the addition of CORSIA and Mini EUA futures, ICE is offering additional tools for customers to bring their carbon tons on risk and put a price on the cost of emissions,&rdquo; continued Bennett.</p>
<p>During 2023, ICE&rsquo;s CORSIA futures went live, providing a targeted tool for airline operators to manage their emissions exposure, and are currently the only way for the market to trade futures based on CORSIA Phase 1. Also in 2023, ICE expanded its range of cap-and-trade futures markets, with the launch of Washington carbon allowance futures, and in 2024 listed the first environmental futures market based on Alberta, Canada&rsquo;s carbon program.</p>
<p>In 2024 year-to-date, over 1.6 million contracts have traded across North American environmental markets, up over 40% versus this period last year. While in 2023, a record 3.9 million contracts traded, along with record participation. The notional value of physically settled futures contracts in the North American portfolio was $10.8 billion in 2023, breaking the last record set in 2021.</p>
<p>ICE offers customers the most liquid markets to trade futures and options on California Carbon Allowances, California Carbon credits, RGGI Allowances (RGA), California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) Credits, and Renewable Energy Certificates.</p>
<p>ICE&rsquo;s energy and environmental markets are the most liquid in the world. On April 18, 2024, open interest across ICE&rsquo;s global energy portfolio hit a record 61 million contracts. Since launch, over 166 billion carbon allowances, approximately 460 million renewable energy certificates, 6 billion carbon credits, and the equivalent of 13 billion Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) have traded on ICE.</p>

<div> TT, Splicer, multi-leg spreads, execution algos, TT platform <br />
Summary:<br />Trading Technologies International introduces TT Splicer, offering synthetic multi-leg spread trading with execution algos, creating new trading opportunities and applications. <div>
<p>Trading Technologies International, Inc. (TT), a global capital markets technology platform provider, today announced the introduction of TT Splicer, a new TT Premium Order Type that provides industry-first functionality for synthetic multi-leg spread trading.</p>
<p><span class="xn-person">Joe Signorelli</span>, EVP &amp; Managing Director, Quantitative Trading Solutions, said: "TT Splicer combines the ease and flexibility of TT's market-leading Autospreader&reg; with the power of our best-in-class execution algos to uniquely minimize slippage and optimize trade execution when trading synthetic multi-leg spreads. This is an exciting development that gives our clients the ability to create a host of new trading opportunities and applications that meet their needs."</p>
<p>TT Chief Operating Officer&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Justin LLewellyn-Jones</span>&nbsp;said: "Our execution algo suite has gained popularity throughout the world for the ability to provide cutting-edge, low-latency execution across listed derivatives, equities, fixed income and FX. The launch of TT Splicer is illustrative of our commitment to continuously improve on the functionality and breadth of the suite and our TT platform."</p>
<p>TT Splicer uniquely enables users to leverage Autospreader to create a synthetic multi-leg instrument on any exchange &ndash; even if the exchange doesn't list those products &ndash; and then utilize one of TT's built-in algos to seamlessly manage order execution. TT Splicer coordinates leg execution across colocated servers and instantly tracks all fills in real time, while dynamic custom ratios continuously balance risk.</p>
<p>Potential TT Splicer applications include:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Trade ICE/CME Heating Oil/Gas Oil (HOGO) spreads directly as a single instrument, controlling how tightly to keep the hedge leg in balance with the outrights</li>
<li>Roll a contract and "leg into" the spread</li>
<li>Trade the Soybean Crush and automatically adjust ratios to account for less liquidity in one or both legs</li>
<li>Account for changes in the Brazilian Real/U.S. Dollar exchange rate when trading sugar contracts on ICE</li>
<li>Create calendar spreads on SGX and other Asian markets that don't natively list these products</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TT Premium Order Types are robust execution algos driven by quantitative modeling that are fully integrated with the TT platform. The 2023 Waters Rankings Awards, which are determined by votes from thousands of sell-side and buy-side market participants, recognized TT as Best Algorithmic Trading Provider for the TT Premium Order Types offering. In addition to TT Splicer, the product suite includes:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>TT Brisk: Execute targeting arrival price and enhance physical basis trades.</li>
<li>TT Close: Execute intelligently into settlement or market close.</li>
<li>TT POV: Execute in line with market activity to target a rate or in illiquid markets.</li>
<li>TT Prowler: Execute iceberg-style with additional anti-gaming and liquidity capture features.</li>
<li>TT Scale POV: Execute within a target range dependent on market conditions.</li>
<li>TT TWAP+: Execute evenly across time (time-weighted average price) with intelligent sizing and distribution.</li>
<li>TT VWAP+: Execute with expected liquidity (volume-weighted average price), such as during settlement windows to mimic trade-at-settlement (TAS).</li>
</ul>

Summary:<br />
The Securities Commission Malaysia held VHACK 2024 in collaboration with USM, showcasing fintech talents and solutions addressing SDG-related issues. This supports the development of Islamic fintech. <div>
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC), in collaboration with the Computer Science Society of Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM), held the highly anticipated Varsity Hackathon (VHACK 2024) on 20 April 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>VHACK is the inaugural event of the FIKRA ACE - Excel, a key component of the SC&rsquo;s FIKRA ACE<sup>1</sup>. The FIKRA ACE - Excel is a capacity building initiative for the SC to support the development of Islamic fintech by building skillsets and talent for the industry through collaborations with higher learning institutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">The SC Chairman Dato&rsquo; Seri Dr. Awang Adek Hussin said that VHACK 2024 is a platform for cultivating the next generation of fintech talents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It showcases the innovative spirit that thrives within undergraduates of Malaysia. This can be a call to action for stakeholders across academia, industry and government to collaborate, innovate and propel Malaysia towards becoming a global leader in Islamic fintech,&rdquo; he said.<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Focusing on solving curated Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) related real-life issues, the programme received an overwhelming response of over 900 applications from 90 higher learning institutions around the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the final pitching day that was held at USM in Penang, 10 teams from multiple public and private universities were crowned winners<sup>2</sup>, bringing home a total of RM37,500 in cash prizes.&nbsp;</p>

<title>‘Big Tech A Priority’ Says UK Financial Conduct Authority Chief Executive</title>

<div> Big Tech, FCA, data sharing, Open Banking, AI<br />
Summary:<br />
FCA plans to examine Big Tech's data access in financial services, incentivize data sharing, and collaborate with regulators for digital innovation. <div>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>In a speech delivered today, the FCA's Chief Executive Nikhil Rathi announced the regulator's plans to examine how Big Tech firms&rsquo; unique access to large sets of data could unlock better products, more competitive prices and wider choice for consumers and businesses.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p><span>The speech at a Digital Regulation Cooperation Forum (DRCF) event outlined Nikhil Rathi&rsquo;s focus on Big Tech as Chair of the DRCF, as well as the FCA&rsquo;s response to the Government&rsquo;s White Paper on Artificial Intelligence (AI), also published today.</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA&rsquo;s Big Tech plans are included today in a feedback statement to its call for input on data sharing between Big Tech and financial services firms. Currently, Big Tech firms can access financial services data through Open Banking but are not required to share their data with the financial industry.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Nikhil Rathi, Chief Executive at the FCA said:</span></span></p>
<p><span>&lsquo;Big Tech&rsquo;s growing emergence in financial services has already made life easier for consumers, but it is still unclear how valuable their data will become in financial markets.</span></p>
<p><span>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s why we want to work with Big Tech to examine how their data could be most helpful for financial firms and their customers in future, and to ensure competition evolves effectively.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p><span>If the FCA&rsquo;s analysis finds Big Tech data is valuable in financial services, it will look to incentivise more data sharing between Big Tech and financial firms through its Open Banking and broader Open Finance work. If it finds potential risk or harms from non-sharing of data it will also look to develop proposals for the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to consider when they are given powers to regulate designated firms&rsquo; digital and data conduct, expected via the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers (DMCC) Bill.</span></p>
<p><span>It also continues joint work with the Bank of England and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) on the role of critical third parties (CTPs) and artificial intelligence (AI).</span></p>
<p><span>Today the DRCF has also launched the AI and Digital Hub, a collaboration between regulators that enables innovators to get advice on issues that cross more than one DRCF regulator&rsquo;s remit.</span></p>

<title>Top 20 Global Biopharmaceutical Companies Report 9.6% Market Capitalization Growth In Q1 2024, Reveals GlobalData</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: Biopharmaceutical, Market capitalization, Growth, FDA approval, Medicare Drug Price Negotiation <br />
Summary: Top 20 biopharmaceutical companies saw 9.6% market cap growth. Perform well due to FDA approvals, strategic acquisitions, and strong sales.<br />Summary: In response to Medicare Drug Price Negotiation, the industry focuses on increasing drug prices and strengthening portfolios to address impending patent cliffs. <br /> <div>
<p>Despite the ongoing uncertainties surrounding macroeconomic activities, fluctuating interest rates, and changes in the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation landscape, the top 20 global biopharmaceutical companies experienced a promising first quarter this year. They reported a total increase of 9.6% in market capitalization from $3.67 trillion as on 31 December 2023 to $4 trillion as on 31 March 2024, reveals&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globaldata.com/who-we-are/mission-and-values/?utm_source=cision&amp;utm_medium=press-release&amp;utm_campaign=gd_corporate_pr-globaldata">GlobalData</a>, a leading data analytics and research company.</p>
<p>Over half of the top 20 pharma companies reported positive growth in market capitalization over Q1 2024, with seven companies- Lilly (33.7%), Novo Nordisk (23.8%), Merck &amp; Co (21.0%), AbbVie (17.8%), GSK (17.7%), Daiichi Sankyo (15.0%) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (10.4%)- reporting over 10% growth in market capitalization.</p>
<p>Ophelia Chan, MSc, Business Fundamentals Analyst at GlobalData, comments: &ldquo;Lilly maintains its lead with the largest market capitalization growth of 33.7% over Q1 2024, closely followed by Novo Nordisk, which saw a market capitalization of 23.8%, surpassing Johnson &amp; Johnson.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img alt="GlobalData_GlobalPharma_Q124-Q423" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/GlobalData_GlobalPharma_Q12.jpg" title="GlobalData_GlobalPharma_Q124-Q423" /></p>
<p>Lilly&rsquo;s market capitalization growth was driven by the strong sales of Mounjaro, its glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1) drug for treating type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, the FDA approval of Zepbound in November 2023, containing the same active ingredient as Mounjaro but for obesity treatment, further contributed to Lilly&rsquo;s growth. Mounjaro&rsquo;s global sales reached $5.3 billion in 2023 and is forecasted to achieve $12.3 billion in 2024, according to GlobalData&rsquo;s Drugs Database Pharma Intelligence Center.</p>
<p>Lilly&rsquo;s GLP-1 agonist rivals, Novo Nordisk had also witnessed a remarkable market capitalization growth owing to the success of its diabetes and obesity drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy, which reported sales of $13.5 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively, in 2023.</p>
<p>Merck &amp; Co&rsquo;s market capitalization growth of 21% was attributed to the US FDA approval of Winrevair, a treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). This approval marks the first FDA-approved activin-signaling inhibitor therapy for PAH.</p>
<p>AbbVie reported market capitalization growth of 17.8% in Q1 2024, driven by its strategic acquisitions. The acquisition of ImmunoGen, valued at $10.1 billion and definitive transaction worth $8.7 billion to acquire Cerevel Therapeutics, will bolster AbbVie&rsquo;s oncology and neuroscience portfolios.</p>
<p>GSK saw a 17.7% market capitalization growth fueled by its 12% revenue increase in 2023 (excluding COVID-19 solutions) and robust pipeline progress. Last year, GSK obtained approvals for four major products:&nbsp;<em>Arexvy</em>&nbsp;RSV vaccine,&nbsp;<em>Apretude</em>&nbsp;for HIV prevention,&nbsp;<em>Ojjaara</em>&nbsp;for myelofibrosis and&nbsp;<em>Jemperli</em>&nbsp;for endometrial cancer. These advancements aim to mitigate the impact of the upcoming patent loss of exclusivity for GSK&rsquo;s HIV blockbuster drug, Dolutegravir, starting in 2028.</p>
<p>Eight biopharmaceutical companies saw their market capitalization decline in Q1 2024, with Roche registering a market capitalization fall of 12.4%. This drop was mainly attributed to the reduced demand for COVID-19 related products. Nonetheless, Vabysmo, approved for wet macular degeneration in 2022, experienced a significant sales increase, tripling to $2.5 billion in 2023, reveals GlobalData&rsquo;s Drugs Database Pharma Intelligence Center.</p>
<p>Gilead Sciences reported a market capitalization decline of 9.6% over Q1 2024 primarily due to its drug Trodelvy (sacituzumab govitecan) failing to meet the primary endpoint of overall survival (OS) in the Phase III EVOKE-01 trial for previously treated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).</p>
<p>Chan concludes: &ldquo;In response to the evolving regulations, the industry is shifting its focus towards increasing drug prices as biopharmaceutical companies prepare for the Medicare negotiated prices set to take effect in September 2024. Additionally, companies are strengthening their portfolios to address impending patent cliffs.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Top 25 Global Insurers Market Value Up 8.3% QoQ In Q1 2024, Reveals GlobalData</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Shares surge, MCap growth, Progressive Corp, Allstate Corp, Berkshire Hathaway <br />
Summary: Insurance industry MCap grows 8.3% to $3.02 trillion. Progressive and Allstate record strong growth, while Humana and AIA Group struggle. Challenges and opportunities ahead. <div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.globaldata.com/company-profile/the-progressive-corp/">Progressive Corp</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globaldata.com/company-profile/the-allstate-corp/">Allstate Corp</a>&nbsp;shares surge 24%</li>
<li>Humana and AIA Group lose over 20%</li>
<li>Berkshire Hathaway stock continues to be to highly valued for the eighth consecutive quarter</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The aggregate market capitalization (MCap) of the top 25 global insurers grew 8.3% to $3.02 trillion on a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) basis during the first quarter (Q1) ended on 31 March 2024. Most of the stocks recorded a sharp growth in Q1, benefiting from the positive quarterly results, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globaldata.com/">GlobalData</a>, a leading data analytics and research company.</p>
<p>Murthy Grandhi, Company Profiles Analyst at GlobalData, comments: &ldquo;Insurers adjusted premiums in specific segments, notably property and casualty (P&amp;C) line, to counteract escalating claims expenses attributed to inflation, persistent geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, and natural calamities. These adjustments have allowed the global insurance industry to effectively address challenges and achieve positive results in the first quarter of 2024.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img alt="GlobalData_TopInsurers_Q1_24" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/GlobalData_TopInsurers_Q1_2.jpg" title="GlobalData_TopInsurers_Q1_24" /></p>
<p><span>Progressive Corp</span></p>
<p>Progressive Corp shares registered a remarkable 29.9% growth in market value during the first quarter of 2024, driven by the exceptional 2023 performance due to robust demand for insurance policies. The company&rsquo;s compelling portfolio, strong leadership position, and success in both vehicle and property sectors were the key contributors. Additionally, its healthy policies in force, high retention rates, and solid capital position significantly created demand for Progressive Corp stock.</p>
<p><span>Allstate Corp</span></p>
<p>Allstate Corp recorded an 11.1% year-over-year increase in total revenue for the fiscal year ending 31 December 2023, reaching $57.1 billion, which surpassed analyst projections. This notable performance was attributed to its recent merger with National General, enhancing its offerings in voluntary benefits and health businesses. Consequently, the company&rsquo;s market valuation also rose by 24.2%, reaching $45.5 billion by the end of Q1 2024.</p>
<p>Grandhi continues: &ldquo;Berkshire Hathaway witnessed a 17% increase in MCap attributed to its positive performance for the fiscal year ended 31 December 2023. The company achieved a total revenue of $364.5 billion and a net profit of $97.1 billion during this period. Additionally, its cash and cash equivalents reached $33.7 billion, reflecting a 4.3% rise from the $32.3 billion reported as of 31 December 2022. This has propelled the stock&rsquo;s upward trajectory, affirming Berkshire Hathaway&rsquo;s status as a coveted asset for the eighth consecutive quarter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Humana experienced a 25.8% decrease in market value, largely attributed to a modest 3.7% increase in payment rates for patients enrolled in Medicare Advantage (MA) plans by the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for 2025. However, the rate increase was adjusted based on the health status of plan enrollees. Despite the initial impression of an increase, industry analysts anticipate actual base payment rates for MA plans to decrease approximately by 0.16% in 2025. This downward adjustment is a result of the expected rise in medical service utilization and the escalating healthcare costs.</p>
<p>One of the top insurers to lose market value during Q1 2024 was AIA Group, which saw its market value eroding by 23.7%. This was primarily due to actions against it by the Insurance Authority and the Independent Commission Against Corruption addressing issues of non-compliance and corruption. This was specifically related to the unlicensed sale of insurance policies to visitors from mainland China via the broker channel.</p>
<p>Grandhi concludes: &ldquo;The insurance sector is poised for substantial changes in 2024, propelled by fluctuating reinsurance expenses and the escalating threat of cyber risks, fueled by rapid technological progress such as generative artificial intelligence. Industries worldwide are growing reliant on IT, IoT, operational technology, and digital services such as cloud computing, all integral components of numerous risk owners&rsquo; supply chains. Nevertheless, unforeseen challenges such as natural disasters, regulatory shifts, and continuing stand-off in and around Red Sea may keep insurers on their toes. Insurers capable of adapting, diversifying, and effectively managing risks stand to capitalize on potential growth opportunities amidst these evolving dynamics.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Imandra Launches AI Assistant For FIX Connectivity</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> neuro-symbolic architecture, FIX Wizard, automated reasoning, LLMs, financial protocols<br />
Summary:<br />
Imandra launches FIX Wizard, combining AI assistant and automated reasoning to address LLM shortcomings, providing logical reasoning for financial protocols and APIs.<br /> <div>
<ul>
<li> <strong><em><span>FIX Wizard is the first of Imandra's AI assistants that address fundamental shortcomings of LLMs</span></em></strong> </li>
<li> <strong><em><span>FIX Wizard is part of the Imandra Connectivity suite used by banks and trading firms</span></em></strong> </li>
<li> <strong><em><span>FIX Wizard builds on Imandra's new neuro-symbolic architecture for creating AI assistants that reason logically</span></em></strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span><br />Austin, TX - 22 April 2024:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Imandra Inc., the AI company pioneering industrial automated reasoning, today announced the launch of FIX Wizard for its FIX Connectivity suite used by banks and trading firms.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>FIX Wizard is Imandra's first AI assistant to be deployed across its product line. Built on Imandra's novel neuro-symbolic architecture, FIX Wizard automatically reasons about complex financial protocols and APIs, acting as an expert AI assistant for onboarding clients in capital markets.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>FIX Wizard combines statistical AI, used by LLMs, and Imandra's automated reasoning to create a powerful Generative AI assistant grounded in logic, with independently verifiable audit trails that meet stringent regulatory requirements. This approach addresses the fundamental shortcomings of applying LLMs in regulated markets, which include hallucinations, lack of scalability to unseen inputs and lack of validation of knowledge sources.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>"LLMs hold tremendous promise, but ultimately cannot be trusted in regulated environments. By combining their strengths with scalable, rigorous automated reasoning, we obtain a kind of magic: conversational interfaces with correct reasoning and domain-specific skills,"&nbsp;</span><strong><span>said Dr Grant Passmore, Co-CEO of Imandra.&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Today, capital markets run on a myriad of complex and interconnected trading systems. Historically, navigating PDF specifications of FIX interfaces was highly manual and error-prone. The industry has been working on initiatives like FIX Orchestra - a digitized representation of FIX specifications. Imandra takes this approach further by creating a full logical model of the API.</span></p>
<p><span>FIX Wizard uses Imandra's "digital twin" of a FIX gateway and automated reasoning to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li> <span>Answer questions about the FIX specification and rules of engagement</span> </li>
<li> <span>Analyze customer-provided FIX traffic, understand the underlying causes of issues and make recommendations on how to remedy them</span> </li>
<li> <span>Diagnose many issues at once, not just feeding back the first problem encountered</span> </li>
<li> <span>Give guidance on certification test cases and run conformance tests against the implementation&nbsp;</span> </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>"LLMs are good at translation and bad at reasoning. Automated Reasoning is bad at translation (i.e., requires you to be very precise) but incredible at reasoning. When we combine these techniques we get ground-breaking products that can be safely deployed in regulated environments,"&nbsp;</span><strong><span>said Denis Ignatovich, Co-CEO of Imandra.&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>How it works:</span></p>
<p><span>Imandra's interface with LLMs builds on years of Imandra's use within financial markets and government and defense. Imandra's underlying technology is capable of logical reasoning about "real-world" algorithms including complex financial trading systems, collision avoidance algorithms and neural networks. This scalability is the result of numerous scientific advances leveraged by the product and its cloud-native design.</span></p>
<p><span>Imandra's neuro-symbolic architecture alleviates LLM woes like hallucinations and incorrect "statistical reasoning." Imandra allows users to encode complex formal "mental models" of entities like API specifications, spreadsheets, knowledge bases, financial models, and more. The LLM then uses Imandra as a "reasoning assistant" where it formalizes its "thoughts" and asks Imandra to analyze their validity (e.g., with respect to regulations) and to perform complex reasoning for answering questions and synthesizing results.</span></p>
<p><span>Today, Imandra is working on several "Wizards" combining its reasoning engine with LLMs - including for SysML - a language used in Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) for designing complex systems in avionics, defense, automotive and other safety-critical industries.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The company has also released a Python API to allow others to easily build AI assistants incorporating Imandra's automated reasoning.</span></p>

<title>Appital Launches ‘Trending Equities’ To Drive Opportunistic Buyside Liquidity</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li> <span><strong>An industry first, the new functionality means that Appital technology now proactively stimulates market liquidity ahead of the event</strong></span> </li>
<li> <span><strong>Gives buyside traders and portfolio managers exposure to deals that may launch imminently&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span> </li>
<li> <span><strong>Enables deal originators to stimulate the market before launching a deal</strong></span> </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>London, 22 April 2024</strong>: Appital, the peer-to-peer price discovery and liquidity sourcing technology for asset managers, today announced the launch of a new functionality designed to drive opportunistic liquidity.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>
<p><span>&lsquo;Appital Trending Equities&rsquo; is an industry-first, innovative functionality within Appital Insights&trade; that enables deal originators on the buyside to proactively stimulate unique liquidity in the market ahead of launching a deal. At the same time, participating buyside firms gain exposure to deals that may launch imminently on the platform, in equities that are relevant to them and meet their minimum ADV or pricing thresholds.</span></p>
<p><span>This new functionality unlocks latent liquidity, drives the bookbuilding process and allows trading desks and PMs to become more opportunistic. They are now able to generate orders in the market that would otherwise not exist, resulting in liquidity events that are not occurring elsewhere.<br /></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Mark Badyra, CEO, Appital, said:&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;In today&rsquo;s fragmented market, the likelihood of having natural market contras at size, in multiple days ADV, which also match price ambitions, is incredibly unlikely. What&rsquo;s more, matching technology alone is no longer enough.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>
<p><span>With our latest innovation, Appital Trending Equities, we solve this problem. Buyside trading desks will receive a list of trending equities within the Appital platform, which they can discuss with their PMs to identify opportunities they wish to participate in. Traders and portfolio managers are empowered to discover and react to deal flow opportunities that are unique in the market, and generate alpha themselves.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This new functionality includes PMs in the deal flow and solves key challenges around decreasing liquidity in the lit market, reliance on the market close and a general reduction in high-touch sales trading and the associated liquidity opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span>&lsquo;Appital Trending Equities&rsquo; is now live and in use by asset managers who are already onboarded and using the Appital platform, gaining significant momentum. Approximately 50 indications have been discovered by opportunistic portfolio management teams totalling over $1bn in potential liquidity.</span></p>
<p><span>Predictions about liquidity events are generated from Appital Insights&trade;, which was launched in Q4 2023 and allows buyside institutions to assess the viability of executing larger ADV orders without alerting the market.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Brian Guckian, Chief Business Development Officer, Appital, added</strong>: &ldquo;Appital Trending Equities is becoming a valuable source of liquidity creation for the market. This is another milestone in our mission to be at the forefront of technological innovation in the equity market and deliver unique functionality to the buyside, unlike anything they have seen before.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We have seen great traction due to our neutral market position and the trust in our platform. Asset managers&nbsp;<span>are happy to share responses to Appital because we are not conflicted on the data and insights and&nbsp;</span>deal originators can better manage their risk before launching a bookbuild.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>To date, more than 40 asset managers with more than $15trn AUM are clients of Appital, with 60+ more in the onboarding stage, managing an additional $30trn AUM.&nbsp;</span></p>

The goal is to <b>enhance efficiency and increase the breadth and depth</b> of the Malaysian wealth management ecosystem and <b>position Malaysia as a competitive and attractive destination for both local and foreign investors</b>. &nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In February 2024, the SC <b>widened qualifications for sophisticated investors</b> to deepen the investor base for restricted products, including VC funds. In addition to wealth and income tests, a new category for knowledge and experience was introduced to assess if investors qualify&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 11px;">as sophisticated investors. &ldquo;</span><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">We believe that knowledge and&nbsp;</b><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">experience are just as valuable as wealth and income.&rdquo;</b></p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have also jointly committed with Bursa Malaysia <b>to speed-up IPO approvals to within 3-months </b>(previously it can take 6-months or&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 11px;">more) to ensure quick time to market for listings on Bursa Malaysia</span></p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Companies can also benefit from an <b>accelerated listing transfers from ACE to Main Market</b>, following amendments to the SC&rsquo;s Equity Guidelines effective 1 Jan 2024. The transfer is now almost automatic.</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SC has implemented <b>capacity building programmes to encourage corporate venturing as well as incentives</b> to encourage corporate investment in startups. SC is also exploring further efforts on corporate innovation, so do watch this space.</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SC, with the support of the Ministry of Finance, had also <b>implemented a successful co-investment scheme under the MyCIF programme</b>. &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>As of December 2023, MyCIF has <b>co-invested RM930 million in ECF and P2P campaigns, benefiting 6,328 MSMEs</b>. &nbsp;</li>
<li>MyCIF has <b>invested 3.7 times the total grant amount of RM250 million</b> by reinvesting returns from repayments and dividends into additional ECF and P2P campaigns by MSMEs. &nbsp;</li>
<li>The crowding-in effect of MyCIF led to a <b>3.5-fold increase in private investment in ECF and P2P from 2020 to 2023</b>. &nbsp;</li>
<li>New measures were also introduced to incentivise investments in agriculture and bio-economy, to drive innovation and sustainability in these sectors. </li>
<li>We are also looking at adding another RM100 million in the coinvestment space, to be managed by the SC </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(f) We are in the final stages of launching a <b>5-Year Roadmap designed to enhance access to capital market financing for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and Mid-Tier Companies (MTCs). </b>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>We are addressing the pressing issue of a significant financing gap faced by these companies. The Capital Market Master Plan 3 (CMP3) estimated a RM90 billion financing gap for MSMEs alone in 2017. &nbsp;</li>
<li>The importance of this initiative cannot be overstated, considering the important role that MSMEs and MTCs play in the Malaysian economy. </li>
<li>MSMEs account for 38% of the national GDP and 48% of employment, while&nbsp; MTCs account for 36% of the GDP and 16% of employment. &nbsp;</li>
<li>The Roadmap contains over 30 initiatives, encompassing 3 key pillars: (i) regulatory and product innovation; (ii) market infrastructure; and (iii) capacity building. &nbsp;</li>
<li>The Roadmap takes a &ldquo;whole-of-nation approach&rdquo; &ndash; emphasising the necessity of collaborative efforts among diverse stakeholders to unlock the full potential of MSMEs and MTCs, while fostering sustainable growth and development.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>VC Golden Pass</b></p>
<ol>
<li>As part of our comprehensive developmental plan, we are looking to welcome experienced international VCs looking to establish a strong presence in Malaysia to cater to both domestic and regional needs.&nbsp; In this regard, we will introduce a <b>VC Golden Pass, </b>designed to streamline the process of VC registration with the<b> SC for eligible international VCs setting up in Malaysia.</b> </li>
</ol>
<p>&bull; Under this purview, the SC is introducing a green lane process to&nbsp; expedite VC registration <b>from the current 6 weeks to 2 weeks,</b> subject upon the fulfilment of stipulated requirements under SC&rsquo;s Focused Scope Assessment framework. &nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>We are also pleased to announce the enhancement of the vetting process towards speedier issuances of Employement Pass to <b>facilitate relocation of non-Malaysian personnel</b>. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Together with the other agencies, we are also happy to connect VC firms with the local community, and potentially identify partners in their foray to tap into Malaysian and regional opportunities. </li>
<li>I would also encourage interested VCs and founders to explore other marquee initiatives under KL20, which offer incentives for locating near KL&rsquo;s vibrant startup community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p><b>VC Academy </b></p>
<ol>
<li>As part of SC&rsquo;s commitment to nurturing talent within the capital markets, SC will be introducing a comprehensive skills development programme tailored to professionals in the VC industry and the broader Malaysian private markets. &nbsp;</li>
</ol> 
<ul>
<li>SIDC, the SC&rsquo;s talent development arm, will introduce an array of capacity building programmes. &nbsp;</li>
<li>This will encompass a diverse range of offerings, including tailored courses and easily accessible public resources designed to cater to the needs of both seasoned veterans and aspiring entrants within the VC industry. </li>
<li>We will also extend our reach to include investors and service providers, ensuring a holistic and inclusive skill enhancement across the board.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ladies and gentleman,</p>
<ol>
<li>We are all excited to witness the convergence of numerous stakeholders rallying under the banner of KL20, united in vision of transforming Malaysia into an attractive and thriving hub for startups and VCs. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Rest assured, the SC stands steadfast in our commitment to do whatever it is necessary to promote this effort. &nbsp;</li>
<li>I believe private markets hold immense potential as a catalyst for propelling Malaysia&rsquo;s economy to new heights. It is an opportune moment for investors to bank on Malaysia&rsquo;s growing tech and industrial base and be part of the next success story. </li>
<li>I look forward to welcoming you to your presence in Malaysia. </li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you very much.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<title>A.I. Risks = Downfall Of Humanity, By Kelvin To, Founder And President Of Data Boiler Technologies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Patented, A.I., Risks, Governance, Cybersecurity
<br />
A.I. risks pose threats to humanity, including energy drain, addiction, optimization fallacies, market challenges, biased models, and ethical concerns.
<br /><br />Summary: A.I. Risks encompass energy drain, addiction risks, optimization fallacies, market challenges, biased models, and ethical concerns. <div>
<p>I am perturbed by those who do NOT understand Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) using <i>&ldquo;A.I. Risks&rdquo;</i> in an attempt to sell existing Governance Risk, Compliance (GRC), Business Continuity, Resiliency, Cybersecurity, Privacy, and non-discriminatory tools, and then regurgitate them as the <i>&ldquo;Foundations of a responsible A.I. risk management framework&rdquo;</i>. Prescribing the wrong framework undermines true A.I. risks and may inadvertently exacerbate the risks to humankind. Please allow me to explain why A.I. risks can be the downfall of humanity.</p>
<p>A.I. enables computers and machines to simulate human intelligence. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/human-intelligence-psychology">Human intelligence</a> is the <i>&ldquo;mental quality that consists of the abilities to learn from experience, adopt to new situations, understand and handle abstract concepts, and use knowledge to manipulate one&rsquo;s environment.&rdquo; </i>Automated intelligence and generic <a href="https://www.databoiler.com/index_htm_files/DataBoiler%20SEC%2020231010%20Predictive%20Analytics.pdf">predictive data analytics</a> are outside scope if the computer or machine is NOT performing functions to <i>&ldquo;simulate the mental quality of humans&rdquo;</i>. However, A.I. does NOT need to be autonomous to be within scope. Confining A.I. risks to covering only Artificial General Intelligence (A.G.I.) would be too narrow of a scope.</p>
<p>To truly understand A.I. risks, one should first make reference to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics">Asimov&rsquo;s Three Laws</a>: &ldquo;<i>machines</i> [1] <i>may not injure a human being, or through inaction, allow a human to come to harm; </i>[2]<i> must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such order would conflict with the Frist Law; </i>[3]<i> must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law</i>&rdquo;, plus the later introduced &ldquo;<a href="https://www.streetdirectory.com/travel_guide/120083/technology/the_fourth_law_of_robotics.html">Zeroth (Forth) Law</a>&rdquo;. Accordingly, Asimov&rsquo;s second and third laws depend on the first law about individual safety of a human. Due to ethical complexity, the Zeroth law emphasized on the broader humanity rather than individual. A bright-line test to A.I. risk is therefore, whether the disobedience, action, or inaction of A.I. would impair the livelihood of human(s), exacerbate the downfall of humanity, or pose existential threats to human(s).</p>
<p>Rather than commenting whether A.I. risks are remote or not, humankind should develop an urgency towards learning and adapting to an A.I.-filled environment where humans can master over it. The following is a list of A.I. risk examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>A.I. drains significant energy, analogy to mining crypto, that it could potentially bring down the energy grid. <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/sustainability/project-natick-underwater-datacenter/">Underwater cooling</a> and <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/pictures/photos-20-innovative-data-centers-that-gives-us-a-glimpse-of-the-future-of-computing/">other innovative approaches</a> are ways to deal with <a href="https://www.us.jll.com/en/newsroom/growth-of-ai-creates-unprecedented-demand-for-global-data-centers">unprecedented demand of data centers</a> given the growth of A.I. Yet, the efficiency of A.I. should be embedded in its design. Finding a needle in a haystack to rely on a &ldquo;black box&rdquo; neural network deep learning from a gigantic, centralized data vault, such as the FINRA <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/cat-outdated-design-since-2012-kelvin-to/">Consolidated Audit Trail</a> is highly inefficient. Decentralized/ Federated learning and analysis directly from data sources is a much better approach from cybersecurity, privacy, and resources saving perspectives.</li>
<li>A.I. molding people into machines or &lsquo;couch potatoes&rsquo; is another threat. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.01470v1">Reinforcement model</a>, <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-ads-audit-optimize-thatppcguy-spa/509185/">optimize AD algorithm</a>, and/or <a href="https://medium.com/ai-artistry/maximizing-rewards-with-policy-gradient-methods-and-monte-carlo-reinforcement-learning-part-46f2fd852cf0">learning methods</a> that lead to addictive, herd and/or polarized behaviors should be closely scrutinized. If we are against human slavery, then we should watch out for Authoritarians trying to use A.I. to exploit or destroy humans&rsquo; abilities to think independently. Indeed, there are <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/cs181/projects/ethics-of-surveillance/ethics.html">civic concerns</a> about massive government surveillance. </li>
<li>A.I. can recall every bit of big data to optimize and rationalize everything for a speedy and accurate decision, no average human being can match up. The irony is, if A.I. mimics the human brains like the Nobel Winner &ndash; Daniel Kahneman&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect_theory">Prospect Theory</a> (book: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555">Thinking, fast and slow</a>), where <i>&ldquo;division of labor between System 1</i> (fast, intuitive, and automatic)&nbsp; <i>and System 2</i> (slow, effortful, and logical)<i> minimizes effort and optimizes performance&rdquo;</i>, then would A.I. have the same fallacies influenced by <i>&ldquo;loss aversion, certainty, and isolation effect&rdquo;</i>? A.I. has driven modern society towards the risk of hyper optimization. Do we want consistency and act rationally every time to undermine humans&rsquo; unique ability to think laterally and/or selectively forget about things? These mental qualities reflect our human imperfections, while the last defense against A.I. relies on Eureka derives from <a href="https://www.ias.edu/sites/default/files/library/UsefulnessHarpers.pdf">usefulness of the useless knowledge</a>. So, before you wish A.I. to give consistent and rational answers (output reliance), or not, be careful.</li>
<li>A.I. exacerbates the 21<sup>st</sup> century challenges, include: a rebellious move by an insurgent with a war chest to orchestrate a market wide shake-up, global <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/stadc2021-great-return-decoupling-kelvin-to-1e/">decoupling</a>, and foreign adversaries wanting to see the US engage in unhealthy competition to possibly erode the US&rsquo;s prominent market position. Many may claim to be &lsquo;Nomad&rsquo; when they represent the &lsquo;Corpo&rsquo;. While &lsquo;Street Kid&rsquo; may not be the underserved and the most vulnerable that people stereotyped. In the cyberpunk era, be mindful of the gap and realize that an inverse relation between <a href="https://www.databoiler.com/index_htm_files/DataBoiler%20Treasury%20Digital%20Assets%20202208.pdf">DeFi and CeFi</a>. Rather than punishing all tech innovations, the ability to delineate good and bad actors is essential to mitigate this risk. </li>
<li>A.I. is like the News media. <i>&ldquo;There are multiple versions of truth. The news, while attempting to inform, often selectively highlights certain aspects rather than recording everything in its entirety&rdquo;</i> (acclaimed author Alain de Botton&rsquo;s book: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/News-Users-Manual-Alain-Botton/dp/0307379124">The News: A User&rsquo;s Manual</a>). "Bias" is an interesting topic, amidst different A.I. models have different tradeoff between tractability versus realism. This <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4763575">empirical research</a> by the US Treasury O.C.C. and the Rensselaer Polytechnical Institute and University College Dublin about <i>&ldquo;machine learning model complexity in capturing the information processing costs that lead to information asymmetry in financial markets&rdquo;</i> is worth reading. It is NOT about over/ under-representation of a population cohort, whilst majority of data consumed by A.I. is inherently biased towards English and precluding other languages. Nemil Dalal argued that <i>&ldquo;today&rsquo;s biggest threat to democracy isn&rsquo;t fake news </i>[Hallucination] <i>&mdash;it&rsquo;s </i><a href="https://qz.com/1130094/todays-biggest-threat-to-democracy-isnt-fake-news-its-selective-facts"><i>selective facts</i></a><i>.&rdquo;</i> A group of academia has launched a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.16787.pdf">Data Provenance Initiative</a> to address concerns about legal and ethical risks face by practitioners in the A.I. community. What constitutes Fair, Reasonable, and Non-Discriminatory? I recommend assessing the divergence between private rights and <a href="https://iea.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/THE%20MYTH%20OF%20SOCIAL%20COST.pdf">social costs</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do NOT get me wrong, as an inventor of patented solutions (US and Canada, pending in EPO and other regions) in signal processing, ensemble learning, trading, etc., I understand why policy makers around the world are scrambling to regulate <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/a-focused-federal-agency-is-necessary-to-oversee-big-tech/">Big-TECH</a> and A.I. <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-21/money-scams-deepfakes-ai-will-drive-10-trillion-in-financial-fraud-and-crime">Deepfake</a> imposter scams are driving a new wave of fraud. <a href="https://time.com/5872868/big-tech-regulated-here-is-4-ways/">Disinformation and privacy issues</a> should be a concern for society and government.</p>
<p>If regulatory policy goal is to promote explicability that provides appropriate &lsquo;contexts&rsquo; of A.I. and ensures its &lsquo;fit-for-purpose&rsquo;, then there is merit in establishing relevant guidelines. However, if allowing the incapable to manage the capable for subjective judgment over an A.I. being <i>&ldquo;opaque or overly complex training techniques make it difficult to understand how predictions are made, which poses risks for issue root cause analysis and for interactions with regulators and other interested parties&rdquo;,</i> then it would be a disaster. The foundation of a responsible A.I. is NOT about how good one person can articulate or reveal the secret ingredients of an A.I. to others. Indeed, government gathering of, and the more people know about these A.I. secret ingredients, the higher risk (e.g. <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3547903">function creep</a>) there will be for the society.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a token limitation may be the one weakness of Large Language Model. A.I. can deploy countless &lsquo;agents&rsquo; to avert hackers. Can a &ldquo;virus&rdquo; to overflow the system be used as a last resort method to stop A.I. upon a conflict with Asimov&rsquo;s first, second, or forth law? Or should every A.I. be mandated a kill-switch/ circuit breaker to fulfill Asimov&rsquo;s third law? Stephen Hawking <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-30290540">warns</a> A.I. could end humankind. It takes unconventional wisdom for a Eureka moment amid the race between A.I. and humans. Embrace difficult challenges would help us to <a href="https://www.nsca.org/learn-unlearn-relearn-becoming-change-ready/">learn, unlearn, and relearn</a> in the 21<sup>st</sup> century to prevent a downfall of humanity and address A.I. risks.</p>

<div> fees, restricted dealers, OSC, registration, amendments
Summary: The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) published fee rule amendments for restricted dealers, introducing new fees and changes to registered firm definition.<br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) announced today the publication of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/securities-law/instruments-rules-policies/1/13-502/amendments-osc-rule-13-502-fees-osc-rule-13-503-commodity-futures-act-fees-changes-their-7">final amendments</a>&nbsp;to its fee rules for restricted dealers, or firms that have been permitted to carry on business under terms and conditions imposed by the OSC.</p>
<p>The OSC published the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/news-events/news/osc-seeks-comment-proposed-fee-changes-restricted-dealers">proposed fee changes</a>&nbsp;for public comment on November 10, 2023.</p>
<p>The amendments introduce two new fees for restricted dealers:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>an additional fee of $24,500 at the time of OSC registration; and</li>
<li>an additional exemptive relief application fee of $24,500 for restricted dealers operating as a marketplace.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fee changes are intended to address and recover additional regulatory costs associated with registering restricted dealers, which include the majority of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/industry/registration-and-compliance/registered-crypto-asset-trading-platforms" target="_blank">crypto asset trading platforms</a>. The OSC continues to observe higher onboarding costs for this registrant category when compared to most existing market participants.</p>
<p>The final amendments also include changes to the definition of &ldquo;registered firm&rdquo; in its fee rules to include individuals or companies required to be registered under Ontario securities law. These changes, if approved, would mean that a non-compliant, unregistered firm operating in Ontario is responsible for paying the same participation fees as a registered firm.</p>
<p>The final&nbsp;amendments&nbsp;can be found on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/securities-law/instruments-rules-policies/1/13-502/amendments-osc-rule-13-502-fees-osc-rule-13-503-commodity-futures-act-fees-changes-their-7">OSC&rsquo;s website</a>&nbsp;and will come into force on July 2, 2024, pending Ministerial approval.</p>
<p>The mandate of the OSC is to provide protection to investors from unfair, improper or fraudulent practices, to foster fair, efficient and competitive capital markets, and confidence in the capital markets, to foster capital formation, and to contribute to the stability of the financial system and the reduction of systemic risk. Investors are urged to check the registration of any persons or company offering an investment opportunity and to review the OSC investor materials available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/">https://www.osc.ca</a>.</p>

<title>Hong Kong Securities And Futures Commission Welcomes SEHK’s Conclusions On Climate-Related Disclosure Requirements For Listed Companies</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/hong-kong-securities-and-futures-commission-welcomes-sehks-conclusions-on-clima-1/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/hong-kong-securities-and-futures-commission-welcomes-sehks-conclusions-on-clima-1/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) today welcomes the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited&rsquo;s (SEHK) publication of its consultation conclusions on the enhancement of climate-related disclosure requirements for listed companies in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The new climate-related disclosure requirements, which will be implemented in phases starting from 1 January 2025, is the first step to align local sustainability disclosure requirements with the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards published by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), as part of Hong Kong&rsquo;s overall strategy to develop a comprehensive sustainability disclosure ecosystem. SEHK has also published an Implementation Guidance to assist listed companies in complying with the new requirements (Notes 1 and 2).</p>
<p>&ldquo;The new regime on climate-related disclosures will give listed companies in Hong Kong a head-start in speaking the common international language of the ISSB to the investing public and capital markets.&nbsp; A balanced, proportionate and phased approach has been adopted when devising the new regime, notably taking into account a majority of Hong Kong-listed companies are mainly from Mainland China or have businesses on the Mainland and in Asia,&rdquo; said Ms Julia Leung, the SFC&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Climate-related reporting by listed companies will address investors&rsquo; needs for more relevant, consistent and comparable information as climate transition finance in Asia moves into a high gear and Hong Kong&rsquo;s role as a leading international sustainable finance centre becomes even more important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To achieve the goal of introducing ISSB-aligned Hong Kong sustainability reporting standards, the SFC will continue to work closely with the Government, SEHK, and other relevant stakeholders to provide a transparent and well-defined pathway on sustainability reporting for businesses (Note 3).</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>The new Listing Rules requirements are developed based on the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) S2 Climate-related Disclosures published by the ISSB in June 2023 while the Implementation Guidance contains references to IFRS S1 General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information.</li>
<li>In March 2024, the HKSAR Government&nbsp;<a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202403/25/P2024032500391_452899_1_1711358339971.pdf" target="_blank">issued</a>&nbsp;a Vision Statement on developing a comprehensive ecosystem for sustainability disclosure in Hong Kong.</li>
<li>The Hong Kong Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group has set up a dedicated working group to develop Hong Kong&rsquo;s roadmap on the appropriate adoption of the ISSB Standards, which is co-led by the SFC and the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, with members comprising other financial regulators, the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited and stakeholders including the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA). The HKICPA will develop the Hong Kong sustainability reporting standards.</li>

<title>ACER Assesses The Tariff Methodology Proposed For The Czech Gas Transmission System</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> ACER, Czech, gas, transmission, tariffs
Summary:
ACER recommends transparency and consistency, additional information on risk premium, details on revenue reconciliation, and monitoring of flow-based charge. 
Next steps: ERO to adopt new tariff methodology by 19 October 2024.<br /><br /> <div>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is the report about?</span></span></p>
<p><span>Today, ACER releases its report on the Czech gas transmission tariffs proposed for 2025 by the Energetick&yacute; regulačn&iacute; &uacute;řad (ERO), the National Regulatory Authority (NRA) of the Czech Republic.</span></p>
<p><span>Recent changes in the patterns of the European gas imports (resulting from Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine) have led to the underutilisation of the Czech natural gas transmission infrastructure. Additionally, future flows into the network face considerable uncertainty due to the termination of the transit contract for gas transportation through Ukraine scheduled by the end of 2025.</span></p>
<p><span>To address these issues, ERO proposes to apply:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>A capacity weighted distance methodology as the reference price methodology (RPM).</span></li>
<li><span>Several mechanisms to address this volume risk, including the implementation of a price cap regime and a risk premium. These mechanisms aim at allocating the existing risk to the TSO. The NRA recommends applying these measures until the end of 2025, when greater stability and visibility on gas flows across the EU is expected.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What does ACER recommend?</span></span></p>
<p><span>ACER analysed the information provided by ERO and assessed the compliance of the proposed RPM against the requirements of the Network Code on Harmonised Transmission Tariff Structures (<a href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsPBlIJUVgFAUwMAQMGHVZYBQYdUAwAAhoCV1YHAQsFUw5QAAAdVAACVFoPAgUdVw4BAx0GClAAGlRcUQUZBgNWAQAACFFQBwBQRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" target="_blank">NC TAR</a>), providing the following recommendations:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Ensure transparency and consistency of the proposed reference price methodology.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Provide additional information on the risk premium collected by the TSO in 2021 and 2022.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Provide further details on the revenue reconciliation and revenue sharing mechanisms, proposed by ERO to mitigate the volume risk of the network.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Monitor and analyse the differences between the flow-based charge applicable to domestic exit points and the one applied to Interconnection Points&rsquo; (IPs&rsquo;) exits.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the next steps?</span></span></p>
<p><span>By 19 October 2024, ERO shall adopt a motivated decision on the new tariff methodology to be applied to the Czech transmission network, taking into account ACER&rsquo;s analysis.</span></p>

<p class="spanHeading">The Exchange received 115 responses from a wide range of respondents, and received broad-based support for its proposals to introduce the new requirements. In view of this market feedback, the Exchange will adopt its consultation proposals.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span class="spanHeading">In reaching its conclusions, the Exchange took into account the Hong Kong Government&rsquo;s vision and approach towards developing a comprehensive ecosystem for sustainability disclosure in Hong Kong<span>2&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;and the International Sustainability Standards Board&rsquo;s (</span>ISSB)<span class="spanHeading">&nbsp;jurisdictional guide preview<span>3</span>.

<title>ACER’s Monitoring Shows EU LNG Imports Might Be Near Its Peak</title>

<div> EU, LNG, market, infrastructure, gas
<br />
ACER's report finds EU secured gas supply diversification, increased LNG infrastructure, peak demand in 2024, and potential shifting reliance on spot market.
<br /><br />Summary: <br /> EU secured gas supply diversification, increased LNG infrastructure, peak demand in 2024, potential shifting reliance on spot market. <div>
<p>Today&rsquo;s ACER European LNG Market Monitoring Report (MMR) analyses global and EU market developments and recommends further actions to improve&nbsp;transparency, competition and flexibility in European LNG terminals.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What 2023 trends did ACER&rsquo;s monitoring and data insights find?</span></p>
<ul>
<li>During the energy crisis,&nbsp;<strong>EU successfully secured gas supply</strong>&nbsp;and diversified gas imports away from Russia, with LNG playing a key role in this shift.</li>
<li>Since 2022,&nbsp;<strong>over 50 bcm of new LNG regasification infrastructure</strong>&nbsp;in the EU has eased supply congestion and helped narrow the price gap between European gas hubs and LNG spot prices.</li>
<li><strong>EU is the biggest LNG import market</strong>&nbsp;(with 134 bcm of LNG imports in 2023), and the US&nbsp;the largest exporter (119 bcm in 2023).</li>
<li>In 2023,&nbsp;<strong>Europe imported 18 bcm of Russian LNG</strong>, mostly from long-term contracts signed before 2022.&nbsp;At least 1 bcm, but possibly more, is re-exported to Asian markets through LNG reloads.</li>
<li><strong>EU LNG demand is likely to reach its peak in 2024</strong>. This is due to reductions in structural gas demand&nbsp;driven by the EU&rsquo;s ambitious decarbonisation goals.</li>
<li>19 global liquefaction projects under construction are set to boost LNG production by circa&nbsp;<strong>200 million tonnes by 2030,</strong>&nbsp;equivalent to half of the current yearly trade.</li>
<li>Around 75% of the LNG import capacity added in the EU since 2022 are&nbsp;<strong>Floating Storage and Regasification Units (FSRUs).&nbsp;</strong>This&nbsp;allows for the potential repurposing or relocation of these floating infrastructure should their utilisation significantly decline.</li>
<li>The targeted gas demand cut scenario of REPowerEU (if it materialises by 2030) could shift EU's reliance on the spot LNG market,&nbsp;<strong>turning a 49 bcm &lsquo;under-contracted&rsquo; status in 2023 to an &lsquo;over-contracted&rsquo; position of 30 to 40 bcm</strong>&nbsp;between 2027-2030. Under-contracted means insufficient long-term contractual commitments increasing buyers&rsquo; reliance on the more volatile spot market. Over-contracted means the long-term contracts exceed the demand. Nonetheless, the surplus in long-term commitments should not pose a burden thanks to the flexibility of free-on-board (FOB) contracts, which enable surplus LNG to be sold on the spot market or redirected elsewhere.</li>
<li>Contrary to the general belief,&nbsp;<strong>the EU remains more dependent on long-term than on spot LNG contracts</strong>&nbsp;(2 thirds vs 1 third). TTF serves as the predominant indexation term for EU spot contracts (64%), but not for long-term ones (where Henry-hub and Brent indexations are dominant).</li>
</ul>

<div> Washington, FATF, Ministers, global financial system, illicit activity
Summary:<br /><br />Ministers reaffirmed FATF's role in global financial system protection, combatting terrorist financing, preventing sanctions evasion, strengthening financial transparency, and combating systemic corruption. <div>
<p>Today, Ministers representing the 40 members of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) met in Washington and reaffirmed the FATF&rsquo;s role in protecting the global financial system from illicit activity. Ministers committed the FATF to taking further action to combat terrorist financing and endorsed additional work to prevent sanctions evasion related to proliferation finance. Ministers also agreed to continue efforts to strengthen the legal and operational frameworks for financial transparency and asset recovery to combat systemic corruption and seize illicit proceeds.&nbsp; Finally, the Ministers agreed to increase resources for the FATF to support the upcoming round of mutual evaluations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Ministers also reiterated their position that the Russian Federation&rsquo;s ongoing, illegal, unprovoked, and unjustified invasion of Ukraine runs counter to the FATF&rsquo;s core principles and represents a gross violation FATF Standards and Ministerial commitments. The Ministers called for jurisdictions to remain vigilant of threats to the integrity, safety, and security of the international financial system arising from the Russian Federation&rsquo;s war against Ukraine.</p>
<p><em>As Prepared for Delivery</em></p>
<p>Thank&nbsp;you, Minister Rajah.&nbsp;I want to welcome Indonesia as the newest FATF member and commend the FATF in successfully meeting its 2022 ministerial commitment on global anti-corruption efforts. I support the FATF&rsquo;s priorities in the Ministerial Declaration and&nbsp;welcome&nbsp;increasing the core budget for the upcoming biennium as the FATF prepares to undertake the next assessment round.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am fully aware of the accountability and pressure that the FATF has brought to bear to address the largest structural deficiency from our 2016 MER on transparency for legal persons. I am proud that the FATF recognized Treasury&rsquo;s long and diligent efforts to rectify this major gap in our AML/CFT framework through the Corporate Transparency Act and the CDD Rule.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also believe it is essential that the FATF continue to emphasize terrorist financing work as a core part of its mandate. We especially must do more to ensure that financial facilitators of terrorist organizations from ISIS to Hamas and Hizballah cannot access the global financial system to further their agenda and cause harm to innocent civilians. In light of the escalatory actions in the Middle East, it is important that the FATF continues to hold Iran accountable for its failure to comply with the FATF standards. I also want to recognize the FATF&rsquo;s historic decision in 2023 to suspend Russia from this body and to condemn Russia&rsquo;s growing financial connectivity with North Korea and Iran.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FATF&rsquo;s work to combat WMD proliferation financing is now more important than ever. We welcome additional efforts by the FATF to assist countries to mitigate proliferation financing risks. Thank you.</p>

<div> IFAD, Murban crude, trading activity, record volume, global market
Summary:
ICE's Murban futures market sets record trading activity with over 1.1 million contracts in Q1 2024. Murban is now a global benchmark for crude oil. <div>
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced record trading activity in Murban crude as ICE Futures Abu Dhabi (IFAD) marks its third anniversary.</p>
<p>IFAD and ICE&rsquo;s Murban futures market launched in March 2021 with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) and nine of the world&rsquo;s largest energy traders as founding partners.</p>
<p>In the first quarter of 2024, ICE&rsquo;s Murban futures market hit record traded volume of over 1.1 million contracts and in March reached record average daily volume of 21,454 contracts, up 152% year-over-year (y/y). On April 15, 2024, Murban futures hit a single day volume record with 36,464 contracts traded. Murban futures have reached a series of open interest records through the start of the 2024 with OI up 33% y/y.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three years on from launch, we, together with ADNOC and our partners, have built a truly global Murban futures market which sits alongside benchmark crude grades Brent and Midland WTI,&rdquo; said Gary King, President, ICE Futures Abu Dhabi. &ldquo;ADNOC&rsquo;s vision to move the official selling price for Murban to forward pricing based on ICE Murban futures opened Murban to a global audience and it now has international reach and relevance in the global crude market, further reflected by Bloomberg&rsquo;s decision to launch a Murban crude oil index aimed at tracking the performance of Murban futures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since IFAD launched, almost 6 million Murban futures contracts have traded, the equivalent to approximately 6 billion barrels of Murban crude oil, as 244 million barrels of Murban have been delivered through IFAD. Over 150 participants have traded on IFAD to date from across the United States, Europe, Asia and the Middle East, including commercial and financial participants.</p>
<p>Murban is part of ICE&rsquo;s global oil complex covering over 800 futures and options contracts, centered around Brent which is used to price over three quarters of the world&rsquo;s internationally traded crude oil. ICE&rsquo;s extensive global commodity markets, including benchmark oil and natural gas contracts, hit record trading activity in the first quarter of 2024 with almost 5 million contracts traded, surpassing the previous record set in the first quarter of 2020.</p>

<div> Conviction, Fraud, Cryptocurrency, Manipulation, Investigation
Summary:
Man convicted of cryptocurrency fraud, manipulation, and wire fraud, defrauding an exchange and its investors of $110 million. FBI investigation and NCET involvement. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>A federal jury in New York convicted a man residing in Puerto Rico today of commodities fraud, commodities market manipulation, and wire fraud in connection with the manipulation on the Mango Markets decentralized cryptocurrency exchange.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, Avraham Eisenberg, 28, engaged in a scheme to fraudulently obtain approximately $110 million worth of cryptocurrency from Mango Markets and its customers by artificially manipulating the price of certain perpetual futures contracts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Avraham Eisenberg executed a manipulative trading scheme on a cryptocurrency exchange, defrauding the exchange and its investors out of $110 million,&rdquo; said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department&rsquo;s Criminal Division. &ldquo;Manipulative trading puts our financial markets and investors at risk. This prosecution&mdash;the first involving the manipulation of cryptocurrency through open-market trades&mdash;demonstrates the Criminal Division&rsquo;s commitment to protecting U.S. financial markets and holding wrongdoers accountable, no matter what mechanism they use to commit manipulation and fraud.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moments ago, Avraham Eisenberg was found guilty by a unanimous jury in the first-ever cryptocurrency market manipulation case,&rdquo; said U.S. Attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York. &ldquo;This ground-breaking prosecution epitomizes this office&rsquo;s ability to employ innovative methods and cutting-edge law enforcement tools to continue to protect all financial markets. The career prosecutors of this office continue their expertise in prosecuting financial fraud, one of our core priorities, and would-be financial criminals should think twice before daring to engage in illicit conduct on our watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The FBI and its partners will not stand by when criminals engage in illicit activity at the expense of the American people and our financial institutions,&rdquo; said Executive Assistant Director Timothy Langan of the FBI&rsquo;s Criminal, Cyber, Response, and Services Branch. &ldquo;If you engage in fraudulent activity, whether that be in the cryptocurrency space or through other forms of market manipulation, you will be held accountable for your ill-gotten gains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eisenberg is scheduled to be sentenced on July 29 and faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison on the commodities fraud count and the commodities manipulation count, and a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison on the wire fraud count. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p>
<p>The FBI investigated the case, with assistance from Homeland Security Investigations and IRS Criminal Investigation.</p>
<p>Trial Attorney and Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Tian Huang of the Criminal Division&rsquo;s Fraud Section, a member of the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET), and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Thomas Burnett and Peter Davis for the Southern District of New York are prosecuting the case.</p>
<p>The NCET was established to combat the growing illicit use of cryptocurrencies and digital assets. Within the Criminal Division&rsquo;s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, the NCET conducts and supports investigations into individuals and entities that are enabling the use of digital assets to commit and facilitate a variety of crimes, with a particular focus on virtual currency exchanges, mixing and tumbling services, and infrastructure providers. The NCET also works to set strategic priorities regarding digital asset technologies, identify areas for increased investigative and prosecutorial focus, and lead the department&rsquo;s efforts to collaborate with domestic and foreign government agencies as well as the private sector to aggressively investigate and prosecute crimes involving cryptocurrency and digital assets.</p>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The OCC uses enforcement actions against an institution-affiliated party (IAP) to deter, encourage correction of, or prevent violations, unsafe or unsound practices, or breaches of fiduciary duty. Enforcement actions against IAPs reinforce the accountability of individuals for their conduct regarding the affairs of a bank. The term &ldquo;institution-affiliated party,&rdquo; or IAP, is defined in 12 USC 1813(u) and includes bank directors, officers, employees, and controlling shareholders. Orders of Prohibition prohibit an individual from any participation in the affairs of a bank or other institution as defined in 12 USC 1818(e)(7). Actions taken against IAPs are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span><a href="https://www.occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/eaAA-ENF-2024-10.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Order of Prohibition and Order for Civil Money Penalty</a>&nbsp;against Norman Desembrana,</span>&nbsp;Former Operations Senior Manager at the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, lockbox facility of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Sioux Falls, South Dakota, for concealing a significant backlog of unprocessed customer checks. The assessed civil money penalty is $40,000. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2024-10)</li>
<li><span><a href="https://www.occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/eaAA-ENF-2023-74.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Order of Prohibition and Order for Civil Money Penalty</a>&nbsp;against Gary Judd,</span>&nbsp;Former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Sterling Bank and Trust, FSB, Southfield, Michigan, for failing to appropriately oversee the bank&rsquo;s operation of its Advantage Loan Program or supervise bank insiders involved in the implementation of the Advantage Loan Program.

The assessed civil money penalty is $400,000. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2023-75)</li>
<li><span><a href="https://www.occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/eaAA-ENF-2024-22.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Order of Prohibition</a>&nbsp;against Jackie M. Snider,</span>&nbsp;Former Assistant Vice President at a Sulphur, Oklahoma, branch of Vision Bank, N.A., Ada, Oklahoma, for misappropriating at least $95,430 via the diversion of funds from customers&rsquo; accounts and taking efforts to conceal such misappropriation. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2024-22)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The OCC issues prohibition/suspension orders against individuals in response to certain criminal conduct. Pursuant to 12 USC 1818(g), in the case of a conviction against an IAP related to certain criminal violations, the OCC will issue an order prohibiting the IAP from any participation in affairs of a bank or other institution as defined in 12 USC 1818(e)(7). Such actions taken against IAPs are:</p>

<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>We want to strike a balance between encouraging competition and innovation and advancing our other operational objectives.</li>

<li>We welcome international firms but want them to operate in a way that protects consumers and market integrity.</li>
</ul>
<br /> 
<hr />
<p>Today is International Jugglers&rsquo; Day.</p>
<p>The art and skill of juggling dates back to at least 2000 BC. Representations of jugglers were found inside Egyptian tombs.</p>
<p>And in China, skilled juggling warriors distracted their opponents in battle with their acrobatic skills, allowing their army to ambush the dazzled rivals.</p>
<p>You will be relieved to hear I will not attempt to bamboozle you with any such live tricks today. Nor do I plan to make any new policy announcements &ndash; something I know your compliance teams will thank me for.</p>
<p>Juggling is, at least metaphorically, a skill we regulators have to master.</p>
<p>Whether it is balancing the demands of consumers, markets, firms. Or our multiple objectives.&nbsp;Or &ndash; as I will argue today &ndash; the various elements of regulation that contribute to growth.</p>
<h2>Accountability</h2>
<p>That juggling act is recognised in the&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.thecityuk.com/media/jlxk0uct/advancing-international-competitiveness-and-economic-growth-how-do-financial-regulators-compare.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">report<span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;published&nbsp;by TheCityUK and Freshfields.</p>
<p>It is no secret that our hosts can be tough on us regulators &ndash; and rightly so. I was, therefore, pleased to read that our role as a leading financial regulator is recognised.</p>
<p>That is perhaps a product of a notable shift in engagement that I have heard a number of you comment on over the last year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we have set about delivering on our new competitiveness mandate, I have heard from many firms how good it is to be able to engage constructively with us regulators rather than only when things go wrong. You&rsquo;ve told me how good it is to be able to engage direct on regulatory reform &ndash; to speak to regulators openly and before rules are formulated, not afterwards in the courtroom.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s report from TheCityUK concludes few, if any, of the 21 other jurisdictions studied have published metrics equivalent to those of UK regulators.</p>
<p>While other regulators do also have objectives around growth and international competitiveness, we are recognised as providing world-leading standards of accountability and transparency.</p>
<p>The objectives of regulators around the world do, of course, differ. That, as the report&rsquo;s authors acknowledge, makes international comparisons difficult.</p>
<p>TheCityUK&rsquo;s suggestion of working on an international benchmarking framework that would include qualitative analysis as well as other metrics is one that we will, therefore, actively engage with. Because good benchmarks, although difficult they might be in practice to deliver, would support others in holding us to account.</p>
<p>Last year, we published our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/corporate/secondary-international-competitiveness-growth-objective-statement.pdf" title="secondary-international-competitiveness-growth-objective-statement.pdf">framework for implementing the secondary objective</a>, showing how regulation can influence growth through 7 drivers of productivity.</p>
<p>One significant element is our own operational performance.</p>
<p>Following entirely justified criticism of the length of time it was taking some to become authorised or approved, we stepped up. We also started to share in greater detail our own&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/data/fca-authorisations-operating-service-metrics-2023-24-q3" title="FCA Authorisations operating service metrics 2023/24 Q3">performance metrics on a quarterly basis</a>, to support the drive to improve our delivery so others could hold us to account for achieving it.</p>
<p>Today, 97% of authorisation cases are assessed within statutory deadlines. Better applications take the least time. Senior Managers and Certification Regime (SMCR) applications take on average 40 days, 50 days ahead of deadlines.</p>
<p>Central to achieving that was not just more resource, though there was. Or more investment in tech and training, though there was that too. But greater commerciality &ndash; and a relentless focus on balancing all of our statutory objectives.</p>
<p>And in authorisations, in particular, we have driven improvements by bringing together private sector commercial experience at Executive Director and Director level, and matched it with deep Director-level regulatory experience. That combination of commerciality and regulatory experience is something we are focusing on more broadly as we drive changes in the way we operate.</p>
<p>But we should never focus only on the areas that are straightforward to measure. Stats alone won&rsquo;t tell the whole story.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And we need to be mindful that it is how these different elements of regulation work together to ensure a regulatory environment to support the attractiveness of a market.</p>
<p>Take crypto. We continue to hear concerns raised about the length of time it can take for some cryptoasset firms to be registered by us for anti-money laundering purposes.</p>
<p>Some complain that too few meet the bar for entry. The argument is we should be faster, let more in.</p>
<p>Achieving that would be easy to measure. Pretty bar charts could decorate our annual report. We could pat ourselves on the back for better operational efficiency and speed of authorisation, one of the drivers of productivity I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>But a simple focus on numbers could undermine trust and reputation &ndash; another of our productivity drivers. Lower standards could leave open our market to abuse by those who seek to launder criminally made cash, damaging market integrity and confidence in financial markets.</p>
<p>Instead, we take a longer view. Crypto&rsquo;s success &ndash; and the success of any base for crypto firms &ndash; relies on trust being built and maintained.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sustainable growth relies, after all, on faith in the system.</p>
<h2>International cooperation</h2>
<p>International cooperation and development of consistent global standards are central to the level playing field on which true competitiveness relies, rather than the simple &ndash; and perhaps easier to measure regulatory arbitrage.</p>
<p>The relationships built carefully over decades by the FCA are helping us lead international discussions on issues of risk that fail to stick neatly to national jurisdictions. Those links enable us to make sure markets can work well effectively and efficiently across borders.</p>
<p>Take Non-Bank Financial Intermediation (NBFI). Our Chief Executive, Nikhil Rathi, co-chairs the Financial Stability Engagement Group (FSEG) at IOSCO. One significant area of focus for this group is international policy work on leverage, liquidity risk in open-ended funds, and fund preparedness for margin and collateral calls. And I am co-chairing work with the European Central Bank on the financial stability risks posed by leverage in NBFI under the Financial Stability Board&rsquo;s (FSB) Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Cooperation.</p>
<p>And LIBOR. As I speak to you today, sterling LIBOR is no more.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/news-stories/us-dollar-libor-panel-has-now-ceased" title="The US dollar LIBOR panel has now ceased">All LIBOR panels have ended</a>. Only synthetic LIBOR settings in US dollars remain and they are expected to end before October. In March, the Bank of England&rsquo;s Financial Policy Committee concluded that the financial stability risk to the UK from the US dollar LIBOR has been mitigated.</p>
<p>Many said this couldn&rsquo;t be done in this timeframe, but thanks to international collaboration and industry partnership, the FCA has led and driven a consistent global approach together with our key domestic partners in the Bank of England and Treasury, as well as IOSCO and the FSB, whose LIBOR steering group we co-chaired.</p>
<p>The final remaining synthetic US dollar LIBOR rates stop in just over 5 months. But when that happens, the final outcome &ndash; of a more stable financial system, which protects investors and consumers and builds confidence in UK financial markets, will be complete.</p>
<p>And our cooperation with fellow regulators doesn&rsquo;t need always to be through the auspices of large multi-lateral bodies. Nor does it need, always, to be focused on risk.</p>
<p>Last year, we partnered with regulators across the world, as part of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/fca-joins-forces-global-regulators-foster-digital-innovation-project-guardian" title="FCA joins forces with global regulators to foster digital innovation with Project Guardian">Monetary Authority of Singapore&rsquo;s Project Guardian</a>, to share knowledge and examine the benefits, regulatory challenges and commercial use cases of asset and fund tokenisation.</p>
<p>We understand that in order to properly support innovation, we must work closely with other regulatory and technical standards, as the industry changes and evolves internationally.</p>
<h2>Rightsizing our regulation</h2>
<p>That international work on tokenisation finds its mirror in our domestic approach, with practical collaboration between government, regulators, and industry on fund tokenisation through the Asset Management Taskforce.</p>
<p>This detailed work has concluded that the UK regulatory framework is 'open for business'&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;it can support the adoption of tokenisation in investment management and the funds industry without the need for significant regulatory reform. We remain committed to supporting this innovation and ensuring that the UK regulatory regime is at the forefront of innovation.</p>
<p>Along with the Bank of England, we are consulting on a new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/consultation-papers/cp24-5-digital-securities-sandbox-joint-bank-england-fca-consultation-paper" title="CP24/5: Digital Securities Sandbox joint Bank of England and FCA Consultation Paper">Digital Securities Sandbox</a>. We want to respond to industry&rsquo;s desire to make the infrastructure supporting traditional securities markets even more efficient, transparent, and resilient, as it adapts to support distributed ledger technology.</p>
<p>It is an exciting new way of making policy as firms in the sandbox will be able to test new business models under a temporarily modified legal framework which, if successful, can then be made permanent. The consultation is open until 29 May.</p>
<p>As we have demonstrated consistently over the past year or so, adherence to international standards and global cooperation does not mean we cannot ourselves innovate &ndash; and at pace - to ensure our regulatory regime supports UK market needs and a changing environment.</p>
<p>We have forged ahead in delivering on our part of the Edinburgh Reforms.</p>
<p>Earlier this month we put in place the final elements of a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/consultation-papers/cp23-33-payments-data-providers-drsp-policy-statement-framework-consolidated-tape-cp23-15" title="CP23/33: Consultation on payments to data providers and DRSP forms including Policy Statement for the framework for UK consolidated tape (CP23/15)">regulatory framework for a consolidated tape</a>. By building a more complete picture of the market, a tape will reinforce the UK&rsquo;s position as a leading centre for the listing and trading of bonds.</p>
<p>And, just last week, we&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/consultation-papers/cp24-7-payment-for-optionality-investment-research" title=" CP24/7: Payment Optionality for Investment Research">proposed giving asset managers greater freedom in how they pay for research</a>, supporting their investment decisions. This greater choice should suit firms of varying business models and sizes, helping to promote competition.</p>
<p>Our analysis shows that asset managers are largely getting the research they need under the current rules.</p>
<p>But our proposed changes would ensure greater compatibility with other major jurisdictions, making it easier for asset managers to buy research in the same way, across borders.</p>
<p>Similarly, we are aiming to publish final rules on changes to the UK&rsquo;s listing regime &ndash; the most wide-ranging and consequential reforms to the UK&rsquo;s capital markets in over 3 decades &ndash; by the summer.</p>
<p>While our rules are only one part &ndash; and perhaps not the largest part &ndash; in the decisions taken by companies&rsquo; boards on whether and where to list their securities, we have demonstrated our commitment to doing what we can to support dynamic capital markets in the UK.</p>
<h2>Open Britain</h2>
<p>Underpinning our approach is our belief in open wholesale markets. This has long been the hallmark of the UK. Overseas firms can access UK markets without needing to be authorised here. And firms based in the UK can connect with counterparts and customers globally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Openness brings benefits &ndash; it can help promote greater economic dynamism through greater liquidity, increased competition, and act as a magnet for other international firms to do business in the UK.</p>
<p>Our openness is the reason why so many across the world come to do their business in London. And why, therefore, we remain global leaders from insurance to debt issuance, from asset management to derivative trading.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But openness of itself is not sufficient to advance competitiveness and growth. Enhancing the UK&rsquo;s international competitiveness in financial services is about creating the right conditions so firms have confidence to innovate and invest in the UK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Creating those conditions means then maintenance of high standards and the preservation of our ability to act, where required.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have noticed an uptick in proposals where for a firm's activity taking place on UK soil, the individuals undertaking senior management functions will not be based in the UK. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If firms run or manage their UK operations from elsewhere, our ability to supervise them is lessened. As is our ability to hold parties to account should things go wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over time this could impact the UK&rsquo;s attractiveness as a global financial services centre.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is for this reason that we expect senior managers to spend time in the UK appropriate with their responsibilities here.</p>
<p>At the same time, however, we are working to ensure that the door is open to those who want to operate in our markets and are able to meet the standards we expect.</p>
<p>While it is the Government rightly in the lead, we are playing our part to support the recently signed&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-berne-financial-services-agreement" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Berne Financial Services Agreement<span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;with Switzerland, which allows UK-based firms new opportunities in accessing Swiss markets and vice versa.</p>
<p>And, last year we launched our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/authorisation/uk-wholesale-markets-support" title="UK wholesale markets pre-application support service">pre-application support service (PASS)</a>&nbsp;&ndash; targeted at overseas wholesale firms wishing to expand into the UK. Or at any wholesale firms planning to set up in the devolved nations and outside the south-east or seeking to operate an unusual or high-risk business model.</p>
<p>We know that some firms would like a bit of extra assistance. So, we are offering firms pre-application meetings with our case officers, giving them dedicated support and guidance through the application process.</p>
<p>I would encourage any firm looking to expand into the UK or out of London and the south-east to come and talk to us &ndash; we can get you to market more quickly.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I started by comparing regulation to juggling, and this is no more true than in the area of promoting growth. As with juggling, keeping your eye on a single ball will mean you drop them all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, by focusing on one narrow contributor to the competitiveness of the UK&rsquo;s financial services you can lose sight of the bigger picture, or the longer-term. Only by considering all the elements that create the right foundation for investment and growth will we succeed. To do so, we &ndash; the regulator &ndash; need to be open-minded, open to change. To provide support for those who want to do business here, but sustain trust and our national reputation through the maintenance of high standards.</p>
<p>And we need to work cross-border, with our fellow regulators around the world, to set consistent, global standards.</p>
<p>We are committed not only to participate in those discussions, but to continue to lead them.</p>

<div> supervision, banking conference, contingency funding, operational readiness, market uncertainties
Summary:
Banking conference addresses banking risks, supervisory changes, and contingency funding. Managing evolving risks and ensuring a safe financial system are key focus areas.<br /><br /> <div>
<p>Good morning, it is really a pleasure to join you by video. I would like to thank Supervision at the New York Fed for inviting me to join you at this year's Regional and Community Banking Conference. These forums enable us to continue our engagement with bankers in the industry to address a variety of issues and challenges that exist in the current banking environment. Some of the topics that will be covered today include contingency funding, operational readiness, market uncertainties, and banking innovations. I appreciate that you have joined us to discuss these and several other topics on our agenda.</p>
<p>Before we get started, I would like to highlight a few areas of concern and identify some changed supervisory expectations that may provide a useful backdrop for the discussions.</p>
<p><strong>The Banking Landscape and Risks Today</strong><br />Over the past few years, we have experienced a number of challenges around the world and in the U.S. that have reverberated throughout the economy and have required banks to confront and mitigate the associated risks&mdash;including the pandemic, a sharp rise in inflation with an associated rapid rise in interest rates, CRE market uncertainties due to changing work and business preferences, increased third-party fintech engagement in the banking industry, and the 2023 bank failures. Today, we find ourselves at an inflection point in banking and financial services. Some traditional risks&mdash;like liquidity risk and interest rate risk&mdash;have become a higher priority concern for banks and regulators, while other risks&mdash;like third-party risk and cybersecurity risk&mdash;continue to evolve and pose new challenges. Bankers and regulators alike must consider how our reactions to these issues will impact the future of the banking system, and how safety and soundness, consumer protection, U.S. financial stability, and the ongoing and future role of banks within the U.S. financial system will be affected.</p>
<p>Banks must ensure their risk-management frameworks appropriately identify, measure, monitor, and control for both existing and emerging risks. They must continue to innovate responsibly and ensure their risk-management frameworks account for novel product offerings both prior to implementation and as the service and customer engagement evolves.</p>
<p>Regulators must consider the many tradeoffs in their approach to supervision and regulation to most effectively support banks as they embark upon and continue on this journey. In their quest to be agile by offering new services and responding to new and evolving risks, banks must have access to and understand the rules of the road. Similarly, supervisors must be knowledgeable in how to appropriately identify, supervise, and regulate emerging risks. Regulators must encourage and support responsible innovation as banks expand their product offerings to serve the needs of their customers and communities.</p>
<p><strong>Risk Management and Contingency Funding</strong><br />Shifting to contingency funding plans, given the expanding number of challenges and shocks that the economy has faced over the past few years, it is prudent for banks not only to continue to evolve and update emergency planning activities in light of these risks, but also to test their emergency plans.</p>
<p>Since the banking stress and bank failures last spring, these risks have led to heightened liquidity risks for some firms. I understand that supervisors at the New York Fed and across the Federal Reserve System have engaged with state member banks and holding companies about appropriate risk management and have indicated that those plans should include emergency borrowing from the discount window if a bank's condition warrants a need for emergency liquidity. Last year, the Federal Reserve Board issued updated guidance noting that depository institutions should regularly evaluate and update their contingency funding plans.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240418a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>All banks should have emergency contingency funding plans in place. Liquidity planning must include access to funding sources that can be utilized when they are most needed, which may include borrowing from the Federal Home Loan Banks or from the discount window.</p>
<p>However, as I've noted previously, while it may be appropriate for supervisors to encourage banks to establish and maintain contingency funding sources, test the contingency funding plans, and evaluate whether those plans are adequate in the context of examination, supervisors are not bankers. And we must be cautious not to cross the line from supervisor to member of the management team and avoid interfering with the decisionmaking of bank management. We must also ensure that liquidity requirements and supervisory expectations are commensurate with the bank's size, complexity, and risk profile.</p>
<p><strong>Supervisory Changes<a name="f24"></a></strong><br />Regulators have an important role to play in ensuring the safety and soundness of the banking system in light of evolving risks. These risks can be exacerbated by shortcomings in bank supervision, as we saw last spring. These bank failures and the events and circumstances surrounding them warrant review, self-reflection, and where necessary, appropriately targeted changes to identified gaps in regulation and supervision. We should carefully examine what is working and what can be improved in bank supervision. In doing so, we must appropriately and effectively manage our supervisory programs, teams, and expectations to ensure that efficient, effective, and consistent supervision is implemented across our regulated entities according to a bank's complexity, size, risk profile, and scope of activities. Conducting supervision in a manner that respects due process and provides transparency around supervisory expectations goes a long way in accomplishing these goals.</p>
<p>We should acknowledge that changes to supervisory expectations and processes, coupled with the sheer volume of recent regulatory and supervisory reforms and proposed reforms, will undoubtedly present additional challenges and risks for banks. While some changes to the supervisory process and priorities may be appropriate to promote a safe and sound financial system and enhance financial stability, having an appropriate focus on the most salient risks is important for effective risk management and effective supervision. We should be cautious that these changes do not distract banks or supervisors from focusing on core and emerging risks or impair the long-term viability of the banking system&mdash;especially for mid-sized and smaller banks.<a name="f26"></a></p>
<p>In closing, I hope that today's conference provides an opportunity for open and frank conversations about prudent risk management and how we can work together to maintain a safe and sound financial system. Thank you for taking the time to be with us today. I hope you enjoy the conference, and I look forward to spending more time discussing these issues with you in the future.</p>

<div> municipal identifiers, corporate identifiers, request volume, international debt, CUSIP

Summary:
- Increase in municipal identifier requests
- Decrease in corporate identifier requests
- Strong demand for international debt CUSIPs on a monthly basis
- Year-over-year changes in various asset classes
- Volatility in corporate segment, steady demand in municipal space
- International equity CUSIP requests down annually <div>
<p><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=oOaGzp6_Nur-n---_h6XVWXA0I4bRPeLAtn_entyeLvHtVE0_CGGOvDgeWJKNHg7bK6brlTmZ0EcVo7c5TsJjtOFwVH3ODyfgUZmg-PK3XCHWVa0QaYL3uipPajpnJy_" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="CUSIP Global Services">CUSIP Global Services</a>&nbsp;(CGS) today announced the release of its CUSIP Issuance Trends Report for March 2024. The report, which tracks the issuance of new security identifiers as an early indicator of debt and capital markets activity over the next quarter, found a monthly increase in request volume for new municipal identifiers, while requests for corporate identifiers slowed on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>North American corporate requests totaled 6,752 in March, which is down 13.0% on a monthly basis. On a year-over-year basis, North American corporate requests closed the month up 9.4%. The monthly volume decline was driven by a 19.9% decrease in request volume for U.S. corporate debt identifiers, a 12.4% decrease in request volume for short-term certificates of deposit (CDs) with maturities of less than one year, and a 14.1% decrease in request volume for long-term CDs with maturities of more than one year.</p>
<p>The aggregate total of identifier requests for new municipal securities &ndash; including municipal bonds, long-term and short-term notes, and commercial paper &ndash; rose 3.2% versus February totals. On a year-over-year basis, overall municipal volumes are up 5.6%. Texas led state-level municipal request volume with a total of 92 new CUSIP requests in March, followed by New York (65) and Wisconsin (62).</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve seen steady, strong demand for new municipal identifiers throughout the first quarter of this year,&rdquo; said Gerard Faulkner, Director of Operations for CGS. &ldquo;While there has been quite a bit more volatility in the corporate segment, particularly around corporate debt and CDs, the municipal space is clearly one to watch as we make our way through the first part of the year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Requests for international equity CUSIPs rose 53.1% in March and international debt CUSIP requests rose 29.2%. On an annualized basis, international equity CUSIP requests are down 3.8% and international debt CUSIP requests are up 102.0%.</p>

As part of the segment, Planisware will benefit from an extended range of services, increased visibility and access to Europe's rich technology ecosystem.</p>
<p>Pierre Demonsant, Co-founder and Chairman of Planisware, commented: "<em>Planisware's successful IPO validates the relevance of our strategy and rewards the commitment of our teams since our creation in 1996. Above all, it marks the start of a new page in Planisware&rsquo;s history. We are convinced that our vision, our role as accelerator of the Project Economy, and our track record of strong profitable growth, will give us the means to achieve our ambition: to be the number one provider of multi-specialty project and portfolio management software solutions.

<title>FIA European Principal Traders Association: New Paper Identifies Unreported Segment Of Liquidity In European Equity Markets - Addressing This Gap Would Present A Much More Accurate And Appealing Market Environment For Those Seeking To Invest And Raise Capital In Europe</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> European equity markets, FIA EPTA, liquidity crisis, MiFID II, post-trade transparency

Summary:
The FIA EPTA paper identifies unreported equity activity, proposes changes to MiFID II transparency, and emphasizes the need for regulators' attention to prevent Europe falling behind in the markets. <br /><br /> <div>
<p><a href="https://email.fia.org/c/1289iYJgNt3WpDRBdSB7ojw33CtWxD">A new paper</a>&nbsp;published today by FIA European Principal Traders Association identifies an entire segment of equity activity in both EU and UK markets that is currently unreported. Consequently, European share trading volumes are perceived by the market, including global investors and issuers, as being significantly lower than they actually are.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<p>The paper points out that European equity markets are perceived to be suffering a longstanding liquidity crisis, with reported average daily volume stagnating, particularly relative to the US. This perception has been blamed for declining capital allocation towards European markets and the migration of listings to other regions.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The unreported segment relates to hedging activity concerning bilateral synthetic equity exposures traded at-scale on broker-internal systematic internalisers. The scale of the unreported segment is material enough to significantly reduce the European liquidity shortfall relative to other global markets, according to the paper.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Simple technical changes to the MiFID II post-trade transparency regime would bring this activity to light, boosting reported European equity volumes so that they better reflect the actual levels of addressable liquidity and economic interest available in European markets today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>&ldquo;A perception of larger, more vibrant secondary markets in Europe will contribute to strengthening EU and UK primary markets, as market depth and liquidity are key factors for companies considering listing their stock via an initial public offering. If the real story regarding European equity volumes was clear for all to see, this would present a much more appealing market environment for those seeking to invest and raise capital, supporting economic growth for the entire region,&rdquo; said FIA EPTA Secretary General Piebe Teeboom.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>&ldquo;Keeping these volumes out of sight unnecessarily complicates achieving the goal of a deeper and more liquid European market,&rdquo; added Lara Shevchenko, Senior Policy Advisor &ndash; Market Structure at FIA EPTA. &ldquo;Regulators in the EU and UK need to take the opportunity presented by the imminent establishment of a Consolidated Tape for shares and ETFs to update relevant post-trade transparency rules, so that they capture the full scope of share trading activity in Europe. Without this, Europe risks being left behind.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<div> Luxembourg, Alter Domus, Temenos Multifonds, ELTIF 2.0 regulations, fund administration
Summary:
Alter Domus implements Temenos Multifonds for fund administration. The platform automates investment operations, complies with ELTIF 2.0 regulations, and supports global growth.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Temenos (SIX: TEMN) today announced that&nbsp;<a href="https://alterdomus.com/" target="_blank">Alter Domus</a>, a leading provider of tech-enabled fund administration, private debt, and corporate services for the alternative investment industry, has gone live on Temenos&rsquo;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.temenos.com/solutions/temenos-multifonds/" target="_blank">automated fund management platform</a>, implementing the solution in under six months.</p>
<p>Headquartered in Luxembourg, with large operations in the US, Alter Domus has more than 5,100 employees across 38 offices globally. Solely focused on alternative investments, the firm has $2.2tn of assets under management and serves 85% of the top 30 asset managers, helping them to handle the complexities of fund management through advanced technology and multijurisdictional&nbsp;expertise.</p>
<p>With the ELTIF 2.0 regulations coming into effect in January 2024, making alternative investments more accessible to a large pool of retail investors, Alter Domus wanted to quickly implement a scalable, cost-efficient platform that could manage a significant increase in transaction volumes. The fund administrator chose Temenos Multifonds Global Investor Servicing to automate and streamline its investment operations, initially for transfer agency services in Europe, with the possibility to move other activities and geographies onto the platform in the future.</p>
<p>Using the Temenos Multifonds platform allows Alter Domus to onboard an unlimited number of investors and automate a wide range of activities including commitment tracking, capital calls, valuation, drawdowns, distributions, and fees processing. The platform is also equipped with all ELTIF-required liquidity management tools, such as gating, fund&nbsp;lock-ups, side pockets, and transaction-level fees, with the ability to unitize any fund.</p>
<p>The cloud-native, agile solution will be used by Alter Domus across the full investor&nbsp;life-cycle, including digital onboarding,&nbsp;AML&nbsp;and&nbsp;KYC&nbsp;due diligence, and MiFID II classification and appropriateness assessment. Alter Domus will also&nbsp;benefit&nbsp;from Temenos&rsquo; global experience supporting over 40,000 funds, both traditional and alternative, across 35 jurisdictions worldwide.</p>
<p><b>Antonis Anastasiou, Group Head of Product Development, Alter Domus, said:&nbsp;</b>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re delighted to have implemented this new fund administration platform in just six months, allowing us to rapidly expand our capabilities to service open-ended fund characteristics. Our technological capabilities are key in helping us support fund managers to take advantage of opportunities in alternative investments. With Temenos, we will&nbsp;benefit&nbsp;from leading technology, used by the world&rsquo;s top fund managers, to help drive our growth.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Sern Tham, Global Head of Product, Temenos Multifonds, commented:</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;As fund administrators look to adapt to the ELTIF 2.0 regulations, having a scalable, cost-efficient platform with&nbsp;appropriate liquidity&nbsp;management tools will be crucial for them to take advantage of the retailization of private equity.&nbsp;This successful implementation demonstrates Temenos&rsquo; ability to deliver fast, flexible fund administration solutions for alternative asset classes such as private equity as well as traditional funds.&nbsp;We look forward to helping Alter Domus drive operational efficiencies through technology and grow its business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Temenos Multifonds solution recently won the Innovation in Fund Technology Award at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globalcustodian.com/79250-2/" target="_blank">Global Custodian Industry Leaders Awards 2023</a>&nbsp;and has received the award for Best Integrated Back-Office Platform at the prestigious&nbsp;<a href="https://www.temenos.com/news/2022/11/04/multifonds-bst-awards-2022/" target="_blank">WatersTechnology Buy-Side Technology Awards</a>&nbsp;for three years in a row.</p>

<ul>
<li class="spanHeading"><span>HKEX is launching the development of a proprietary derivatives platform to address rapidly evolving client needs</span></li>
<li class="spanHeading"><span>&nbsp;</span><span></span><span>New platform will give HKEX capability to offer near 24-hour derivatives trading, introduce new products and provide enhanced efficiency, elevating Group&rsquo;s competitiveness as a global exchange</span></li>

</ul>
<p class="spanHeading">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="spanHeading">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) is pleased to announce today (Thursday) the development of the Orion Derivatives Platform (ODP), offering enhanced trading, clearing and risk management capabilities. This new platform, being developed in-house by HKEX&rsquo;s technology teams with expected launch in 2028, will help differentiate the Group&rsquo;s derivatives offerings and elevate its competitiveness in the global derivatives marketplace.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">HKEX Chief Executive Officer, Bonnie Y Chan, said: &ldquo;Building future-ready technology platforms and operations is a key strategic priority for HKEX, as we help our markets and participants deliver long-term, sustainable growth and development. We are therefore pleased to announce plans to develop the Orion Derivatives Platform, representing our significant investment into the future of our markets. Derivatives are one of the fastest-growing segments of HKEX's diverse business, achieving record-breaking volumes in both 2023 and 2022. Developing an in-house platform that is adaptable, efficient, and scalable, would give us a unique competitive advantage in the global derivatives space.

ODP will offer enhanced trading and clearing capabilities to clients, including the potential of near 24-hour trading, additional order types, an industry-standard interface, as well as an enhanced testing and onboarding experience. It will also incorporate capital efficient risk management tools, such as the Value-at-Risk (VaR) model, to align clearing capitalisation methods with international practices.<br /></span></p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>The VaR margining methodology was successfully implemented in HKEX&rsquo;s cash market in 2022, offering a clearer, more efficient way to assess risk exposures as compared with the previous methodology. With the development of ODP, HKEX will bring VaR to its derivatives markets, helping further reduce the costs of trading whilst ensuring robust risk management.</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>HKEX Group Chief Information Officer, Richard Leung, said: &ldquo;HKEX is fully committed to driving innovation in our markets through the development of best-in-class technology platforms, and the launch of the ODP project underscores this ongoing strategic commitment.

We look forward to bringing all stakeholders on this exciting journey to own our digital destiny, and positioning HKEX and Hong Kong&rsquo;s financial markets for the future.&rdquo;</span></p>

<title>ISDA - GenAI In The Derivatives Market: A Future Perspective</title>

<div> Future Leaders in Derivatives, genAI, OTC derivatives market, regulatory framework, risk mitigation
Summary:
GenAI use cases in OTC market, risks, regulatory framework, potential solutions. Mitigation through governance, human oversight, cybersecurity, and model risk policies.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>This ISDA Future Leaders in Derivatives (IFLD) whitepaper sets out guidance for industry stakeholders, regulators and technology providers seeking to harness the power of generative artificial intelligence (genAI) in transforming the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market. It discusses promising use cases for this technology in the OTC derivatives market, the risks of such technology, the current regulatory framework and potential risk mitigation solutions. By embracing genAI, organizations can unlock new opportunities for efficiency, innovation and compliance in an increasingly complex market.</p>
<p>GenAI is rapidly becoming a useful tool across industries, with the ability to significantly reduce the time taken to produce work. There are several promising use cases for genAI in the derivatives market. The first relates to its ability to create new language based on precedent and synthesize data into a human-readable summary. GenAI is a useful tool for market participants to summarize complex derivatives agreements and suggest clauses based on deal terms and firms&rsquo; existing precedent agreements, which has the potential to significantly decrease negotiation and drafting costs. In addition, genAI can be used to extract unstructured data from derivatives documentation to provide summaries of derivatives transactions required for operations and front-office processes.</p>
<p>GenAI can also synthesize various jurisdictional regulations and present these in an easy-to-read format, comply with industry or firm standards and provide checks against trades and trade documentation. While not a replacement for a human lawyer, it can significantly accelerate the review process and act as an additional regulatory compliance check.</p>
<p>The second use case identified is with respect to genAI&rsquo;s use in application development to propose new code changes. McKinsey has estimated that using genAI in this way can make coding up to 56% faster. The third use case is to analyze data, including nuanced human emotion data, to provide market insights that can be useful in trading. The fourth use case is to improve operational efficiencies, such as to summarize margin and collateral requirements for the business and assist in selecting the least costly collateral or create synthetic data that can be used for model testing. Finally, genAI can be used to assist in the development of derivatives markets in emerging markets, by aiding firms in summarizing local regulations and market conditions, paving the way for a more efficient entry into such markets.</p>
<p>Governments are also looking at use cases for genAI and proposing regulations to safeguard consumers and financial markets. These proposals are still in their infancy, but reviewing the current state shows the direction in which regulators and policymakers are heading.</p>
<p>While these use cases offer great efficiencies, the use of genAI does not come without its challenges and risks. Due to the nature of genAI and the large amount of data needed to train the models, data breaches can be a significant challenge and lead to reputational, confidentiality, intellectual property and legal risks. The use of genAI for trading can also create regulatory issues and, without proper oversight, could lead to fines and sanctions from financial regulators. Additionally, genAI is associated with producing bias and could be used to discriminate against protected classes, leading to civil and possible criminal liability for companies. Lastly, there is significant risk of model failure, in which the results produced are sub-standard or simply false. This could lead to erroneous trades and diminished trust within a financial institution.</p>
<p>There are steps companies can take to mitigate these challenges and risks. This paper concludes with a set of proposed best practices. Firms are encouraged to formulate a comprehensive governance framework for their own use of genAI and that of their third-party vendors. In addition, companies should ensure the recommendations and presentation of material produced by AI are acted upon only by humans who can take responsibility for the ultimate decisions of the company. Firms should implement comprehensive cyber security and data security policies to safeguard their IT systems from cyberattacks and malicious use of genAI technology. Lastly, firms should develop model risk mitigation policies to ensure the models conform to expected results and any deviation or failure can be quickly corrected.</p>

<title>ISDA Future Leaders In Derivatives Publishes Generative Artificial Intelligence Whitepaper</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-future-leaders-in-derivatives-publishes-generative-artificial-intelligence/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-future-leaders-in-derivatives-publishes-generative-artificial-intelligence/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ISDA has today published a whitepaper from ISDA Future Leaders in Derivatives (IFLD), its professional development program for emerging leaders in the derivatives market. The whitepaper,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/04/17/genai-in-the-derivatives-market-a-future-perspective/"><em>GenAI in the Derivatives Market: a Future Perspective</em></a>, was developed by the third cohort of IFLD participants, who began working together in October 2023.</p>
<p>The 38 individuals in the group represent buy- and sell-side institutions, law firms and service providers from around the world. After being selected for the IFLD program, they were asked to engage with stakeholders, develop positions and produce a whitepaper on the potential use of generative artificial intelligence (genAI) in the over-the-counter derivatives market. The participants were also given access to ISDA&rsquo;s training materials, resources and staff expertise to support the project and their own professional development.</p>
<p>Drawing on industry expertise and academic research, the whitepaper identifies a range of potential use cases for genAI in the derivatives market, including document creation, market insight and risk profiling. It also explores regulatory issues in key jurisdictions and addresses the challenges and risks associated with the use of genAI. The paper concludes with a set of recommendations for stakeholders. These include investing in talent development, fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing with technology providers, prioritizing ethical AI principles and engaging with policymakers to promote an appropriate regulatory framework.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rapid development of artificial intelligence has generated considerable attention, both within financial markets and across society more broadly. As the technology advances, there is a significant opportunity for genAI to support more efficient, data-driven decision making in the derivatives market, but we need to approach this carefully, making sure the implications and risks of the technology are properly addressed. Fresh perspectives will be needed as future opportunities and challenges are considered, so I commend the IFLD for completing this paper, which makes a valuable contribution to this fast-evolving topic,&rdquo; said Scott O&rsquo;Malia, ISDA&rsquo;s Chief Executive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This year&rsquo;s IFLD group was drawn from a diverse range of institutions and jurisdictions, and we have worked together over the past six months to explore the development of genAI in the global derivatives market. It is clear this technology has the potential to add significant value to multiple industry processes. We hope the paper will help market participants, policymakers and other stakeholders as they look to harness the technology and address the associated challenges,&rdquo; said IFLD participant Takuya Otani, Director, Counterparty Portfolio Management Desk at Mizuho.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Participating in this year&rsquo;s IFLD program gave me the valuable opportunity to collaborate with a passionate, diverse and knowledgeable cohort of professionals from across the global derivatives market. With access to industry experts and best-in-class training programs, the group came together to develop a comprehensive and valuable paper that we hope will make a meaningful contribution to the future development of genAI in the derivatives market. The experience has been empowering and enriching, and I would wholeheartedly recommend the program to others,&rdquo; said IFLD participant Tom Reynolds, Senior Manager, Financial Services Documentation at Factor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now in its third year, the IFLD has made its mark as a highly prestigious program for talented individuals in the derivatives market. This year&rsquo;s cohort has produced a thoughtful and well-researched paper that provides helpful guidance in addressing the opportunities and challenges associated with the use of genAI. We commend the group for its achievements and look forward to recruiting the next set of future leaders,&rdquo; said Joel Clark, Senior Director, Communications at ISDA and Chair of the IFLD.</p>
<p>Participants from the IFLD will present the paper&rsquo;s findings and recommendations during a panel discussion at ISDA&rsquo;s 38<span>th</span>&nbsp;Annual General Meeting, which is taking place in Tokyo this week. Nominations for a fourth group of IFLD participants will open later this year.</p>

<title>Treasury International Capital Data For February</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/treasury-international-capital-data-for-february-10/</link>

<div> Treasury International Capital, February 2024, TIC data, foreign acquisitions, U.S. securities<br />
Summary: The Treasury International Capital (TIC) data for February 2024 shows a net inflow of $51.6 billion from foreign acquisitions of U.S. securities. Foreign holdings of U.S. securities increased. <div>
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury today released Treasury International Capital (TIC) data for February 2024.&nbsp; The next release, which will report on data for March 2024, is scheduled for May 15, 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sum total in February of all net foreign acquisitions of long-term securities, short-term U.S. securities, and banking flows was a net TIC inflow of $51.6 billion. &nbsp;Of this, net foreign private inflows were $36.2 billion, and net foreign official inflows were $15.5 billion.</p>
<p>Foreign residents increased their holdings of long-term U.S. securities in February; their net purchases were $145.7 billion.&nbsp; Net purchases by private foreign investors were $117.5 billion, while net purchases by foreign official institutions were $28.2 billion.</p>
<p>U.S. residents increased their holdings of long-term foreign securities, with net purchases of $74.1 billion.</p>
<p>After including adjustments, such as estimated foreign portfolio acquisitions of U.S. stocks through stock swaps, overall net foreign purchases of long-term securities are estimated to have been $71.5 billion in February.</p>
<p>Foreign residents increased their holdings of U.S. Treasury bills by $11.1 billion.&nbsp; Foreign resident holdings of all dollar-denominated short-term U.S. securities and other custody liabilities increased by $10.5 billion.</p>
<p>Banks&rsquo; own net dollar-denominated liabilities to foreign residents&nbsp;decreased&nbsp;by $30.3 billion.</p>
<p><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/data/treasury-international-capital-tic-system">Complete data are available on the Treasury website here.</a></p>
<p>About TIC Data</p>
<p>The monthly data on holdings of long-term securities, as well as the monthly table on Major Foreign Holders of Treasury Securities, reflect foreign holdings of U.S. securities collected primarily on the basis of custodial data.&nbsp; These data help provide a window into foreign ownership of U.S. securities, but they cannot attribute holdings of U.S. securities with complete accuracy.&nbsp; For example, if a U.S. Treasury security purchased by a foreign resident is held in a custodial account in a third country, the true ownership of the security will not be reflected in the data.&nbsp; The custodial data will also not properly attribute U.S. Treasury securities managed by foreign private portfolio managers who invest on behalf of residents of other countries.&nbsp; In addition, foreign countries may hold dollars and other U.S. assets that are not captured in the TIC data.&nbsp; For these reasons, it is difficult to draw precise conclusions from TIC data about changes in the foreign holdings of U.S. financial assets by individual countries.</p>
<p>New Data on Valuation Changes in Holdings of Long-Term Securities</p>
<p>As announced last month, starting with this release, the Treasury International Capital (TIC) system begins reporting monthly valuation changes in holdings of long-term securities.&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/data/treasury-international-capital-tic-system">Data are available on the Treasury website here</a>.</p>
<p>Tables 1, 2, and 3 on monthly holdings of securities now show valuation changes as far back as February 2023. The new data show total monthly changes in the fair market value of holdings that result only from changes in the prices of the securities held.</p>
<p>There is no change to the monthly TIC press release or to monthly reporting on banking claims and liabilities, derivatives, and claims and liabilities of nonfinancial firms.</p>

<div> Forum, capital markets, regulatory environment, angel investors, private market
<br />
The writer discusses the changes in capital markets and the role of the SEC in creating a more accessible environment for entrepreneurs and investors.
<br />
The SEC should simplify rules, focus on opportunity, and encourage a growing private market to better serve entrepreneurs and investors.
Summary: <div>
<p>Good afternoon. It is my pleasure to participate in this year&rsquo;s Small Business Forum (&ldquo;Forum&rdquo;). I recall attending my first Forum nineteen years ago in San Francisco,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-small-business-forum-041724?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;when I was serving as Chief Advisor to the California Corporations Commissioner. The year was 2005, and it was held in a hotel near Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf. I hope that we can soon return to having in-person Forums held throughout the country.</p>
<p>Our capital markets and the regulatory environment have changed significantly since that time. Public companies have more disclosure obligations and private companies have more ways to raise capital. The number of public companies, though, has declined significantly over the last couple of decades.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-small-business-forum-041724?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Smaller companies have accounted for the vast majority of this decline.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-small-business-forum-041724?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;The retreat by smaller companies from the public markets highlights the importance of the private markets as a source of capital. For early-stage start-up companies, these sources might be angel investors and individuals who have a pre-existing relationship with the founders.</p>
<p>Given the increasing role of angel investors, and others who might invest in the &ldquo;friends and family&rdquo; round, the Commission should create an ecosystem where founders can be easily connected with knowledgeable individuals who have the ability to assess the risks and rewards of making investments in start-up companies.</p>
<p>One way to create this environment is to make the Commission&rsquo;s capital raising rules for early-stage companies more understandable and reduce the need for lawyers charging $1,000 or more per hour. The Office of the Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation has an online resource<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-small-business-forum-041724?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;to aid entrepreneurs. The Commission&rsquo;s staff has also participated in events to help founders and others at start-up companies better understand the Commission&rsquo;s rules and educational resources. However, the complexity of our regulatory regime remains a challenge,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-small-business-forum-041724?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;and this is a concern that should be addressed. Not only is capital formation part of the Commission&rsquo;s mission, but Congress has specifically directed the Commission to advance the interests of small business through the SEC Small Business Advocate Act of 2016.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-small-business-forum-041724?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Another way that the Commission can build a vibrant ecosystem for raising start-up capital is by ensuring that its rules focus on opportunity. Paternalistic rules issued in the name of investor protection can limit individuals from investing in early-stage companies, but such rules often fail to consider the risk tolerance of prospective investors and their ability to analyze such investment. That type of a regulatory regime can make it more difficult for entrepreneurs to raise capital without the attendant investor protections. Instead, regulations should focus on creating opportunities and avoiding a broad, paternalistic approach.</p>
<p>Finally, a third way that the Commission can create a healthy ecosystem for entrepreneurs and investors is to encourage a growing private market for capital. Promoting economic growth, innovation, and jobs creation requires the side-by-side existence of vibrant public and private markets. The Commission&rsquo;s rules should not discourage companies from remaining private, especially if the rationale for such rules is that less disclosure equates to more fraud. Bad actors appear in both public and private companies and the Commission has anti-fraud rules and enforcement authority to address such behavior. The Commission&rsquo;s regulatory regime should not lose sight of its purpose of encouraging good actors to start businesses and allowing them to receive capital from willing investors.</p>
<p>These are three approaches for building an ecosystem to better serve entrepreneurs and investors. I know there are many more. I look forward to the ideas that will come from this afternoon&rsquo;s fireside chat with Professor Angela Lee and the later panel with Trish Costello and Beto Pallares. Thank you.</p>

Summary:<br />
- Trilateral meeting of Japan, Republic of Korea, and United States<br />
- Economic cooperation for open and fair practices<br />
- Imposition of sanctions on Russia and DPRK<br />
- Collaboration for supply chain resilience<br />
- Strengthening of multilateral development banks and international financial institutions<br /> <div>
<p class="text-align-justify">Today, we, the Finance Ministers of Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United States held our first trilateral meeting in Washington, DC. Our discussion builds on our Trilateral Leaders&rsquo; Summit last August in Camp David, and affirms the importance of our relationship to our own economies and to the global economy.</p>
<p>As leading global economies, we seek continued opportunity and prosperity for our peoples, the Indo-Pacific region, and the globe through open and fair economic practices. We will continue to cooperate to promote sustainable economic growth, financial stability, as well as orderly and well-functioning financial markets. We will also continue to consult closely on foreign exchange market developments in line with our existing G20 commitments, while acknowledging serious concerns of Japan and the Republic of Korea about the recent sharp depreciation of the Japanese yen and the Korean won.</p>
<p>Together, we affirm our commitment to utilize and coordinate our respective sanctions tools to impose costs on Russia for its war against Ukraine and target the Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea&rsquo;s (DPRK&rsquo;s) weapons program. We strongly condemn the DPRK&rsquo;s exports to Russia, as well as Russia&rsquo;s procurement of the DPRK&rsquo;s ballistic missiles, in direct violation of relevant UN Security Council Resolutions, and call upon them to immediately cease such activities. We emphasize the importance of collaboration to overcome supply chain vulnerabilities and the possible harm to our economies from non-market economic practices of other countries, including economic coercion and overcapacity in key sectors. We have reaffirmed Leaders&rsquo; commitment to mobilize financing for resilient supply chains and will work together to that end, including through the Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Supply-chain Enhancement (RISE). We will continue to work together to evolve the multilateral development banks and strengthen other international financial institutions to better respond to key global challenges. Reaffirming the importance of ASEAN and Pacific Island countries, we will combine efforts to strengthen their macroeconomic and financial resilience as well as financial integrity. We welcome the progress in the trilateral collaboration among our development finance institutions. We will continue staff level engagement to take these forward.</p>
<p>These goals demonstrate the ongoing importance and unprecedented strength of this trilateral economic relationship between Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United States. We will continue cooperation to strengthen our economies and promote global economic prosperity.&nbsp;</p>

The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) is updating crypto asset trading platforms on the implementation of value-referenced crypto assets (VRCAs). The CSA is extending the deadline for compliance to October 31, 2024 due to technical issues. CTPs and VRCA issuers are encouraged to contact the CSA with any questions. Canadian investors are cautioned that all crypto assets, including VRCAs, carry risk and are not the same as fiat currency.
<br /><br />Summary: <br />The Canadian Securities Administrators are extending the deadline for compliance with VRCAs to October 31, 2024. They caution investors about the risks of crypto assets. <div>

<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>A VRCA is a crypto asset that is designed to maintain a stable value over time by referencing the value of a fiat currency or any other value, right, or combination thereof.

By this date, the CSA expected that CTPs would no longer allow clients to buy, deposit, or enter into crypto contracts to buy or deposit FBCAs that do not comply with the interim terms and conditions.</span><br /><br /><span>As part of the CSA&rsquo;s ongoing engagement with Canadian crypto market participants on the implementation of its interim approach, and in response to technical issues CTPs raised with meeting the April 30 deadline, the CSA is extending the April 30 deadline to October 31, 2024.</span><br /><br /><span>The CSA continues to welcome submissions on the appropriate long-term regulation of VRCAs.

<title>Finansinspektionen Prioritizes Particularly Vulnerable Sectors To Combat Money Laundering</title>

<div> FinTech, cryptoassets, banks, cash-intensive businesses, money laundering<br />
Summary:<br />
FI prioritizes money laundering supervision in vulnerable sectors, including FinTech, crypto trading, and small banks. Focus on terrorist financing and sanctions compliance. <div>
<p><span>Money laundering is a global problem that allows criminals to transact large sums of money without revealing their illegal activities. In order to counteract the risk of money laundering, FI has identified a number of areas where the risks are assessed to be particularly large and that we will have an extra focus on during the year.</span></p>
<div class="editor-content">
<p>In order for FI's supervision to be as effective as possible, we direct our resources to areas where the risks are the greatest and where we can achieve the most. Supervision in money laundering is a high priority area for us in 2024, and this report outlines which risks will be prioritized in this area.</p>
<p>"We place high demands on the financial sector and work to ensure that companies do what they must to protect themselves from being exploited by criminals. It is a prerequisite for a sustainable social economy," says Erik Blomm&eacute;, head of the Money Laundering Supervision department at FI.</p>
<p>We assess that certain sectors are particularly vulnerable. For example, parts of the FinTech industry, companies that trade in cryptoassets, small and medium-sized banks, and cash-intensive businesses. We have also identified some larger risks that exist in several sectors, such as the use of companies as instruments of crime, the increasing risk of terrorist financing, and shortcomings in compliance with international sanctions.</p>

The Commission issued further notices to keep the public informed of fee developments. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that, starting on May 22, 2024, the fee rates applicable to most securities transactions will be set at $27.80 per million dollars.</p>
<p>Consequently, each self-regulatory organization will continue to pay the Commission a rate of $8 per million for covered sales occurring on charge dates through May 21, 2024, and a rate of $27.80 per million for covered sales occurring on charge dates on or after May 22, 2024.</p>
<p>Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. &sect; 78ee, the SEC sets fiscal-year fee rates after the agency receives its full-year appropriation. Until the new rate becomes effective, the existing rate stays in place. In fiscal year 2023, the fee rate was $8 per million, and that fee rate will stay in effect during the first eight months of FY 2024. Because the rate did not increase at the beginning of FY 2024, and because the SEC did not receive its full-year appropriation until March 2024, the fee rate for the remainder of the year increased to balance collections to the targeted collection amount.</p>
<p>For more information on the term &ldquo;charge date,&rdquo; please refer to Rule 31(a)(3) and Exchange Act Release No. 49928 at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-49928.htm">http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-49928.htm</a>.</p>
<p>The assessment on security futures transactions will remain unchanged at $0.0042 for each round turn transaction.</p>
<p>The Commission determined these new rates in accordance with Section 31 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These adjustments do not directly affect the amount of funding available to the SEC.</p>
<p>The Office of Interpretation and Guidance in the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Trading and Markets is available for questions on Section 31 at (202) 551-5777, or by email at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:tradingandmarkets@sec.gov">tradingandmarkets@sec.gov</a>.</p>
<p>The Commission will issue further notices as appropriate to keep the public informed of developments relating to fees under Section 31. These notices will be posted at the SEC's website at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sec.gov/">http://www.sec.gov</a>.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is REMIT?</span></p>
<p>Europe has an EU-wide legal framework (generally called &lsquo;REMIT&rsquo;) designed to prevent and protect consumers and business against market abuse in the European electricity and gas markets. The revised REMIT takes effect from 7 May 2024. For a short overview on the revised REMIT, see&nbsp;<a href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsFBgNTUFYAWkwKBlBRHVYJB1AdC1pXVRpQVVZTDQMDAQdVUlAdBVBSUVpUBAIdBAFRAR0GW1IFGgxRB1IZUFRTUwEBAANZAFYFRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why is the ACER open letter on the revised REMIT relevant?</span></p>
<p>The ACER open letter provides an overview of the main changes the revised REMIT brings in terms of data reporting and notification obligations e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>what has changed in the definition of &lsquo;Organise Marketplace&rsquo; and when should they start reporting data related to the order books;</li>
<li>how market participants that are resident or established in a &lsquo;third country&rsquo; (outside the EU) should provide information about their designated representative in the EU;</li>
<li>how market participants should notify their usage of algorithmic trading.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The letter also sets out what ACER expects from reporting parties once the amended regulation enters into force.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What&rsquo;s next?</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The revised REMIT was adopted by the European Parliament on 29 February and by the Council on 18 March 2024. It will&nbsp;enter into force on 7 May 2024.</li>
<li>ACER and the European Commission will host a workshop (11 June) to discuss the implementation of the revised REMIT and its main implications.&nbsp;<a href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtSU1RUAlNVAEwJAQFXHVYMAwUdCgsCUxpWUgJRAQUHAFMBBwYdBVBSUVpUBAIdBAFRAR0GW1IFGgxRB1IZUFRTUwEBAANZAFYFRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" target="_blank">Register here</a>.</li>

<title>Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management Adopts DTCC’s ITP Services As Industry Prepares For U.S. Move To T+1</title>

<div> DTCC, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management, T+1 settlement cycle, Institutional Trade Processing, APAC region <br />
Summary: Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management adopts DTCC's ITP services for faster trade processing and T+1 settlement, leveraging automated post-trade processing and soto-soto arrangement. <br /> <div>
<p>DTCC, the premier post-trade market infrastructure for the global financial services industry, today announced that Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management is leveraging DTCC&rsquo;s Institutional Trade Processing (ITP) suite of services to accelerate trade processing as the industry sets its sights on the U.S. move to a T+1 settlement cycle on May 28, 2024.</p>
<p>Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management has adopted DTCC ITP&rsquo;s CTM, including CTM&rsquo;s Match to Instruct (M2i) workflow as well as leveraging TradeSuite ID, ALERT, and Settlement Instruction Manager to fully automate their post-trade processing and support the achievement of same day affirmation (SDA) for cross-border transactions within the APAC region. Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management is the first Japanese asset management firm to adopt ITP services through Nomura Research Institute&rsquo;s (NRI)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dtcc.com/news/2023/may/23/dtcc-and-nomura-research-institute-to-bring-greater-post-trade-automation-and-efficiency-to-japan">SmartBridge Advance, an offering made possible through collaborative efforts between DTCC and NRI</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are pleased to adopt DTCC&rsquo;s ITP suite of services,&rdquo; said Yosuke Hosokawa, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management. &ldquo;As the U.S. transitions to T+1 settlement, it is important that financial markets outside the U.S. leverage automation to enable straight through processing and align with global standards. We are happy to collaborate with the wider industry to bring accelerated settlement to our clients.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To achieve accelerated settlement, firms need to complete post-trade agreement and affirmation faster. This can be achieved by automating the allocation, confirmation, and affirmation processes.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dtcc.com/institutional-trade-processing/itp/ctm">CTM</a>, DTCC&rsquo;s platform for the central matching of cross-border and U.S. equity and fixed income transactions, automates the trade confirmation process. CTM&rsquo;s M2i workflow leverages the central matching capabilities of CTM, as well as SSI enrichment via&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dtcc.com/institutional-trade-processing/itp/alert">ALERT</a>. With this workflow, which includes affirmation options depending on the broker&rsquo;s setup, trades that are allocated, confirmed, and matched by the institutional investor and its brokers in CTM will automatically trigger trade affirmation and delivery of instructions for Depository Trust Company (DTC)-eligible securities directly to the U.S. depository for settlement. When combined with Settlement Instruction Manager, which automatically generates and sends settlement instructions to custodians and interested third parties, users can more effectively manage and monitor the lifecycle of a trade through to settlement finality.</p>
<p>In Japan, regulatory mandates require appointed trust banks to oversee their underlying investment managers&rsquo; trading activities and be included in the pre-settlement, post-trade communications chain. Settlement Instruction Manager enables the &ldquo;soto-soto&rdquo; arrangement with trust banks where investment managers send settlement instructions directly to their custodians simultaneously with the trust banks. The trust banks are given a copy of the settlement instructions for record keeping purposes. This helps enable the achievement of SDA and T+1 settlement within the APAC region. Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management is the first regional asset management firm to utilize the soto-soto arrangement among DTCC&rsquo;s ITP clients.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are pleased to partner with Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management to bring best practice capabilities that enable accelerated settlement in the region,&rdquo; said Val Wotton, Managing Director and General Manager, DTCC Institutional Trade Processing. &ldquo;As we look toward the U.S. move to T+1, achieving faster time to settlement for both cross-border and domestic transactions is more important than ever. ITP&rsquo;s suite of services is uniquely positioned to enable counterparties to reach settlement finality faster while seamlessly connecting them to thousands of counterparties around the world.&rdquo;</p>

<title>ICE Climate, Property And Loan-Level Datasets Provide Holistic Visibility Into Broad-Based Housing Sector Risk</title>

<div> Keywords: ICE, climate risk, home affordability, mortgage data, insurance costs

Summary:<br /><br />ICE presents research on climate risk and housing affordability at AmeriCatalyst conference. Integrates climate, property, and mortgage datasets to quantify all-inclusive cost of home ownership. Climate-driven factors may raise barriers to homeownership. ICE's research shows climate-driven factors contributing to housing cost burdens, impacting insurance costs, utility bills, and property taxes. <br /> <div>
<ul>
<li><i>Loan-level data tied to climate-driven insurance costs, property taxes, estimated utility bills, as well as property damage risk from climate events</i></li>
<li><i style="font-family: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">Original ICE research on the intersection of climate risk and home affordability to be shared at AmeriCatalyst conference in Washington, DC</i></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, will be presenting original research made possible by the integration of the company&rsquo;s growing collection of climate, property and loan-level mortgage datasets and proprietary analytics. The research, focused on the critical intersection of climate risk and housing affordability, will be presented during the&nbsp;<a href="https://americatalyst.com/going-to-extremes-2024" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">AmeriCatalyst Going to Extremes Leadership Summit</a>&nbsp;in Washington, DC on Thursday, April 18, 2024.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home affordability has been a defining challenge of the U.S. housing market since the pandemic,&rdquo; said Ben Graboske, President of Mortgage Data and Analytics at ICE. &ldquo;Until now, the focus has mainly been the low inventory, rising interest rates and high home prices that have been straining affordability. But the potential impact of climate-related events &ndash; and their ripple effects - on the true cost of ownership cannot be overlooked. That holds true for homeowners, lenders, investors and policy makers alike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leveraging vast data assets from across its Mortgage and Sustainable Finance businesses, ICE was able to quantify a more all-inclusive cost of home ownership. Using granular, timely loan- and property-level data, ICE researchers aggregated anonymized mortgage payments, property taxes, property insurance, as well as estimated utility bills for electric, water and heating fuels for millions of homeowners.</p>
<p>Combining this information with ICE&rsquo;s property-level climate risk metrics that cover more than 100M US homes will help improve transparency and risk understanding throughout the housing finance sector. Soon to be available via the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com/products/rapid-analytics-platform" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">ICE Rapid Analytics Platform<sup>SM</sup>&nbsp;</a>(RAP) and the contributory&nbsp;<a href="https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com/products/mcdash" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">McDash<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;</a>loan-level mortgage performance dataset, the convergence will allow users to apply ICE&rsquo;s climate metrics to individual loans, properties as well as entire portfolios. ICE is also leveraging the combined insight to incorporate enhanced asset-level climate risk modeling for its existing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ice.com/fixed-income-data-services/data-and-analytics/sustainable-finance-data/climate-data" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">municipal bond and mortgage-backed securities</a>&nbsp;products.</p>
<p>The downstream impact goes beyond raising further barriers to homeownership for first time buyers hoping to break into the market. Even millions of current homeowners with low fixed-rate loans are seeing such variable costs of homeownership on the rise. ICE&rsquo;s research shows how such climate-driven factors may contribute to housing cost burdens at every level, and drills down into where climate risk may continue to drive cost growth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nexus of climate and affordability, especially as it relates to insurance cost, is an important topic within the housing and securitized sector right now,&rdquo; said Larry Lawrence, Global Head of Sustainable Finance at ICE. &ldquo;Insurers have been raising premiums or, in many cases, pulling out of major markets entirely in an effort to manage their own risks. Climate impacts may also fuel rising utility costs, and multi-billion-dollar disasters are contributing to rising property taxes as well, further constricting affordability. There are no simple solutions to these problems, but what there can be is more transparency and data to aid market participants.&rdquo;</p>

<div> partnership, MASH, drugs, development, Boehringer<br />
Summary:<br />Biopharmaceutical companies are showing renewed interest in MASH drug development, with several major partnership deals and innovative drug developments in 2024. <div>
<p><span><span>Biopharmaceutical companies are regaining interest in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) innovator drug development. MASH innovator drugs witnessed over $2.5 billion increase in the total value of partnership deals from 2020 to 2024 year-to-date (YTD), with more than $2 billion forged in Q1 2024 alone, reveals&nbsp;</span><a href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.gqh-2BaxUzlo7XKIuSly0rC502qyvSaH8suunkkct0v9mvfQCOd-2BH-2FL-2BYGtpYy-2FL-2FyLaZm1qwwVaPg8lPm6dvpuUGzmxcDRrpc-2BXaU-2BFHctKK2qwfJBe2dIC8cwTpUbkNKn4yN37FaiHVX8FXGb3WhnEUl1jttyxOEaeUbYCd7y-2BQvyAQhDUr-2BD-2BAMgyKdIHyIIedSCiJSAFX7cTX1LtbsqA-3D-3Duh7__awSuR00uK8EZood8su7v4ItMFr0d7S5MNR1CcvAHRb7u8JiSB5Axp3o6-2Brp7TTn9jFAQeaiwuDUNp6ED3yPnAqPtLtA7N0aAz15yM-2Fa7YbLjEsQ0GRAa40BulYCiuXYlscaEI4tDOH-2BQ8TtWmcY6IrOuDV-2BwUcz9jyldjhoMm7omWvdfJ4kQ-2Bp-2BcTsZRlGZuqxotMbWQzf1Q0MquA-2B0NazIHofFVCM9YhNEt-2FdeL7gApGY8ULCf-2BAqmbaJdAahBk4IOLFpl1pZG0acV1Jeyk8qUTjd6PkdrsI0t0EGaDjaytki7wYd0S6hnULOx53TiUXSETsTCwcGJ2epdRwUS232Kplk6pvMWsDkzVsEnJtgg-3D" target="_blank"><span><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GlobalData</span></span></span></a><span>, a leading data and analytics company.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>MASH, previously known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is a disease characterized by liver inflammation and damage caused by the accumulation of fat. Madrigal Pharmaceuticals&rsquo; Rezdiffra (resmetirom), a small molecule THRB agonist, was the first drug approved by the FDA for MASH in March 2024.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Alison Labya, Business Fundamentals Analyst at GlobalData, comments: &ldquo;Interest in MASH has returned in light of the FDA approval of Madrigal&rsquo;s Rezdiffra, as well as the success of GLP-1 obesity drugs and their potential efficacy in MASH, as demonstrated by Eli Lilly&rsquo;s Zepbound (tirzepatide; also known as Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes) in its Phase II SYNERGY-NASH trial readout.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>However, prior to Rezdiffra&rsquo;s approval, several companies discontinued development within MASH due to competitive pressures and failure to demonstrate efficacy in clinical trials, resulting in the waning interest from biopharmaceutical companies.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Examples of discontinued development in MASH include Genfit&rsquo;s oral NR1C1/NR1C2 dual agonist elafibranor in July 2020 and Bristol Myers Squibb&rsquo;s pegbelfermin in November 2021, both due to failure to demonstrate clinical efficacy in their Phase III trial readouts.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>GlobalData&rsquo;s Pharma Intelligence Center Deals Database reveals that MASH drugs&nbsp;secured&nbsp;over $5.7 billion in total partnership deal value from 2018 to 2024YTD, where 2024YTD is already the top year for MASH partnerships by deal value.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><img alt="GlobalData_MASH_24YTD" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/GlobalData_MASH_24YTD.jpg" title="GlobalData_MASH_24YTD" /><br /></span></span></p>
<div><span><span><br /></span></span></div>
<p><span><span>In January 2024, Boehringer Ingelheim signed a partnership deal worth over $2 billion with China-based biotech Suzhou Ruibo Biotechnology and its Sweden-based subsidiary Ribocure Pharmaceuticals to discover and develop siRNA therapeutics for MASH using Ribocure&rsquo;s RIBO-GalSTAR platform. Boehringer also has a GLP-1/GLU dual agonist survodutide&mdash;co-developed with Zealand Pharma&mdash;currently in Phase II trials for MASH.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Labya adds: &ldquo;Boehringer&rsquo;s collaboration with Suzhou Ruibo Biotechnology currently represents the largest partnership deal for MASH drugs of all time.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Meanwhile, Novo Nordisk entered a&nbsp;$500 million&nbsp;co-development partnership deal with US-based Cellarity for the discovery and development of a small molecule drug for MASH using Cellarity&rsquo;s artificial intelligence (AI) platform.&nbsp;This follows Novo Nordisk&rsquo;s&nbsp;co-development partnership with Gilead Sciences, forged in March 2021, to conduct a&nbsp;Phase II trial of its GLP1R agonist Ozempic (semaglutide) with Gilead&rsquo;s fixed-dose combination of FXR agonist cilofexor and ACC inhibitor firsocostat in MASH patients with cirrhosis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Labya concludes: &ldquo;The recent increase in partnership deals involving innovative MASH drugs in 2024YTD involved large biopharmaceutical companies with prior involvement in MASH drug development, such as Boehringer and Novo Nordisk. Given the large number of MASH drugs in clinical development, including GLP-1 agonists, there may be an increase in partnership deals and mergers and acquisitions involving late-stage clinical MASH drugs over this year.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Note: Data in the chart includes all announced and completed partnership deals globally from 2018 to 2024YTD. Includes deals where at least one drug involved is developed for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) with innovator drug type, where stages of development discovery, preclinical, Phase I, Phase II, Phase III, pre-registration, and marketed are considered. Includes deals that have disclosed their deal value in the public domain</strong><em>.</em></span></span></p>

<div> Capacity Allocation Mechanisms Network Code, gas transmission, ACER, revision process, European Commission
Summary:
ACER plans to update the gas Capacity Allocation Mechanisms Network Code through stakeholder input and a public consultation, with a recommendation to the European Commission by 2024. <div>
<p>ACER sees the need to update the European rules on allocating gas transmission capacity. Hence, ACER will run&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsCUwMIAwACBkxcBgVWHVZcBgEdUwAJXxpRUAVVAQVQBFQDAAQdVwIFVg8OAwAdBlgEDh0GAVJQGlRVCgAZVQQBVQQBVVJTUlUERQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" target="_blank">public consultation</a>&nbsp;to collect proposals from stakeholders on which amendments to the gas Capacity Allocation Mechanisms Network Code (CAM NC) could be considered.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is the gas Capacity Allocation Mechanisms Network Code?</span></p>
<p>The current&nbsp;<a href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtTCA5UUVlRWkwMV1BTHVYMUVUdC1wFVxoEAVYPUgQDAwcAAgkdVwIFVg8OAwAdBlgEDh0GAVJQGlRVCgAZVQQBVQQBVVJTUlUERQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" target="_blank">Capacity Allocation Mechanisms Network Code</a>&nbsp;has been in place since 2017. It harmonises how Transmission System Operators (TSOs) offer and allocate the available gas transmission pipeline capacity to the network users. In the context of Europe&rsquo;s decarbonisation targets and the evolving gas market, the network code needs to be updated.</p>
<p>ACER had several interactions with stakeholders on how to do this. This included a preliminary analysis (from October 2023 to January 2024) of the&nbsp;<a href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtQUlcGBFNVU0wNVwcFHVYMDQEdUAADBBpTXQUAUlIEUgcEUwQdVwIFVg8OAwAdBlgEDh0GAVJQGlRVCgAZVQQBVQQBVVJTUlUERQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" target="_blank">main achievements of the network code to date and potential improvements</a>&nbsp;(see the&nbsp;<a href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsOVQYJVwQCUExYU1dRHVYBBVMdUw4IBxpTUwcCVQsHBFUCAQIdVwIFVg8OAwAdBlgEDh0GAVJQGlRVCgAZVQQBVQQBVVJTUlUERQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" target="_blank">scoping consultation</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsAUAdVVgVWWkwAVFVRHVYNUFUdCgEHVRpXBgcADAYHVVUFAVAdVwIFVg8OAwAdBlgEDh0GAVJQGlRVCgAZVQQBVQQBVVJTUlUERQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" target="_blank">workshop</a>).</p>
<p>After having shared its conclusions with the European Commission, the Commission invited ACER to launch the EU-wide network code revision process building on the scoping and problem identification work undertaken by ACER and considering the regulatory elements introduced by the recently agreed hydrogen and decarbonised gas market package. The CAM NC revision process will conclude with ACER recommending amendments to the Commission, which is responsible for revising the text of the network code.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the next steps?</span></p>
<p>ACER is preparing a policy paper on the revision of the Network Code on Capacity Allocation Mechanisms in the gas transmission systems, which will focus on the potential improvements to the network code.</p>

<p>ACER will organise a workshop (by invitation only) on 9 July 2024 (09:00 &ndash; 11:00). Respondents of the public consultation that specifically expressed their interest in the survey will be invited to this workshop.</p>
<p>After considering stakeholders&rsquo; inputs, by the end of 2024, ACER will draft a recommendation to the Commission on amending the network code.</p>

<title>Kroll’s State Of Cyber Defense Report Reveals Healthcare Industry is Disillusioned In Its Preparedness For Cyberattacks</title>

<div> report, healthcare, cybersecurity, breaches, outsourcing
<br />
Healthcare organizations overestimate their cybersecurity capabilities, with only 3% having mature processes. They are highly targeted and plan to outsource security services.
<br /><br />Summary: Healthcare organizations overestimate cybersecurity, plan to outsource, and are highly targeted, with phishing, email compromise, and ransomware being major threats. <div>
<p><a href="https://www.kroll.com/en" target="_blank">Kroll</a>, the leading independent provider of global risk and financial advisory solutions, has released the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kroll.com/en/insights/publications/cyber/state-cyber-defense-healthcare" target="_blank">State of Cyber Defense: Diagnosing Cyber Threats in Healthcare</a><i>&nbsp;</i>report, exposing the healthcare industry&rsquo;s disillusionment in terms of its cyber maturity.&nbsp;The research reveals that over a quarter (26%) of healthcare businesses have immature cybersecurity processes yet nearly 50% believe their processes are &lsquo;very mature&rsquo;. Despite this high sense of self-confidence, only 3% of healthcare organizations surveyed actually have mature cyber processes in place.</p>
<p>Twenty-eight percent of healthcare organizations surveyed only employ the most basic security capabilities, such as cybersecurity monitoring, and none of the healthcare respondents had all recommended threat and detection capabilities in place. It is therefore no surprise that Kroll&rsquo;s threat intelligence consistently finds the industry to be one of the most targeted sectors by threat actors.&nbsp;The industry is also particularly susceptible to data breaches, with healthcare being the most breached industry in 2022 and the second most breached in 2023, according to Kroll&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kroll.com/en/insights/publications/cyber/data-breach-outlook-2024" target="_blank">Data Breach Outlook</a>.</p>
<p>The story becomes more interesting when looking at where healthcare organizations are sourcing their cybersecurity. Healthcare organizations are 65% less likely to fully outsource their cybersecurity services than the average organization.&nbsp;However, of the healthcare respondents who currently manage all their cybersecurity services in-house, 62% confirmed that they have plans to outsource in the next 12 months. Outsourced managed security could help the healthcare industry close the self-diagnosis gap and better protect themselves in the future.</p>
<p><b>Devon Ackerman, Global Head of Incident Response, Cyber Risk at Kroll,</b>&nbsp;<b>commented:</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;The self-diagnosis gap&nbsp;between healthcare&rsquo;s confidence in its security and its real-world security capabilities is particularly worrying considering that a cyber incident could disrupt hospital operations and have devastating outcomes for patient care and treatment, even putting human lives at risk. Unfortunately, healthcare is a wide-reaching environment with varying levels of investment and IT complexity, not to mention extremely time-poor staff that need both maximum convenience and security from IT operations. This is often why relying on a trusted external third-party provider, with visibility into the changing threat landscape, can be a game-changer for improving security resilience to protect against today&rsquo;s threats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Key findings from Kroll&rsquo;s&nbsp;<i>State of Cyber Defense: Diagnosing Cyber Threats in Healthcare&nbsp;</i>report&nbsp;include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Above-average confidence:</b>&nbsp;Healthcare is the most likely industry to self-report as having very mature security. Only a tiny fraction of healthcare respondents (3%) said that they do not trust their organization&rsquo;s ability to defend against most cyberattacks.</li>
<li><b>Below-average capabilities</b>: Unfortunately, the real-world security capabilities of healthcare organizations are below average. Of healthcare businesses, 26% rank as having low cyber maturity, and healthcare performs badly in comparison to other sectors that scored highly for self-reported security.</li>
<li><b>In-house security services</b>: Healthcare organizations are 65% less likely to outsource their cybersecurity services than other sectors due to the dynamic nature of these work environments. However, nearly two-thirds (62%) of healthcare companies that currently handle everything in-house plan to outsource some services in the next 12 months.</li>
<li><b>Credential access fears</b>: Healthcare respondents selected credential access as their number one fear&mdash;more than ransomware, BEC and phishing. Interestingly, credential access was the least significant threat according to all other industries.</li>
<li><b>Email compromise and ransomware</b>: Kroll Threat Intelligence finds that&nbsp;a third of cases (33%) infiltrated healthcare networks through the use of phishing links, and email compromise (37%) and ransomware (34%) are the two most common incident types.</li>
<li><b>Top target for breaches</b>: The healthcare industry is one of the most breached industries, ranking first in 2022 and second in 2023 in Kroll data. Further, the industry has had YoY increases in the number of inquiries and identified monitoring activations.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<i>State of Cyber Defense: Diagnosing Cyber Threats in Healthcare&nbsp;</i>report&nbsp;is a combination of survey data from 1,000 global senior IT security decision-makers and Kroll data from its front-line threat intelligence and experience of handling over 3,000 yearly incidents. The third-party survey was carried out by an independent specialist in market research, Vanson Bourne, and all respondents had some responsibility or knowledge of cybersecurity within their organization.</p>

<title>FSB Proposes Measures To Enhance The Liquidity Preparedness Of Non-Bank Market Participants For Margin And Collateral Calls During Times Of Market-Wide Stress</title>

<div> liquidity, risk management, non-bank market participants, FSB, policy recommendations <br />
Summary: The FSB report proposes policy recommendations to enhance liquidity preparedness, highlighting weaknesses in risk management and governance for non-bank market participants. <div>
<ul>
<li> <em><strong>FSB report identifies weaknesses in risk management and governance as key causes of inadequate liquidity preparedness by some non-bank market participants during recent incidents of liquidity stress in financial markets.</strong></em> </li>
<li> <em><strong>Report proposes eight policy recommendations focused on managing and mitigating the impact of spikes in margin and collateral calls in the non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) sector.</strong></em> </li>
<li> <em><strong>Proposed recommendations cover liquidity risk management and governance, stress testing and scenario design, and collateral management practices of non-bank financial institutions.</strong></em> </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) published today a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/04/liquidity-preparedness-for-margin-and-collateral-calls-consultation-report/">consultation report on liquidity preparedness for margin and collateral calls</a>. The report sets out eight proposed policy recommendations to enhance the liquidity preparedness of non-bank market participants for margin and collateral calls in centrally and non-centrally cleared derivatives and securities markets (including securities financing such as repo).</p>
<p>The report highlights the need for policy adjustments to deal with liquidity strains in the NBFI sector arising from spikes in margin and collateral calls during times of market stress, such as the March 2020 market turmoil, Archegos, and the commodities markets turmoil and stress in liability-driven investment funds in 2022. To achieve this, the FSB is proposing eight high-level and cross-sectoral policy recommendations that build on and complement existing rules and regulations on liquidity risk management across different sectors and jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The recommendations cover liquidity risk management and governance, stress testing and scenario design, and collateral management practices of non-bank market participants, focussing on liquidity risks arising from spikes in margin and collateral calls. They apply to non-bank market participants that may face margin and collateral calls, including insurance companies, pension funds, hedge funds, other investment funds and family offices. They are proposed to apply proportionately with a focus on non-bank market participants with material exposures to spikes in margin and collateral calls during times of stress. The report also highlights the need for financial intermediaries in bilateral transactions with non-financial entities, such as commodities traders, to consider assessing their liquidity preparedness for spikes in margin calls and collateral during times of stress.</p>
<p>The FSB is inviting comments on this consultation report and the questions set out there. Responses should be submitted via this secure&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/survey/236355?newtest=Y&amp;lang=en" rel="noopener" target="_blank">online form</a>&nbsp;by 18 June 2024.&nbsp;For questions, please contact the FSB (<a href="mailto:fsb@fsb.org">fsb@fsb.org</a>). Responses will be published on the FSB&rsquo;s website unless respondents expressly request otherwise on the online form.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>This work forms part of the FSB&rsquo;s work programme on enhancing the resilience of NBFI. It follows up on the findings of a review of margining practices conducted in 2022 by the (BCBS) Bank for International Settlements&rsquo; Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO). The review recommended that the FSB undertake additional international work on enhancing liquidity preparedness of market participants and on regulatory data gaps, so that authorities can better monitor the NBFI sector&rsquo;s liquidity preparedness.</p>
<p>Further details on the FSB&rsquo;s work programme to enhance resilience in NBFI can be found in its latest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/09/enhancing-the-resilience-of-non-bank-financial-intermediation-progress-report-3/">progress report</a>.</p>
<p>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. The FSB also conducts outreach with approximately 70 other jurisdictions through its six Regional Consultative Groups.</p>
<p>The FSB is chaired by Klaas Knot, President of De Nederlandsche Bank. The FSB Secretariat is located in Basel, Switzerland and hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>

</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="detailText">
<div class="paragraph">
<div>
<p>Clearstream, Deutsche B&ouml;rse&rsquo;s post-trade business, intends to make an investment in Digital Vault Services (DVS), a pioneering fintech offering issuance and safekeeping services for digital bank guarantees and sureties in Europe. The investment is subject to applicable regulatory approvals and finalisation of legal documentation.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div>
<p>The investment enables DVS to further enhance and broaden its offering as a market infrastructure solution for corporates and financial institutions. The mid-term plan will be to integrate DVS&rsquo;s Guarantee Vault with D7, the digital post-trade platform of Deutsche B&ouml;rse and its post-trade business Clearstream. This will allow D7 for the first time to expand its digital asset product portfolio to non-securities.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div>
<p>With DVS&rsquo;s established offering in Europe coupled with Clearstream&rsquo;s leverage and experience offering market infrastructure solutions and connectivity, both parties seek to bring added value to the trade finance ecosystem of corporates, banks and insurers. &nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div>
<p>Jens Hachmeister, Head of Issuer Services &amp; New Digital Markets at Clearstream, said: &ldquo;Digital leadership is a central part of Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group&rsquo;s Horizon 2026 strategy. The companies&rsquo; shared commitment to market innovation makes DVS a perfect fit for Deutsche B&ouml;rse and Clearstream. We are convinced that DVS&rsquo;s innovative approach to digital bank guarantees, combined with D7&rsquo;s track record in digitising securities and Clearstream&rsquo;s central role in global financial markets, will drive significant growth and deliver value for our clients and ultimately the entire financial industry.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div>
<p>Ludger Janssen, Co-CEO of Digital Vault Services, added: &ldquo;Clearstream has emerged as a strategic ally for DVS, echoing our dedication to streamlining processes and recognizing the transformative potential of digitisation in the financial industry, in particular with regards to guarantee management. With technology as our foundation, together with Clearstream and our central and digital guarantee registry, we foresee a unique end-to-end solution that disrupts and modernises outdated procedures with unparalleled efficiency.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div>
<p>Jaime Gimeno, Co-CEO of Digital Vault Services, added: &ldquo;Back in 2018, when designing a solution to the cumbersome paper-based process for issuing and storing guarantees, we took inspiration from the central securities depository model used in the securities industry. This strategic partnership with Clearstream now represents a major milestone in our growth journey towards becoming the recognized market infrastructure solution for guarantees in Europe. As we move forward the partnership also positions DVS for exciting new use cases and instruments.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div>
<p>Today&rsquo;s financial markets are highly fragmented with isolated technology solutions, resulting in slow processes, high error rates and costs for all market participants.

<p>ISDA has announced that it is extending its Digital Regulatory Reporting (DRR) initiative to several additional jurisdictions, enabling firms to implement changes to regulatory reporting requirements cost-effectively and accurately, reducing the risk of regulatory penalties for misreported data.</p>
<p>The ISDA DRR is being extended to cover rule amendments being implemented under the UK European Market Infrastructure Regulation and by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Those rule changes are due to be implemented in the UK on September 30, 2024, and October 21, 2024 in Australia and Singapore. The ISDA DRR code for all three sets of rules is currently available for market participants to review and test.</p>
<p>Regulators around the world are revising their reporting rules to incorporate globally agreed data standards to improve the cross-border consistency of what is reported and the format in which it is submitted. While more aligned, disparities will continue to exist in the various rule sets, meaning firms cannot take the work completed for one jurisdiction and apply it to another. Each set of requirements will need to be individually interpreted and applied, but there&rsquo;s no guarantee each firm will interpret the requirements in the same way, leading to inconsistencies and the potential for regulatory fines for those firms that get it wrong.</p>
<p>ISDA&rsquo;s DRR addresses this by establishing a golden-source interpretation of each rule set, reviewed and agreed by an industry committee. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/cdm/">Common Domain Model</a>&nbsp;&ndash; an open-source data standard for financial products, trades and lifecycle events &ndash; is then used to convert this mutualized interpretation into free, machine-readable code. Firms can either use the ISDA DRR as the basis for implementation or to validate an independent interpretation of the rules.</p>
<p>The first iteration of the ISDA DRR was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2022/11/22/isda-launches-digital-regulatory-reporting-1-0-and-opens-access-to-entire-market/">launched in November 2022</a>, ahead of the initial set of reporting rule changes introduced by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on December 5, 2022. The DRR has since been extended to cover amended rules in Japan that came into effect on April 1, 2024, and the EU, which will be implemented on April 29, 2024.</p>
<p>The DRR will be further extended to cover rule changes in Canada and Hong Kong, both due in 2025. The ISDA DRR code for those jurisdictions will be available well in advance of implementation. The DRR for the CFTC rules will also be updated to include further anticipated updates,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2023-12-28/pdf/2023-28350.pdf">currently under consultation at the commission</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ISDA DRR significantly reduces the time and cost needed to implement changes in reporting requirements. Rather than interpreting and implementing each set of rules themselves, and then repeating that work as the rules change in future, firms can implement code that has been validated and tested by industry participants and will be updated as rules are amended, enabling resources to be reassigned to other projects,&rdquo; said Scott O&rsquo;Malia, ISDA&rsquo;s Chief Executive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The DRR code for the UK, Australia, Singapore, Canada and Hong Kong will be available well ahead of the rules coming into effect, meaning firms will have plenty of time to implement and test the DRR before using it to report to regulators. Having supported the first phase of the CFTC rule amendments, we&rsquo;re also committed to updating the DRR to include any additional changes when finalized,&rdquo; Mr. O&rsquo;Malia added.</p>

<div> Keywords: FAST Conference, climate action, financing, sustainability, Asia-Pacific<br />
Summary: The second FAST Conference highlights the need for collective action, improved disclosures, and de-risking of transition financing to address climate challenges in Asia-Pacific.<br /><br /> <div>
<p><em>Distinguished Guests</em></p>
<p><em>Ladies and Gentlemen,</em></p>
<p><span>1. Good morning and welcome to the second edition of the Financing Asia&rsquo;s Transition (FAST) Conference 2024.</span></p>
<p>2. Each year, MAS, together with Temasek and BlackRock, seeks to convene key financial, industry and thought leaders in sustainability to focus on Asia. The Asia-Pacific region accounts for half of global emissions, and even excluding China, it accounts for 19% of emissions&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/financing-asias-transition-bridging-global-ambition-to-regional-action-and-impact#1">[1]</a></span>&nbsp;. This share will grow in the coming years. It will be in Asia where global actions in climate mitigation will ultimately succeed or fail.</p>
<p><span><span>More Collective Action Needed Amidst Challenges</span></span></p>
<p>3. At COP28 last year, we saw noteworthy achievements including the operationalisation of the loss and damage fund, the mobilisation of over USD 83 billion for climate action, and the conclusion of the first Global Stocktake.</p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;</span><span><span>Whilst there has been continued global commitment to collective action, more momentum is needed.&nbsp;</span></span><span>National climate action plans remain insufficient to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, or even to below 2 degrees Celsius.</span></p>
<p><span>5.&nbsp;</span><span><span>International collective action, difficult even in the best of times, will be needed in greater measure, but yet it faces growing challenges.</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Governments and policymakers are facing slower economic growth, still-elevated inflation and limited fiscal headroom amidst high levels of debt.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Financial institutions and businesses face rising costs in complying with regulatory and disclosure requirements, adjusting to carbon pricing policies, implementing their transition plans, and building resilience into their supply chains.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>6.&nbsp;</span><span><span>Social and political support for national climate action and international coordination will continue to be a contested arena.</span></span><span>&nbsp;As the costs of both climate change and the transition become more apparent, contention will grow between groups who view national and global efforts as insufficient, and those who think it is already too much.</span></p>
<p><span>7.&nbsp;</span><span>One unambiguous marker of the gap between need and reality is&nbsp;</span><span>the significant deficit in climate finance.</span>&nbsp;In January this year, the IMF estimated the annual shortfall to meet climate mitigation and adaptation needs in emerging and developing Asia to be at least USD 800 billion.&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/financing-asias-transition-bridging-global-ambition-to-regional-action-and-impact#2">[2]</a></span></p>
<p><span><span>Bridging Action to Needs in Asia&rsquo;s Climate Transition</span></span></p>
<p><span>8. Let me emphasise 3 key areas we have to get right if we are to bridge action to needs, increase momentum of action, and close financing gaps.</span></p>
<p><em><span>Sustaining Collective Commitment and Action</span></em></p>
<p>9.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span><span><span>First, there is simply no alternative to individual action and collective commitment.</span></span><span>&nbsp;This means that climate action has to be kept very much on the agenda of</span>&nbsp;<span>intergovernmental platforms, industry coalitions and private sector net zero commitments. There are over 90 intergovernmental initiatives&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/financing-asias-transition-bridging-global-ambition-to-regional-action-and-impact#3">[3]</a></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;and 160 industry cooperative initiatives&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/financing-asias-transition-bridging-global-ambition-to-regional-action-and-impact#4">[4]</a></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;globally. Last year, the World Bank launched the Private Sector Investment Lab, which seeks to develop solutions to address the barriers to private sector investment in emerging markets. These initiatives have been invaluable in mobilising support, germinating ideas, and forging partnerships.&nbsp;<span>In the next stage, we need to translate these into effectiveness and traction</span>. We need to go from ideas to pilots, from pilots to playbooks and standardisation, and then to scale.</span></p>
<p><span>10.&nbsp;</span><span><span>In Singapore, we are doing our part to sustain collective commitment and action.</span></span><span>&nbsp;For example, we host the GFANZ&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/financing-asias-transition-bridging-global-ambition-to-regional-action-and-impact#5">[5]</a></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Asia-Pacific Network Central Office and have also recently launched the Singapore Sustainable Finance Association to foster close collaboration across asset classes in the financial sector and the real economy.</span></p>
<p><span>11.&nbsp;<span>COP meetings have also developed into a critically important platform, not just for multilateral agreement, but also for facilitating partnerships, promoting the exchange of solutions, and communicating commitments and plans.&nbsp;</span></span><span>Ecosperity and this FAST conference are also key platforms that can&nbsp;</span><span>help to bring an Asian perspective and focus to a global dialogue and forge greater collaboration for the region.</span></p>
<p><span>12.&nbsp;<span>We will also have to sustain popular understanding and support for climate action.</span></span><span>&nbsp;Communicating the urgent need for action and demonstrating our collective resolve remain important planks for sustaining this support. We have to continue to do that and more. But there is an increasingly important second plank; of assuring the workforce and the public that as companies, sectors, and economies transition, and as jobs transform, there will be help given to manage this change and to benefit from it.</span></p>
<p><span>13.</span><span><span>&nbsp;Jobs in many sectors will see some transformation and new green jobs will be created.&nbsp;</span></span><span>In Asia Pacific, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) puts the potential opportunity at 14.2 million net green jobs by 2030&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/financing-asias-transition-bridging-global-ambition-to-regional-action-and-impact#6">[6]</a></span>&nbsp;.B</span><span>ut skills training and supporting policies will need to be in place so that this opportunity can be realised. For the financial sector too, we need to prepare a professional workforce that has the skills to provide the needed financing support to the region&rsquo;s transition.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Later this afternoon,&nbsp;<span>there will be a launch event of the Sustainable Finance Jobs Transformation Map (JTM) in partnership with the Institute of Banking and Finance Singapore and supported by Workforce Singapore</span>. The JTM assesses the impact of sustainable finance on jobs in Singapore&rsquo;s financial services sector. It identifies the new skills needed in existing job roles as well as the new job roles that will be created. Most importantly, the JTM enables the needed training to be designed and delivered.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><em><span>Strengthening Disclosures</span></em></p>
<p><span>14.&nbsp;</span><span><span>The second area of needed action I will mention is about strengthening disclosures.&nbsp;</span></span><span>To sustain commitment and the momentum of action, we need to sharpen accountability of all our actions, across both the public and private sectors, to shareholders, stakeholders and the public. Data and disclosures are key to this accountability.</span></p>
<p><span>15.&nbsp;<span>As we consider the need to sustain collective action, the quality and comparability of disclosures are important elements.&nbsp;</span></span><span>The development of sustainability disclosure standards began with important frameworks such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.</span></p>
<p><span>16.&nbsp;<span>We welcome the increasing global convergence towards the adoption of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) disclosure standards.</span></span><span>&nbsp;At COP28, nearly 400 organisations from 64 jurisdictions signed a statement committing to advancing the global adoption of the ISSB standards. Singapore supports the standardisation of disclosure requirements, and has announced that we will introduce mandatory climate reporting beginning in 2025 in alignment with the ISSB standards.&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/financing-asias-transition-bridging-global-ambition-to-regional-action-and-impact#7">[7]</a></span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;Pervasive international adoption of ISSB standards will reduce the complexity and cost of reporting by businesses and financial institutions, and focus resources on delivering high-quality reporting.</span></p>
<p><span>17.&nbsp;<span>Another enabler for high-quality disclosures is the building of good data infrastructure</span></span><span>. Last year, MAS launched Gprnt, an integrated digital platform that aims to automate and simplify businesses&rsquo; reporting of basic environmental, social and governance (ESG) data, which will be especially useful for small and medium sized companies.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>On a global level, we saw a proof of concept for the Net Zero Data Public Utility (NZDPU) at COP28, a global platform for corporate emissions data to be consolidated across sources and formats. Gprnt is working with the NZDPU to strengthen access by companies to key climate transition-related data across both platforms.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>These efforts help enable much needed sustainability-related data to be disclosed in a trusted and interoperable manner.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><em><span>Supporting the de-risking and viability of transition financing</span></em></p>
<p><span>18.&nbsp;</span><span><span>Third, we will need to bridge the financing gap through supporting the de-risking and viability of transition financing.</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>&nbsp;</span>According to IMF, the private sector will need to supply up to 90% of the USD 2 trillion needed annually by emerging market and developing economies to reach net zero by 2050.&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/financing-asias-transition-bridging-global-ambition-to-regional-action-and-impact#8">[8]</a></span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>However, in Asia, many transition projects are still unviable to commercial capital due to political, currency, and credit risk.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>19.&nbsp;</span><span><span>Bridging the financing gap will require both market solutions and a supportive policy environment.&nbsp;</span></span><span>We need to de-risk projects for investors and lenders, and also find ways to realise the value of environmental benefits to improve the commercial viability of projects.</span></p>
<p><span>20.&nbsp;<span>Multilateral Development Banks have a critical role to play in de-risking projects.&nbsp;</span></span><span>In recognition of this, the World Bank recently announced a streamlining of their guarantee solutions to a simple &ldquo;menu of options&rdquo; to allow improved access and faster execution. These changes will start from 1 July 2024, with a goal of tripling the World Bank Group&rsquo;s guarantee business to USD 20 billion by 2030.</span></p>
<p><span>21.&nbsp;</span><span><span>Public-private partnerships in the form of flexible concessional capital in blended finance platforms will be a primary vehicle to de-risk projects and improve viability for commercial capital to come in at scale.&nbsp;</span></span><span>At COP28 last year, we saw the launch of ALT</span><span>&Eacute;</span><span>RRA, a climate-focused fund with USD 30 billion in catalytic capital, which seeks to mobilise USD 250 billion by 2030 for climate change action. In Singapore, we aim to raise USD 5 billion together with international partners for a blended finance initiative focused on this region - the Financing Asia&rsquo;s Transition Partnership (FAST-P).</span></p>
<p><span>22.&nbsp;</span><span><span>We can do more to channel financing credibly and effectively to the region&rsquo;s transition needs, specifically through region-contextualised sectoral pathways.</span></span><span>&nbsp;Many financial institutions today reference global pathways, such as the International Energy Agency&rsquo;s (IEA) Net Zero Emissions Pathway, to set their net zero targets and develop their transition plans. We cannot expect every region&rsquo;s pathway to be the same. A set of credible transition pathways contextualised to Asia&rsquo;s needs will have to take into account that this region&rsquo;s energy demand is still growing in the near term. Regional sectoral pathways will enable financial institutions to better steward their clients and support the region&rsquo;s transition. MAS is thus working with credible pathway modellers like the IEA to explore the development of such region-contextualised sectoral pathways for Asia.</span></p>
<p><span>23.&nbsp;</span><span><span>Another goal is to capture the value from environmental benefits to improve the commercial viability of financing transition projects. Here, we aim to establish high-quality trusted transition credits. This requires market solutions and supportive policies.&nbsp;</span></span><span>MAS identified the early retirement of coal fired plants as a challenging use case which required intervention to be bankable. We launched the Transition Credits Coalition, or TRACTION&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/financing-asias-transition-bridging-global-ambition-to-regional-action-and-impact#9">[9]</a></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;for short, to bring together some 30 partners to enhance the economic viability of retiring coal plants early with transition credits.</span></p>
<p><span>24.&nbsp;</span><span><span>TRACTION&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>is looking into three areas</span></span><span>&nbsp;that are foundational to scaling transition credits &ndash;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span>First, enabling a supply of high-integrity transition credits.</span></span><span>&nbsp;This is a new type of carbon credit where methodologies are still under development. As there is currently no unified framework for assessing the quality of transition credits, we want to bring greater clarity to market participants about the characteristics that high-integrity transition credits should have.</span></li>
<li><span><span>Second, developing a toolkit of solutions to enhance the replicability of transition credit transactions.&nbsp;</span></span><span>While such transactions can be highly complex and challenging to scale, we see the potential value of drawing out common considerations, solutions and structuring approaches. TRACTION will thus look to develop a playbook that can help coal plant owners, project developers and financiers to utilise transition credits.</span></li>
<li><span><span>Third, building investor confidence in transition credits.</span></span><span>&nbsp;For transition credits to be commercially viable, they will need to meet the expectations of credits off-takers. Close engagements with investors in both voluntary and compliance markets will help the design of credits to better meet these expectations.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>25.&nbsp;</span><span><span>In parallel, work has begun on two pilot projects</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;to apply transition credits in coal phase-out transactions.&nbsp;</span></span><span>Based on early estimates, the transition credits could help bring forward the retirement of two coal plants by at least 5 years, translating to a reduction of more than 3 million tonnes of carbon emissions per year. By way of comparison, this would be twice the emissions savings achieved if all light vehicles in Singapore were converted to electric vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Conclusion</span></span></p>
<p><span>26.&nbsp;</span>Let me conclude. To bridge global climate ambition to regional action and impact, we need to ensure that the challenges of growing contention and rising costs do not erode our collective commitment to action. There is no alternative to strengthening the momentum of action through multilateral agreements, industry coalitions and national and corporate net zero plans.</p>
<p>27. We still have much to do ahead of us if we are to bridge Global Ambitions to Finance Asia&rsquo;s Transition. We have to sustain collective commitment and action; strengthen climate disclosures and accountability; and support the de-risking and viability of transition financing.</p>
<p>28. I wish you a fruitful conference ahead, identifying opportunities, forging partnerships and renewing purpose and commitment. Thank you.</p>

<div> Lawyers, technology, judgement, critical skills, AI
Summary:
- Lawyers should incorporate technology and AI into their practice with proactive oversight.
- Technology has a long history of collaboration with law, lawyers should adapt.
- Technology brings both opportunities and challenges to legal practice.
- Lawyers need critical thinking, curiosity, skepticism, and judgement to effectively use technology.
- Advanced technology necessitates a level of technical proficiency to enhance legal services. 
- Summary: Lawyers must embrace and responsibly utilize technology, AI, while maintaining traditional critical skills like judgement. <div>
<h4>KEY POINTS</h4>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s clearly in lawyers&rsquo; interests, and in the interests of their clients, for lawyers to stay &lsquo;tech-smart&rsquo;.</li>
<li>However, the more technology advances, the more human judgement can be seen as a defining feature of legal practice.</li>
<li>With the increased use of technology in law, lawyers need to employ some critical skills to operate effectively in this environment, including curiosity and willingness to learn, a healthy scepticism and the application of good judgement.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Check against delivery</span></p>
<p>Before I begin, I would like to acknowledge the traditional owners and custodians of the land on which we meet today, the Wurundjeri people of the Kulin nation, and pay my respects to their Elders past, present and future. I extend that respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people here today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you this evening.</p>
<p>I commend the University of Melbourne Centre for AI and Digital Ethics, and the Ninian Stephen Law Program, for their ongoing commitment to building the capability of the legal profession to respond to the challenges of rapid sociotechnical change.</p>
<p>Sir Ninian was known for his<em>&nbsp;clarity of thinking and his extraordinarily wide-ranging interests. Over 40 years ago,&nbsp;</em>as far back as 1983, addressing a seminar at the Australian National University, he said that we must be &lsquo;skilful in our use of the electronic tools which the information revolution has given us&rsquo;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/technology-in-the-professional-toolkit/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>[1]</span></a>.</p>
<p>Sir Ninian was right. Let me elaborate.</p>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>The more technology advances, the more human judgement can be seen as a defining feature of legal practice.</p>
<p>You may have heard the view expressed that technological developments present a challenge to law and its practice.</p>
<p>But I think the view that the legal system struggles to keep pace with the rapid &ndash; and, it&rsquo;s usually assumed, inevitably positive &ndash; developments in technology, doesn&rsquo;t do justice to the dynamic ways in which lawyers have adapted to these changes.</p>
<p>In essence, it&rsquo;s a matter of lawyers using, and continuing to use, critical human and intellectual skills &ndash; including, in particular,&nbsp;<span>judgement</span>&nbsp;&ndash; to adapt to new circumstances.</p>
<p>In my view, technology is a necessary tool in a lawyer&rsquo;s toolkit &ndash; but it&rsquo;s not the only one. To put it in a nutshell: the more technology advances, the more it shows that lawyers are going to be with us for some time yet.</p>
<p>And this evening I&rsquo;d like to explore what that means.</p>
<h2>Law and technology</h2>
<p>So first, the relationship between law and technology.</p>
<p>Twenty-five years ago, a company called Napster argued that law can&rsquo;t keep up with technology, while its users shared songs illegally. Then, copyright infringement suits suggested otherwise.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/technology-in-the-professional-toolkit/#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span>[2]</span></a></p>
<p>On the other hand, when law&nbsp;<span>does</span>&nbsp;step in, the argument is then made that law and regulation are preventing innovation. But, given the changes we&rsquo;ve all seen in our own lifetime, I think it&rsquo;s pretty clear that innovation still happens.</p>
<p>I think if we look closely at the practice of law, we can see that&nbsp;<span>law and technology have a long history of working together</span>&nbsp;&ndash; as lawyers exercise judgement and employ critical thinking to adapt to technology&rsquo;s developments and advances. Let me give a few examples.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start with copyright law. The &lsquo;idea-expression&rsquo; distinction has accommodated a range of innovations &ndash; from the printing press, to peer-to-peer networks, through to large language models or LLMs. Although software stretched copyright &ndash; and copyright lawyers &ndash; for some time, eventually it was incorporated into the regime as a literary work.</p>
<p>The rise of the open-source movement &ndash; originally 'copyleft' &ndash; was in part a philosophical response to monopolies granted by copyright law. But, the open-source innovation has thrived &ndash; Linux is an example of this. The success of the open-source movement can be partly credited to creative copyright lawyers, who had a strong grasp of the underlying technologies, developing innovative licensing regimes &ndash; such as the creative commons licence.</p>
<p>In recent times, we are seeing this play out with large language models. Both technologists and lawyers are grappling with questions such as: Does training LLMs infringe copyright? Do the fair dealing defences apply? Are the works generated by LLMs protected by copyright &ndash; that is, is there sufficient &lsquo;sweat of the brow&rsquo; to receive protection? And so on.</p>
<p>These are examples of people &ndash; lawyers &ndash; seeking to understand new technology and its ramifications. And they were using the skills we expect of lawyering in general: curiosity, open-mindedness, and most importantly, judgement.</p>
<p>Another example of lawyers applying existing principles and skills in the realm of new technology might be found in anti-spam law, and the concept of trespass to chattels.</p>
<p>The invention of a fence around my property was, at the time, an evolution of technology. It also gave clarity to legal disputes: if you cross my fence, you&rsquo;ve trespassed. But when you stand on the other side of my fence and scare my sheep, I go to a lawyer, who makes a case that you are&nbsp;<span>sort of</span>&nbsp;trespassing &ndash; you&rsquo;re trespassing to chattels.</p>
<p>A few centuries pass, and the principle is applied to a new kind of &lsquo;property interference&rsquo;. That is, the concept of &lsquo;trespass to chattels&rsquo;, which applied originally as a charge against someone who didn&rsquo;t&nbsp;<span>exactly</span>&nbsp;trespass, but messed with your livestock, is later used in court cases against spammers. The argument is that the spammers aren&rsquo;t quite trespassing &ndash; just as a postman isn&rsquo;t trespassing when he or she comes to your door to deliver a parcel. But, since they are clogging the servers, they are &lsquo;messing with&rsquo; your property, that is, trespassing to chattels.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/technology-in-the-professional-toolkit/#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><span>[3]</span></a></p>
<p>This is not a story of&nbsp;<span>law</span>&nbsp;and technology &ndash; it&rsquo;s a story of&nbsp;<span>lawyers</span>&nbsp;and technology.</p>
<p>So we can see that lawyers can and do apply longstanding principles and employ critical thinking to help our understanding of new technological experiences. But is the opposite also true? Can technology contribute to the practice of lawyering?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very clear that it can. And that it does.</p>
<p>The speed and scale of the progress of technology in the law can easily be overlooked. Why? Because many of us take for granted the technology that was once innovative.</p>
<p>I remember when I started as a lawyer in the early 80s, the most advanced technology in the firm was the telex machine. My firm had one &ndash; and, believe it or not, we would share that infrastructure with other firms.</p>
<p>Then, of course, the mighty fax machine turned up, and telex disappeared; and then, the now ubiquitous email arrived. Typewriters were rapidly overtaken by word processors, and all of a sudden, documents became digital.</p>
<p>And now we have the Australasian Legal Information Institute or &lsquo;AUSTLII&rsquo;. Most of us today couldn&rsquo;t imagine a world without it. Yet, it was one of the first efforts to digitise and democratise legal resources. It spearheaded the adoption of medium-neutral citation protocols. This enabled the automation of content gathering and retrieval in a way not previously seen, certainly not in any free resource.</p>
<p>And today, many legal practitioners &ndash; and law enforcement agencies &ndash; increasingly rely on &lsquo;Technology Assisted Review&rsquo; or &lsquo;TAR&rsquo;, particularly in the e-discovery space. TAR processes - such as de-duplication of documents, email threading or a &lsquo;find similar&rsquo; function - are as groundbreaking as they are becoming increasingly necessary.</p>
<p>With our ever-growing digital footprints, for lawyers to continue to maintain their duty to their client of due care and skill, it is arguable that they&nbsp;<span>must</span>&nbsp;turn to technological advances such as TAR.</p>
<p>These are all examples of technology evolving and being adopted by lawyers to improve their practice of the law &ndash; and lawyers adapting to changing circumstances.</p>
<h2>Technology: challenge or opportunity?</h2>
<p>But of course, while technology can very clearly be a benefit, like many things, it can also bring challenges.</p>
<p>New technology brings with it risks that have to be managed &ndash; ethical considerations, confidentiality issues, and due diligence &ndash; to name but a few. As one lawyer in the United States infamously found out last year, using ChatGPT without independently verifying its &lsquo;findings&rsquo; can get you in hot water.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/technology-in-the-professional-toolkit/#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><span>[4]</span></a></p>
<p>Which brings me to artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>We all see that AI is an astonishing development. The potential benefits to businesses and individuals are enormous &ndash; with an estimated &lsquo;additional $170 billion to $600 billion a year to Australia&rsquo;s GDP by 2030.&rsquo;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/technology-in-the-professional-toolkit/#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><span>[5]</span></a></p>
<p>And AI can bring both challenges and opportunities to lawyers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start with the challenges.</p>
<p>First off, let&rsquo;s be frank: large language models can&rsquo;t think. They&rsquo;re language generators, but they do not&nbsp;<span>think</span>&nbsp;&ndash; as human beings usually understand the term. They can create extensive, comprehensible, even &ndash; mostly &ndash; accurate linguistic output. But they lack judgement.</p>
<p>While LLMs can provide detailed answers about how certain ethical frameworks apply in respect of certain decisions, they are themselves without ethics. So while AI might assist in&nbsp;<span>applying logic</span>, it does not &ndash; and cannot &ndash; apply&nbsp;<span>ethical judgement</span>&nbsp;about which logic to follow or why.</p>
<p>Nor can generative AI balance &lsquo;best interests&rsquo; of the client, or employ critical thinking. For example, if you ask an LLM a question that assumes something untrue, it will take that assumption as true. A human being, on the other hand, may find - through research - that the assumption was false.</p>
<p>This leads us to the much-vaunted issue of &lsquo;AI hallucination&rsquo;. Recent research from Stanford University has shown that &lsquo;legal hallucinations are pervasive and disturbing&rsquo;, ranging from &lsquo;69% to 88% in response to specific legal queries for state-of-the-art language models. Moreover, these models often lack self-awareness about their errors and tend to reinforce incorrect legal assumptions and beliefs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So, while an unscrupulous lawyer might conceivably try to deceive the court, he or she would do that in full knowledge that they&rsquo;d made the case up. AI, on the other hand, thinks it&rsquo;s done its job well, simply because it has provided the answer to the question it was asked.</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve seen in the case of the lawyer in the United States, AI hallucinations can be a major risk for an individual lawyer&rsquo;s case, career, and firm. But the irresponsible use of AI has a broader, more pervasive, and potentially destructive challenge for legal practitioners.</p>
<p>If stories of lawyers using and trusting &lsquo;AI legal hallucinations&rsquo; abound, public trust in the legal system &ndash; and in the rule of law &ndash; becomes eroded. As professionals, lawyers have a duty to the court, to their profession, to their client, and fundamentally to the rule of law itself.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/technology-in-the-professional-toolkit/#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><span>[6]</span></a></p>
<p>So AI can be harmful to lawyers and the legal profession when it is used without bringing to bear a healthy scepticism, a critical eye, and the exercise of judgement.</p>
<p>But what of the&nbsp;<span>opportunities</span>&nbsp;that AI presents? Like the telex machine of old, or the use of TAR in e-discovery, can AI contribute positively to a lawyer&rsquo;s work?</p>
<p>Well, according to Goldman Sachs research from last year, 44% of legal work can or will eventually be replaced by AI.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/technology-in-the-professional-toolkit/#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><span>[7]</span></a>&nbsp;A recent Australian survey also showed a strong belief among Australian law firms that by 2028, AI will be doing at least some legal work.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/technology-in-the-professional-toolkit/#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><span>[8]</span></a></p>
<p>But &ndash; before you rush to consider a career change - let&rsquo;s look a little closer.</p>
<p>Joint research between Microsoft and the Tech Council of Australia suggests that only 10% of solicitor tasks could be&nbsp;<span>fully</span>&nbsp;automated<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/technology-in-the-professional-toolkit/#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"><span>[9]</span></a>&nbsp;&ndash; the rest would involve AI and human lawyers working together.</p>
<p>So what kind of legal work can AI do? The most obvious is research and review &ndash; again, provided there are sufficient checks and balances. In this case, just as a senior lawyer can&rsquo;t accept blindly whatever a junior gives them, neither should they blindly accept whatever comes out of their LLM of choice.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, AI can be useful for lawyers in research. Another possible use might be in assisting with e-discovery &ndash; provided its &lsquo;findings&rsquo; aren&rsquo;t trusted implicitly.</p>
<p>Interestingly, AI can also be used, to an extent, in the assessment of rights. For example, the self-styled &lsquo;AI consumer champion&rsquo; donotpay.com, a US-based online legal service and chat-bot, has helped individuals overturn more than 160,000 traffic offences.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/technology-in-the-professional-toolkit/#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><span>[10]</span></a>&nbsp;This might have interesting consequences for improving the decisions of regulators whose job it is to issue such tickets. If those regulators know that there are freely available tools which can readily check the validity of a ticket, it may be that less tickets would be issued which can be appealed.</p>
<h2>Technological literacy</h2>
<p>It should be clear by now that technology having an influence on the law is a given. But what that influence is, depends on lawyers themselves. Which brings me to my final point &ndash; it&rsquo;s clearly in lawyers&rsquo; interests, and in the interests of their clients, for lawyers to stay &lsquo;tech-smart&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Indeed, some have suggested that legal thinking itself is already moving in this direction. With legal databases becoming more and more a key part of legal practice, it&rsquo;s argued that &lsquo;lawyers are beginning to think of the law as a collection of facts and principles that can be assembled, disassembled, and reassembled in a variety of ways for different purposes&rsquo;.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/technology-in-the-professional-toolkit/#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"><span>[11]</span></a>&nbsp;This smacks of Thomas Carlyle&rsquo;s lament 200 years ago that &lsquo;men are grown mechanical in head and in heart, as well as in hand.&rsquo;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/technology-in-the-professional-toolkit/#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"><span>[12]</span></a></p>
<p>The point is that, to the extent this &lsquo;mechanising&rsquo; of the legal mind is real &ndash; only to that extent will AI replace it. If, as I&rsquo;ve shown, there&rsquo;s space for technology and lawyers to work together, this is&nbsp;<span>not</span>&nbsp;achieved through any kind of routine mechanical thinking. A machine will&nbsp;<span>always</span>&nbsp;beat a human at being mechanical. And so it should.</p>
<p>Now, with the increased use of technology in law, lawyers need to employ some critical skills &ndash; skills they have always used &ndash; to operate effectively in this environment. &nbsp;</p>
<p>What are those critical skills? To reiterate, they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>curiosity and willingness to learn</li>
<li>a healthy scepticism, and</li>
<li>application of judgement.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are skills that mark out a good lawyer irrespective of any questions about technology. But they are needed more than ever now, in our evolving technological environment.</p>
<p>Much of what is routine, linear, or mechanical, can &ndash; and will &ndash; be replaced by something that excels in the routine, in the linear, in the mechanical. In fact, evidence suggests that LLMs are more efficient and effective at compiling lists of relevant cases than junior lawyers.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/technology-in-the-professional-toolkit/#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"><span>[13]</span></a>&nbsp;But, as I&rsquo;ve said, mechanical research must be tempered by real-world fact-checking.</p>
<p>Ultimately, as AI advances to equal human prediction and analysis, it only highlights the greater need for that uniquely human skill: judgement.</p>
<p>When Steven Schwartz effectively outsourced his research to ChatGPT in&nbsp;<em>Mata v. Avianca</em>, he was exhibiting an&nbsp;<span>open mind</span>&nbsp;about the potential benefits of AI. And that&rsquo;s good. But he failed to display a healthy&nbsp;<span>curiosity</span>&nbsp;about it. That meant he didn&rsquo;t fully understand it, and treated it like a search engine, not a generative language model. He also failed to show a healthy&nbsp;<span>scepticism</span>&nbsp;that would have led him to cross-checking the AI&rsquo;s output.</p>
<p>So wouldn&rsquo;t it be safer for lawyers to reject technological developments such as AI? I think not.</p>
<p>Lawyers today clearly need a level of technical proficiency.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/technology-in-the-professional-toolkit/#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14"><span>[14]</span></a>&nbsp;In fact, some have argued failing to take advantage of technology &lsquo;could be considered unethical, even malpractice, because technology-assisted legal practice can yield substantively better legal results.&rsquo;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/technology-in-the-professional-toolkit/#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15"><span>[15]</span></a></p>
<p>As far back as 2018, it was being suggested by an Australian academic, Dr Michael McNamara from Flinders University, that the evolution of technology:</p>
<p>&lsquo;should be welcomed as a natural evolution and innovation in the delivery of legal services (just like the emergence of the modern solicitor and barrister) rather than as a cause for concern. Without a wave of legally and technologically literate graduates, who either join existing law firms with fresh ideas, compete with legal practitioners by operating outside the purview of legal practice, or completely disrupt legal services with innovation, the legal profession risks stagnating&rsquo;.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/technology-in-the-professional-toolkit/#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16"><span>[16]</span></a></p>
<p>In essence, the legal profession&rsquo;s interaction with emerging technologies should be<span>&nbsp;proactive, strategic and bold</span>.</p>
<p>Lawyers need to be able to use technology &ndash; including AI &ndash; in order to actually do their job and discharge their duties. And they must have a level of data capability &ndash; the expertise to find, analyse, understand, and utilise data.</p>
<p>Now, you might be wondering how this aligns with what I&rsquo;ve said to market participants on other occasions, about the dangers of rushing into innovations such as AI. My response to that is &ndash; our warnings have always been grounded in the risks of what happens when there is a lack of appropriate controls, or proper governance. And lawyers have always played a key role in governance. And so, effective supervision and oversight are critical - to ensure technology is used responsibly.</p>
<p>By being&nbsp;<span>proactive, strategic, and bold</span>&nbsp;in their interaction with technology, lawyers can solve problems, not just identify risks.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>In conclusion, we must be careful with generative AI but not afraid of it. Technology has, in one form or other, always been here - and the history of law is very often in lockstep with the history of technological development.</p>
<p>Sometimes that means the law helps shape our understanding and experience of technology &ndash; other times, it&rsquo;s technology that changes the legal profession.</p>
<p>In any case, with the ever-increasing use of technology in law, being a lawyer means understanding those changes. Just as the public expects ASIC to be a bold regulator, I believe it also expects the legal profession to be bold in the face of technological advances &ndash; particularly if those advances could, eventually, offer greater &lsquo;democratisation&rsquo; of access to justice.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, this means all of us in the legal profession asking the right questions, to make sure we understand the benefits &ndash; and the harms.</p>
<p>Above all, in a world of AI and big data, being a lawyer means having a range of tools in your toolkit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, while technology is very much a necessary tool in that toolkit, being a lawyer also requires responsible oversight of that technology. And it requires &ndash; now more than ever &ndash; cultivating an open-minded curiosity, a willingness to learn, and a persistent scepticism.</p>
<p>In a word, it requires judgement.</p>

<title>ISDA Margin Survey Shows $1.4 Trillion In Margin Collected At Year-End 2023</title>

<div> margin survey, initial margin, variation margin, derivatives market, non-cleared derivatives
Summary:
ISDA's latest margin survey shows that $1.4 trillion of margin was collected at year-end 2023, with $462.0 billion of IM and $944.5 billion of VM. The survey includes 32 leading derivatives market participants and covers the margin received by phase-one firms and the amount of IM posted by all market participants to major central counterparties. ISDA is working on initiatives to increase automation and efficiency in collateral management processes. <div>
<p>ISDA has published its latest margin survey, which shows that $1.4 trillion of initial margin (IM) and variation margin (VM) was collected by 32 leading derivatives market participants for their non-cleared derivatives exposures at the end of 2023, unchanged from the previous year.</p>
<p>The $1.4 trillion total comprised $462.0 billion of IM and $944.5 billion of VM, compared to $325.7 billion of IM and $1.1 trillion of VM at the end of 2022. The 32 firms covered by the ISDA Margin Survey included all 20 of the firms subject to the first phase of regulatory IM requirements for non-cleared derivatives in September 2016 (phase-one entities), five of the six phase-two firms and seven of the eight phase-three entities.</p>
<p>Total margin received by the 20 phase-one firms was $1.3 trillion, a fall of 0.6% from the previous year. This included $432.3 billion of IM (a 40.8% increase versus 2022) and $851.0 billion of VM (a decline of 13.5%).</p>
<p>The survey also reports the amount of IM posted by all market participants to major central counterparties. Total IM posted for cleared interest rate derivatives (IRD) and single-name and index credit default swaps (CDS) reached $392.2 billion at the end of 2023, a rise of 2% compared to the year before. Of this, $331.8 billion was posted for cleared IRD transactions and $60.4 billion was delivered for cleared CDS exposures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The introduction of the sixth phase of the margin rules in September 2022 means more entities than ever before need to post IM for their non-cleared derivatives exposures, and additional firms continue to come into scope each year. This significantly reduces counterparty credit risk, but it does also mean that large amounts of high-quality liquid assets need to be sourced to meet margin calls, which means collateral management processes need to be as efficient as possible,&rdquo; said Scott O&rsquo;Malia, ISDA&rsquo;s Chief Executive.</p>
<p>ISDA is working on several initiatives to apply the Common Domain Model &ndash; an open-source data standard for financial products, trades and lifecycle events &ndash; to collateral management documentation, collateral representation and margin and settlement processes to increase automation and efficiency and reduce operational, liquidity and counterparty risks.

<div> EWG, FWG, balanced growth, AML, sustainable finance
Summary:
U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen met with the Economic and Financial Working Groups to discuss balanced growth, AML, and sustainable finance.<br /><br /> <div>
<p>U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen met with the Economic Working Group (EWG) and Financial Working Group (FWG) on April 16. Following her trip to Beijing and Guangzhou last week, Secretary Yellen and the leads of the two groups had productive conversations about how the working groups can continue to advance the bilateral relationship across areas of both cooperation and disagreement. In particular, the Secretary received updates from the EWG on their work on the Intensive Exchange on Balanced Growth in the Domestic and Global Economies and from the FWG on the new Joint Treasury-People&rsquo;s Bank of China Cooperation and Exchange on Anti-Money Laundering (AML), as well as upcoming plans for technical exercises on financial stability. Secretary Yellen closed the meeting by welcoming further communication to stabilize the economic relationship.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s EWG meeting was its fourth meeting since its establishment last fall, and the first in the United States since November. Senior officials from the U.S. Treasury and China&rsquo;s Ministry of Finance continued their conversations on&nbsp;the latest macroeconomic situation in China and the United States, shared global challenges including debt issues, as well as areas with divergent views. The teams also engaged in discussions on balanced growth in the domestic and global economies that Secretary Yellen and her counterpart Vice Premier He Lifeng announced in Guangzhou earlier this month. Both sides agreed to discuss economic&nbsp;policies that support balanced growth of the domestic and global economies at a regular cadence. The U.S. delegation continued to express concerns about China&rsquo;s non-market practices and industrial overcapacity.&nbsp;Both sides agreed to further discuss these issues.</p>
<p>The FWG also met for the fourth time on Tuesday, led by senior officials from the U.S. Treasury and the PBOC, with participation by other agencies.&nbsp; The meetings began with a review of the latest technical exchange in March, which discussed each jurisdiction&rsquo;s approach to financial stability oversight.&nbsp; The meeting sessions included discussions on banks&rsquo; liquidity risk management, financial stability and market developments, swap arrangement practices, cross-border payments and data, and sustainable finance, among other topics.&nbsp; As agreed in Beijing, the first Joint Treasury-PBOC Cooperation and Exchange on AML also met under the auspices of the FWG to discuss several priority AML/CFT issues, including virtual assets and beneficial ownership.&nbsp; The meetings again concluded with both sides agreeing to continue to meet regularly and to hold additional technical exercises on operational resilience in the financial sector, supervision and regulation on cross-border supply of financial services, and on the financial stability implications from the insurance sector&rsquo;s exposure to climate risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secretary Yellen also welcomed new progress in the FWG on sustainable finance. The U.S. Treasury and the PBOC have agreed to mutual areas of interest in this space.&nbsp; Both sides agreed on the importance of transition finance to support the decarbonization of various sectors, including through the voluntary commitments financial institutions make to decarbonize.&nbsp; Both sides also recognized that degradation of ecosystems and loss of biodiversity represent economic challenges, and that financial support for conservation and restoration is critical. Treasury and PBOC see the value of sustainable finance in supporting low-carbon climate resilient development, including through renewable energy expansion, capacity building, and adaptation financing around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EWG and FWG were formed by Secretary Yellen and Vice Premier He last September. The EWG is co-led by Jay Shambaugh, Under Secretary for International Affairs at the U.S. Treasury, and Liao Min, Vice Minister of China&rsquo;s Ministry of Finance. The FWG is co-led by Brent Neiman, Assistant Secretary for International Finance at the U.S. Treasury, and Xuan Changneng, Deputy Governor of the People&rsquo;s Bank of China. Both working groups build on President Biden&rsquo;s guidance following the Bali and Woodside Summits to deepen communications between the two countries.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Prepared Remarks Before The 2024 43rd Annual Small Business Forum, SEC Chair Gary Gensler, Washington D.C., April 16, 2024</title>

<div> Securities and Exchange Commission, Small Business Forum, small businesses, investors, capital markets<br />
Summary: SEC Chair Gensler welcomes attendees to the 43rd Annual Small Business Forum, highlighting the importance of small businesses and seeking input for policy recommendations. <div>
<p>Good afternoon. Thank you, Stacey for your introduction. As is customary, I&rsquo;d like to note that my views are my own as Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and I am not speaking on behalf of my fellow Commissioners or the staff.</p>
<p>Stacey Bowers joined us in January as the new director of the Office of the Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation (OASB). We are excited to have her as part of the SEC&rsquo;s team advancing our important work on behalf of small businesses and their investors.</p>
<p>In 1980, Congress directed the SEC to hold an annual Small Business Forum so the Commission could hear directly from small businesses and their investors about the unique issues that they face. Today, I&rsquo;m pleased to welcome you to the SEC&rsquo;s 43rd Annual Forum. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I grew up in a small business household. My grandparents on one side opened and ran a grocery store and on the other side a bar, both in Baltimore. My dad, Sam Gensler, started a small business repairing vending machines. It grew into a small vending machine business that served hundreds of other small businesses in the process, such as small diners and bars.</p>
<p>In this sense, my family&rsquo;s business was part of a larger community of small businesses, whose owners were as diverse as the city of Baltimore.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs and small businesses are integral to our capital markets. In fact, more than 99 percent of U.S. businesses are small, and their employees make up nearly half of the American private sector employees.</p>
<p>From 1995-2021, small businesses created nearly two out of every three new jobs.</p>
<p>At the SEC, our job is to serve investors building for a better future and companies of every size. We are working to make our markets more efficient, competitive, transparent, fair&mdash;and worthy of the public&rsquo;s trust. We work to ensure that markets serve investors and issuers alike&mdash;not the other way around.</p>
<p>At the SEC, we have educational resources to help equip small businesses and investors with the tools to help navigate capital raising. Please check out SEC.gov and Investor.gov.</p>
<p>As you discuss the various topics over the next three days&mdash;from early-stage stories to investing in early-stage companies to accessing the public markets&mdash;please share your ideas and policy recommendations with us. We greatly benefit from your perspective and willingness to engage.</p>
<p>This forum will inform a report that will be delivered to Congress. Further, your perspective may help the Commission consider policies to benefit small businesses, like my dad and grandad&rsquo;s and so many across America.</p>
<p>Thank you, and now turning it back to the rest of the program.</p>

<div> appointed, investors, climate change, engagement, leadership
Summary:<br />CalPERS COO appointed Steering Committee chair of Climate Action 100+ organization, leading engagement with 700 investors to address climate change. Co-founded in 2017. Taking vigorous action on climate. <div>
<p>CalPERS today announced that Chief Operating Investment Officer&nbsp;<a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/page/about/organization/executive-officers/michael-cohen" target="_self">Michael Cohen</a>&nbsp;has been appointed Steering Committee chair of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.climateaction100.org/" target="_blank" title="Opens in new window">Climate Action 100+</a>, a global organization of investors working with the world&rsquo;s largest companies to fight climate change.</p>
<p>Climate Action 100+ represents more than 700 institutional investors engaging companies to improve their climate change governance, cut emissions, and strengthen climate-related financial disclosures.</p>
<p>"Our organization played a pivotal role in creating Climate Action 100+," said CalPERS Chief Executive Officer Marcie Frost. "Michael will be a steady hand for the Steering Committee at a crucial moment, one where our fiduciary duty requires swift and substantive action on climate change to ensure long-term value for our members, their families, and their retirement security."</p>
<p>The Steering Committee sets overall initiative strategy and is currently chaired by Fran&ccedil;ois Humbert of Generali Asset Management. The role rotates every 12 months between different regional representatives on the committee.</p>
<p>"I am honored to be appointed chair of the Steering Committee and eager to help guide the organization through its next phase of investor engagement," said Cohen. "Climate Action 100+ was founded to ensure companies take meaningful steps to address the existential financial threats from climate change. There is still more to do to constructively engage with our corporate partners and build upon early successes."</p>
<p>Since its founding, Climate Action 100+ has engaged 170 companies to address climate change. Those efforts have led to three-quarters of the companies committing to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Almost all the companies have board committee oversight of both climate change risks and opportunities.</p>
<p>CalPERS co-founded Climate Action 100+ in 2017 and served as its inaugural chair.</p>
<p>In addition to its integral role with Climate Action 100+, CalPERS has taken vigorous action on the climate front:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/page/newsroom/calpers-news/2024/calpers-applauds-sec-transparency-climate-disclosure-rule-notes-more-to-be-done" target="_self">supporting</a>&nbsp;the SEC climate disclosure rule,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/page/newsroom/calpers-news/2024/calpers-proxy-voting-global-company-accountability-for-climate-change-board-independence-executive-compensation" target="_self">holding companies accountable</a>&nbsp;for climate-related risk, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/page/newsroom/calpers-news/2023/calpers-announces-100-billion-net-zero-pledge-and-new-climate-accountability-measures" target="_self">developing the Sustainable Investing 2030 Plan</a>&nbsp;to move its portfolio to net zero emissions.</p>

<div> SEC, small business, forum, capital raising, entrepreneurs 
Summary:
SEC's 43rd annual Small Business Forum brings together voices of early-stage founders, capital allocators, and small public companies. Emphasis on underrepresented founders, wealth gap, investor role, and policy recommendations. 
<br /><br /> <div>
<p>Welcome to the SEC&rsquo;s 43rd&nbsp;annual Small Business Forum. I&rsquo;d like to thank all of you for joining us over the course of the next three days to hear the voices of early-stage founders, capital allocators, and small public companies. I am excited to be here as the new Director of the Small Business Advocacy Office and to play a role in this important Commission event that brings together the small business community, the Commissioners, and other government and thought leaders.</p>
<p>Before I say much more, on behalf of myself and my colleagues here at the SEC, I want to make clear that the views expressed today are each speaker&rsquo;s own &mdash; in my case in my capacity as the Director of the Small Business Advocacy Office &mdash; and do not necessarily reflect those of the Commission, any of the Commissioners, or any of our colleagues on the Staff.</p>
<p>While I wish I had put a nickel in my savings every time I heard it, it nonetheless remains true that small businesses and their investors are vital to our economy, no matter their life cycle stage. For instance, did you know that small businesses created over 43% of U.S. GDP last year?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/bowers-remarks-small-business-forum-041624#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Or that women owned or co-owned almost 45% of non-employer small businesses &mdash; that&rsquo;s 11.5 million firms &mdash; and almost 40% of employer small businesses &mdash; another 2.1 million firms.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/bowers-remarks-small-business-forum-041624#_ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;And were you aware that over the last 10 years, diverse businesses have created over 4.7 million jobs?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/bowers-remarks-small-business-forum-041624#_ftn3">[3]</a>&nbsp;How about the fact that small businesses accounted for 54% of employment in rural areas?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/bowers-remarks-small-business-forum-041624#_ftn4">[4]</a>&nbsp;Or that small public companies raised $4.6 billion in registered offerings in 2022?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/bowers-remarks-small-business-forum-041624#_ftn5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Over the course of the next three days, I am excited to hear from leaders who have personal knowledge of the issues facing small businesses and their investors. We will have the chance to learn first-hand from one-on-one conversations with those who have lived the small business experience and survived to tell the tale. We will also engage with panels of individuals from the small business community who will share their insights and take-aways, and you in the audience will have the opportunity to ask them questions.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s focus will be on amplifying the stories of early-stage businesses, including conversations about barriers to entry for underrepresented founders and bridging the wealth gap. Tomorrow, we will open the dialogue with investors on their role as capital allocators and some of the challenges that emerging fund managers face, and we will address broader questions, like private market liquidity. Finally, on day three we will catch up with folks in the small public company space and get insight on initial public offerings, research coverage, and other pertinent topics.</p>
<p>The goal of the SEC&rsquo;s Small Business Forum is to bring together a multitude of voices from the public and private sectors, with different ideas and perspectives on capital raising. Over the course of this year&rsquo;s Forum, we will have the opportunity to listen to insightful remarks from our Commissioners and learn from our presenters, as they share their stories. But we also want to hear from all of you about your experiences, suggestions, and questions. The voices of the small business community provide insight into the journeys that entrepreneurs and investors undertake as they navigate the various capital-raising pathways. These stories can motivate us to think and consider ideas in a different way and appreciate narratives that are distinct from our own.</p>
<p>I suspect that many of you, in our audience, have your own stories to share about capital raising or questions you are pondering. I encourage you to amplify your voice by posting questions and comments in the chat.</p>
<p>In addition to fostering learning and growth through conversation, a goal of the Forum is to provide an opportunity for the public to shape recommendations to the Commission and to Congress regarding policies that affect capital formation for small businesses and their investors. We have already heard from some of you about proposed policy recommendations, but we want to hear from all of you. If you have not yet shared your ideas, there is still time to submit your thoughts through the submission portal or you can email us at smallbusiness@sec.gov. Then, at the end of each day&rsquo;s panel, we will invite you to vote to prioritize the policy recommendations to send to the Commission and Congress.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;ve only been the Director of the Small Business Advocacy Office for three months, I have already had the privilege of engaging with a wide variety of our stakeholders to hear their experiences and perspectives. What an incredible learning opportunity it is to be able to dialogue with so many who play a role in the small business ecosystem. I look forward to continuing my journey as the Director and connecting with many more of you in the months and years to come!</p>
<p>And in this journey, I will be joined by an outstanding team. It is hard to quantify the amount of passion, time, and effort it takes to host this event, and the dedicated team in our Office does so with quiet perseverance. I would like to thank Amy Reischauer and Kim Dinwoodie for leading the charge and the rest of the team for all of their support, including Jennifer Brady, T.J. Collins, Julie Zelman Davis, Pablo Echeverri, Courtney Haseley, Sarah Kenyon, Sheen Munshi, Vikki Porter, Jenny Riegel, Malika Sullivan, Todd Vanlaere, and Tyneise Wilson.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;d like to introduce and welcome Chair Gensler to the Small Business Forum to share his insights and perspectives.</p>

<div> ISDA, Bank of Israel, TELBOR, derivatives, fallbacks
Summary:<br />ISDA responds to Bank of Israel's TELBOR cessation, activating fallbacks for affected derivatives contracts, with guidance for different contract versions. <div>
<p>ISDA has published the following statement in response to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.boi.org.il/en/communication-and-publications/press-releases/16-4-20242en/">today&rsquo;s announcement</a>&nbsp;by the Bank of Israel (BOI) on the future cessation of all TELBOR tenors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s announcement constitutes an index cessation event under the 2021 ISDA Interest Rate Derivatives Definitions and the November 2022 Benchmarks Module to the ISDA 2021 Fallbacks Protocol. As a result, the fallback spread adjustment published by Bloomberg is fixed as of the date of the announcement for all TELBOR settings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The BOI specifically announced that publication of all TELBOR tenors will permanently cease immediately after final publication on June 30, 2025. From that point, fallbacks (to the adjusted risk-free rate plus spread) will automatically apply for outstanding TELBOR derivatives contracts that incorporate Version 7.0 onwards of the 2021 ISDA Interest Rate Derivatives Definitions or in respect of which both parties have adhered to the November 2022 Benchmarks Module to the ISDA 2021 Fallbacks Protocol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For outstanding TELBOR derivatives contracts that incorporate Versions 1.0 to 6.0 of the 2021 ISDA Interest Rate Derivatives Definitions and are not amended by the November 2022 Benchmarks Module to the ISDA 2021 Fallbacks Protocol, the Generic Fallback Provisions will apply and, under the Generic Fallback Provisions, the parties will seek to apply the first Alternative Continuation Fallback pursuant to which a Continuation Amendment can be made. Pursuant to the direction of the &lsquo;Telbor committee&rsquo; (established by the BOI in 2007), the recommendation for derivatives is to use compounded SHIR plus the adjustment spread published by Bloomberg, although parties may have agreed an alternative outcome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/protocol/november-2022-benchmark-module-of-the-isda-2021-fallbacks-protocol/">November 2022 Benchmarks Module to the ISDA 2021 Fallbacks Protocol</a>, which incorporates the fallbacks into legacy non-cleared derivatives trades with other counterparties that choose to adhere to the protocol, remains open for adherence on the ISDA website.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This statement is for information purposes only. It does not constitute legal advice and should not be considered an explanation of all relevant issues. You should consult your legal advisors and any other advisor you deem appropriate in considering the issues discussed herein.</p>

<br />
The EBA, EIOPA, and ECB have formed an alliance to govern the DPM 2.0 standard, aiming to facilitate data exchange and promote efficient reporting processes.
<br /><br />Summary: The EBA, EIOPA, and ECB have formed an alliance to govern the DPM 2.0 standard, aiming to facilitate data exchange and promote efficient reporting processes. <div>
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA), the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) and the European Central Bank (ECB) set up a Data Point Model (DPM) alliance, establishing a common governance framework for the collaboration on the DPM 2.0 Standard. Together with the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/ecb-and-eba-step-efforts-make-banking-industry-data-reporting"><span>establishment of a Joint Bank reporting Committee (JBRC)</span></a><span>&nbsp;between the EBA and ECB, this alliance is another step in the process of building an integrated reporting system.</span></p>
<p>Following the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-and-eiopa-publish-data-point-modelling-standard-20-foster">publication by the EBA and EIOPA of the DPM 2.0 standard in June 2023</a>, the two ESAs together with the ECB have agreed on the common arrangements that will govern their cooperation on DPM 2.0 (the DPM alliance).</p>
<p>Under the DPM alliance, the EBA, EIOPA and ECB will together govern the DPM 2.0 standard and cooperate in the DPM methodology for modelling reporting requirements, the metamodel used for populating the reporting requirements and the associated documentation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The DPM alliance seeks to facilitate the definition and exchange of regulatory data within the financial sector; increase efficiencies and avoid duplication of efforts; promote more efficient processes for defining and communicating reporting requirements, and for collecting and exchanging data and metadata amongst reporting entities, national authorities and European authorities; and facilitate good practices in the definition and exchange of regulatory reporting data and information.</p>
<p>The DPM alliance is established through a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-04/f40d42b9-3480-477d-841c-c05614dcfc54/Memorandum%20of%20Understanding%20on%20the%20DPM%20governance%20framework.pdf" title="Memorandum of Understanding on the DPM governance framework">Memorandum of Understanding that was signed by the EBA, ECB, and EIOPA</a>.</p>
<h4>Note to the editors</h4>
<p>The Data Point Model (DPM) is the data dictionary providing the structured representation of the data required for regulatory purposes by the EBA. It encompasses its regulatory processes and integrates the data of different EBA Technical Standards and Guidelines. The DPM may include also other data definitions relevant to the common understanding of the EBA regulatory data - business concepts and their relations, as well as their validation and calculation rules.</p>
<p>Since its inception, the EBA has been using the same DPM Standard 1.0 and together with the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) has worked on a DPM Refit project aimed at achieving a common&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document_library/Risk%20Analysis%20and%20Data/DPM%20data%20dictionary/DPM%202.0/1056372/Factsheet%20on%20DPM%20standard%202.0.pdf">DPM Standard 2.0</a>, which is better prepared to address the new challenges of regulation of financial sector.</p>
<p>At EBA the two models will coexist with the same integrated data during a transitional period in order to enable a smooth evolution to all stakeholders involved in regulatory processes.</p>

<title>FIA Calls On International Regulators To Continue Progress On Margin Transparency - Proposed Recommendations Will Help Reduce Liquidity Risk During Market Stress</title>

<div> derivatives markets, initial margin requirements, transparency, market stress, central clearing system
Summary:<br />
FIA urges international bodies to improve resilience of derivatives markets through transparency in initial margin requirements to reduce liquidity risk. <div>
<table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="body-text">FIA today&nbsp;<a href="https://email.fia.org/c/1284fjzdhwpdXI6uZcFXy2LkjIpozu">filed a letter</a>&nbsp;with international standard-setting bodies urging further progress on efforts to increase the resilience of global derivatives markets in times of stress.<br /><br />The letter was submitted in response to a consultation on initial margin requirements in centrally cleared derivatives markets that was issued in January by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), the Bank for International Settlements' Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO).<br /><br />The standard-setting bodies called for comment on 10 policy proposals that aim to improve participants' understanding of initial margin calculations and potential future margin requirements.<br /><br />The FIA response expressed strong support for the proposed requirements for increased transparency into the process used by central counterparties to set IM requirements, saying it will give clearing members and their clients more ability to prepare for margin calls and thereby reduce liquidity risk in financial markets. As observed during recent periods of market stress, IM requirements can rise very fast when prices are volatile, and the resulting calls for additional margin can put stress on the ability of clearing members and market participants to fund these calls.<br /><br />"We strongly support the proposed requirements on CCPs to provide additional disclosures and margin simulation tools," said Jacqueline Mesa, global head of policy, FIA. "We believe that, if implemented and monitored consistently across jurisdictions, these proposals will increase transparency and enhance understanding of CCP margin models, their main components and their responsiveness to changing market conditions. This will help clearing members, their clients and more broadly, market participants, to be better prepared for sudden spikes in margin requirements."<br /><br />Addressing the challenges created by the volatility of IM requirements has been a top priority for FIA and its members for several years. As explained in&nbsp;<a href="https://email.fia.org/c/1284fk2RRAhVm4Q7qHtDDcKlKwIcmn">a&nbsp;white paper</a>&nbsp;issued by FIA in 2020, sudden increases in margin requirements can create a type of feedback loop called procyclicality. Margin calls drive demand for liquid assets at a time when those assets are scarce due to market stresses. This demand for liquid assets can spill over into other financial markets such as repo markets and can contribute to systemic risk.<br /><br />This issue of margin procyclicality was demonstrated during abrupt market moves resulting from the Covid 19 pandemic in 2020, Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and the "mini-budget" crisis in September 2022 &ndash; all of which led to sharp rises in IM requirements in centrally cleared derivatives markets.<br /><br />FIA strongly believes that CCPs must retain the ability to adjust IM requirements in response to changing market conditions. Indeed, this is one of the strengths of the central clearing system. However, FIA also strongly believes that more transparency into margin models would help market participants better anticipate changes in IM requirements and prepare for margin calls, thereby reducing liquidity risk for both individual firms and the financial system as a whole.&nbsp;<br /><br />Background:<br /><br />FIA is the leading global trade organization for the futures, options, and centrally cleared derivatives markets. FIA&rsquo;s mission is to support open, transparent, and competitive markets; protect and enhance the integrity of the financial system; and promote high standards of professional conduct. FIA&rsquo;s membership includes clearing firms, exchanges, clearinghouses, trading firms and commodities specialists from more than 48 countries, as well as technology vendors, lawyers and other professionals serving the industry.<br /><br />FIA has published several papers over the past few years exploring and recommending best practices for CCP risk management. They include:

<title>EACH Responds To The BCBS-CPMI-IOSCO Proposals On Transparency And Responsiveness Of Initial Margin In Centrally Cleared Markets</title>

<div> Transparency, PQDs, Margin simulators, Margin responsiveness, Discretionary judgement<br />
Summary:<br />
- EACH believes CCP transparency is sufficient
- Public Quantitative Disclosure is backward-looking
- Margin simulators balance cost and reliability
- Volatility measurement has limitations
- CCPs should retain discretionary judgement <div>
<p>EACH has today responded to the &lsquo;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d568.htm" target="_blank">BCBS-CPMI-IOSCO consultative report</a>&nbsp;on transparency and responsiveness of initial margin in centrally cleared markets&rsquo;. We commend authorities for analysing the important and challenging issue of responsiveness of cleared initial margin, and appreciate the opportunity to contribute. We also welcome that the authorities are considering the need for adequate transparency across the full clearing value chain, from CCPs to Clearing Members (CMs) and from CMs to clients. We believe that it is crucial to ensure that any additional measures prescribed are also taken into account by CMs and Clients in their liquidity preparedness exercises.</p>
<p>The detailed answers can be read in our response&nbsp;<a href="https://eachccp.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EACH-Response-%E2%80%93-BCBS-CPMI-IOSCO-consultative-report-on-transparency-and-responsiveness-of-initial-margin-in-centrally-cleared-markets-April-2024.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>, and a summary of our main ideas is included below:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Transparency</b>&nbsp;&ndash; EACH believes that the level of transparency measures required from the CCPs at present are considered sufficient, as CCPs provide a wide range of measures from Margin simulators and PQDs to website disclosures and private disclosures to CMs and clients.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Public Quantitative Disclosure</b>&nbsp;(<b>PQDs</b>) &ndash; We emphasise that the information contained within PQDs is not portfolio specific and is backward-looking, making it unclear how this increase could be used for liquidity preparedness which is by nature forward-looking.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Margin simulators</b>&nbsp;&ndash; We are of the opinion that the main challenge consists in finding a balance between the cost of implementation and operating the simulation tool and the reliability of the results. EACH&nbsp;recommends against forward looking scenarios, which we do not believe provide meaningful added value to users, could put an undue liability on CCPs and will have significant implementation and maintenance costs. Additionally, CCPs note that margin simulators show very little use by CMs and clients.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Measuring margin responsiveness</b>&nbsp;&ndash; EACH highlights that using volatility as a way of measuring responsiveness has different limitations, such as it being not observable and it changes not fully capturing the drivers of margin procyclicality that are within CCPs' control. We suggest considering an&nbsp;<b>alternative proposal</b>, that focuses on analysing how initial margin would change under different market stress scenarios, namely historical periods of volatility. We recommend that the design of the&nbsp;approach is&nbsp;left to the CCPs, subject to CCPs internal policies and procedures standards.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Measures on</b>&nbsp;<b>discretionary judgement by CCPs</b>&nbsp;&ndash; We highlight that there may be events that will go beyond the circumstances covered by the CCP rulebook. For this, CCPs believe it is important for them to retain a degree of discretionary judgement.</li>
</ul>

5. Current outlook on inflation and economic growth

Summary: <div>
<p>Thank you, Matteo. It is my pleasure to welcome you to the 13th International Research Forum on Monetary Policy. The vibrant discussions you will engage in at this conference, and your research more broadly, will help us to understand better the origins and implications of uncertainty. I became a member of the Federal Reserve Board just as it was grappling with the economic after-effects of the pandemic, a once-in-a-century disturbance of worldwide significance. As a result, I know from firsthand experience that understanding the main sources of uncertainty and how best to make monetary policy decisions in the presence of uncertainty are crucial to policymaking.</p>
<p>I will take this opportunity to do a couple of things. First, I will review a few historical examples of how economic thinking on monetary policymaking in the presence of uncertainty has evolved. Second, I will consider lessons learned from these examples that could influence how monetary policymakers think about the policy choices the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) faces currently.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20240416a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 1960s to the 1980s</strong><br />In the 1960s, during the heyday of Keynesian macroeconomics, researchers widely believed that monetary policymakers faced a long-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, and that the tradeoff could be calibrated to keep unemployment indefinitely low at an acceptable cost in terms of higher inflation. Improvements in econometric modeling abounded, and the harnessing of&nbsp;<em>optimal-control</em>&nbsp;methods developed in the field of engineering held out the prospect that business cycle fluctuations could be stabilized.</p>
<p>There were contrarians, of course, most notably Milton Friedman, who highlighted the necessity of monetary policymakers to consider what they&nbsp;<em>don't</em>&nbsp;know in their decisionmaking process (Friedman, 1968). Friedman's statement that monetary policy works with "long and variable lags" was, among other things, an argument against policymakers trying to fine-tune the level of economic activity. In recognition of policymakers' limited knowledge of short-run economic relationships, Friedman advocated the use of simple rules for monetary policy, such as the&nbsp;<em>k</em>-percent money growth rule. He argued that rules that focused on monetary growth and that eschewed direct feedback on macroeconomic variables would work reasonably well, on average, and avoid the hubris of fine-tuning policy in a dynamic and uncertain world.</p>
<p>History proved Friedman right in his take on the importance of uncertainty, even if his prescription of a&nbsp;<em>k</em>-percent money growth rule fared less well.</p>
<p>During roughly the same period when Friedman authored his famous presidential address to the American Economic Association disputing the purported long-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, William Brainard published an influential paper on the implications of uncertainty. Brainard (1967) argued that uncertainty about the power of monetary policy implied that policy should respond more cautiously to shocks than would be the case if this uncertainty did not exist. Brainard's&nbsp;<em>attenuation principle</em>&nbsp;is a classic example of what is today known as the Bayesian approach to uncertainty.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20240416a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;The Brainard approach to uncertainty consisted of two steps. The first step is to compute the optimal policy for a world without uncertainty; that is, the&nbsp;<em>certainty equivalence</em>&nbsp;case. The second step is to adjust that policy response to account for the particular uncertainty under study. One strand of research followed these steps through the 1970s and beyond.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20240416a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;A parallel strand of research that embraced at least part of the message of Friedman was also under way. It bypassed the optimal policy benchmark altogether, on the grounds that uncertainty is pervasive, and sought instead to find simple rules that performed well across a large class of models and for a large range of conditions.</p>
<p>Brainard's insight was important. There are many circumstances in which the principle of gradualism applies, but as I will discuss later, economic research has also found that there are circumstances in which the presence of uncertainty does not warrant a gradual policy response.</p>
<p><strong>The 1990s and 2000s</strong><br />Jumping ahead to the 1990s, a "new economy" was emerging. The unemployment rate was below what many analysts at the time judged to be its natural rate, and many FOMC participants and others were forecasting growth above the economy's potential. Chairman Alan Greenspan, however, suspected that technological advances and other forces were fostering a "new economy" of sustained high productivity growth that would allow a period of persistently low unemployment without generating inflationary pressure. In the absence of hard evidence to the contrary, he was able to persuade the FOMC to go along with him by implicitly employing the Bayesian logic of Brainard's attenuation principle with a disarmingly simple suggestion: Let's just wait one more meeting and see. Chairman Greenspan repeated this message as inflation fell from above 2 percent in 1996 to below 2 percent in 1997 and 1998 while the economy added 9.3 million jobs, and the FOMC raised the federal funds rate just once.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20240416a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a></p>
<p>Around the same time, there was an explosion of interest in&nbsp;<em>simple policy rules</em>&nbsp;for monetary policy, beginning, in most people's reckoning, with the rule John Taylor (1993) published in the early 1990s. These simple feedback rules, which specify how central banks' policy instrument would respond to the state of the economy, differed from their predecessors by replacing monetary aggregates as the instrument of monetary policy with a short-term policy interest rate. This research embraced the message that restricting feedback to a small number of key macroeconomic variables would result in more robust outcomes than adhering to the prescriptions of, say, optimal-control policies, which in essence imposed feedback on all aspects of these models.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20240416a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;Whether much of the robustness gains of simple rules can be realized when central banks only use such rules as "guides" for monetary policy is a topic worthy of further research.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20240416a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a></p>
<p>The claimed robustness of simple rules across a set of fixed models is arguably only part of their appeal. Another part is the notion that their parsimony presumably makes simple rules relatively easy for households, businesses, and financial market participants to learn. One useful finding was that gradualism in policy setting, in the form of a sizable weight on the lagged policy rate in the policy rule, is helpful for facilitating learnability.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20240416a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;In any event, the literature on learning in macroeconomics extended the dimension of uncertainty for monetary policymakers from the cross section of candidate models to the time dimension of any given model.</p>
<p>The bulk of the early literature assumed private-sector decisionmakers were knowledgeable, rational agents, while policymakers lacked detailed knowledge of the structure of the economy. The assumed imbalance of information and knowledge was striking. It was usually assumed, sometimes only implicitly, that private agents understood not only the economic environment in which they operated, but also the policy regime that was in place. Considering this background, some more recent contributions explored two related departures from the assumption of a fixed model with uncertain parameters: time-variation in the true (population) model, and private agents learning about the economy.</p>
<p>As I just observed, the rational expectations paradigm presupposes that economic agents have a great deal of knowledge about their environment, but policymakers do not know the true (population) parameters of the models they use. Instead, they must use estimates of those parameters. As Sargent (1993) noted, it makes sense to assume that the decisionmakers within the models that policymakers employ are no more sophisticated than the econometricians who estimate them. Doing so means accepting that the true (population) parameters of one's model could be time varying&mdash;the outcome of the interplay between shocks, uncertainty, learning, and policy. That realization changes the way you think about monetary policy.</p>
<p>How might this matter? Let me give you one example. As many of you know, econometricians have found sizable declines in recent decades in the response of inflation to the unemployment rate.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20240416a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;Taken at face value, these declines in the slope of the Phillips curve have important implications for the optimal conduct of monetary policy. But what should policymakers take from such econometric results? Some researchers argue that the apparent decline in the response to slack in the Phillips curve could be a manifestation of the improved control of inflation by the central bank.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20240416a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;That is, policymakers could be "victims of their own success" in the sense that good performance in controlling inflation over the Great Moderation period may have weakened the information content of the data.</p>
<p>Now, take this notion a step further, as a strand of the literature does, and suppose that private agents within our models are themselves skeptical&mdash;that is, that they have doubts about their methods for formulating expectations and making decisions, and that they act accordingly. Economists now have new means of modeling uncertainty both&nbsp;<em>within</em>&nbsp;a given model and&nbsp;<em>across</em>&nbsp;a set of rival models. These methods draw on theories of&nbsp;<em>ambiguity aversion</em>.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20240416a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;Under ambiguity aversion, agents are particularly concerned about types of uncertainties that do not lend themselves to being represented in terms of probabilities. Agents' choices are motivated, in part, by an incentive to minimize the adverse consequences of these types of uncertainties. The ambiguity aversion approach to uncertainty suggests that to protect against uncertainty over which a policymaker is unwilling or unable to attach prior probabilities, the appropriate response is often anti-attenuation; that is, policy should apply&nbsp;<em>stronger</em>&nbsp;monetary medicine than in the certainty equivalence case.</p>
<p>For the reasons I have outlined, there are circumstances when uncertainty might appropriately induce a gradual response and other circumstances when a nongradual response to uncertainty may be justified. Furthermore, under either the Bayesian approach or the ambiguity aversion approach, the best response to uncertainty is context specific and can vary over time.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20240416a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;Sometimes the context leads to the same conclusion, broadly speaking, regardless of the approach. One case of perennial interest to central bankers is inflation persistence where the Bayesian approach, the ambiguity aversion approach, and its close cousin, robust control, all tend to lead to policy that is stronger than the certainty equivalent case to forestall the possibility of inflationary forces becoming embedded in inflation expectations.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20240416a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a>&nbsp;Another case is that of crisis periods.</p>
<p><strong>The Global Financial Crisis</strong><br />Take, for example, the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. During this period, the tension between caution, on the one hand, and vigorous action, on the other, as a way to conduct monetary policy in the face of uncertainty was evident. In September 2007, the FOMC decided to lower its target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to "forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets" and noted that "developments in financial markets since the Committee's last regular meeting have increased the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20240416a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a>&nbsp;In subsequent meetings, the FOMC gradually lowered its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points and, in January 2008, decided to quicken its pace by lowering the target by 75 basis points in an unscheduled meeting and by 50 basis points, 75 basis points, and 25 basis points in subsequent meetings. Inflation, however, was rising over that period. By June 2008, it was well over 2 percent and still increasing, and the FOMC paused its rate cutting. It was a decision that weighed the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations with the downside risks to economic growth.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20240416a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;In September 2008, the circumstances changed precipitously, as did the FOMC's approach to policy. The Committee quickly cut the federal funds rate effectively to zero and took extraordinary steps to stabilize the financial system and support the economy. The motivation to respond assertively to the emerging crisis, and the uncertainty surrounding it, was no doubt accentuated by the knowledge that future policy actions might be circumscribed by a lengthy spell of the funds rate at its lower bound, which would magnify losses associated with adverse outcomes.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20240416a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a>&nbsp;My conclusion, as Chair Powell mentioned in a speech in 2018, is that during crisis periods, words like "we will do whatever it takes" will likely be more effective than "we will take cautious steps."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20240416a.htm#fn16" title="footnote 16"><span>16</span></a><a name="f16"></a></p>
<p><strong>Lessons Learned</strong><br />Some clear lessons flow from the history that I have summarized. First, when uncertainty is high, policymakers should sometimes act quickly and should sometimes act cautiously. The right action depends on the circumstances. Second, while simple monetary policy rules are appealing for several reasons, rigid adherence to the prescriptions of simple rules is unwarranted. Historically, policymakers have only used rules as "guides" or benchmarks in setting policy, and there are good reasons for this. It is clearly beneficial to look at the totality of the data to identify changes in the economy in real time, to embrace the risk-management considerations associated with uncertainty that factor into FOMC decisions, and to adapt policy to the evolution of the economy. Third, in the presence of a high degree of uncertainly, policymakers benefit from a healthy dose of humility. There are limits to what we know about the economy, especially after periods of economic upheaval such as a pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>Current Situation</strong><br />Reflecting on the situation we are facing today, over the past year, inflation has come down significantly but is still running above the FOMC's 2 percent goal. In March, headline personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation was 2.7 percent over the past 12 months based on the Federal Reserve's staff estimates. A year earlier, it was 4.4 percent. Core PCE inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy components, stood at 2.8 percent; a year ago, it was 4.8 percent. While we have seen considerable progress in lowering inflation, the job of sustainably restoring 2 percent inflation is not yet done.</p>
<p>Real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 3.4 percent, and I expect first-quarter economic growth to slow down but remain solid as indicated by the solid growth in retail sales in March and February. Recent readings on both job gains and inflation have come in higher than expected. The economy added an average of 276,000 nonfarm jobs per month in the three months through March, a faster pace than we have seen since last March. And the inflation data over the past three months were above the low readings in the second half of last year.</p>
<p>My baseline outlook continues to be that inflation will decline further, with the policy rate held steady at its current level, and that the labor market will remain strong, with labor demand and supply continuing to rebalance. Of course, the outlook is still quite uncertain, and if incoming data suggest that inflation is more persistent than I currently expect it to be, it will be appropriate to hold in place the current restrictive stance of policy for longer. I am fully committed to getting inflation back to 2 percent.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />I would like to conclude by saying that in this environment of heightened uncertainty, it is increasingly important to comprehend what is driving uncertainty and how monetary policy might play a role in limiting the negative impact of uncertainty on businesses, households, and financial markets. Many of you in this audience have devoted a considerable amount of time to understanding the intricate link between uncertainty and economic outcomes. Your work has enriched our collective knowledge and has been instrumental in helping us policymakers understand the complexities of our decisions. Please keep it up!</p>

<p><a name="fn1"></a>1. The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn2"></a>2. For example, in 1998, Alan Blinder wrote that the Brainard result was "never far from my mind when I occupied the Vice Chairman's office at the Federal Reserve. In my view . . . a little stodginess at the central bank is entirely appropriate" (Blinder, 1998, p. 12).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn3"></a>3. An incomplete list of the early contributions includes Prescott (1972), Chow (1976), Craine and Havenner (1977), and Kendrick (1982).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn4"></a>4. The estimate of 9.3 million jobs uses total nonfarm seasonally adjusted numbers from the&nbsp;<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/">St. Louis Fed FRED database</a>&nbsp;(PAYEMS series) and takes the difference between the December 1998 and January 1996 numbers.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn5"></a>5. Optimal-control policies are optimal conditional on the structure of the model to which they are applied. Provided the model is a reliable approximation of the true economy, and policymakers' preferences are correctly specified, the policy prescriptions derived from optimal-control exercises are, by definition, the best that can be achieved. However, the underlying assumptions are stringent in many applications. There is also a literature on risk-adjusted optimal control dating back at least to Whittle (1981). See Taylor and Williams (2010) and references therein for a detailed argument on the efficacy of simple rules as hedges against model misspecification. Svensson (2003) is a critique of the use of all simple monetary policy rules&mdash;sometimes referred to as&nbsp;<em>instrument rules</em>&mdash;as opposed to what are called&nbsp;<em>targeting rules</em>. In a 2012 speech, then Vice Chair Janet Yellen observed, "In evaluating the stance of policy, I find the prescriptions from simple policy rules a logical starting point" (Yellen, 2012). She went on to argue that simple rules "by no means deserve the 'last word'" on guidance for monetary policy, in part because they do not fully account for factors that might be idiosyncratic, such as risk-management concerns. That speech introduced the Fed's optimal-control simulations to the public as an alternative source of guidance for monetary policy that could be used alongside that of simple monetary policy rules, together with judgment. Since 2017, the&nbsp;<em>Monetary Policy Report</em>&nbsp;has discussed simple monetary policy rules and their limitations.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn6"></a>6. Nikolosko-Rzhevskyy, Papell, and Prodan (2014), among others, explore this question.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn7"></a>7. By "learnable" I mean in the sense that least-squares learning would converge, in the limit, on rational expectations equilibrium. See Evans and Honkapohja (2001) for a textbook treatment of learning in macroeconomics. Bullard and Mitra (2002) established the benefits of inertia in monetary policy for making a wider set of models "E-stable," meaning the process of least-squares learning leads to a unique and stable equilibrium. Tetlow and von zur Muehlen (2009) broadened that conclusion to a wider set of learning rules.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn8"></a>8. See, for example, Stock and Watson (2021) for time-series evidence and Smith, Timmermann, and Wright (2023) for panel data results.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn9"></a>9. See, for example, Bullard (2018) for a demonstration and McLeay and Tenreyo (2019) for a detailed argument along these lines.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn10"></a>10. The literature on robust control in economics (for example, Hansen and Sargent, 2008) began with the normative case of how policymakers might address their doubts. The literature on ambiguity aversion (for example, Epstein and Schneider, 2003) had agents within models confront their doubts in making decisions. Works at the intersection of these two strands of the literature expand the concept of uncertainty (in the sense of Knight, 1921) in a micro-founded manner and relax the rational expectations hypothesis in a disciplined way. See, for example, Hansen and Sargent (2021).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn11"></a>11. See Barlevy (2011) for an accessible survey and Tetlow and von zur Muehlen (2001) for a more technical treatment.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn12"></a>12. S&ouml;derst&ouml;m (2002) establishes the result for the Bayesian case. Tetlow (2019) is a simple demonstration of that case alongside an ambiguity aversion case. With uncertain inflation persistence, the Bayesian and ambiguity aversion approaches lead to a policy that is stronger than the certainty equivalent case because a symmetric distribution for inflation persistence results in asymmetric (downward-skewed) distributions for economic outcomes when evaluated for the certainty equivalent policy. Adam and Woodford (2012) show that uncertainty regarding the data generating process for inflation in the New Keynesian model retains as the optimal policy the same general form as in the standard model but with a more aggressive response to inflation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn13"></a>13. See paragraphs 2 and 4 of the September 2007 FOMC statement, which is available on the Federal Reserve Board's website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm">https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn14"></a>14. See paragraph 4 of the June 2008 FOMC statement, which, in explaining the FOMC's decision to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 2 percent at that meeting, noted, "Although downside risks to growth remain, they appear to have diminished somewhat, and the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have increased." See also the minutes of the June 24&ndash;25, 2008, FOMC Meeting, in particular the summary of the Committee's discussion on downside risks to growth and upside risks to inflation on pages 7 and 8. Both documents are available on the Federal Reserve Board's website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm">https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn15"></a>15. The literature on the implications of the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates for the conduct on monetary policy is large and includes Reifschneider and Williams (2000).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn16"></a>16. See Powell (2018).&nbsp;</p>

Summary:<br />Zevero and LEVELUP merge under Zevero brand, expanding globally. AI-driven carbon accounting platform empowers businesses to measure, manage, and reduce carbon footprint. Co-founders continue involvement. <div>
<ul type="disc">
<li><i>The combined company will operate under&nbsp;Zevero brand</i></li>
<li><i>26 and 27-year-old founders secure multi-million-pound deal following rapid UK growth</i></li>
<li><i>Zevero will expand its specialisms in high-emission food and beverage industry to new industries and geographies with a new global management team</i></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://email.prnewswire.com/ls/click?upn=u001.v-2BJ3gj6ki5QD5j-2Fn6dQLimWo7kaTSMSZbqF5Bz4ASpkKNVfTE8pMHvuovGuFAkpymuRc_pIbxPfpDI69aAybPrpOfg1n6CWmKMnb3conIyNKCYgr-2BTRqxLAwMRExIXLpGb5DJ5FmlKeQqLtj6jhpWeVEVA5C1esHn8FI6bWEZi2YELuikSNAv4qIgRS-2FIToLb9Mzhxwk0pbAWq4Y4Qri-2BAJrwYFIzcIvIzZgy1sTIAgH2J3RzqsliMz0qcQC-2Bdm-2BU6Wd-2BtPFexfa3qW3KJSkI74Cibs9vrPR8sNcM84PvmIDUBX0r2spPPaZZMTA2ZLoUQ1LD-2BBF1TLylVTgRuYuJDY3I0bHmcvzsXO-2B5kJz7WNHsBtu-2Ft20dK9EC-2BXaMrD-2FfvfW0MK9dvjJ2xManp3VCLUCza3oOspVdFyaWWSdDOj6q6CSxGE-2BPi0meeql5tdFwhtia" target="_blank">Zevero</a></span>, a decarbonisation platform that empowers companies to reach a net zero future, announced it has been acquired by Singapore-based climate tech startup,&nbsp;LEVELUP. The multi-million-pound deal will see the two companies merge under the Zevero brand and expand operations across Asia, Europe and the U.S., fuelling Zevero's access to the global $15 billion<sup>*</sup> carbon accounting market.</p>
<p>Zevero's innovative software platform uses AI-driven carbon modelling, automated emissions calculations and real-time analytics to help companies within the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry to accurately measure, manage and reduce their carbon footprint across their entire supply chain. In bringing together these capabilities with LEVELUP's extensive agriculture industry expertise, the new combined offering will be a powerful tool in the global fight against climate change.</p>
<p>"In just three years, Zevero has proven its ability to provide full-stack carbon accounting to clients in over 13 countries,"&nbsp;<b>said Shigeo Taniuchi, incoming CEO of Zevero - previously of LEVELUP.&nbsp;</b>"Combining Zevero's strong product foundations and UK market experience with our team's expertise across Asia will rapidly accelerate our shared mission to become the definitive carbon management solution for businesses worldwide."</p>
<p>Zevero was founded in 2020 by friends Ben Richardson and George Wade, then both just 23. The pair grew frustrated at how challenging it was for businesses to understand their carbon impact end-to-end. With increasing environmental-focused regulation at the time impacting more and more industries, Ben and George recognised a critical need to digitise the carbon accounting process and make it possible for businesses to see the full picture of their carbon impact throughout each stage of their supply chain. As, only through having this visibility, can businesses make any impactful changes to their operations.</p>
<h4><b>A strong footing in the UK</b></h4>
<p>Zevero initially made its name in the UK carbon accounting market, quickly acquiring customers in the food and beverage industry - such as Brixton Brewery and MOTH, amongst others. Rising consumer demand for environmentally-friendly products and services, increasing regulatory enforcement and consequent supply chain pressures are driving the need for accurate emissions data and credible decarbonisation strategies - both areas in which many companies currently lack the right resources, knowledge and tools.</p>
<p>"Climate change is the biggest threat facing society. For most companies, there are multiple challenges in their way."<b>&nbsp;said Ben Richardson, Co-Founder of Zevero.</b>&nbsp;"Despite pressure to act, they lack the capabilities to see the full impact of their products on the environment. Without that transparency, it's impossible to set realistic emission reduction targets and drive meaningful change."</p>
<p>"Traditionally, calculating corporate emissions has relied on spreadsheets and static PDFs. Zevero makes it easier and more accurate for companies to measure, reduce and report on their carbon emissions in real-time, not just once a year,"&nbsp;<b>said George Wade, Zevero's other Co-Founder.&nbsp;</b>"Much has been said about brands greenwashing, but what we're hearing from these businesses is that they actively want to make drastic changes to clean up their supply chains - but up until now they haven't had the data to make those decisions confidently. Zevero has created a solution for that."</p>
<p>Through the acquisition, Ben and George will remain actively involved as Co-Founders - together with other Co-Founders, seasoned executive, Shigeo Taniuchi and serial entrepreneur, Yuya Kuratomi - and will be responsible for driving Zevero's product roadmap and growth initiatives. Zevero's diverse leadership team will integrate LEVELUP's extensive presence and network in Asia to accelerate the expansion and impact of Zevero.</p>

I continue to be inspired by our teams, whose energy, expertise, and commitment is nothing short of amazing."&nbsp;</p>
<h4>2023 HIGHLIGHTS:&nbsp;<b>BUILDING A POSITIVE HUMAN FUTURE&nbsp;</b></h4>
<h5><b>Breakthrough technologies made real&nbsp;</b></h5>
<p>Over the past year, organisations turned to PA when looking to deliver technology-enabled real-world innovation &ndash; whether the answer to their challenge required a change in strategy, a new product or service, or a wider enterprise transformation.</p>
<p>PA's pioneering approach can be seen in its work for&nbsp;<a href="http://email.prnewswire.com/ls/click?upn=u001.v-2BJ3gj6ki5QD5j-2Fn6dQLioQ6EYAs9Md2mZHIRRJulyhgbima7cpLsIjwr5-2B-2Bpa8oVRlV30mC9r9goHd07dmlZsAA2DuFcThsrn8VxXOQDPCTyNP2fN-2FbVEsWBqYTBYwflgIx-2B1KxQ-2FHURSQ4fXRecGaUSXXSOpJnURtF4B9yEX8-3DuGh2_pIbxPfpDI69aAybPrpOfg1n6CWmKMnb3conIyNKCYgr-2BTRqxLAwMRExIXLpGb5DJPEaj7QMmqnrbmrwO6AwVP1EBCbJwQUD4trajjKODRYvfcgOlfAuep0wWN6Vz4oZMAF2z5NcyJqAkDbW4RNGUCOP3w3bkzJZ1y6-2FodfGNEYU1HWc5APniacyWP5EqP5mL62u3IeYchRqAE5cc9CTQ-2BGSlusff2I5BhreHfism3G1Y2p5LFyuFZbq0sci-2F9IXL-2Floe9EL4FeKhRAwbuGByWUFwa7kavU9q2nmzN0GXsRlTW6x7FjXJjV-2FDXwcKGqPKk68RVKJvRlKRb59M5ciMLZCNDSdIkyOxtXhi4WP3EqwUooMVe5cSE7PxvR36ZArW" target="_blank">Hubly Surgical</a>, which is on a mission to transform bedside neurosurgery. In 2023, a PA designed life-saving bore drill to replace archaic and high-risk methods in intracranial surgery, received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance in the US. This new-to-world neurotechnology can now be brought to market to save lives.</p>
<h5>Innovation accelerates results&nbsp;</h5>
<p>For innovation to achieve real impact, PA believes it needs to be viewed through a full lifecycle, end-to-end lens. Understanding the impact of potential changes across a complex system is imperative to secure a rapid return on&nbsp;innovation investment.</p>
<p>This approach was evidenced through PA's work, in strategic partnership with Jacobs, for the UK's&nbsp;<a href="http://email.prnewswire.com/ls/click?upn=u001.v-2BJ3gj6ki5QD5j-2Fn6dQLioQ6EYAs9Md2mZHIRRJulyj4UbDArMPrpldD8j3Drk7zp3a4y6oISQ-2FOZj0NFB5ADo14JCO4-2B9VglP-2FF-2F-2FgqCaLdw-2FTg3mLVbav4HWt91JCoSRyXfvGmx4WtNMlQ-2By7SqsAI48d7WRVRcTG2LOTW7p-2F9PJe7szq719tzEZANRCfsIDjzdNwc6CFHLrgrm-2Biz3QOz2evbqNvDHMvcRyVvG1I-3DYc3V_pIbxPfpDI69aAybPrpOfg1n6CWmKMnb3conIyNKCYgr-2BTRqxLAwMRExIXLpGb5DJPEaj7QMmqnrbmrwO6AwVP1EBCbJwQUD4trajjKODRYvfcgOlfAuep0wWN6Vz4oZMAF2z5NcyJqAkDbW4RNGUCOP3w3bkzJZ1y6-2FodfGNEYU1HWc5APniacyWP5EqP5mL62u3IeYchRqAE5cc9CTQ-2BGSlusff2I5BhreHfism3G1uz9gNfLWPqjpyk5NgSjMHdNcKKT-2B1-2FIoOumVnsrV-2BD-2FSk1oa26soHXrJFREZEvgKLzBTx8jLJCqu8aEfEX7WGWbMYUrx-2BNLpPCw-2BOgePenmEcGS7VVaojC7dH5SEXqZ-2BhEcU7BOxjdrJnweDOrUbm" target="_blank">Nuclear Decommissioning Authority</a>&nbsp;(NDA). The PA and Jacobs team led a digital enterprise asset transformation journey within a highly regulated landscape. The team combined nuclear sector expertise alongside digital, data, organisational design, and people and change skills to rapidly transform NDA's asset support capability, resulting in major savings for safety critical, regulated assets.</p>
<h5>Diverse experts unlock opportunity&nbsp;</h5>
<p>Diversity of expertise &ndash; from perspective to experience &ndash; leads to better ideas. To deliver innovative and effective solutions to previously unsolvable problems, organisations need the right blend of diverse experts in combination with emerging technologies.</p>
<p>In 2023, PA's strategists, innovators, designers, consultants, digital experts, scientists, engineers, and technologists helped a wide range of clients, including the team at&nbsp;<a href="http://email.prnewswire.com/ls/click?upn=u001.v-2BJ3gj6ki5QD5j-2Fn6dQLioQ6EYAs9Md2mZHIRRJulyhgbima7cpLsIjwr5-2B-2Bpa8oG4oraomjawZuSLHTNOROg2q-2B52-2FJF69Jyts2kdNENItKpKBNC4rcw-2BmzU-2Fx7fJtUjVwP-2FJYdkUMbPyzCtoQKSYfERfCkUPirjd6O5dVccb194t21APmk8EMTquT-2BUAWKalWw_pIbxPfpDI69aAybPrpOfg1n6CWmKMnb3conIyNKCYgr-2BTRqxLAwMRExIXLpGb5DJPEaj7QMmqnrbmrwO6AwVP1EBCbJwQUD4trajjKODRYvfcgOlfAuep0wWN6Vz4oZMAF2z5NcyJqAkDbW4RNGUCOP3w3bkzJZ1y6-2FodfGNEYU1HWc5APniacyWP5EqP5mL62u3IeYchRqAE5cc9CTQ-2BGSlusff2I5BhreHfism3G3BEXYG8u8Ej82gxrMBfF-2BRhogNzEPhlyyOdeKpu7KnEDepBeFGICBA9PdBLvJD0l18TNZNXaX7sJCML6hUH10d9ZYkyRzA00ItxYf41vh7hmW6mAZnYMMFFLzxJr429MWAqJ4Yz7Il7yiIh4Ekc1j1" target="_blank">Amsterdam Airport Schiphol</a>. As one of the world's busiest airports, moving over 72 million passengers a year, Schiphol needed a way to assess the&nbsp;carbon footprint of its technology and data. PA worked with their teams to discover how technology and data can help turn their ambition to be the world's most sustainable airport into reality.</p>
<h5><b>Progress through collaboration&nbsp;</b></h5>
<p>PA's team thrives on solving the most complex challenges, creating strategies, and leading transformations across organisations and industries. This involves bringing together different perspectives and stakeholders &ndash; regulators, the public sector, the private sector, start-ups, supply chains, the science community, and more &ndash; to unlock new value.</p>

<p>PA's people are its driving force, and the company offers exceptional career opportunities.

<p><span><span>The&nbsp;vLEI is a new form of digitized organizational identity that meets the global need for automated authentication and verification of legal entities across a variety of industries. By wrapping new and existing LEIs in digital credentials that can be verified, the vLEI offers a digitally trustworthy version of the LEI which can be used to verify the identities of legal entities and their authorized representatives across a rapidly growing number of automated interactions. The vLEI can be used as a signing tool for corporate, digital identity and persons with delegated signing authority rights. Using the vLEI, government organizations, companies, and all legal entities will be able to confirm ownership structures and authorized representations in a growing number of digital business activities. Examples of known use cases include approving business transactions and contracts, onboarding customers, transacting within import/export and supply chain business networks, and submitting regulatory filings and reports.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The vLEI ecosystem utilizes the existing Global LEI System as the only open, standardized, and regulatory-endorsed system for legal entity identification. It is based on the Trust over IP Governance metamodel and leverages open standards including the ACDC (Authentic Chained Data Container) specification, the KERI (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure) protocol for key management, and&nbsp;the CESR (Composable Event Streaming Representation) capabilities for secure digital signing.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>By using secure credentials and open standards, the vLEI creates a verifiable link between an organization and its representatives. These digital credentials are not only tamper-resistant but also verifiable in a decentralized manner, providing an ideal foundation on which to establish a secure chain of trust with GLEIF at the root.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>There are two types of vLEI organizational credentials in the vLEI ecosystem that can be issued to authorized representatives of an organization; the Official Organization Role (OOR), which leverages the ISO 5009 standard and can be verified by the organization and against public sources; and the Engagement Context Role (ECR), which are credentials defined and verified by the vLEI holder itself.&nbsp;<span lang="EN-US">By combining these three concepts &ndash; the organization&rsquo;s identity, represented by the LEI, a person&rsquo;s identity, and the role that the person plays for the organization, vLEI credentials can be issued.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Anders &Aring;str&ouml;m, CEO and Co-founder of NordLEI, comments: "Nord vLEI is proud to lead the way as the first QVI based in Europe. The strength of the global economy lies in its transparency and trust. The vLEI enables functional, reliable, and ethical interactions on a scale never seen before and significantly reduces the potential for fraud and inefficiencies. As a QVI we will deliver the same quality as we have come to be known for with NordLEI."</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Rickard Israelsson, Co-founder of NordLEI, comments: "Achieving the status as a Qualified vLEI Issuer affirms our vision of being at the forefront of the digital transformation in identification and authentication, something we have been striving for since the inception of NordLEI in 2014. The vLEI makes trustworthy and reliable digital transactions and interactions possible and efficient. It is an honor to be the first QVI in Europe."</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Stephan Wolf, CEO of GLEIF, comments: "The vLEI has truly universal applicability due to its unparalleled capacity to bridge the trust deficits that inhibit digital transactions and interactions. Welcoming Nord vLEI as a QVI marks an important step forward for the vLEI ecosystem, reaffirming our ongoing commitment to developing the supporting infrastructure to establish the vLEI as a fundamental enabler of digital trust across the global economy."</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Becoming a member of the vLEI ecosystem via GLEIF qualification is a globally recognized designation of commitment to trusted organizational digital identity. Nord vLEI builds upon the expertise and reputation of NordLEI. Nord vLEI focuses on the development, management, and implementation of the vLEI. In 2023, NordLEI was recognized by GLEIF as the best performing LEI issuer in the Mid-Cap Category.</span></span></p>

<div> research, initial margin, reactiveness, procyclicality, uncertainty
Summary: 
- WFE and Dr. David Murphy introduce a novel measure of initial margin model reactiveness.
- Proposed methodology overcomes limitations of current measures of model procyclicality.
- Results show trade-offs between model reactiveness and uncertainty, as well as impact of anti-procyclicality tools.
- Adoption of an outcome-based approach to procyclicality is supported.
- Research highlights the need for adaptation of current methodology proposed by BCBS-CPMI-IOSCO. 
- The study sheds light on the shortcomings of current approaches and proposals to measure model reactiveness and provides an alternative method for consideration. <div>
<p>With standard setters considering further guidance on initial margin in centrally cleared markets, the World Federation of Exchanges (&ldquo;WFE&rdquo;) has today published joint research with Dr. David Murphy, Visiting Professor at the Department of Law of the London School of Economics (&ldquo;LSE&rdquo;) introducing a novel measure of initial margin model reactiveness (or &ldquo;procyclicality&rdquo;) that, unlike other measures, does not rely on particular risk factor paths and quantifies the uncertainty in the measurements.&nbsp;<br /><br />The WFE Research Working Paper, &ldquo;The Impulsive Approach to Procyclicality&rdquo;, arrives soon after the recent BCBS-CPMI-IOSCO Review of Transparency and Responsiveness of Initial Margin in Centrally Cleared Markets, which seeks to establish a standardised measure of margin responsiveness across the international clearing community.&nbsp;<br /><br />The responsiveness of initial margin models, both for centrally and non-centrally cleared trades, has been part of the discussions about how to best manage liquidity pressures in the financial system. However, the debate about how reactive margin should be to changes in market conditions has been hampered by the lack of a generally accepted and statistically sound way of measuring such reactiveness.&nbsp;<br /><br />Common measures of model procyclicality, including the method being proposed by the Joint Working Group on Margin (&ldquo;JWGM&rdquo;) set up by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, are strongly dependent on the individual scenarios and, as a consequence, cannot be used to compare margin models across different market conditions and are unlikely to provide a sufficient understanding of how models (and anti-procyclicality tools) could behave when there is an unanticipated change in market conditions. They also ignore the uncertainty surrounding the measurements.<br /><br />The methodology proposed in this research overcomes these limitations, measuring margin responsiveness to shifts in volatility and market dynamics by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Utilising an impulse response function (IRF) in a Monte Carlo simulation setting,</li>
<li>Capturing the variability (uncertainty) surrounding margin model reactiveness,</li>
<li>Providing a tool to assess and compare models that does not depend on a particular scenario.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The results presented demonstrate that a model&rsquo;s impulse response is a robust and useful measure of its reactiveness. Using this measure, the analysis also sheds light on different aspects of procyclicality management:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a trade-off between model reactiveness and the uncertainty of future model behaviour,&nbsp;</li>
<li>The use of a stress period and the addition of a buffer, two commonly used anti-procyclicality (APC) tools, do not significantly reduce the likelihood of a model over- or under-reacting. In particular, the buffer performs poorly.</li>
<li>The impact of the choice of core margin model far exceeds the impact of the APC tools analysed,</li>
<li>While the filtered Value at Risk (VaR) models analyzed offer the benefit of higher speeds of reaction, they tend to over-react to sharp, stepwise increases in volatility.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These results support the adoption of an outcome-based approach to procyclicality, recognising that there is no single correct level of procyclicality, but only acceptable choices given a specific situation (including risk factor dynamics, portfolio characteristics, participants&rsquo; funding liquidity arrangements), and the desired trade-off between reactiveness, potential extent of over-reaction, and margin accuracy.<br /><br />This research also highlights the need for an adaptation of the current methodology proposed by BCBS-CPMI-IOSCO before it is put into effect: either by capturing the degree of uncertainty in the measurement, or by including an appropriate warning of the standard setter&rsquo;s proposed method&rsquo;s limitations.&nbsp;<br /><br />Please find the full study&nbsp;<a href="https://world-exchanges.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=48ddcbc11eb58f141a51219ea&amp;id=0d55f0209c&amp;e=979576350c" target="_blank">here</a>.<br /><br /><strong>Pedro Gurrola-Perez, Head of Research at the World Federation of Exchanges,</strong>&nbsp;commented &ldquo;As the policy landscape looks set for change in this area, the research we have published today contributes to the sum of knowledge on this topic, sheds light on the shortcomings of the current approaches and proposals to measure model reactiveness (shortcomings which have often obscured the debate around procyclicality), and provides an alternative method for consideration which brings clarity to the discussion and provides the concepts of a model being over- or under-reactive with a statistically robust footing.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Dr. David Murphy, Visiting Professor at the Department of Law, LSE,</strong>&nbsp;commented &ldquo;As someone who has been studying the procyclicality of initial margin for some years, I am very happy to have been involved with this work. The importance of the measurement of procyclicality is increasingly recognised. For the first time, this paper presents a measure that allows different initial margin models to be robustly compared.&rdquo;</p>

<div> Female founders, FinTech growth, regional scaleups, UK FinTech, diversity<br />
Summary:<br />
Firms with female founders have higher turnover growth. Multi-founder FinTechs raise more funding. Regional UK FinTechs show potential for growth. Suggestions for entrepreneurs, investors, and policymakers. Innovate Finance, Whitecap Consulting, and Streets Consulting's research reveals insights into regional FinTech scaleups. <div>
<ul>
<li> <strong><span>Firms with female founders achieved over 30% more turnover growth than those with male only founders - yet only 16% of firms had a female founder</span></strong> </li>
<li> <strong><span>Firms in Lending, Banking, InsurTech, Money Management and WealthTech enjoy the strongest revenue growth</span></strong> </li>
<li> <strong><span>More than half of FinTechs had more than one founder; and the more founders, the higher their revenue growth rate</span></strong> </li>
<li> <strong><span>9 out of 10 firms that attended an accelerator went on to raise funding</span></strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Innovate Finance, Streets Consulting and Whitecap Consulting have published the &lsquo;Scaling UK Regional FinTech&rsquo; research report. The new, unique study, born from the collective expertise of the three organisations deeply embedded in the UK&rsquo;s FinTech ecosystem, provides valuable insights into accelerating the growth of regional scaleups* based outside of London and the South East.</span></p>
<p><span>The research project, undertaken by Whitecap Consulting and co-published with Innovate Finance and Streets Consulting, was designed to answer a fundamental question for the FinTech industry and the wider UK economy:&nbsp;</span><em><span>How do we enable more FinTech firms to successfully scale up in the UK?</span></em></p>
<p><span>The &lsquo;Scaling UK Regional FinTech&rsquo; research report delves into the growth and development data of 250 of the UK's regional FinTech scaleups outside of London and is supported by interviews with leaders and entrepreneurs. It reveals the challenges and opportunities FinTech scaleups face as they grow, navigate the current economic climate and strive to bring the innovation and growth that the UK economy needs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><strong><span>Background</span></strong></h4>
<p><span>According to the latest data published in the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.gov.uk%2Fgovernment%2Fpublications%2Fthe-kalifa-review-of-uk-fintech/1/0102018ee21d21c8-53339280-2740-4391-b321-2f38152a7004-000000/ESCnwv_UVcBIdwxgl9dLeUgmDPA=369" target="_blank"><span>Kalifa Review</span></a><span>, UK FinTech accounts for 10% of the global industry, comprising around 2,500 UK companies. The Kalifa Review also stated that by 2030, FinTech&rsquo;s direct Gross Value Add (GVA) contribution to the UK economy is predicted to reach&nbsp;</span><a href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fassets.publishing.service.gov.uk%2Fmedia%2F607979c7d3bf7f400f5b3c65%2FKalifaReviewofUKFintech01.pdf/1/0102018ee21d21c8-53339280-2740-4391-b321-2f38152a7004-000000/Jvec2T5ka-hBU3qM3Fd2xwPSgFM=369" target="_blank"><span>&pound;13.7bn</span></a><span>, with job creation contributing to 70% of this value.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The UK attracts more FinTech investment than the rest of Europe combined and is second only to the United States, according to the latest investment report by&nbsp;</span><a href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.innovatefinance.com%2Fcapital%2Ffintech-investment-landscape-2023%2F/1/0102018ee21d21c8-53339280-2740-4391-b321-2f38152a7004-000000/OB-CpKzTaED9ZpAyP15iilk4hc8=369" target="_blank"><span>Innovate Finance</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Six of the top 10 fintechs ranked by Fintech50 have headquarters in London.</span></p>
<p><span>As recently as the Autumn Statement 2023, the UK Chancellor announced a series of measures to support&nbsp;</span><a href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.innovatefinance.com%2Fpolicy-blogs%2Fautumn-statement-22nd-nov-headlines-key-points-for-fintechs%2F/1/0102018ee21d21c8-53339280-2740-4391-b321-2f38152a7004-000000/RAuGti8dU-hEF5SyHWgcWv6t830=369" target="_blank"><span>high-growth innovative FinTech companies in the UK</span></a><span>&nbsp;which struggle to raise scaleup capital.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In order to support the UK in its aspirations to grow the UK FinTech scaleup sector and maintain the UK&rsquo;s current position as a global leader in FinTech, Innovate Finance, Streets Consulting and Whitecap Consulting sought to understand the lessons that can be learned from FinTechs located outside London and the South East, all successfully scaling today.</span></p>
<h4><strong><span>Report Findings:</span></strong></h4>
<h5><strong><span>People</span></strong></h5>
<ul>
<li> <span>Firms with female founders achieved over 30% more turnover growth than those with male only founders - yet only 16% of firms had a female founder.</span> </li>
<li> <span>More than half of FinTechs had more than one founder; the average age of all founders is 38 years old.</span> </li>
<li> <span>The more founders, the higher their revenue growth rate (companies with up to 4 founders were part of the study).</span> </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong><span>Finances</span></strong></h5>
<ul>
<li> <span>Raising investment correlates to higher employee and revenue growth, but revenue grows at a proportionally lower rate.&nbsp;</span> </li>
<li> <span>9 out of 10 firms that attended an accelerator went on to raise funding.</span> </li>
<li> <span>Firms in Payments and WealthTech account for the largest number of scaleups, but PropTech firms are most likely to successfully raise funding.</span> </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong><span>Market</span></strong></h5>
<ul>
<li> <span>87% of FinTechs analysed have a B2B element to their go to market strategy, compared to 30% B2C (16% have both).</span> </li>
<li> <span>On average, B2C firms that obtain funding achieved double the revenue and employee growth of B2B only firms.</span> </li>
<li> <span>Firms in Lending, Banking, InsurTech, Money Management and WealthTech enjoy the strongest revenue growth.</span> </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong><span>Recommendations from the report</span></strong></h4>
<p><span>Based on the analysis and interviews undertaken during the research report, the evidence suggests the following actions would help create more FinTech scaleups across the UK:</span></p>
<h5><span>For entrepreneurs:</span></h5>
<ol>
<li><strong><span>Vocation, not location.</span></strong><span>&nbsp;What you do and how you do it will define your success, not your location.</span></li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t go it alone.&nbsp;</strong><span>FinTech firms with multiple founders are more likely to successfully scale.</span></li>
<li><strong>Ensure gender diversity</strong><span>. Firms with one or more female founders outperform male-only founder teams.</span></li>
<li><strong>Join an accelerator.&nbsp;</strong><span>Companies which were part of an accelerator raised investment more successfully; the coaching, guidance and contacts within accelerator cohorts can provide assistance as organisations scale.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<h5><span>For investors, policymakers and the wider FinTech sector:</span></h5>
<ol>
<li><strong><span>Think nationally.</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Our analysis shows that location doesn&rsquo;t matter, although being in a city has a positive impact on growth.</span></li>
<li><strong>Reduce risk for entrepreneurs.</strong><span>&nbsp;More support is required in terms of tax relief schemes and access to&nbsp;</span><span>funding.</span></li>
<li><strong>Encourage diversity in FinTech leadership.</strong><span>&nbsp;More initiatives are required, building on the new government taskforce to create dedicated funding for female-founded businesses and to provide support for other challenges faced by female entrepreneurs.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span>Janine Hirt, CEO of Innovate Finance, said:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>&ldquo;We are delighted to partner with Whitecap and Streets Consulting on this important piece of research providing insightful advice from FinTech scale ups and recommendations for policy-makers. The report tells the inspiring story of FinTech innovators across the UK, showing their incredible contributions and determination to grow successful businesses and drive so much positive change for a more democratic, transparent and inclusive financial services sector that benefits both consumers and businesses alike.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Julian Wells, Director &amp; FinTech Lead at Whitecap Consulting, said:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re delighted to present these findings to the FinTech community and we&rsquo;re proud to work with Innovate Finance and Streets Consulting to make this happen.&nbsp; The research highlights some fascinating and surprising trends, but also contains valuable advice from those founders who have &lsquo;been there and done that&rsquo; in terms of creating and growing new FinTechs.&nbsp; The main message for us from this report is that in today&rsquo;s world&nbsp;</span><em><span>where&nbsp;</span></em><span>you scale a business is nowhere near as important as&nbsp;</span><em><span>how&nbsp;</span></em><span>you scale a business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>He added:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>&ldquo;What is not a surprise to us, is to see so many regional FinTech innovators succeeding outside of London - there is an extremely vibrant ecosystem of FinTech innovators across all four corners of our nation.&nbsp; These are exactly the kinds of data and insights which can help shape the UK&rsquo;s effort to maintain its position as a true leader in global FinTech.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Julia Streets, CEO of Streets Consulting, commented: &ldquo;</span></strong><span>It&rsquo;s tremendous to have partnered with such prestigious FinTech industry experts to produce this report, which shines a bright light on the opportunities and challenges facing our regional FinTech scaleups.&nbsp; We see these stories day in, day out, as we advise our clients and coach with incubators in this important sector for UK economic prosperity.&nbsp; The opportunities are exciting and vast for the UK to continue to lead as innovators in global FinTech and we&rsquo;re passionate about supporting that growth and transformation.</span><strong><span>&rdquo;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>She added:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>&ldquo;The data on diversity from this report is bitter-sweet.&nbsp; Once again we see the benefits of diversity and inclusion, since FinTechs founded by women significantly outperform those founded by men; but once again we see the size of the challenge, as fewer than a fifth of FinTech firms are founded by women.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>The Scaling UK Regional FinTech Research Report is available to download&nbsp;</span></strong><a href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.streetsconsulting.com%2Fresearch%2F/1/0102018ee21d21c8-53339280-2740-4391-b321-2f38152a7004-000000/gjnkFewlMIreZeo93zY-WltKjKc=369" target="_blank"><strong><span>here</span></strong></a><strong><span>.</span></strong></p>
<h4><strong><span>Universe of Study</span></strong></h4>
<p><span>To create a study robust in its methodology and accurate in its insights, the report&rsquo;s authors gathered information on 250 UK FinTechs based outside of London, spanning many different regions and analysed the data thoroughly. Additionally, deep-dive one-to-one interviews have been conducted with 10 FinTech entrepreneurs from some of the UK&rsquo;s main FinTech regions, to give an even deeper insight into the circumstances and experiences that sit behind some of the highest growth FinTech firms in this exciting UK innovation success story.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>Definition of &rsquo;Scaleup&rsquo; -&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Firms that have reported revenues above &pound;632,000 (and less than &pound;25m) using Companies House data. This is the primary measure from which the research has distinguished these firms from the startup community.</span></li>

<div> Partnership, Credit check, Dutch market, Open banking, Risk management
Summary:
Worldline and RiskQuest partner for credit check solutions tailored to the Dutch market, leveraging open banking capabilities for efficient, innovative, and secure credit assessment. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p><span>Worldline [Euronext: WLN], a global leader in payment services, has signed a partnership agreement with the leading risk consultancy firm in the Netherlands RiskQuest BV, part of the Zanders Group, to provide best-in-class credit check processes specific to the Dutch market. Worldline and RiskQuest will join forces to create an open banking-based credit analysis that addresses consumer, private and SME lending, and leasing in relation to the unique characteristics of the Dutch financial landscape. Through this partnership, Worldline's Credit Insight solution will incorporate RiskQuest's significant market expertise, bolstering the already industry-leading services available to Worldline customers.</span></p>
<p>Combining RiskQuest&rsquo;s significant experience and insights on the Dutch financial environment with Worldline&rsquo;s global status as an innovative partner for payment services, this partnership will leverage their joint capabilities and further enhance Worldline&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://worldline.com/en/home/main-navigation/resources/resources-hub/blogs/2023/the-benefits-of-open-banking-and-the-power-of-worldline-credit-insight-solution.html">Credit Insight solution</a>&nbsp;which was launched last year. Creating a credit risk analysis solution that is adapted to the unique needs of the Dutch market and is available in a single API, provides a huge advantage as it eliminates the need for multiple connections and multiple formats from and towards many banks. This means that customers can connect to 3,500+ banks in 20 European countries through a single API connection.</p>
<p>Besides this large open banking reach and all associated benefits, this solution offers several advantages, such as instant views of customer financial positions, affordability, and risks &ndash; directly from bank data. In turn, this significantly lowers the risk of fraud and helps financial institutions adapt to changes in how people bank, complexities driven by high inflation and interest rates, and the disruption brought about by fintech competition.</p>
<blockquote><span>Clement Jozwiak, Head of Products Financial Services</span>:&nbsp;<i>"We are excited to partner with RiskQuest to harness the synergies of Worldline's open banking platform. This partnership allows us to deliver a best-in-class solution tailored to the unique demands of the Dutch market. Together, we share the ambition to revolutionise credit risk management, providing lenders, leasing providers and financial institutions with an efficient, innovative, and seamlessly integrated credit assessment experience."</i></blockquote>
<blockquote>&nbsp;</blockquote>
<blockquote><span>Hans Heintz, Director at Zanders Group</span>:&nbsp;<i>"We look forward to entering into this strategic agreement with Worldline. Our deep understanding of the intricacies of the Dutch financial system, combined with Worldline's comprehensive open banking capabilities, positions us to offer an exceptional credit assessment product. Both companies are committed to empowering Dutch lenders with cutting-edge, secure, and instant credit insights, paving the way for a transformative approach to credit risk management in the Netherlands."</i></blockquote>

<div> Tokyo, Singapore, derivatives trading, Asia-Pacific, survey<br />
Summary:
- Tokyo and Singapore to dominate derivatives trading
- Japan's potential for interest rate and FX derivatives
- Optimism about growth potential in IRD and FX trading in Asia
- India seen as having more derivatives market potential than China
- International Swaps and Derivatives Association’s (ISDA) 38th Annual General Meeting features key speakers and sessions <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Tokyo and Singapore will be the top locations for derivatives trading in the Asia-Pacific region over the next three to five years, according to market participants who responded to a survey to mark the start of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association&rsquo;s (ISDA) 38<span>th</span>&nbsp;Annual General Meeting (AGM) in Tokyo on April 16-18.</p>
<p>Asked to rank the importance of a selection of Asia-Pacific cities, respondents cited Singapore (with a ranking score of 4.23), Tokyo (4.08), Hong Kong (3.74), Shanghai (3.73) and Sydney (3.63).</p>
<p>Nearly two-thirds (64.6%) of respondents anticipate a shift to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.boj.or.jp/en/mopo/mpmdeci/mpr_2024/k240319a.pdf">higher interest rates</a>&nbsp;will be a catalyst for increased interest rate derivatives (IRD) activity and risk management in Japan. Close to half (45.6%) believe Japan&rsquo;s share of global foreign exchange (FX) derivatives trading will increase given government debt levels, economic activity and currency volatility. According to the&nbsp;<a href="https://data.bis.org/topics/DER/tables-and-dashboards">Bank for International Settlements (BIS) latest triennial survey</a>, the share of IRD and FX derivatives global average daily turnover reported by sales desks in Japan stood at 0.9% and 4%, respectively, in April 2022.</p>
<p>The overwhelming majority of survey participants (93%) stated that derivatives will be important in realizing the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsa.go.jp/en/policy/pjlamc/20231214.html">Japanese government&rsquo;s ambition</a>&nbsp;to position the country as a hub for asset management, with 50.0% identifying derivatives as very or extremely important.</p>
<p>Market participants are also optimistic about the growth potential of IRD trading in Asia excluding Japan in the coming three to five years. Two-thirds of respondents (65.6%) expect an expansion of the region&rsquo;s share of IRD global average daily turnover, which stood at 11% in April 2022 (based on location of the sales desks), according to the BIS. Interest rate volatility and economic growth were cited as potential catalysts.</p>
<p>FX derivatives trading in Asia ex-Japan is similarly expected to grow from its current level of 22% of global average daily turnover based on BIS 2022 triennial survey analysis. The proportion reported by sales desks in the region is anticipated to increase at least moderately over the next three to five years by 72% of respondents, with 22% believing it will rise substantially. Global trade partnerships and enhanced credit activities are identified as potential drivers. Just 5% of respondents think the share of FX trading will fall.</p>
<p>India was seen as having more derivatives market potential than China by 75% of respondents, with economic growth and the development of capital and financial markets the most cited reasons.</p>
<p>The survey involved 155 global market participants with operations and/or activity in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s AGM features sessions on the economic outlook in Japan and geopolitical risks in Asia Pacific and beyond. The event also includes panels on regulatory efforts to address perceived vulnerabilities posed by non-bank financial intermediation, the global impact of US Treasury clearing requirements and the cost of implementing Basel III.</p>
<p>Keynote speakers include&nbsp;<span>Rostin Behnam</span>, Chairman of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission,&nbsp;<span>Marco Casalaina</span>, Vice President of Products at Azure AI,&nbsp;<span>Masahiko Kato</span>, president and CEO of Mizuho Bank,&nbsp;<span>Teruhisa Kurita</span>, Commissioner at Japan&rsquo;s Financial Services Agency,&nbsp;<span>Thomas Montag</span>, CEO of Rubicon Carbon,&nbsp;<span>Yutaka Nakajima</span>, Deputy President Director, Representative Executive Officer, Nomura Holdings,&nbsp;<span>Seiichi Shimizu</span>, Executive Director, Bank of Japan, and&nbsp;<span>Eiji Ueda</span>, Executive Managing Director and Chief Investment Officer, Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF), Japan.</p>

<title>Remarks At Program On Corporate Compliance And Enforcement Spring Conference 2024,  Gurbir S. Grewal, Director, Division Of Enforcement, New York City, NY, April 15, 2024</title>

<div> Securities and Exchange Commission, Enforcement Director, AI, investors, compliance<br />
Summary:<br />
SEC Enforcement Director discusses risks of AI in financial markets, urges proactive compliance to avoid potential investor harm. <div>
<p>Professor Arlen, thank you for the introduction, and thank you to PCCE for inviting me to participate in today&rsquo;s 10<span>th</span>&nbsp;anniversary program.</p>
<p>As is customary, my remarks this afternoon are in my official capacity as SEC Enforcement Director, and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Commission, the Commissioners, or other members of the staff.</p>
<p>One of the hallmarks of PCCE is that it brings together academics, regulators, and industry professionals, and allows us to have candid conversations about corporate misconduct and the ways in which we can all work together to improve compliance.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s precisely what I&rsquo;d like to do this afternoon. As we gather to mark ten years of dialogue, I think it&rsquo;s important to both summarize what we&rsquo;ve learned during this period and see how we can leverage those lessons to effect better compliance in the future.</p>
<p>If the last decade has shown us anything in this regard, it&rsquo;s that many of the major financial scandals of the time have had a number of things in common. And that is, when you combine charismatic leaders with strong investor interest, noncompliance, weak controls, or under-empowered gatekeepers, it creates a perfect storm of risk and the potential for great investor harm.</p>
<p>Most recently, we&rsquo;ve seen these storms ravage investors in the crypto markets with the spectacular collapses of FTX and Terraform, among others.</p>
<p>With respect to the former, it&rsquo;s been referred to as one of the largest financial frauds in U.S. history, and it&rsquo;s principal architect was recently sentenced to 25 years in federal prison.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-pcce-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Tellingly, John Ray, who was appointed FTX CEO as part of its bankruptcy proceedings, observed that &ldquo;in his 40 years of legal and restructuring experience,&rdquo; which included the Enron bankruptcy, he had never seen &ldquo;such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-pcce-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>With respect to the latter, just over a week ago, the SEC prevailed on its fraud claims against Terraform and its founder Do Kwon.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-pcce-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;A jury in the Southern District of New York found the defendants liable for misleading investors in multiple ways before the collapse of their stablecoin, along with the rest of their ecosystem, in 2022. That collapse wiped out $40 billion from the crypto markets, decimated countless investors, and precipitated a chain of bankruptcies and events that ultimately contributed to the Crypto Winter of 2022.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-pcce-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Now, I recently spoke at length about our efforts to address this decade of non-compliance and investor harm in the crypto markets, and won&rsquo;t go further into other examples of similar misconduct today. I&rsquo;ll simply note they exist.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-pcce-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not just in the crypto markets. We experienced perfect storms of risk during the SPAC boom with frauds like the one that the SEC alleges was perpetrated by Trevor Milton and the EV company, Nikola.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-pcce-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;And we&rsquo;ve seen them in any number of recent alleged frauds by founders, including the collapse of Theranos and the prosecutions of its founders Elizabeth Holmes and Sunny Balwani.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-pcce-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>I am certain that those who have studied these and other recent financial frauds at greater length than me, or than my remarks allow discussing, will undoubtedly point to other contributing or distinguishing factors. But at minimum, one throughline is that&nbsp;<i>elevated investor interest</i>&nbsp;in rapidly developing technology or offerings often leads to&nbsp;<i>elevated investor risk</i>.</p>
<p>Put another way: any time you have individuals or corporations trying to capitalize and profit on FOMO, or the &ldquo;fear of missing out,&rdquo; around a new technology or offering, it should raise red flags for regulators and compliance professionals alike. After all, effective enforcement and governance require anticipating risk areas.</p>
<p>So looking ahead, where do we see potential risk?</p>
<p>Every day, we see revolutionary technological advancements in artificial intelligence, or AI, that promise to transform nearly every aspect of our lives, including our financial decision making.</p>
<p>Every day, we see individuals, corporations, analysts, and others touting these developments.</p>
<p>Every day, we see investors looking to incorporate AI into their investment strategies, or using it to analyze and recommend investments.</p>
<p>Every day, we see companies attempting to not only develop AI capabilities, or harness it to improve their productivity and growth, but also to attract and retain investors.</p>
<p>And in the end, every day, we see investors making larger and larger investments in these issuers or financial products.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-pcce-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p>Indeed, according to a recent survey, 61% of investors believe that faster adoption of AI is very, or extremely, important to a company&rsquo;s value.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-pcce-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;That jumps to 85% when including investors who believe it is moderately important.</p>
<p>As a result, it may be an understatement to say that there is not only immense investor interest, but also immense market interest, in AI.</p>
<p>While perhaps not quite yet a perfect storm, there&rsquo;s certainly one brewing around AI. And it is incumbent on each of us to make sure it does not come to pass and that investors are not harmed by noncompliance with the securities laws when it comes to this new technology.</p>
<p>How then should we be preparing for, and addressing, these potential risks?</p>
<p>Our experience with ESG investing provides an instructive starting point. With ESG, we saw large swaths of investors become interested in firms and companies that incorporated ESG into their investment strategies and business plans.</p>
<p>That meant that companies had meaningful financial incentives to exaggerate, or make misleading statements about, their supposed ESG activities or products. After all, saying that you have an investment strategy or business plan that incorporates ESG considerations is pretty easy; creating one and sticking to it is another matter. And over the last several years, we have brought a number of enforcement actions addressing this type of misconduct.</p>
<p>For example, the SEC charged a Deutsche Bank subsidiary with making materially misleading statements about its supposed ESG-related investment products.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-pcce-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;According to the SEC&rsquo;s order in that case, the firm marketed itself as a&nbsp;<i>leader</i>&nbsp;in ESG and claimed that it adhered to specific policies for integrating ESG considerations into its investments. It even advertised that ESG was in its &ldquo;DNA.&rdquo; But as it turned out, the firm did not ensure that its investment professionals actually followed all aspects of the ESG investment processes that it marketed. In the end, it paid a $19 million civil penalty to settle those claims.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, we are now seeing the same thing with AI. Just last month, the SEC announced settled charges against two registered investment advisers for making false and misleading statements about their purported use of AI.</p>
<p>One firm claimed it used it to analyze client data and predict which companies were going to &ldquo;make it big.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-pcce-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;The other claimed it provided &ldquo;expert AI-driven forecasts.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-pcce-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;Both statements were false and misleading. Neither had the AI capabilities that they claimed.</p>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p>I hope these actions put the investment industry on notice. If you are rushing to make claims about using AI in your investment processes to capitalize on growing investor interest, stop. Take a step back, and ask yourselves: do these representations accurately reflect what we are doing or are they simply aspirational?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s the latter, your actions may constitute the type of &ldquo;AI-washing&rdquo; that violates the federal securities laws.</p>
<p>The bottom line: you must ensure that your representations regarding your use of AI are not materially false or misleading.</p>
<p>Now, I know that many of you here are in-house counsel and compliance personnel at public companies. AI-washing is not just an issue for investment firms; it should concern each of you as well.</p>
<p>There are any number of reasons that a public company may disclose AI-related information. It may be in the business of developing AI applications. It may use AI capabilities in its own operations to increase efficiency and value for shareholders. Or, it may discuss security risks or competitive risks from AI.</p>
<p>But irrespective of the context, if you&rsquo;re speaking on AI, you too must ensure that you do so in a manner that is not materially false or misleading. This becomes ever more significant as AI-related disclosures by SEC registrants are increasing.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-pcce-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p>So how do you help ensure that your companies and clients comply with securities law requirements as they relate to AI?</p>
<p>Here, I think we can draw from general principles of what I&rsquo;ve called &ldquo;proactive compliance.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-pcce-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;As I&rsquo;ve said before, proactive compliance requires three things: education, engagement, and execution.</p>
<p>First,&nbsp;<span><i>educate</i></span>&nbsp;yourselves about emerging and heightened AI risk areas as they relate to your businesses. That means reading the AI-related enforcement actions I mentioned. It means reviewing any future enforcement actions that may follow in this space.</p>
<p>It also means reviewing speeches like Chair Gensler&rsquo;s recent speech on AI, which highlighted multiple other ways in which a firm&rsquo;s AI use may heighten risk or implicate the federal securities laws.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-pcce-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;He specifically discussed the conflicts of interests raised by AI for advisers, the problems presented by AI hallucinations, and the threat that AI could pose to the stability of our markets.</p>
<p>And it means staying abreast of how potential AI-related issues are actually impacting companies in the real world. Take for example, the recent reporting around an airline&rsquo;s chatbot offering a customer incorrect information about its refund policy.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-pcce-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a></p>
<p>Second, take what you&rsquo;ve learned from our orders and public pronouncements, and your own research, and&nbsp;<span><i>engage</i></span>&nbsp;with personnel inside your company&rsquo;s different business units to learn how AI intersects with their activities, strategies, risks, financial incentives, and so on.</p>
<p>Ask: what public statements are we making about our incorporation of AI into our business operations? Are they accurate, or are they aspirational? Does AI present a material risk to our business operations in some way?</p>
<p>Now, is the time to engage.</p>
<p>And third,&nbsp;<span><i>execute</i></span>. Does your use of AI require updating policies and procedures and internal controls? If so, are those policies and procedures bespoke to your company? And here, let me be clear: it&rsquo;s not enough to go to ChatGPT or a similar tool and ask it to produce an AI policy for you.</p>
<p>And then, have you taken the steps necessary to implement those policies and procedures? As we have seen time and again, adoption is only part of the battle; effective execution is equally important and that&rsquo;s where many firms fall short.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-pcce-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></p>
<p>Let me finish by touching on a topic that comes up often in these conversations: individual liability. As I mentioned, a public company may find it necessary to disclose information regarding security risks from AI. In fact, by some measures, most public company disclosures about AI relate to security and competitive risks from AI.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-pcce-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a>&nbsp;Individual liability for disclosure failures related to AI as a security threat may therefore be of particular interest to you.</p>
<p>Here, I would look to our approach to cybersecurity disclosure failures generally: we look at what a person actually knew or should have known; what the person actually did or did not do; and how that measures up to the standards of our statutes, rules, and regulations. And as I&rsquo;ve said before in the context of CCO and CISO liability, and I will say it again in the context of AI-related risk disclosures: folks who operate in good faith and take reasonable steps are unlikely to hear from us.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-pcce-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a></p>
<p class="text-align-center">***</p>
<p>In the end, while AI may be transformative to many aspects of our lives, the SEC&rsquo;s experience with other developing technologies and investment products illustrates not only the elevated investor risk presented by potentially false or misleading claims about its use, but also the steps market participants can take to help ensure compliance with AI-related disclosures and how we might approach liability in this area.</p>
<p>I look forward to working with you to further our shared goal of protecting investors, while harnessing the benefits of AI and avoiding the next perfect storm of risk.</p>
<p>Thank you again to PCCE for the invitation and congratulations on 10 years of these types of candid conversations.</p>
<p>I now look forward to discussing a few additional topics with Professor Arlen and with each of you.</p>

<div> consent order, restitution, civil monetary penalty, fraud, CFTC<br />
Summary: The CFTC imposed a consent order for fraud, requiring $4.5 million in restitution and a civil penalty against Nawabi Enterprises for forex trading fraud. <br /><br /> <div>
<p><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced the entry of a consent order in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California imposing restitution and a civil monetary penalty against&nbsp;<span>Eshaq M. Nawabi,&nbsp;</span>d/b/a/<span>&nbsp;Nawabi Enterprise,</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span>Hyperion Consulting Inc.</span>&nbsp;The order requires the defendants to pay $4.5 million in restitution to victims of the fraud and a $4.5 million civil monetary penalty.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Today&rsquo;s order follows a prior consent order the court entered on December 6, 2023, which, in addition to finding the defendants liable for fraud, enjoins them from future violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations, as charged in the complaint, and permanently bans them from registering with the CFTC and trading on any registered entity. Today&rsquo;s order fully resolves the CFTC action filed on April 26, 2022. [See CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8524-22">8524-22</a>].</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Case Background</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The order finds from approximately October 2019<span>&nbsp;</span>through April 22, 2022, the defendants solicited pool participants to deposit money to trade forex. To persuade pool participants to send them money, the defendants made fraudulent and material misrepresentations and omissions including: the defendants had historically made large profits (between 8&ndash;25% per month) for themselves and pool participants from trading forex; pool participants would realize profits of 8&ndash;25% per month on their funds with minimal risk; the defendants would trade forex with the funds the pool participants deposited; and upon request, pool participants could withdraw their money within three to five business days of any such requests. Instead of trading pool participant funds as promised, the defendants misappropriated the pool participants&rsquo; money for Nawabi&rsquo;s own personal benefit as well as to pay other pool participants in a manner akin to a Ponzi scheme. To conceal their misappropriation, the defendants created and issued false account statements that misrepresented trading returns the pool participants supposedly earned. The defendants failed to return funds to the pool participants despite repeated requests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The CFTC cautions that orders requiring repayment of funds to victims may not always result in the recovery of lost money because the wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this case are Sarah Matlack Wastler, James H. Holl, III, Maura Viehmeyer, Erica Bodin, and Rick Glaser.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>******</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>CFTC&rsquo;s Forex</span>&nbsp;<span>Fraud Advisory</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The CFTC has issued several customer protection&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/index.htm">Fraud Advisories and Articles</a>&nbsp;that provide the warning signs of fraud, including the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/ConsumerProtection/FraudAwarenessPrevention/CFTCFraudAdvisories/fraudadv_forex.html">Foreign Currency (Forex) Trading Fraud Advisory</a>, which alerts customers to forex fraud and lists simple ways to spot forex scams.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The CFTC also strongly urges the public to verify a company&rsquo;s registration with the CFTC before committing funds. If unregistered, a customer should be wary of providing funds to that entity. A company&rsquo;s registration status can be found using&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nfa.futures.org/basicnet">NFA BASIC</a>.</span></span></p>

<div> Joint Forum, financial market regulators, artificial intelligence, Total Cost Reporting, digital transformation
Summary: 
The Joint Forum of Canadian financial market regulators discussed AI, Total Cost Reporting, and digital transformation at their annual meeting.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The Joint Forum of Financial Market Regulators (Joint Forum) held its annual meeting on April 10, 2024, bringing together members of the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA), the Canadian Council of Insurance Regulators (CCIR), the Canadian Association of Pension Supervisory Authorities (CAPSA) and representatives from the Canadian Insurance Services Regulatory Organizations (CISRO), as well as the Mortgage Broker Regulators&rsquo; Council of Canada (MBRCC).<br /><br />As part of the plenary session, moderated by the Chair of the CSA Financial Innovation Hub Lise Estelle Brault, Joint Forum regulators heard from experts on how artificial intelligence (AI) technologies bring emerging benefits for financial markets participants, but also pose new risks.<br /><br />&ldquo;We are adapting to the new and ever-evolving dynamics of regulation in a digital world. The integration of AI can lead to the development of new financial products and services but can also create new risks and the need for new governance considerations,&rdquo; said Stan Magidson, CSA Chair and Chair and CEO of the Alberta Securities Commission. &ldquo;As regulators, we will maintain fair and efficient capital markets and remain vigilant in promoting the responsible development of AI in finance.&rdquo;<br /><br />Luc Sirois, Chief Innovator and President of the Council of Innovation of the Government of Qu&eacute;bec, shared his perspectives on digital transformation in the different financial sectors and the need to connect research and practice through inter-disciplinary collaboration. He noted that such advances have disruptive potential that requires enhanced partnership between government and business to address challenges, such as speed of technological change.<br /><br />Joint Forum members provided updates on important initiatives within their organizations. Members also discussed key information on the cross-sectoral efforts to implement the Total Cost Reporting (TCR) reforms, which are aimed at increasing investors&rsquo; and policyholders&rsquo; awareness of the ongoing costs of owning investment funds and individual segregated fund contracts. The TCR Implementation Committee, established in 2023 to provide guidance and assistance to registrants and insurers as they operationalize the enhancements, presented current work being completed to support the transition. Angela Mazerolle, CAPSA Chair and Vice-President, Regulatory Operations with the New Brunswick Financial and Consumer Services Commission stated &ldquo;CAPSA continues to support the important work of the Joint Forum and the sharing of information between the member organizations. We were pleased to report on our work in updating the 2004 Guidelines for Capital Accumulation Plans, originally developed by the Joint Forum, with the intention to have this important updated Guideline finalized this summer.&rdquo; Huston Loke, Chair of CCIR and Executive Vice President, Market Conduct at FSRA also added &ldquo;Consumers are better protected when the performance and costs of the funds they own are disclosed on a consistent and harmonized basis The Total Cost Reporting project is a testament to the Canadian Council of Insurance Regulators&rsquo; (CCIR) and the Canadian Securities Administrators&rsquo; shared commitment to supporting a stable and innovative marketplace in which industry can compete and the Canadian public can have confidence that consumers are being treated fairly.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>The CSA</strong>, the council of the securities regulators of Canada&rsquo;s provinces and territories, co-ordinates and harmonizes regulation for the Canadian capital markets.</p>
<p><strong>CCIR</strong>&nbsp;is an inter-jurisdictional association of insurance regulators. The mandate of the CCIR is to facilitate and promote an efficient and effective insurance regulatory system in Canada to serve the public interest.<br /><br /><strong>CAPSA</strong>&nbsp;is a national association of pension regulators whose mission is to facilitate an efficient and effective pension regulatory system in Canada. It develops practical solutions to further the coordination and harmonization of pension regulation across Canada.</p>

<title>ISDA derivatiViews: Capital For Clearing Must Be Risk Appropriate</title>

<div> capital requirements, derivatives, US banks, central clearing, risk management services
Summary:<br />US capital proposals would significantly increase capital requirements for derivatives, impacting US banks' ability to provide risk management services and access to central clearing.<br /> <div>
<p>Our analysis of the US capital proposals paints a very clear picture &ndash; the rules would dramatically increase capital requirements for derivatives, which will impact the ability of US banks to provide intermediary and risk management services. The consequences are particularly stark for the provision of access to central clearing, an activity that is widely seen as risk reducing yet faces an eye-watering capital increase because of the proposals.</p>
<p>According to the results of an industry impact analysis based on input from US global systemically important banks (G-SIBs), the proposed Basel III &lsquo;endgame&rsquo; and G-SIB surcharge rules would increase capital for client clearing businesses by more than 80%. A tax of this size on a low-risk, low-margin business will inevitably affect the ability of US banks to offer client clearing services, reducing capacity and increasing costs.</p>
<p>Mandatory central clearing of derivatives has been a regulatory priority since the 2008 financial crisis as a means of reducing counterparty credit risk. And it has worked well. According to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/a/pOlgE/SwapsInfo-Full-Year-2023-and-the-Fourth-Quarter-of-2023-Review.pdf">ISDA&rsquo;s SwapsInfo</a>, which is based on transactions reported to the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation&rsquo;s swap data repository under US Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulations, 78.2% of interest rate derivatives traded notional was cleared in 2023. Following adoption of rules by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last December, mandatory clearing is now being extended to certain US Treasury securities &ndash; a policy&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-247">SEC chair Gary Gensler</a>&nbsp;says will &ldquo;help to make the Treasury market more efficient, competitive and resilient&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The US capital proposals contradict that. Imposing such a burdensome tax would be inconsistent with the post-financial crisis policy objective to promote central clearing and would serve as a retrograde step by reducing the capacity of banks to support this business.</p>
<p>The increase comes from two specific elements of the proposals. First, changes in the US Basel III proposals, which include counting the client-facing leg of a cleared derivatives transaction in the credit valuation adjustment framework, will&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/01/16/isda-and-sifma-response-to-us-basel-iii-npr/">add $2 billion to US G-SIB capital requirements</a>. Second, proposed modifications to the complexity and interconnectedness categories of the G-SIB surcharge to include client derivatives cleared under the agency model, among other things, will&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/01/16/isda-and-sifma-response-to-g-sib-surcharge-framework-consultation/">add $5.2 billion to required capital</a>.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve set out our concerns to US prudential regulators and have proposed a variety of calibration changes to make the rules more risk appropriate. We will continue to warn that these regulations risk inhibiting the ability of banks to provide vital intermediation services, including access to clearing for their clients.</p>
<p>We strongly believe central clearing has made the derivatives market safer and more efficient, an opinion widely shared by regulators and academics. Given that, we see no basis for justifying such a large increase in capital for this business. We continue to advocate for capital rules that are appropriate and risk sensitive. We feel the US prudential approach on clearing is neither.</p>
<p><span>This topic will be discussed at ISDA&rsquo;s Annual General Meeting in Japan on April 16-18. It&rsquo;s the last chance to register,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://agm.isda.org/"><span>so sign up today</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<title>There’s Got To Be A Better Way: Statement Of Dissent Regarding Wayzata Investment Partners LLC, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, April 15, 2024</title>

<div> Commission, pay-to-play rule, investment adviser, campaign contribution, political process
<br />
The Commission settled a case under the pay-to-play rule. The rule penalizes covered associates for political donations, hampering political participation. Dissent supports legitimate political involvement.
<br /> 
Summary: The pay-to-play rule penalizes investment advisers for political donations, hampering political involvement and disadvantaging industry candidates. <div>
<p>Today the Commission instituted and settled an administrative proceeding under the investment adviser pay-to-play rule.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-wayzata-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;The facts here are similar to those of other pay-to-play cases: In April 2022, a covered associate of an investment adviser made a campaign contribution to a candidate for elected office. The office the candidate sought had influence over selecting investment advisers for a state investment board. The Commission&rsquo;s order, however, does not allege any link between the donation and the investments. In fact, the state investment board had invested in closed-end funds advised by Respondent several years prior to the contribution. Respondent&rsquo;s violation stems not from any attempt to obtain additional investments from the state investment board, but from the fact that it continued to provide advisory services for compensation in connection with the board&rsquo;s longstanding closed-end fund investments. This case is yet another illustration of the overbreadth of the pay-to-play rule and another reminder of the way the rule hampers legitimate political participation. Accordingly, I did not support the case.</p>
<p>I have dissented from past pay-to-play cases,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-wayzata-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;but write again to underscore the serious consequences of the rule on the political process. If a person covered by the rule&mdash;and that includes, among others, general partners, managing members, executive officers, employees who solicit a government entity for the investment adviser, and their supervisors<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-wayzata-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&mdash;makes a donation of more than $350,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-wayzata-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;the investment adviser cannot provide investment advice for compensation for two years after the donation. The rule allows for exemptions,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-wayzata-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;but the Commission has rarely granted them. To avoid questions from Commission examiners, the easiest course is not to contribute to political campaigns. So, the cost of working for an investment adviser is that you have to give up your right to contribute to certain political campaigns.</p>
<p>A further repercussion of the rule that was recently brought to my attention is that an investment adviser who chooses to run for office cannot collect campaign donations from acquaintances and supporters in the industry. Not being able to solicit for campaign contributions people with whom you have worked for years is a serious disadvantage to political candidates coming from the investment advisory industry. This consequence of our pay-to-play rule is yet another reason to worry that it impedes political participation.</p>
<p>The concerns about public corruption underlying the rule are worthy of attention. Politicians should not select advisers to manage public funds based on who has made the highest campaign contributions. But there has to be a better way to get at public corruption. Other government bodies exist to pursue such misconduct, and we are able to bring cases when there has been actual adviser misconduct involving payments to public officials.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-wayzata-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;Pursuing instances in which public officials, for personal or political benefit, have entrusted public money to advisers is vital. By contrast, a rule that penalizes people already subject to fiduciary obligations who donate money without any intent to do anything other than express their political preferences does not improve the political process.</p>

<div> Euronext, Mid-Point Match, dark trading, liquidity, execution quality <br />
Summary:
Euronext launches Mid-Point Match with dark, mid-point, and sweep functionalities for increased liquidity and accurate execution with no latency. <br /> <div>
<p align="justify"><span>Euronext, the leading pan-European market infrastructure, today announced the successful launch of Euronext Mid-Point Match, its advanced suite of dark, mid-point and sweep functionalities embedded within Euronext's Central Order Book. These enhancements allow trading members and buy-side firms to trade at the real mid-point, without incurring implicit latency costs, to access increased liquidity, while tapping into Euronext&rsquo;s unique pool of liquidity fostered by local brokers and investors. First introduced on the Brussels market on 18 March 2024, Euronext Mid-Point Match was launched across all Euronext markets on 8 April 2024.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Euronext Mid-Point Match offers a sweep functionality, allowing intermediaries to leverage both Euronext&rsquo;s dark and lit liquidity pools, to increase execution opportunities and flexibility across Euronext seven regulated markets. Dark orders in Euronext Mid-Point Match are pegged to the real-time mid-point of the Euronext Primary Best Bid and Offer, and provide traders with accurate execution opportunities. This results in lower market impact compared to London-based Multilateral Trading Facilities, which typically exhibit a 7-8 millisecond delay in displaying the Primary mid-point. Furthermore, dark-to-lit sweep orders interact seamlessly with the Euronext Central Order Book with zero latency, facilitating swift and efficient execution.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Under the Reference Price Waiver for small trades and Large In Scale Waiver for block trades, investors benefit from flexibility in their execution strategies.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>To safeguard execution quality, Euronext Mid-Point Match offers Minimum Acceptable Quantity and Minimum Execution Size features, providing traders with additional control over their orders.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Nicolas Rivard, Global Head of Cash Equity and Data Services at Euronext, said:&nbsp;</span><span>&ldquo;We are proud to offer a dark trading facility to our clients, to provide them with enhanced execution opportunities. Thanks to our state-of-the-art Core Data Centre, Euronext Mid-Point Match offers a high value proposition with no latency, no new membership, and direct access to Europe&rsquo;s largest liquidity pool, as well as the possibility to switch from dark to lit books when trading. Since 18 March, we have been pleased to see new members joining at a strong pace.&rdquo;</span></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Scope for central government arm&rsquo;s length bodies</strong>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;size thresholds have been clarified to include&nbsp;total operating income and funding received (including grant-in-aid) exceeding &pound;500 million. This is relevant for Arm&rsquo;s Length Bodies that rely on sponsor departments for income rather than from sales of goods and services.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Sector specific and industrial grouping</strong>&nbsp;- additional guidance clarifying where entities&rsquo; operations partially fall into TCFD&rsquo;s sector and industrial group guidance has been clarified.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Reporting requirements for principal risks</strong>&nbsp;- a table and flow chart have been added to aid preparers in identifying reporting requirements depending on whether climate is a principal risk.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Reporting boundaries</strong>&nbsp;- additional details was added setting out the qualitative and quantitative disclosures, which have been clarified, focusing on entity-level reporting (rather than group-level reporting) for the latter.</li>
<li><strong>Assurance arrangements</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; simplified the technical wording on assurance procedures.</li>
<li><strong>Opportunities</strong>&nbsp;- added high-level guidance on reporting climate-related opportunities, leveraging from existing performance reporting principles.</li>

<p>This Exposure Draft is to consult on new climate-related financial disclosures in entity-level annual reports that align with the TCFD&rsquo;s recommendations.</p>
<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>The Phase 2 Exposure Draft addresses the recommended disclosures for the Risk Management and Metrics and Targets pillars of the TCFD framework.</p>

<h4 id="remit">Remit</h4>
<p>This Exposure Draft covers the whole UK public sector, which is the boundary for the Whole of Government Accounts. However, the relevant authority for each jurisdiction within that boundary will have their own due process for proposing and approving changes to their reporting regime.

<p>The proposed changes are published for comment only. The proposals may be modified before being formally presented to the Financial Reporting Advisory Board (FRAB) for its approval.</p>
<h4 id="effective-date">Effective date</h4>
<p>The proposed effective date for central government bodies is 1 April 2024, with Phase 2 disclosures required in annual reports and accounts for 2024-25 on a comply or explain basis.</p>
<p>Other public sector bodies should follow the direction from their respective relevant authority. Public sector bodies may choose to voluntarily apply this guidance - in full or in part.</p>

<title>Comment On Hong Kong Crypto ETF Approvals</title>

<div> Hong Kong, Spot ETFs, ETC Group, Approval, Bitcoin
Summary:
Spot ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum approved in Hong Kong, reflecting global impact and establishing crypto as investable assets. Long-term demand expected to increase. Target price revisions predicted to exceed $100k by 2025.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Following the approval of Spot Bitcoin and Spot Ethereum ETFs by Hong Kong&rsquo;s Securities and Futures Commission, Tim Bevan, CEO at ETC Group, has commented below. ETC Group is Europe&rsquo;s leading provider of institutional-grade exchange-traded products in digital assets. In 2020, ETC Group blazed a trail in the industry with the debut of the ETC Group Physical Bitcoin ETP as the first crypto-linked product on XETRA, recognised by its ticker BTCE. Continuing the innovative streak, recent additions to ETC Group's market-leading product line-up include ET32, a unique total return Ethereum staking ETP linked to a transparent staking benchmark, and DA20, the only broad-market Crypto Basket ETP tracking an MSCI digital assets benchmark of the top 20 investable cryptocurrencies.</p>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tim Bevan commented. &ldquo;Hong Kong approving spot ETFs soon after the announcement of the LSE reiterates the global ripple effect of the spot ETF approvals in the US. This is further confirmation that Bitcoin is now an established investable asset amongst the traditional finance community globally and will create further demand pressure over time. Whilst we may see short-term volatility around the halving event and the escalation of geopolitical risk, the long-term supply/demand dynamics are skewed heavily to the upside, and we expect to see target price revisions for 2025 well in excess of $100k.&rdquo;</p>

<div> Bonds, ICE, RMA, trading network, liquidity<br />
Summary:<br />
ICE Bonds' RMA service wins Best Sell-Side Trading Network. Enhanced with STP penetration, pricing algorithm, and expanded user base. TD Securities praises efficiency.<br /> <div>
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.waterstechnology.com/awards-rankings/7951747/sell-side-technology-awards-2024-all-the-winners" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">WatersTechnology</a>&nbsp;has selected ICE Bonds as Best Sell-Side Trading Network for its Risk Matching Auction (RMA) service. This award comes after significant product enhancements and expansion of RMA&rsquo;s network.</p>
<p>RMA is ICE Bonds&rsquo; dealer-to-dealer sweep solution, which was relaunched in July 2023 as part of ICE Bonds&rsquo; suite of trading protocols. RMA offers users a strong pool of corporate bond liquidity across all sectors and maturities. RMA has been recognized for its user-friendly web-based user interface and different post trade options to provide users with a seamless post-trade experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The RMA workflow is a foundational piece in expanding ICE Bonds into institutional corporate bond trading, and establishing sell-side connectivity is crucial in this initiative,&rdquo; said Peter Borstelmann, President, ICE Bonds. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re delighted to be recognized for our RMA solution, which empowers traders to access liquidity post-sessions for tail risk management through existing protocols. By leveraging our assets in execution and data, we are confident that our modernized solution can deliver robust risk proposals and a cost-effective alternative for customers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>RMA provides an efficient way for traders to potentially reduce their risk exposure by providing a robust pool of liquidity in the corporate bond space. In the past year, some enhancements to RMA include:</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li>Removing the manual aspect of post-trade services by establishing extremely high STP penetration across several different connectivity options with the dealer community, including preexisting and new connections.</li>
<li>Creating a sophisticated pricing algorithm that uses continuous evaluated pricing (CEP&trade;) derived mid-price, ICE&rsquo;s proprietary pricing data, in addition to real-time market related inputs.</li>
<li>Expanding the RMA user base by adding Investment Grade and High Yield traders across all sectors and most of the systematic trading desks across the street.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;RMA's differentiated functionality helps us navigate markets, leveraging explicit preferences and profiles to support strategic decision-making,&rdquo; said Marty Manion, co-Head of TD Securities Automated Trading. &ldquo;We're pleased to work with ICE Bonds, whose platform delivers efficiencies to help support our risk management process.&rdquo;</p>
<p>RMA is part of the suite of services offered by ICE Bonds. ICE Bonds offers deep liquidity pools that support multiple trading protocols including click-to-trade, auction and RFQ, with a vast breadth of fixed income data. Focused on execution efficiency, ICE Bonds enables both anonymous and disclosed counterparty interactions, and trading from odd-lots to blocks.</p>

<h3>Speech</h3>
<h4><a id="_Hlk163427203"></a>Innovation in money and payments</h4>
<p>The money we use to support economic and financial activity, and the payment systems we use as we do so, are fundamental to the Bank of England&rsquo;s role to maintain monetary and financial stability. Money and payments have been no stranger to technological innovation over many centuries.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;But the pace, breadth and depth of technological change we see now suggests even more radical change may be ahead of us.</p>
<p>My aim today is to set out how the Bank of England is seeking to ensure that we will be able both to capture the benefits of these advances and to ensure they are safe. I&rsquo;ll discuss how, as we consider the payments landscape in its entirety, we are increasingly focused on innovation in wholesale payments and the importance of payments innovation by banks. We&rsquo;ll publish a Discussion Paper on these areas this summer to draw on input and collaboration from the private sector, as a complement to the work we&rsquo;ve been doing on stablecoin regulation and retail central bank digital currency (CBDC).</p>
<p>Looking back nearly five years ago, Facebook and others proposed a Libra stablecoin that aimed to apply technologies pioneered in the crypto-asset ecosystem to retail payments in the real-world on a global scale. That was somewhat of a bolt from the blue.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[2]</a></sup>&nbsp;It reminded us in the UK that, notwithstanding an apparently quick and seamless payments experience for many people (with near ubiquitous contactless card payments and new wallet apps like Apple Pay), technological innovation in money and payments was far from over.</p>
<p>Today, we see examples of interbank retail payment systems around the world &ndash; the Unified Payments Interface in India, Pix in Brazil, Swish in Sweden &ndash; that are used alongside cards for retail payments in a way that doesn&rsquo;t yet happen in the UK. Individuals can pay retailers in-store or online out of their bank accounts without going via cards &ndash; offering savings particularly for small businesses.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[3]</a></sup>&nbsp;And people increasingly make payments between different banks using only the recipient&rsquo;s mobile phone number or a QR code.</p>
<p>As we look ahead, we appear to be on the cusp of widespread, more fundamental technological change. Technologies loosely grouped under the broad heading of &lsquo;tokenisation&rsquo; &ndash; distributed ledger technology (DLT) and the potential for atomic settlement and programmability, as pioneered in crypto-asset markets &ndash; have the potential to offer greater efficiency and functionality for &lsquo;real world&rsquo; retail and wholesale payments. That innovation matters for our role in maintaining monetary and financial stability, and also has the potential to offer significant benefits for customers and businesses, economic activity and growth.</p>
<p>In retail payments (the high volume, low value payments made between households and businesses), our experiments with the private sector and the London Centre of the Bank for International Settlements&rsquo; Innovation Hub have already shown how use cases for these technologies can embed payments more deeply, automatically and efficiently into our increasingly digital lives.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Such technologies can enhance online shopping by enabling a buyer&rsquo;s funds to be reserved at time of purchase and automatically released to the seller only once physical delivery of goods is confirmed. That could enable greater competition in online retail if consumers are more confident to shop online with a new merchant or platform. Similarly (and perhaps I&rsquo;m playing to the gallery for those who&rsquo;ve travelled long distances today), they could allow commuters to purchase train tickets and be refunded immediately and automatically if the train arrives late, without a need for separate forms and payment instructions. In the context of supply chains, automatic payment upon delivery could help alleviate the perennial challenge of late payments to small businesses.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[5]</a></sup>&nbsp;And finally, these technologies could meaningfully reduce the cost of retail payments. Libra was proposing to enable cross-border payments like remittances at a fraction of the 6-7% average cost at the time. And lower cost payments could make micropayments (those for very small amounts) more economical, so that, for example, I pay for the article I read rather than needing an entire newspaper subscription.</p>
<p>I highlight these examples not as a comprehensive description of what these technologies have to offer. Rather, they simply highlight to me that there is genuine potential for these technologies to improve our everyday lives.</p>
<p>Such technologies also offer the opportunity to enhance wholesale payments and settlement &ndash; low volume, high value activity between financial and corporate institutions, which includes interbank payments as well as the payments that settle financial market activity.</p>
<p>Here, while the execution of financial market transactions today takes place at speed, its clearing and settlement is far slower, as the multiple entities involved (central securities depositories, central counterparties, custodians, banks and end-investors) each update their records. DLT allows a single, definitive database to be shared and updated simultaneously across all network participants, rather than each party maintaining its own records. It thus enables all participants in a network to have the same, single source of truth, without the need for manual reconciliation. This can facilitate faster, more efficient processes with fewer intermediaries, and increase the speed at which a transaction can settle &ndash; all of which could reduce the risks and costs involved. Tokenisation could also increase the liquidity of a wider range of financial assets (for example private assets, units in investment funds, or even real estate), enabling them to be held, traded or perhaps used as collateral by a broad set of players, and 'fractionalised' so that investors can hold a portion if they can't afford the whole.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[6]</a></sup></p>
<h4>The Bank of England&rsquo;s role in payments innovation</h4>
<p>I like to think of money and payment systems in terms of trains and rails &ndash; money is the train, and the payment system is the set of rails by which that asset travels from sender to receiver. The Bank of England&rsquo;s role for each is two-fold &ndash; both provider and regulator.</p>
<p>First, we provide trains and rails of our own. We issue our own money (cash and central bank reserves) and run the Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) infrastructure (the system by which reserves are transferred between financial institutions). These sit at the heart of the economy and financial system,&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk163414309"></a>and together deliver trust in money and payments, which underpins monetary and financial stability.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-7" id="footnote-ref-7"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[7]</a></sup>&nbsp;They are also an important foundation on which the private sector can provide services and innovate.</p>
<p>Second, we regulate the trains and rails provided by the private sector &ndash; the money issued by commercial banks, and the interbank payment systems and card schemes through which that money is transferred.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-8" id="footnote-ref-8"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[8]</a></sup>&nbsp;Again, our aim is to deliver trust in money and payments and so monetary and financial stability &ndash; by ensuring this private sector activity is safe. In so doing, we support safe innovation.</p>
<p>The technological innovation I&rsquo;ve described requires us to look ahead to identify what changes in our role as provider and regulator might be needed. I&rsquo;d highlight three reasons for that.</p>
<p>First, some of these technologies can reduce risks in the financial system. For example, collapsing the myriad of post-trade clearing and settlement activities and intermediaries into a potentially instantaneous smart contract could reduce, or even remove, counterparty credit and settlement risks. This could bring some new challenges to manage (the ability to net transactions before settlement is reduced, for example). But the direction of travel towards more efficient post-trade processes in financial markets is clear.</p>
<p>Second, as the central bank, we issue the safest form of money in the economy and that plays a crucial foundational role for monetary and financial stability. And so, as technology advances and new players introduce welcome competition, we need to ensure that we provide central bank money and payments infrastructure with the requisite functionality so that its role as an anchor of confidence in different types of money in the economy is not eclipsed.</p>
<p>Third, a regulated financial system that isn't delivering at the frontier in terms of outcomes for the real economy and financial market participants is vulnerable to new players growing quickly outside of the regulatory perimeter. Such players might quickly get to systemic scale and, in so doing, create risks that are hard retrospectively to address &ndash; a phenomenon we&rsquo;ve seen as technological innovation has hit other sectors of the economy.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-9" id="footnote-ref-9"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[9]</a></sup></p>
<h4>Our work on retail innovation</h4>
<h4>Stablecoin regulation</h4>
<p>We were reminded starkly of this final point by the Libra announcement in 2019. We faced the prospect of Facebook harnessing its network of (then) over two billion users to drive adoption both of a new form of money for retail payments (a stablecoin) and of new DLT rails for it to travel on. On both fronts, the risks were not adequately addressed by the regulatory frameworks then in place. And that meant trust in money and payments would not be assured.</p>
<p>While the Libra/Diem<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-10" id="footnote-ref-10"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[10]</a></sup>&nbsp;proposal came to naught, the possibility of stablecoins coming to be used at scale for retail payments (including by harnessing large firms&rsquo; existing user bases) remains. PayPal launched a dollar stablecoin with Paxos last year. And Visa is experimenting in the US, enabling merchants to receive payments in Circle&rsquo;s USD Coin.</p>
<p>So in November, we published a Discussion Paper proposing a regulatory regime for stablecoins used at systemic scale in retail payments, while the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) proposed a regime for stablecoins more broadly.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-11" id="footnote-ref-11"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[11]</a></sup>&nbsp;We&rsquo;ve received valuable feedback from a range of stakeholders in the crypto, payments and banking sectors, as well as from academics and civil society.</p>
<p>Our proposals are focused on ensuring the new train (the stablecoin itself) and the new rails (the system that transfers the stablecoins from payer to payee) meet our and the public&rsquo;s expectations for them to be as safe as those currently used for retail payments (commercial bank money and interbank payment systems respectively).</p>
<p>As with commercial bank money, safety comes from the financial resources stablecoin issuers hold to reduce the likelihood of failure and the resolution arrangements in place in case they do. It will be impossible to provide deposit insurance-style protections for stablecoins, since there isn&rsquo;t a broader industry among which to share the costs. And so that means tighter requirements on financial resources than for commercial bank money. We have proposed that stablecoins used at systemic scale for payments be backed 100% by central bank deposits. And that these would be unremunerated, as stablecoin issuers would not be engaged in lending or in money market activity, and so not expected to play a role in monetary policy transmission.</p>
<p>In the absence of revenues from backing assets, revenues for stablecoin issuers would have to come from other sources. This could be from fees for the use of the payment rails themselves, as is the case for interbank payment systems, including card companies, today. Or it could be through providing ancillary services, in the way that Open Banking firms today neither issue money nor provide payment rails, but rather offer users services such as budgeting tools based on access to payments data. (At the risk of straining my metaphor, such firms offer neither the train nor the rail, but rather the onboard concessions delivering services to passengers.)&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk163473136"></a>But my fundamental point is that business models wanting to offer a systemic means of payment and earn revenues from maturity and liquidity transformation should be regulated as banks.</p>
<p>In feedback to the Discussion Paper, some respondents said these requirements would challenge stablecoin issuers&rsquo; business models and so might effectively bar use of stablecoins at systemic scale. We&rsquo;ll of course closely consider all feedback received and we will then consult further on a draft rulebook &ndash; guided always by the principle that the same risks in different business models need to be addressed to achieve the same regulatory outcome.</p>
<h4>Exploration of retail CBDC</h4>
<p>At the same time as considering how to regulate new tokenised money for retail payments issued by the private sector, we are also exploring whether to provide such money ourselves. Hence, the Bank of England and HM Treasury (like many other countries around the world) are exploring whether or not to issue a retail CBDC in the UK.</p>
<p>Use of cash in UK retail transactions has already fallen from around two-thirds of transactions twenty years ago to 14% in 2022.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-12" id="footnote-ref-12"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[12]</a></sup>&nbsp;And the possibility of large technology companies issuing money risks bearing down further on the role of central bank money in retail payments. To be clear, we will issue banknotes for as long as people wish to use cash. But these trends do raise concerns for the Bank of England&rsquo;s objectives that may warrant a response.</p>
<p>A core tenet of monetary and financial stability is that the public can be confident in the value of money, regardless of its form and issuer, and that all types of money can be easily exchanged, delivering so-called uniformity of money. Wide access to banknotes &ndash; alongside bank regulation and provision of RTGS &ndash; has provided the anchor for our financial system and our economy for generations - since it ensures different forms of private money (like bank deposits) can always be converted into financially risk-free public money.</p>
<p>The fall to date in the use of cash hasn&rsquo;t yet challenged this uniformity of money. The risk that it might do so in future is hard to quantify and may be remote. But this uncertainty and the severity of the impact should it crystallise is an important motivation for our exploration of a retail CBDC. I firmly believe that, as technological innovation takes place, we must not forget the contribution that retail central bank money has made to monetary and financial stability.</p>
<p>There is also a risk that new players issuing money may impede other firms&rsquo; ability to provide wallets and other payment services for it (so-called &lsquo;walled gardens&rsquo;), or issue money in such a way that users cannot transact with users outside of their platform. This could challenge uniformity of money, since this money might not always be easily converted into other types of money. Such dynamics would also challenge competition in the payments market &ndash; and we&rsquo;ve of course seen in other sectors of the economy how digital, highly networked markets can present challenges to competition regulation.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-13" id="footnote-ref-13"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Given that context, we consulted with HM Treasury last year on a retail digital pound, and we published in January our response to the over 50,000 responses we received.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-14" id="footnote-ref-14"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[14]</a></sup>&nbsp;Many people raised important concerns around ensuring privacy and control over how they spend their money should a digital pound be launched.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-15" id="footnote-ref-15"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[15]</a></sup>&nbsp;We take these concerns seriously. In response, the Government has committed to introducing primary legislation to Parliament before a digital pound could be launched (and to consult further before doing so). And that legislation would guarantee users&rsquo; privacy and control of their digital pound payments.</p>
<p>Let me emphasise &ndash; we have not taken any decision on whether or not to issue a digital pound. But preparatory work is prudent to ensure the option to issue is available if needed. Our work over the next two years or so will be focused on making a robust and objective assessment of potential benefits and costs, including operational and technical feasibility. To do that, we will consider the potential design of a digital pound in greater detail, informed by technology experimentation and proofs of concept with the private sector. We will continue to engage widely with external stakeholders. And importantly, we will be informed by how innovation in the wider payments landscape evolves.</p>
<p>Indeed, key inputs into any decision to proceed with a retail CBDC will be the nature and scale of innovation in other forms of retail money (in particular, commercial bank money), as well as how our own wholesale payments infrastructure might evolve in support. Let me cover both in the rest of this speech, starting with our work&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk163453331"></a>supporting innovation in wholesale payments and settlement &ndash; an area on which we&rsquo;re increasingly focused.</p>
<h4>Our increased focus on wholesale innovation</h4>
<h4>Settlement</h4>
<p><a id="_Hlk163421093"></a>I spoke earlier about how tokenisation could drive greater speed and efficiency in post-trade financial market processes, through less need for manual reconciliation and long chains of intermediaries. As regulator of financial market infrastructure (FMI), we&rsquo;re proactively encouraging firms to explore these technologies.</p>
<p>New legislation passed last year gave HM Treasury the power to establish so-called &lsquo;FMI sandboxes&rsquo; &ndash; where we modify regulations to allow firms to experiment with new technology. Earlier this month, the Bank of England and the FCA consulted on our approach to the first such sandbox, the Digital Securities Sandbox.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-16" id="footnote-ref-16"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[16]</a></sup>&nbsp;This will enable the private sector to set up real-world trading venues and settlement systems using new technologies such as DLT. We will review feedback to our consultation closely, and plan to open the sandbox to applications this summer.</p>
<p>I want to emphasise the &lsquo;real world&rsquo; aspect, because &ldquo;sandbox&rdquo; as a moniker probably undersells the innovation we&rsquo;re making as regulators here. These won&rsquo;t merely be prototypes or experiments. Our aim is to design the sandbox so that sandbox entrants and the digital securities in it are used in broadly the same way as in the conventional financial system.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-17" id="footnote-ref-17"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[17]</a></sup>&nbsp;So this is a really exciting opportunity for market participants and regulators to gain practical insights into the potential benefits of new technologies, while placing limits on activity to enable that innovation to take place safely.</p>
<p>The sandbox will last for five years, during which time the Bank of England, FCA and HM Treasury intend to learn from firms&rsquo; activity and, subject to that, to create a new permanent regulatory regime for the trading and settlement of digital securities. The government has the tools to put that in place reasonably quickly. In that sense, the sandbox ought not be a &lsquo;bridge to nowhere&rsquo;, but rather a means to test and then embed durable and safe innovation.</p>
<h4>Payments</h4>
<p>As securities are transferred from buyers to sellers, so money needs to be transferred the other way. Our starting point here is that there are clear benefits to financial stability from settling wholesale transactions in central bank money. It is the ultimate risk-free asset and safest form of money in the economy, and it enables an unequivocal discharge of obligations between parties.</p>
<p>Of course, some wholesale transactions settle in commercial bank money today.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-18" id="footnote-ref-18"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[18]</a></sup>&nbsp;And commercial bank money is a much safer asset than it was at the time of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), thanks to reforms to bank regulation and central bank liquidity insurance, as well as the establishment of resolution regimes.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk163473488"></a>That said, there is a tail risk from too much wholesale settlement taking place in privately issued money. Banks holding money with each other in order to settle payments creates interconnectedness &ndash; and this could amplify a banking stress, as banks pull wholesale deposits from each other, leading to wider deleveraging and losses (dynamics that were clearly at play during the GFC). Moreover, a payment system settling in commercial bank money would struggle quickly to switch to central bank money in a banking stress, impairing the economic activity being conducted through it.</p>
<p>Settlement of wholesale transactions in central bank money on the other hand can be an anchor of confidence and stability in a stress. We have a low risk appetite at the Bank of England for a significant shift away from settlement in central bank money towards private settlement assets. And so, as the technology for trading, payments and securities settlement evolves, we need to ensure our wholesale payments infrastructure keeps pace.</p>
<p>We have already made significant headway in renewing the UK&rsquo;s RTGS system. It now operates using global messaging standards, to enable more automatic processing of payments domestically and cross-border. Later this year, it will transition to a more resilient and capable core settlement engine (including with capability to move to near 24/7 operation in future). And we are reviewing how best to expand further the number of financial institutions with direct access to RTGS.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-19" id="footnote-ref-19"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>At the moment, the tokenised securities transactions in the Digital Securities Sandbox would not be able to settle in central bank money. Rather, they would have to use privately issued settlement assets, such as tokenised bank deposits. We are therefore increasingly focused on how best our wholesale infrastructure should evolve to support the settlement of tokenised transactions, to ensure the continued role of central bank money in wholesale payments.</p>
<p>Already, we have established a new &lsquo;omnibus&rsquo; account in the current RTGS system to allow private sector payment systems using DLT to offer settlement in a tokenised representation of central bank money.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-20" id="footnote-ref-20"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[20]</a></sup>&nbsp;Indeed, the first such payment system entered its initial phase of operations at the end of last year under limits from the Bank of England. Returning to my trains/rails framing,&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk163823244"></a>such a solution in effect allows the private sector to offer a train with the safety of central bank money, travelling on privately operated payment rails using the latest DLT technology &ndash; even though the underlying central bank money continues to employ a traditional centralised ledger.</p>
<p>More broadly, the Bank of England is exploring with the industry the benefits of extending the renewed RTGS system in future to offer synchronised settlement in a variety of assets, by linking the traditional centralised RTGS ledger to other ledgers, including those using DLT.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-21" id="footnote-ref-21"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>Money could move on our RTGS system at the same time as tokenised securities move in financial market transactions. Or money in RTGS could move at the same time as money on another central bank&rsquo;s distributed ledger in foreign exchange transactions. Such &lsquo;atomic settlement&rsquo;, with the simultaneous movement of money and assets on different ledgers, can effectively extend Delivery versus Payment or Payment versus Payment to a greater range of use cases.</p>
<p>Indeed, in a project with the BIS Innovation Hub last year, we explored how such synchronisation might work in practice to enhance housing purchases. Movement of funds in RTGS could automatically take place at the same time as the change in home ownership is recorded on a digitised title deed, meaning less need for costly and risky chains of intermediaries.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-22" id="footnote-ref-22"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[22]</a></sup>&nbsp;(And all this was coordinated by a &lsquo;synchronisation operator&rsquo;, which &ndash; now probably stretching my analogy to breaking point &ndash; is akin to managing the train timetable so that money and assets move on different rails at the same time.)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some other central banks are experimenting with going further, tokenising central bank money themselves on a separate, distributed ledger &ndash; so-called wholesale CBDCs.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-23" id="footnote-ref-23"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[23]</a></sup>&nbsp;The question we are keen to consider is how these different models for central bank infrastructure compare, including whether there are important differences in the payment use cases they can support.</p>
<p>The evolution of wholesale payments will also be relevant to our consideration of a retail CBDC, since both could help support the future uniformity of money in the UK. Today, the equal value of money issued by different banks is supported not only by being able to convert them one-for-one into cash, but also by payments between those banks settling across the books of the central bank, in reserves, through RTGS.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-24" id="footnote-ref-24"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[24]</a></sup>&nbsp;Similarly, as the technology underlying privately issued money evolves (whether through tokenised bank deposits or regulated stablecoins), this uniformity of money could potentially be bolstered not just by retail CBDC, but also by enhancing the Bank of England&rsquo;s wholesale payments infrastructure so that it can continue to play its key role in supporting settlement between these new forms of private money.</p>
<h3>Payments innovation by banks</h3>
<p>I want to finish on what the coming wave of technology innovation in payments means for commercial bank deposits &ndash; which of course support the vast majority of retail payments in the UK at present.</p>
<p>As Andrew Bailey said in his call to action at Mansion House last year, we don&rsquo;t want the central bank to be left as the only game in town when it comes to payments innovation.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-25" id="footnote-ref-25"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[25]</a></sup>&nbsp;In addition to our exploratory work on retail CBDC and our proposed regime for regulated stablecoins, we want to encourage more thinking and, crucially, action by banks in payments innovation. That needs to cover trains and rails &ndash; both how tokenisation might be applied to bank deposits to enhance their functionality across the full range of retail payments use cases, and what interbank payment rails would be needed to support this.</p>
<p>I am firmly of the view that the technology revolution will hit &ndash; indeed, is hitting &ndash; finance in the way that it has hit other sectors of the economy. It strikes me that, for banks (as the incumbents), payments innovation is both a first-tier opportunity (given the potential benefits for them and their customers of additional payments functionality) and a first-tier threat (given the risk of disintermediation by new players). That in my view demands urgent action.</p>
<p>For the Bank of England&rsquo;s part, we&rsquo;ll support this both as a regulator by setting out clear expectations<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-26" id="footnote-ref-26"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[26]</a></sup>, and as a provider of the wholesale infrastructure via which interbank payments ultimately settle. On the latter, we are experimenting with six other central banks, the Bank for International Settlements and the private sector on &lsquo;Project Agor&aacute;&rsquo;, which will explore how tokenised commercial bank deposits could be integrated with tokenised wholesale central bank money to enhance payments efficiency and functionality, including cross-border.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-27" id="footnote-ref-27"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>To pause for a moment on this international dimension before I conclude, central banks all around the world are facing questions similar to those I&rsquo;ve set out today. Projects like Agor&aacute; will help us pool our resources in tackling them. But importantly, they will also help ensure we tackle them in a way that is coherent, helps reduce rather than add to frictions in cross-border payments, and importantly (and definitely a subject for a speech on another day) helps us understand the implications for the international monetary system should digital money lead to more frictionless cross-border money holdings and payment flows.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-28" id="footnote-ref-28"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[28]</a></sup></p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>New technologies offer the prospect of enhanced retail and wholesale payments functionality in the UK. Our immediate focus at the Bank of England following Facebook&rsquo;s Libra announcement in 2019 has rightly been on establishing regulatory regimes for stablecoins to be used safely for retail payments, and on considering whether a retail CBDC might be needed in future.</p>
<p>But we are increasingly complementing that work with a focus on how we can best support innovation both in wholesale payments and financial markets (including through modernisation of the Bank of England&rsquo;s wholesale payments infrastructure) and in banks&rsquo; retail payments offerings. To do that will require input and close collaboration from the private sector, and so we are planning to set out our thinking in these areas in a Discussion Paper this summer.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-29" id="footnote-ref-29"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[29]</a></sup>&nbsp;We look forward to harnessing the expertise and creativity of the people in this room as we do so.</p>

<p>This is due to a range of reasons, including some firms not having access to the central bank balance sheet or having cost-effective arrangements with private settlement banks. That said, the barriers to entry for direct access to the UK wholesale payment system CHAPS (such as the cost of technical infrastructure required) has reduced in recent years and, we expect, will continue to decrease.

<div> Geopolitical tensions, market capitalization, 2024 Q1 performance, CME Group, Nairobi Securities Exchange <br />
Summary: Market volatility due to geopolitical tensions. CME's dominance challenged. Nairobi Exchange top performer, B3 SA worst, overall increase in Q1 performance. <div>
<p>In the first quarter of 2024, markets were attuned to the balance between decreasing macroeconomic risks and escalating geopolitical tensions. These opposing forces could lead to sharp reversals, heightened volatility, and market dislocation. A retreat in market sentiment could occur as these dynamics unfold.</p>
<p>The FTSE Mondo Visione Exchanges Index closed at 73,589.92 points at the end of March, marking a 0.1% decrease from its February 2024 value of 73,691.53.</p>
<p>The top 5 exchanges by market capitalisation at the end of March were:</p>

<p>Herbie Skeete, Managing Director of Mondo Visione and Co-founder of the Index said: "CME Group has long been recognised as a powerhouse in the global exchange arena. However, signs of vulnerability are beginning to show in its once unassailable dominance. The CFTC approved a proposal in January that permits the trading of U.S. Treasury and SOFR futures on FMX, a platform owned by Howard Lutnick's BGC Group. This move signals BGC's emergence as a potential challenger to CME. However, immediate competition remains between ICE and CME, which are fiercely battling to become the largest exchange through market capitalisation. Currently, ICE appears to have the upper hand, thanks to a surge in its energy complex, a bullish outlook in its fixed-income business, and a series of client acquisitions in the mortgage sector."</p>
<p>In March, the Nairobi Securities Exchange saw the highest capital returns in U.S. dollars, with a 26.5% increase in share price. Saudi Tadawul Group came in second with a 12.7% increase, followed by Nasdaq with a 12.3% increase.</p>

<div> CEO, secondment, retirement, leadership, transformation
<br />
Greg Yanco appointed Interim CEO, Warren Day joins CDPP, Tim Mullaly retires, new executive director roles, ongoing transformation.
<br /><br />Summary:
Warren Day joins CDPP, Tim Mullaly retires. Greg Yanco appointed Interim CEO. New executive director roles, ongoing transformation of ASIC. <div>
<p>The Australian Securities and Investments Commission today confirmed a number of changes to its senior executive leadership team.</p>
<h4>Chief Executive Officer</h4>
<p>ASIC Chair Joe Longo has accepted a request from the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions for ASIC CEO Warren Day to join the CDPP on secondment as the Director&rsquo;s Executive Officer, effective 1 June 2024.</p>
<p>The Chair said the request recognised the contribution Mr Day had made to ASIC as CEO, in particular supporting its organisational transformation since 2021.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Warren has been a significant contributor to ASIC for more than 20 years across virtually every part of ASIC&rsquo;s remit. This is an opportunity for him to bring the skills and experience he has gained at ASIC to an agency we have a shared interest in supporting and seeing succeed,&rdquo; Mr Longo said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since I embarked on the review of ASIC&rsquo;s infrastructure and operations on my first day as ASIC Chair, Warren has played a significant leadership role, particularly with leading the organisational redesign, the delivery of our strategic and enforcement priorities, and the management of ASIC&rsquo;s Executive Leadership Team.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Warren leaves with our full support and his appointment underpins the critical institutional relationship ASIC holds with the CDPP, which is core to our enforcement work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the CDPP secondment, Mr Day has indicated he will not return to ASIC.</p>
<p>The ASIC Chair said Mr Day&rsquo;s secondment to the CDPP came as ASIC enters the next phase of its transformation.</p>
<h4>Regulation and Supervision  &nbsp;</h4>
<p>Executive Director of Regulation and Supervision Greg Yanco will be appointed as ASIC&rsquo;s Interim CEO effective 1 June 2024. Mr Yanco was previously Executive Director Markets between January 2019 and June 2023 before commencing in his current role. He has more than 30 years of experience in financial market development, regulation, and supervision.</p>
<p>Mr Yanco has informed the Commission that he expects to retire in mid-2025. A local and global search for a permanent CEO will commence in early 2025.</p>
<h4>Enforcement and Compliance</h4>
<p>Following more than 25 years of service to ASIC, Executive Director of Enforcement and Compliance Tim Mullaly has also advised that he will be retiring from ASIC at the end of July 2024.</p>
<p>Mr Mullaly has held executive roles at ASIC for the last 12 years, leading the Financial Services Enforcement team for 11 years and, for the last year, Enforcement and Compliance (E&amp;C) team. In this role and as a member of ASIC's Executive Leadership team, Mr Mullaly was critical to implementing the new E&amp;C structure, overseeing a team of 450 staff focused on delivery of enforcement and compliance outcomes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tim has for many years played a crucial role in ensuring that ASIC has maintained a strong and strategic pipeline of enforcement work. ASIC is in court every day, and we are launching new investigations every second day of the week, all aligned to the priorities we have set out,&rdquo; Mr Longo said.</p>
<p>Local and global searches for the Executive Director Regulation and Supervision and Executive Director Enforcement and Compliance roles will commence shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Filling these positions is an opportunity for executive renewal and ASIC&rsquo;s ongoing transformation towards being a modern, ambitious and confident regulator. As the ongoing impact of our work continues to be realised, we also have opportunities for exceptional leaders to drive the next phase of ASIC&rsquo;s transformation,&rdquo; Mr Longo said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to thank Warren and Tim for their significant contribution to ASIC over many years and thank Greg for stepping into the Interim CEO role.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Background  &nbsp;</h4>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s executive leadership team is also being strengthened with the addition of a new Executive Director role for Registry and Intelligence &ndash; following the transition of Registry services back to ASIC from the ATO &ndash; as well as a Chief People and Culture Transformation Officer. ASIC also recently appointed Joanne Harper as Executive Director for Data, Digital and Technology.</p>

<div> Delisting, TMX Group, Debentures, TSX, OTC
Summary:<br /><br />TMX Group delists Series D, E, and F Debentures from TSX, citing limited trading and OTC market liquidity. New series continues trading OTC. <div>
<p class="sizeable">&nbsp;TMX Group Limited (TMX Group or the Company) today announced that its board of directors and Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) have approved the voluntary delisting of the Company's non-convertible Series D, E and F Debentures from TSX. In making the decision to delist, the Company considered, among other things, the fact that secondary market trading in Canadian non-convertible corporate bonds occurs predominantly via over-the-counter markets (OTC), and this decision allows our fixed income investors access to the deepest pool of liquidity. The total value of the Canadian corporate bond market is estimated at approximately $527 billion, according to the FTSE Canada Corporate Bond Index. Originally listed in July 2021, TMX Group's Series D, E and F Debentures have traded less than $20 million in aggregate on TSX, through the end of February 2024.</p>
<p class="sizeable">TMX Group intends to delist these debentures on or about April 26, 2024, and following delisting, they can continue to trade on the OTC markets. Neither the TSX nor the terms of the trust indenture under which these debentures were issued require the Company to obtain approval from debenture holders prior to delisting them from TSX.</p>
<p class="sizeable">The delisting impacts the following TMX Group debentures:</p>
<ul class="sizeable">
<li>Series D (TSX: X.DB.A): $300 million aggregate principal amount of 2.997% Series D Senior Unsecured Debentures due December 11, 2024;</li>
<li>Series E (TSX: X.DB.B): $200 million aggregate principal amount of 3.779% Series E Senior Unsecured Debentures due June 5, 2028; and</li>
<li>Series F (TSX: X.DB.C): $250 million aggregate principal amount of 2.016% Series F Senior Unsecured Debentures due February 12, 2031.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="sizeable">TMX Group series G, H and I debentures, issued in February 2024, are not listed on TSX and continue to trade OTC.</p>
<p class="sizeable">This news release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the TMX Group Debentures or any other securities of TMX Group in any jurisdiction, and is not an offer for sale within the United States of any securities of TMX Group. Securities of TMX Group, including any debt securities, may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration under U.S. securities laws or unless exempt from registration under such laws.</p>

<title>UK And U.S. To Clamp Down Harder On The Trade Of Russian Metals</title>

<div> London Metal Exchange, Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Russian metal exports, UK, US

Summary:
The UK and US ban Russian metal exports, including aluminium, copper, and nickel, from the London Metal Exchange and Chicago Mercantile Exchange. This action aims to reduce revenue for the Kremlin and support Ukraine. Sanctions Minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan and Minister for Trade Policy Greg Hands provided statements regarding this action. There are no restrictions on acquiring existing stockpiles of Russian metals on the exchange. This action does not cover titanium or platinum group metals. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<ul>
<li>Russian metal producers blocked from profits from the London Metal Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, reducing a crucial source of revenue for the Kremlin.</li>
<li>Joint UK and U.S. action builds on ban of metal imports, targeting $40 billion of Russian exports of aluminium, copper and nickel.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The UK and the U.S. have together announced joint action to clamp down harder on prohibited Russian metal exports, by today bringing the world&rsquo;s two largest metal exchanges into the scope of the existing bans.</p>
<p>The London Metal Exchange (LME) and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) will no longer trade new aluminium, copper and nickel produced by Russia. Metals are Russia&rsquo;s largest export commodity after energy, though their value has been decreasing since Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine. In 2022 they were $25 billion, dropping to $15 billion in 2023 due to the efforts of the G7 and allies to curtail the market. Today&rsquo;s action will go further to constrain Russia&rsquo;s ability to make money from its shrinking metals exports, dealing another blow&nbsp;to President Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s funding for his illegal war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Jeremy Hunt, Chancellor of the Exchequer, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="last-child">Disabling Putin&rsquo;s capacity to wage his illegal war in Ukraine is better achieved when we act alongside our allies. Thanks to Britain&rsquo;s leadership in this area, our decisive action with the U.S. to jointly ban Russian metals from the two largest exchanges will prevent the Kremlin funnelling more cash into its war machine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Janet L. Yellen, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our new prohibitions on key metals, in coordination with our partners in the United Kingdom, will continue to target the revenue Russia can earn to continue its brutal war against Ukraine.</p>
<p class="last-child">By taking this action in a targeted and responsible manner, we will reduce Russia&rsquo;s earnings while protecting our partners and allies from unwanted spillover effects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Prime Minister first announced the intention to act on banning Russian metals in May 2023. UK legislation to directly ban imports of Russian metals, including aluminium, copper and nickel was introduced in December. Separately, the U.S. put in place tariffs on various Russian metal imports.</p>
<p>Together, the UK and the U.S. have today gone one step further and brought both metal exchanges into the scope of these measures &ndash; reinforcing a shared commitment to constrain Russia and support Ukraine. This follows a dialogue between the two countries to maximise the impact of the policy, which is a technically complex measure requiring time to work through the details to ensure its effectiveness and minimise the risk of market disruption.</p>
<p>Metal exchanges provide a central role in facilitating the trading of industrial metals around the globe. The London Metal Exchange and Chicago Mercantile Exchange both have warehouses all over the world. Together, they are the world&rsquo;s two largest metal exchanges and set global benchmark prices for the trade of base metals.</p>
<p>Both the UK and U.S. measures will exempt the existing stock of Russian metal on these global exchanges so they can still be traded and withdrawn. This is to minimise the risk to market stability.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s announcement to strengthen the UK&rsquo;s existing ban on Russian metals builds on ongoing work to support Ukraine. Since Putin&rsquo;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the UK has introduced the largest and most severe package of sanctions ever imposed on any major economy. Over 2,000 individuals and entities have now been sanctioned, and it is estimated that without sanctions, Russia would have over $400 billion more to fund its war &ndash; which could be enough to do so for an additional four years. The UK has also provided almost &pound;12 billion in military, humanitarian and economic support to Ukraine and has often been the&nbsp;first mover&nbsp;on vital lethal aid.</p>
<p>Sanctions Minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today&rsquo;s action ratches up economic pressure on Putin, further depriving him of the key resources and revenue streams he needs to fund his illegal war in Ukraine.</p>
<p class="last-child">We have now imposed extensive trade sanctions on Russian-origin oil, gas, gold, diamonds, iron, steel, and base metals, dealing a heavy blow to Putin&rsquo;s war economy. But we must continue to work with our allies to further tighten the screws on the Kremlin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Minister for Trade Policy Greg Hands said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The UK has already imposed the most severe package of bans that we&rsquo;ve ever seen on a major economy, including on Russian metals which is Russia&rsquo;s largest export commodity after oil and gas.</p>
<p class="last-child">Now, we&rsquo;re going even further. By strengthening our sanctions on Russian metals, alongside the U.S., we will reduce Russian revenue which it uses to fund Putin&rsquo;s war machine.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="further-information">Further information</h4>
<ul>
<li>There are no restrictions on acquiring existing stockpiles of Russian metals already on exchange, in order to prevent disruption to markets.</li>
<li>This action does not cover titanium or platinum group metals, such as platinum and palladium, which were not included in the UK&rsquo;s prohibition in December due to supply chain sensitivities.</li>

<div> FinCEN, AML/CFT, investment advisers, suspicious activity reports, regulatory gap
Summary: FinCEN proposes AML/CFT regulations for investment advisers, lacking solid evidence of illicit activity, and potentially imposing heavy costs. <br /><br /> <div>
<h4>Re: FINCEN&ndash;2024&ndash;0006 and RIN 1506&ndash;AB58; Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the &nbsp;&nbsp;Financing of Terrorism Program and Suspicious Activity Report Filing Requirements for Registered Investment Advisers and Exempt Reporting Advisers.</h4>
<p>Dear Director Gacki:</p>
<p>The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Treasury bureau responsible for administering the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), once more has proposed to subject certain investment advisers to a range of anti-money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regulations.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-fincen-04122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp; Eight and a half years have gone by since FinCEN&rsquo;s last proposal, so one would assume that the case for revisiting this initiative after so many years would be strong.&nbsp; Because it is not, I submit this comment in opposition to this proposal.</p>
<p>None of the justifications offered in support of this latest proposal is convincing or compelling. One concern is that registered investment advisers (RIAs) and exempt reporting advisers (ERAs) are an entry point for financial criminals and/or hostile state actors because they lack minimum standards for AML/CFT programs and need not report suspicious activity to FinCEN.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-fincen-04122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp; In a vacuum, this concern might hold water, but broker-dealers, mutual funds, futures commission merchants, and banks are all subject to the full panoply of BSA requirements.&nbsp; It is hard to conceive of an adviser-related activity that would not fall within the regulatory ambit of some or all of those covered financial institutions.&nbsp; The regulatory gap described, therefore, is more optical than substantive; closing it amounts to little more than grade-grubbing.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-fincen-04122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>The Proposal is thin on actual examples of RIAs serving as gateways to illicit activity.&nbsp; If the identified gap is really a problem, after so many years we should have a wide array of examples of how advisers were used by financial criminals. &nbsp;Instead, the threat unregulated RIAs pose to our national security and financial system seems to be largely notional. &nbsp;For example, a 2024 Treasury analysis cited in support of imposing BSA obligations on RIAs and ERAs, indicates that &ldquo;15.4 percent of RIAs and ERAs were associated with or referenced in at least one [Suspicious Activity Report (SAR)].&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-fincen-04122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, FinCEN explains that &ldquo;the number of SAR filings associated with an RIA or ERA increased by approximately 400 percent between 2013 and 2021&mdash;a disproportionately higher increase than the overall increase in SAR filings, which was approximately 140 percent.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-fincen-04122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp; To be meaningful, however, those numbers need context, which the Proposal lacks. &nbsp;How many reports are actually in question?&nbsp; How many of the number are mentions of an adviser in a SAR narrative?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-fincen-04122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp; Moreover, as the &ldquo;S&rdquo; in S-A-R indicates, what is being reported on these forms is a reporting entity&rsquo;s&nbsp;<i>suspicion</i>&nbsp;that something may be amiss in a transaction; it is not proof and may reflect the filer&rsquo;s self-protective instinct, rather than a real suspicion of any wrongdoing.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-fincen-04122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>The Proposal&rsquo;s specific examples of adviser-related financial crime prove little. &nbsp;One of the leading examples &mdash;a private equity fund being used to launder criminal proceeds&mdash;involved an adviser&nbsp;<i>complicit</i>&nbsp;in the illegal activity.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-fincen-04122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp; The Proposal acknowledges that the adviser was actively engaged in the crime, but still treats this as evidence that, absent these proposed rules, otherwise innocent advisers might accidently facilitate financial crime.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-fincen-04122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In another example, funds stolen from the Malaysian government were used to acquire a minority interest in a US private equity firm.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-fincen-04122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp; The funds &ldquo;were moved through multiple accounts owned by different entities on or about the same day&rdquo; to conceal their origin.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-fincen-04122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Proposal accurately describes the transfers as &ldquo;unnecessarily complex [] with no apparent business purpose,&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-fincen-04122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;and argues that the way to prevent certain advisers from being used as conduits for dirty money in such circumstances is to require them to &ldquo;determine the source of wealth and purpose for a customer.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-fincen-04122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp; FinCEN oversells the necessity of the proposed rules by downplaying that these malefactors were caught, perhaps because of the existing BSA rules for banks.&nbsp; Accordingly, before it adds yet another level of redundancy to the already multi-layered AML/CFT regulatory regime, FinCEN must do more than contend that the lack of omniscience equates to unacceptable vulnerability.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-fincen-04122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proposed rules would impose yet more costs on RIAs already staggering under the weight of two years of SEC regulatory excesses, along with new mandates from other regulators.&nbsp; I am particularly worried about how these new rules could affect smaller advisers, especially with a wholly unreasonable proposed compliance date of twelve months.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-fincen-04122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I urge FinCEN to be mindful of the detrimental effect these proposed rules would have on adviser costs&mdash;especially for smaller advisers.&nbsp; If FinCEN decides to move forward with this Proposal, which I urge it not to do, please be open to commenter suggestions on how to reduce the scope of the rules to reflect actual, demonstrable risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Hester M. Peirce<br />Commissioner</p>

<title>IMF Executive Board Selects Kristalina Georgieva To Serve A Second Term As Managing Director</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today selected Kristalina Georgieva to serve as IMF Managing Director for a second five-year term starting on October 1, 2024. The Board&rsquo;s decision was taken by consensus.</p>
<p>In line with the selection process it had established on March 13, 2024 (<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2024/03/13/pr2386-imf-exec-board-initiates-selection-process-next-md">See Press Release No. 24/86</a>), the Board held several discussions, including with Ms. Georgieva,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2024/04/04/pr24106-imf-executive-board-statement-managing-directors-selection-process">the sole candidate nominated for the position</a>, before making its decision today. Following today&rsquo;s meeting, the Coordinators of the Executive Board, Mr. Afonso S. Bevilaqua and Mr. Abdullah F. BinZarah, made the following statement:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In taking this decision, the Board commended Ms. Georgieva&rsquo;s strong and agile leadership during her term, navigating a series of major global shocks. Ms. Georgieva led the IMF&rsquo;s unprecedented response to these shocks, including the approval of more than $360 billion in new financing since the start of the pandemic for 97 countries, debt service relief to the Fund&rsquo;s poorest, most vulnerable members, and a historic Special Drawing Rights (SDR) allocation equivalent to $650 billion. Under her leadership, the Fund introduced innovative new financing facilities, including the Resilience and Sustainability Facility and the Food Shock Window. It replenished the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust, with the capacity to mobilize concessional loans to its poorest members, and co-created the Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable. It also secured a 50 percent quota increase to bolster the Fund&rsquo;s permanent resources and agreed to add a third Sub-Saharan African chair to the IMF Board.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looking ahead, the&nbsp;Board welcomes Ms. Georgieva&rsquo;s ongoing emphasis on issues of macroeconomic and financial stability, while also ensuring that the Fund continues to adapt and evolve to meet the needs of its entire membership. It recognizes her focus on strengthening the Fund&rsquo;s support to its members through effective policy advice, capacity development and financing. The Board looks forward to continuing to work closely with the Managing Director.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>Ms. Georgieva has served as Managing Director since October 1, 2019&nbsp;<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2019/09/25/pr19351-imf-executive-board-selects-kristalina-georgieva-as-managing-director">(See Press Release No. 19/351)</a>. The Managing Director is the chief of the IMF&rsquo;s operating staff and Chair of the Executive Board. The Managing Director is assisted by four Deputy Managing Directors in overseeing the Fund&rsquo;s operations, which serve its membership through about 3,100 staff.</p>
<p>Ms. Georgieva, a national of Bulgaria, has been the IMF&rsquo;s Managing Director since 2019. Previously she served as Chief Executive Officer of the World Bank from &nbsp;January 2017. From February 1, 2019, to April 8, 2019, she was the Interim President for the World Bank Group. She previously served at the European Commission as Commissioner for International Cooperation, Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response, and as Vice President for Budget and Human Resources. Ms. Georgieva has a Ph.D. in Economic Science and a M.A. in Political Economy and Sociology from the University of National and World Economy in Bulgaria, where she also taught from 1977 to 1991.</p>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/autorit-des-marchs-financiers-announces-standardized-climate-scenario-exercise/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The&nbsp;<span dir="ltr" lang="fr">Autorit&eacute; des march&eacute;s financiers</span>&nbsp;(AMF) today announced a consultation with certain Qu&eacute;bec financial institutions for a targeted Standardized Climate Scenario Exercise&nbsp;(SCSE).</p>
<p>The SCSE will be conducted in collaboration with the&nbsp;<a class="is-external" href="https://www.osfi-bsif.gc.ca/fr" target="_blank">Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions&nbsp;<span class="icon-wrapper external-wrapper typo3-search-exclude"><img class="external" height="10" src="https://lautorite.qc.ca/typo3conf/ext/amf_site_lautorite/Resources/Public/Assets/svg/originals/external.svg" width="10" /></span><span class="visuallyhidden typo3-search-exclude">This link will open in a new window</span></a>&nbsp;(OSFI). The goals of the SCSE are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>increase financial institutions' understanding of their potential exposures to climate-related risks;</li>
<li>build institutions' capacity to conduct climate scenario analysis and risk assessments; and</li>
<li>measure the potential financial exposures to climate-related risks across institutions.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The AMF, jointly with OSFI, is proposing a draft methodology and workbook with instructions, developed using feedback received by the OSFI from a first consultation phase held in the fall of&nbsp;2023. A summary of the consultation feedback can be found in the report&nbsp;<a class="is-external" href="https://www.osfi-bsif.gc.ca/en/consultations/consultation-summaries/what-we-heard-consultations-draft-standardized-climate-scenario-exercise-methodology" target="_blank">What we heard: Consultations on draft Standardized Climate Scenario Exercise Methodology&nbsp;<span class="icon-wrapper external-wrapper typo3-search-exclude"><img class="external" height="10" src="https://lautorite.qc.ca/typo3conf/ext/amf_site_lautorite/Resources/Public/Assets/svg/originals/external.svg" width="10" /></span><span class="visuallyhidden typo3-search-exclude">This link will open in a new window</span></a>.</p>
<p>The AMF-regulated financial institutions participating in the SCSE were selected by applying specific criteria based on their size, degree of exposure to climate-related risks and level of impact on the Qu&eacute;bec financial system. They can submit their comments at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:ScenarioClimatique@lautorite.qc.ca.">ScenarioClimatique@lautorite.qc.ca</a>&nbsp;by June&nbsp;7, 2024.</p>
<p>OSFI and the AMF will hold an information session on May&nbsp;2 at 1:00&nbsp;p.m.&nbsp;(ET). Interested stakeholders can&nbsp;<a class="is-external" href="https://osfibsif.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8x3nbJhGhrtrUI6?Q_Language=EN" target="_blank">register&nbsp;<span class="icon-wrapper external-wrapper typo3-search-exclude"><img class="external" height="10" src="https://lautorite.qc.ca/typo3conf/ext/amf_site_lautorite/Resources/Public/Assets/svg/originals/external.svg" width="10" /></span><span class="visuallyhidden typo3-search-exclude">This link will open in a new window</span></a>&nbsp;by May&nbsp;1 at 12:00&nbsp;p.m.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Financial institutions are exposed to the consequences of climate change. The joint exercise we are launching today with our OSFI colleagues will help institutions be better prepared to manage climate change risks. It will also enable us to take the necessary actions to support financial market stability and the protection of Qu&eacute;bec consumers,&rdquo; said Yves Ouellet, AMF President and CEO.</p>
<p>"The Standardized Climate Scenario Exercise will encourage financial institutions to adopt sound climate risk management practices. We are proud to collaborate with our colleagues at the&nbsp;Autorit&eacute; des march&eacute;s financiers. Expanding this exercise across Canadian supervisory jurisdictions will create a stronger financial system for all Canadians," added Peter Routledge, OSFI Superintendent of Financial Institutions.</p>
<h4>Additional information</h4>
<ul>
<li>The AMF and OSFI will only receive comments from the respective financial institutions they regulate.</li>
<li>Participating Qu&eacute;bec financial institutions can begin work on the sections of the methodology and instructions that are considered final:    
<ul>
<li>industry and regional sector classification for transition risks</li>
<li>geocoding and regional scope for physical risks.</li>
</ul>

<title>Pourquoi Pas? Securities Regulation And The American Dream: Remarks Before The Association Of Private Enterprise Education, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, Washington D.C., April 8, 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/pourquoi-pas-securities-regulation-and-the-american-dream-remarks-before-the-a/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/pourquoi-pas-securities-regulation-and-the-american-dream-remarks-before-the-a/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Will [Luther]. It is such a pleasure to be here this morning. I have a number of disclaimers. My first disclaimer is that I am not an economist, and this is not an academic presentation. Second, the views I express are my own as a Commissioner and not necessarily those of the Securities and Exchange Commission (&ldquo;SEC&rdquo; or &ldquo;Commission&rdquo;) or my fellow Commissioners. My third disclaimer is that my high-school French is very rusty. Members of the Acad&eacute;mie Fran&ccedil;aise might want to tune out.</p>
<p>On a trip to France last summer, I had a fascinating conversation with a ride share driver. He spoke admiringly of the United States as the land of opportunity and freedom. In the U.S., he explained, the question you get when you want to try something new is &ldquo;Pourquoi Pas,&rdquo; &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; By contrast, in many other countries, the question posed to the person trying to do something new is &ldquo;Pourquoi?,&rdquo; &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; One system encourages you to strive; the other challenges you for even wanting to do such a thing. One system admires people who try something new, even if they fail. The other punishes people for daring to be different, even if they succeed. When people want to do something new or different, the American spirit is inclined to respond with a laissez-faire &ldquo;why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The driver&rsquo;s enthusiasm for the American system&mdash;one in which people are able to stand out from the crowd, take risks, bring ideas to the market, benefit from their own labor and ingenuity, and, yes, to fail and try again&mdash;inspired me to consider how the SEC can support the free spirit of the country whose capital markets it regulates. How can we contribute to the legal framework that makes the United States the place about which so many people, including my French raconteur, dream?</p>
<p>Regulators help define a country&rsquo;s openness to new endeavors, new competitors, and new ideas. The SEC is only one of many regulators, but, because of the critical markets we regulate, we play an important role in determining how open this country is. The SEC establishes the ground rules for the capital markets that form the basis of the American economy, which in turn supports a healthy, prosperous, welcoming society. Effective securities regulation clears the pathways that allow people to access our markets by, for example, promoting transparency, protecting from fraud, manipulation, and other misconduct, and overseeing intermediaries who handle other people&rsquo;s money. Regulation that does these things naturally creates space for individuals and companies to develop new ideas and new business models, on which investors and customers can then pass judgment. This kind of regulation creates an environment in which investable capital meets people&rsquo;s plans for building new businesses or expanding existing ones. Not only do the particular businesses raising funds benefit, but their shareholders, customers, communities, and employees share in those the benefits too. Sensible regulation can encourage people to build and expand businesses and to invest in other people&rsquo;s companies. Careless regulation, by contrast, can drive businesses away, squelch entrepreneurs&rsquo; dreams, and make investors skittish about committing their capital.</p>
<p>Getting regulation right requires establishing and enforcing clear ground rules within which people have broad latitude to make decisions for themselves. The clear ground rules give people the confidence to participate in the marketplace; they can trust that other market participants generally are acting in good faith because there is an effective outside disciplining mechanism. A good regulatory framework affords latitude to individual decision-makers and thereby ensures that the markets are responsive to people&rsquo;s actual needs, rather than to regulators&rsquo; perceptions about what people need.</p>
<p>Securities regulation in the United States generally falls in the sensible regulation column. The United States has long been the place where the most interesting and dynamic companies in the world are born and where free-thinking iconoclasts bring their great ideas to life and build their lives. It also is the place where people from all over the world choose to invest their money. In a room full of economists, I dare not give securities regulation full credit for the magnetism of the United States&mdash;economists have disagreed on how much credit is due.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;I am comfortable saying that the American securities regulatory framework has helped to create the environment within which businesses and investors thrive. That said, there is still room for improvement. I want to walk you through why I believe our securities regulatory framework is fundamentally sound, why it is trending in the wrong direction, and what we can do to turn it back in the right direction.</p>
<p>When prudently pursued, the SEC&rsquo;s mission&mdash;protecting investors, facilitating capital formation, and maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets&mdash;helps to cultivate a healthy environment for investing and raising capital. We achieve this mission by carrying out the mandates set forth in several statutes,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;which give us responsibility for regulating companies selling securities, investors, stock exchanges, broker-dealers, investment advisers, mutual funds, and other participants in the equities, options, bond, and security-based swap markets.</p>
<p>These statutes give the SEC more prescriptive power over the markets and market participants than I would prefer, but Congress did not set up the SEC as the ultimate gatekeeper to the markets either. For example, a company seeking to raise money does not need to get the SEC&rsquo;s sign-off that it is a good company before selling its shares in the public markets. The company needs only make truthful disclosures necessary for investors to decide whether it is a company in which&nbsp;<i>they</i>&nbsp;want to invest. Similarly, the SEC does not have the authority to test would-be investment advisers on their capability in managing money. Instead, advisers registering with us have to make disclosures about who they are and what they do so that investors can decide whether they want these advisers to manage their money. Mutual funds marketed to the public have great leeway in the type and mix of assets they hold and the strategies they use, as long as fund disclosures accurately reflect them. Credit rating agencies have to disclose what methodologies they use, but the SEC cannot regulate those methodologies. Generally, Congress did not design the SEC to be a merit regulator, and the resulting flexibility for market participants is an important contributor to create the dynamic market environment where entrepreneurs thrive.</p>
<p>Even though Congress did not set the SEC up to be a merit regulator, the securities laws are not hands-off the markets either. Legislation in 1975, for example, gave the SEC authority to &ldquo;facilitate the establishment of a national market system,&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;a directive that puzzles me since markets tend to establish themselves organically without a government facilitator. The securities laws also require market infrastructure providers, such as exchanges and clearinghouses, to go through a Commission approval process when they begin operations and whenever they change their rules. Substantive provisions govern mutual fund structure and operations. Broker-dealers generally must be members of a self-regulatory organization. Statutory provisions govern the proxy process, tender offers, and the process for obtaining shareholder input on executive compensation. Congress prohibited certain transactions by investment advisers. In many other instances, the securities statutes prescribe or proscribe specific conduct. Importantly, however, even where there are statutory prescriptions, Congress often provided the SEC the ability to make exceptions to them and to condition those exceptions as appropriate. This escape hatch and tailoring feature of the securities laws is another important tool to achieve sensible regulation.</p>
<p>The statutory background is only one factor in determining the quality of our regulation. The SEC adopts regulations to implement its statutory mandates, and it administers, interprets, and enforces the securities laws. How the SEC carries out these functions is very relevant to the question of whether securities regulation cultivates or suppresses the American spirit that celebrates freedom of enterprise, initiative, and thought.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s record on this score was better in the past than it is now. Over its ninety-year history, the SEC has enacted many regulations to implement statutory mandates. Those regulations generally have been principles-based. For example, much of the rulebook governing public company disclosures has embodied an approach that directs companies to provide investors a window into the company through the eyes of management, rather than ticking through a prescriptive checklist of items for disclosure. This framework accommodates all sorts of companies of all sizes in all sorts of industries. Likewise, the SEC&rsquo;s regulation of investment advisers, consistent with the statute&rsquo;s grounding in fiduciary duty, largely avoided prescriptions.</p>
<p>In this century, however, the Commission&rsquo;s regulatory approach has turned increasingly prescriptive as we expand the rulebook at a record-breaking clip. Some of these prescriptions are statutory, but many are a product of the SEC&rsquo;s discretion. Public companies are subject to an ever-growing list of disclosure rules. Some mandates seem designed to change the way companies operate, rather than to elicit material disclosures. In the past year, for example, we have adopted rules requiring certain companies to make extensive cyber and climate disclosures. Investment advisers, too, have seen their regulatory regime become more prescriptive, including most recently a new set of rules directed at reshaping the relationship between hedge fund advisers and investors. Additional proposals would micro-manage investment advisers&rsquo; interactions with their custodians and other service providers. Prescriptive rulemaking is not limited to public companies and investment advisers. Broker-dealers also face proposed prescriptions, including a new rule proposal that would govern how they execute trades. These types of regulations, particularly when they are not scaled for small entities, often act as barriers to entry into the securities industry. Moreover, the complexity discourages innovation since fitting new products, processes, or technologies into a thicket of complex and inflexible rules is challenging.</p>
<p>Not only is our rulebook expanding through new rulemakings, but aggressive interpretations of existing rules and statutes also add to the rulebook. For example, we have used an enforcement action to expand disclosure requirements.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;Recently, we have brought enforcement cases that effectively expand an internal accounting controls rule designed to ensure that financial statements are accurate and reliable when disclosed to investors. Now it also covers issues unrelated to the financial statements, including share repurchases,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;insider trading,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;airline flight routes,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;and workplace harassment.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, Congress gave us broad exemptive authority: when the statutes do not work for an asset class, a product, a transaction, or a type of entity, we can adjust them. We have used this authority to good effect in the past. For example, in the 1990s, the Commission could have forced automated trading venues&mdash;known back then as electronic communications networks&mdash;into the regulatory framework for national securities exchanges.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;Doing this would have subjected them to onerous innovation-deterring requirements, such as having to operate as a self-regulatory organization and to seek Commission review and approval of all their rules. Instead, the Commission clarified the regulatory landscape by clearly stating that these venues did fall within the definition of exchange but simultaneously used its exemptive authority to exempt them from regulation as exchanges so long as they satisfied the disclosure-focused requirements of operating as an alternative trading system, or ATS.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p>We also used our exemptive authority to accommodate a new product in the investment company space&mdash;exchange-traded funds. These variants on traditional mutual funds required exemptions from certain rules. We began issuing exemptive orders with conditions to ensure investor protection, and eventually we crafted a rule specifically for exchange-traded funds. Getting from the first, firm-specific exemptive order to a rule that applied to the whole industry took too long, but the SEC showed a willingness to facilitate the introduction of a new product into the market, a product that has revolutionized the investment portfolios of many Americans.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;After the finalization of the ETF rule, the Commission continued to work with the industry on the introduction of non-transparent ETFs.</p>
<p>Too often these days, we take a different approach&mdash;rather than using our authority to accommodate new products, new technology, and new ways of doing things, we reject them out of hand. We ask questions, not out of curiosity to work through the puzzle of finding a compliant way forward for new products and processes, but as part of a process seemingly designed to grind down those who propose an alternative to the status quo.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate with the SEC&rsquo;s approach to bitcoin exchange-traded products (&ldquo;ETPs&rdquo;). In 2013, the SEC received its first application for a spot bitcoin ETP. More than ten years later, we approved the first such products,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;but only after a federal court effectively forced our hand.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;During this decade of back-and-forth with bitcoin ETP applicants, our nebulous, unprecedented approval standard shifted inexplicably, and would-be ETP sponsors incurred large costs, in the form of time, money, and frustration. In the meantime, investors could not access a product, one that has exhibited record-breaking popularity.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;I personally am agnostic on the merits of these spot bitcoin products, but dragging the sponsors seeking to meet investor demand through a grueling ten-year regulatory obstacle course is not the best approach to investor protection.</p>
<p>More generally with respect to crypto, the Commission has failed to use its exemptive authority to good effect. A tailored registration and disclosure regime for crypto projects could have helped to avoid some of the problems we have seen in the market, but the Commission instead insists the existing disclosure regime works just fine for crypto. Insisting on treating tokens offered by tiny crypto projects as if they are shares in an IPO-ready company is wrong-headed. Attorney Steve Lofchie explains: &ldquo;Crypto firms are not arguing that crypto assets should not be regulated . . . . They are arguing that the SEC regulatory scheme applicable to securities, debt and other ordinary securities that represent ownership in a corporation are ill-suited for crypto.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;Consequently, the Commission can point to a long list of enforcement actions as examples of what not to do, but not to any viable path forward for crypto projects in the United States. We did use our authority to create a time-limited, strictly constrained regime for special purpose broker dealers to custody crypto asset securities, but only one firm has been able to register under this Commission guidance, perhaps because it is so restrictive and unwieldy.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a></p>
<p>I believe the SEC&rsquo;s motives are generally good; the agency wants to create a regulatory framework that brings investors and companies into our markets. Many of my colleagues at the Commission see much of this rulemaking and enforcement activity and withholding of exemptive relief as justified or even required by our mandate to protect investors.</p>
<p>I fear, however, that actions that may seem beneficial to investors in the short-run may harm investors and our capital markets in the long-run. Operating from deeply ingrained aversion to risk, the SEC often focuses its efforts on discouraging people from investing in projects that might fail to pan out, prohibiting firms from pursuing technologies or business models that we do not fully understand, and excluding new firms with which we are not familiar. Whether intentional or inadvertent, we end up persuading companies and market participants with new ideas that our markets are not for them. A disproportionate focus on preventing failures can fence out the upstart, disruptive entrepreneur who lacks an army of lawyers on retainer or rich friends on speed dial. Investor protection can morph into incumbent protection.</p>
<p>We should modulate our regulations to ensure that we are doing our part to keep America open to innovators, entrepreneurs, and upstart competitors. Some basic principles can guide that new regulatory approach. First, foster regulatory predictability so people have the space to make reliable educated assessments of regulatory risk. Second, take a prudent, humble, and iterative approach to regulation that can respond nimbly to innovation and that can identify and correct regulatory missteps. Third, relish the intellectual challenge of dealing with novel legal questions raised by innovative companies and products. Fourth, explore ways in which new technologies can make us a better regulator. You, as academics, can hold us accountable to regulating according to these and other sensible regulatory principles.</p>
<p>First, the Commission should focus on fostering a predictable regulatory framework. Rules need to keep up with changes in the market, but predictability is an essential precondition to a vibrant entrepreneurial culture. Rules may change, but they should do so after adequate time for public discussion about the wisdom of such changes. Only after a sufficiently long compliance period, during which the regulator has worked with the industry on implementation, should the government enforce a rule. This kind of predictability in the rule set gives people the confidence to invest in building a new company, product, or service. If, instead, rules can change on a dime to outlaw previously lawful activities or sometimes to make legal what was once illegal, people will be reluctant to do things that turn on what the law is. Just as a homeowner under threat of eminent domain will not remodel the kitchen in her house, a financial firm will not invest in a new product line that it fears could be taken away by a sudden regulatory change or an enforcement action premised on an unprecedented interpretation of an existing rule. Unlike the homeowner who is bound by geography, the company can roll out that new product line in a jurisdiction where regulation is predictable. Regulatory predictability gives entrepreneurs the confidence to try something new. A would-be entrepreneur in the jurisdiction of a regulator that acts arbitrarily and unpredictably is likely to settle into a conventional profession, which is less likely to attract regulatory attention. My French ride-share chauffeur would have to shelve his dream, or move elsewhere to pursue them.</p>
<p>Some of the SEC&rsquo;s recent crypto cases illustrate the problem that a lack of predictability brings. These cases struck many, including me, as arbitrary. The Commission, for example, recently brought a case against ShapeShift, an online crypto trading platform that had been operational since 2014. As Commissioner Uyeda and I noted in our dissent:</p>
<p>It is entirely unclear how ShapeShift was to discern that the Commission would consider crypto assets generally&mdash;and any crypto asset in particular&mdash;a security in the form of an investment contract. Even now, ten years on, it is hardly more discernible. But perhaps that ambiguity is exactly the result the Commission wants. Now the next person who comes up with an idea for building something to help other people buy or sell crypto will think twice. Why spend time and effort creating something only to face an enforcement action ten years later?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></p>
<p>Similarly, the SEC sued LBRY, a small crypto-project run by an enthusiastic team that had built a functional blockchain on which a video-sharing service operated. LBRY lost a company-crushing lawsuit&mdash;not based on fraud, but on a failure to anticipate how the Commission would apply registration rules designed for traditional equity or debt securities to a completely new genre of business enterprises.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a>&nbsp;The case sends a message to the next aspiring set of entrepreneurs, and it is not a message about America being the land of opportunity. While we are quite predictable now (in the SEC&rsquo;s eyes, just about every crypto asset is a security and just about every person that works with crypto-assets must somehow register), we let an entire industry languish for years in uncertainty as to how it should engage with us and our regulations. As a result, the bold were punished, and the timid never even tried.</p>
<p>Regulatory vacillation was on full display in the adoption of Rule 30e-3 in June 2018 and its quick subsequent rescission.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>&nbsp;Rule 30e-3 allowed certain funds to an optional method to satisfy their obligations to transmit shareholder reports by putting required documents on their websites and sending a paper notice to investors that notified them of the online availability and their right to request a paper version. If existing funds wanted to take advantage of the new rule, they needed to put their investors on notice for&nbsp;<i>two years</i>. Starting on January 1, 2021, funds could rely on the rule. The following year, in October 2022, the SEC adopted a new tailored shareholder reports rule that, along with many good changes, quite controversially prohibited funds from relying on Rule 30e-3.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a>&nbsp;After a multi-year process, funds would now have to spend extensive resources to adopt a completely new process and likely field inquiries from frustrated and confused fund shareholders. Proposing to unwind a rule we had just adopted before that rule was fully implemented is hardly an example of regulatory predictability.</p>
<p>Second, the Commission should exercise prudence and humility when taking regulatory action. Regulatory prudence arises out of serious consideration of the limitations of our knowledge, whether of new technologies or of investor preferences or, simply, of the future. These limitations mean that abrupt, comprehensive changes are unlikely to produce satisfactory results. Accordingly, before proposing new rules, the Commission needs to do the hard work of identifying discrete problems that are susceptible to being addressed through regulation. We need our large team of economists to identify whether the benefits of the proposed solution to those problems are larger than the cost of that solution. We need the public&rsquo;s help too. And when the Commission has done this work and decides to propose new rules, it should do so in an iterative manner. A staggered approach allows the SEC to identify problems in a way that leaves space for the Commission to respond nimbly to continued experimentation, for new entrants to disrupt incumbent firms, and for the Commission to correct regulatory errors without significant market disruption.</p>
<p>Prudence does not describe the Commission&rsquo;s approach to proposing market structure reforms in December 2022. On a single day, the Commission proposed four rules that, if adopted, would bring sweeping changes to our equity markets. These proposals would make changes to how execution quality is reported, to minimum tick sizes for quoting bids and offers and executing orders, to the standards defining &ldquo;best execution,&rdquo; and to the way retail customer orders are required to be handled, including mandating that they generally be sent to a periodic auction.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a>&nbsp;Among other concerns with this approach, the Commission had difficulty pinpointing an actual problem it was trying to solve&mdash;retail investors, after all, are getting better execution quality at lower cost than ever before. Moreover, determining whether these simultaneous sweeping changes actually would improve execution quality for retail investors is difficult. The most controversial component of the proposed set of solutions&mdash;the retail auctions&mdash;would impose uniform, mandatory rules on how these untried auctions must be structured. The proposed prescriptive mandate came just as the Commission was beginning to receive proposals for innovative, voluntary ways of conducting such auctions.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a></p>
<p>A prudent regulator, by contrast, looks to learn from industry experimentation rather than declare a premature end to experimentation by imposing a mandatory framework. Prudence counsels engaging with innovators early and often. We must acknowledge that project funders and employees working on the project cannot wait for commercialization indefinitely. Consequently, large, well-funded firms that can finance the wait have a leg up over smaller firms. The latter, unfettered by a history of doing things the old way and the red tape that is inevitable in large organizations, may be much better at timely spotting problems and quickly developing solutions. We should facilitate small scale experiments early, which can then be expanded, adjusted, or ended depending on the results of those experiments. These experiments can be very instructive in helping us to understand how markets work.</p>
<p>Third, the Commission as an agency needs to embrace and relish the challenge of dealing with the intersection of new technologies and new business models with the financial markets. Determining how to apply a longstanding regulatory framework to 21<span>st</span>-century technologies can present extraordinarily difficult challenges, but developing new rules to advance our three-part mission in the regulation of firms using the latest new technologies is also a difficult task. Although creating and maintaining a nimble approach to financial markets regulation is difficult, the Commission attracts a smart and talented workforce in part with the promise of being able to spend one&rsquo;s workday looking for solutions to hard problems. The Commission should expect and empower its staff to approach these issues creatively.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, the SEC has met inquiries about blockchain technology with a stubborn and decidedly uncreative insistence that existing rules work just fine. We have not worked seriously with people in the industry to figure out how to achieve our regulatory objectives in a way that is tailored to the opportunities and risks of the technology.</p>
<p>Technology does not always require new rules. Sometimes existing rules, paired with some technology-specific guidance, work just fine. One example someone recently pointed out to me was when the Commission, in the mid-to-late 1990s, took an iterative process to respond to the regulatory issues raised by the rise of the internet. It gathered industry feedback on where clarity might help registrants and issued responsive no-action letters<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a>&nbsp;and interpretive releases.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a>&nbsp;To take one instance, in 1995, the Commission issued guidance under various existing Commission statutes on how market participants could use electronic media to deliver information. The Commission &ldquo;appreciate[d] the promise of electronic distribution of information&rdquo; and aimed to &ldquo;encourage continued research and development and use of such media,&rdquo; because this approach could help investors.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a>&nbsp;Accordingly, the Commission never issued sweeping rules that either overregulated the industry or locked in technologies or processes that became obsolete with time.</p>
<p>The Commission faces a similarly disruptive technology today in the form of artificial intelligence, and a similar approach could be appropriate here. Artificial intelligence may transform aspects of many industries, including the financial industry. Rather than attempting to adopt a sweeping new rule to deal once and for all with AI, we may be better off approaching it in a manner similar to how we treated the internet last century. If regulated firms need guidance on how particular AI practices interact with the securities regulatory framework, we should listen carefully without prejudice or hostility and provide timely, meaningful feedback rooted in law.</p>
<p>Fourth, the Commission should embrace, as appropriate, new technologies in its work to enhance our ability to execute our mission and to give our staff the familiarity with these technologies so that they can have fruitful conversations with market participants. Regulatory agencies often find it difficult to keep up with the pace of technological development in the industries that they regulate, which can easily turn them into reactive, suspicious regulators. They are reluctant to engage in frank discussions of the benefits and risks of new technologies, much less to accede to their use by firms they regulate.</p>
<p>AI again provides an opportunity to put this fourth principle to work. To figure out how AI might be useful, we should educate our employees in how the underlying technologies work and how to use AI. Armed with the employees&rsquo; suggestions on how AI might help them do their jobs faster and better, we can then examine whether AI can enhance the work experience and work product of SEC employees. We can look at how it might streamline how the SEC consumes information. Perhaps it could help reduce human error. Perhaps automation of routine tasks, such as reviewing filings by registrants, could free our staff&rsquo;s time to think deeply about thornier disclosure issues and other difficult and urgent legal questions from market participants. Using AI ourselves will sharpen our understanding and thereby make us better able to regulate the technology sensibly.</p>
<p>Importantly, as we put AI and other technologies to use at the SEC, we must avoid the very real temptation to misuse it. Because technology makes it easier to identify violations, it might be tempting to punish every foot fault. That approach to regulating the securities markets misses the forest for the trees. AI also makes it easier to engage in mass surveillance of marketplace activity. Indeed, we are doing that already with our Consolidated Audit Trail, which watches everyone&rsquo;s trading activity. If we are to be regulate consistent with the American spirit, we must restore our commitment to our fellow Americans&rsquo; privacy.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s commitment to these principles of regulation is not alone enough to maintain America&rsquo;s status as the land for people willing to think for themselves and take risks to bring their dreams to life. The SEC and other parts of the government play an important role in creating the right environment, but the dreamers and doers are essential to cultivating the American spirit. To that end, I encouraged our Parisian driver to move to the United States. When he emigrated to France from Algeria, he could have come to America, but had chosen France because of the language. I tried to convey in my French, which was undoubtedly worse than his English, that he already had an American mindset&mdash;a love of freedom, a dislike of conformity (he was not, as he put it, part of the &ldquo;flock&rdquo; of sheep), a passion for hard work, an overflowing well of business ideas, and a determination to see that his son has greater opportunities than he has had. Rolling out the welcome mat for him includes ensuring that our regulatory environment fosters, rather than stifles, the American spirit.</p>
