<div> Securities and Exchange Commission, Small Business Forum, small businesses, investors, capital markets<br>
Summary: SEC Chair Gensler welcomes attendees to the 43rd Annual Small Business Forum, highlighting the importance of small businesses and seeking input for policy recommendations. <div>
<p>Good afternoon. Thank you, Stacey for your introduction. As is customary, I&rsquo;d like to note that my views are my own as Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and I am not speaking on behalf of my fellow Commissioners or the staff.</p>
<p>Stacey Bowers joined us in January as the new director of the Office of the Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation (OASB). We are excited to have her as part of the SEC&rsquo;s team advancing our important work on behalf of small businesses and their investors.</p>
<p>In 1980, Congress directed the SEC to hold an annual Small Business Forum so the Commission could hear directly from small businesses and their investors about the unique issues that they face. Today, I&rsquo;m pleased to welcome you to the SEC&rsquo;s 43rd Annual Forum. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I grew up in a small business household. My grandparents on one side opened and ran a grocery store and on the other side a bar, both in Baltimore. My dad, Sam Gensler, started a small business repairing vending machines. It grew into a small vending machine business that served hundreds of other small businesses in the process, such as small diners and bars.</p>
<p>In this sense, my family&rsquo;s business was part of a larger community of small businesses, whose owners were as diverse as the city of Baltimore.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs and small businesses are integral to our capital markets. In fact, more than 99 percent of U.S. businesses are small, and their employees make up nearly half of the American private sector employees.</p>
<p>From 1995-2021, small businesses created nearly two out of every three new jobs.</p>
<p>At the SEC, our job is to serve investors building for a better future and companies of every size. We are working to make our markets more efficient, competitive, transparent, fair&mdash;and worthy of the public&rsquo;s trust. We work to ensure that markets serve investors and issuers alike&mdash;not the other way around.</p>
<p>At the SEC, we have educational resources to help equip small businesses and investors with the tools to help navigate capital raising. Please check out SEC.gov and Investor.gov.</p>
<p>As you discuss the various topics over the next three days&mdash;from early-stage stories to investing in early-stage companies to accessing the public markets&mdash;please share your ideas and policy recommendations with us. We greatly benefit from your perspective and willingness to engage.</p>
<p>This forum will inform a report that will be delivered to Congress. Further, your perspective may help the Commission consider policies to benefit small businesses, like my dad and grandad&rsquo;s and so many across America.</p>
<p>Thank you, and now turning it back to the rest of the program.</p>

<div> appointed, investors, climate change, engagement, leadership
Summary:<br>CalPERS COO appointed Steering Committee chair of Climate Action 100+ organization, leading engagement with 700 investors to address climate change. Co-founded in 2017. Taking vigorous action on climate. <div>
<p>CalPERS today announced that Chief Operating Investment Officer&nbsp;<a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/page/about/organization/executive-officers/michael-cohen" target="_self">Michael Cohen</a>&nbsp;has been appointed Steering Committee chair of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.climateaction100.org/" target="_blank" title="Opens in new window">Climate Action 100+</a>, a global organization of investors working with the world&rsquo;s largest companies to fight climate change.</p>
<p>Climate Action 100+ represents more than 700 institutional investors engaging companies to improve their climate change governance, cut emissions, and strengthen climate-related financial disclosures.</p>
<p>"Our organization played a pivotal role in creating Climate Action 100+," said CalPERS Chief Executive Officer Marcie Frost. "Michael will be a steady hand for the Steering Committee at a crucial moment, one where our fiduciary duty requires swift and substantive action on climate change to ensure long-term value for our members, their families, and their retirement security."</p>
<p>The Steering Committee sets overall initiative strategy and is currently chaired by Fran&ccedil;ois Humbert of Generali Asset Management. The role rotates every 12 months between different regional representatives on the committee.</p>
<p>"I am honored to be appointed chair of the Steering Committee and eager to help guide the organization through its next phase of investor engagement," said Cohen. "Climate Action 100+ was founded to ensure companies take meaningful steps to address the existential financial threats from climate change. There is still more to do to constructively engage with our corporate partners and build upon early successes."</p>
<p>Since its founding, Climate Action 100+ has engaged 170 companies to address climate change. Those efforts have led to three-quarters of the companies committing to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Almost all the companies have board committee oversight of both climate change risks and opportunities.</p>
<p>CalPERS co-founded Climate Action 100+ in 2017 and served as its inaugural chair.</p>
<p>In addition to its integral role with Climate Action 100+, CalPERS has taken vigorous action on the climate front:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/page/newsroom/calpers-news/2024/calpers-applauds-sec-transparency-climate-disclosure-rule-notes-more-to-be-done" target="_self">supporting</a>&nbsp;the SEC climate disclosure rule,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/page/newsroom/calpers-news/2024/calpers-proxy-voting-global-company-accountability-for-climate-change-board-independence-executive-compensation" target="_self">holding companies accountable</a>&nbsp;for climate-related risk, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/page/newsroom/calpers-news/2023/calpers-announces-100-billion-net-zero-pledge-and-new-climate-accountability-measures" target="_self">developing the Sustainable Investing 2030 Plan</a>&nbsp;to move its portfolio to net zero emissions.</p>

<title>AMPLIFYING VOICES: Opening Remarks At The SEC’s Small Business Forum, Stacey Bowers, Director, Office Of The Advocate For Small Business Capital Formation, Washington D.C., April 16, 2024</title>

<div> SEC, small business, forum, capital raising, entrepreneurs 
Summary:
SEC's 43rd annual Small Business Forum brings together voices of early-stage founders, capital allocators, and small public companies. Emphasis on underrepresented founders, wealth gap, investor role, and policy recommendations. 
<br><br> <div>
<p>Welcome to the SEC&rsquo;s 43rd&nbsp;annual Small Business Forum. I&rsquo;d like to thank all of you for joining us over the course of the next three days to hear the voices of early-stage founders, capital allocators, and small public companies. I am excited to be here as the new Director of the Small Business Advocacy Office and to play a role in this important Commission event that brings together the small business community, the Commissioners, and other government and thought leaders.</p>
<p>Before I say much more, on behalf of myself and my colleagues here at the SEC, I want to make clear that the views expressed today are each speaker&rsquo;s own &mdash; in my case in my capacity as the Director of the Small Business Advocacy Office &mdash; and do not necessarily reflect those of the Commission, any of the Commissioners, or any of our colleagues on the Staff.</p>
<p>While I wish I had put a nickel in my savings every time I heard it, it nonetheless remains true that small businesses and their investors are vital to our economy, no matter their life cycle stage. For instance, did you know that small businesses created over 43% of U.S. GDP last year?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/bowers-remarks-small-business-forum-041624#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Or that women owned or co-owned almost 45% of non-employer small businesses &mdash; that&rsquo;s 11.5 million firms &mdash; and almost 40% of employer small businesses &mdash; another 2.1 million firms.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/bowers-remarks-small-business-forum-041624#_ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;And were you aware that over the last 10 years, diverse businesses have created over 4.7 million jobs?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/bowers-remarks-small-business-forum-041624#_ftn3">[3]</a>&nbsp;How about the fact that small businesses accounted for 54% of employment in rural areas?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/bowers-remarks-small-business-forum-041624#_ftn4">[4]</a>&nbsp;Or that small public companies raised $4.6 billion in registered offerings in 2022?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/bowers-remarks-small-business-forum-041624#_ftn5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Over the course of the next three days, I am excited to hear from leaders who have personal knowledge of the issues facing small businesses and their investors. We will have the chance to learn first-hand from one-on-one conversations with those who have lived the small business experience and survived to tell the tale. We will also engage with panels of individuals from the small business community who will share their insights and take-aways, and you in the audience will have the opportunity to ask them questions.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s focus will be on amplifying the stories of early-stage businesses, including conversations about barriers to entry for underrepresented founders and bridging the wealth gap. Tomorrow, we will open the dialogue with investors on their role as capital allocators and some of the challenges that emerging fund managers face, and we will address broader questions, like private market liquidity. Finally, on day three we will catch up with folks in the small public company space and get insight on initial public offerings, research coverage, and other pertinent topics.</p>
<p>The goal of the SEC&rsquo;s Small Business Forum is to bring together a multitude of voices from the public and private sectors, with different ideas and perspectives on capital raising. Over the course of this year&rsquo;s Forum, we will have the opportunity to listen to insightful remarks from our Commissioners and learn from our presenters, as they share their stories. But we also want to hear from all of you about your experiences, suggestions, and questions. The voices of the small business community provide insight into the journeys that entrepreneurs and investors undertake as they navigate the various capital-raising pathways. These stories can motivate us to think and consider ideas in a different way and appreciate narratives that are distinct from our own.</p>
<p>I suspect that many of you, in our audience, have your own stories to share about capital raising or questions you are pondering. I encourage you to amplify your voice by posting questions and comments in the chat.</p>
<p>In addition to fostering learning and growth through conversation, a goal of the Forum is to provide an opportunity for the public to shape recommendations to the Commission and to Congress regarding policies that affect capital formation for small businesses and their investors. We have already heard from some of you about proposed policy recommendations, but we want to hear from all of you. If you have not yet shared your ideas, there is still time to submit your thoughts through the submission portal or you can email us at smallbusiness@sec.gov. Then, at the end of each day&rsquo;s panel, we will invite you to vote to prioritize the policy recommendations to send to the Commission and Congress.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;ve only been the Director of the Small Business Advocacy Office for three months, I have already had the privilege of engaging with a wide variety of our stakeholders to hear their experiences and perspectives. What an incredible learning opportunity it is to be able to dialogue with so many who play a role in the small business ecosystem. I look forward to continuing my journey as the Director and connecting with many more of you in the months and years to come!</p>
<p>And in this journey, I will be joined by an outstanding team. It is hard to quantify the amount of passion, time, and effort it takes to host this event, and the dedicated team in our Office does so with quiet perseverance. I would like to thank Amy Reischauer and Kim Dinwoodie for leading the charge and the rest of the team for all of their support, including Jennifer Brady, T.J. Collins, Julie Zelman Davis, Pablo Echeverri, Courtney Haseley, Sarah Kenyon, Sheen Munshi, Vikki Porter, Jenny Riegel, Malika Sullivan, Todd Vanlaere, and Tyneise Wilson.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;d like to introduce and welcome Chair Gensler to the Small Business Forum to share his insights and perspectives.</p>

<title>ISDA Statement On BOI’s TELBOR Announcement</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> ISDA, Bank of Israel, TELBOR, derivatives, fallbacks
Summary:<br>ISDA responds to Bank of Israel's TELBOR cessation, activating fallbacks for affected derivatives contracts, with guidance for different contract versions. <div>
<p>ISDA has published the following statement in response to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.boi.org.il/en/communication-and-publications/press-releases/16-4-20242en/">today&rsquo;s announcement</a>&nbsp;by the Bank of Israel (BOI) on the future cessation of all TELBOR tenors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s announcement constitutes an index cessation event under the 2021 ISDA Interest Rate Derivatives Definitions and the November 2022 Benchmarks Module to the ISDA 2021 Fallbacks Protocol. As a result, the fallback spread adjustment published by Bloomberg is fixed as of the date of the announcement for all TELBOR settings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The BOI specifically announced that publication of all TELBOR tenors will permanently cease immediately after final publication on June 30, 2025. From that point, fallbacks (to the adjusted risk-free rate plus spread) will automatically apply for outstanding TELBOR derivatives contracts that incorporate Version 7.0 onwards of the 2021 ISDA Interest Rate Derivatives Definitions or in respect of which both parties have adhered to the November 2022 Benchmarks Module to the ISDA 2021 Fallbacks Protocol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For outstanding TELBOR derivatives contracts that incorporate Versions 1.0 to 6.0 of the 2021 ISDA Interest Rate Derivatives Definitions and are not amended by the November 2022 Benchmarks Module to the ISDA 2021 Fallbacks Protocol, the Generic Fallback Provisions will apply and, under the Generic Fallback Provisions, the parties will seek to apply the first Alternative Continuation Fallback pursuant to which a Continuation Amendment can be made. Pursuant to the direction of the &lsquo;Telbor committee&rsquo; (established by the BOI in 2007), the recommendation for derivatives is to use compounded SHIR plus the adjustment spread published by Bloomberg, although parties may have agreed an alternative outcome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/protocol/november-2022-benchmark-module-of-the-isda-2021-fallbacks-protocol/">November 2022 Benchmarks Module to the ISDA 2021 Fallbacks Protocol</a>, which incorporates the fallbacks into legacy non-cleared derivatives trades with other counterparties that choose to adhere to the protocol, remains open for adherence on the ISDA website.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This statement is for information purposes only. It does not constitute legal advice and should not be considered an explanation of all relevant issues. You should consult your legal advisors and any other advisor you deem appropriate in considering the issues discussed herein.</p>
<p>For additional information on benchmark reform, including the operation of derivatives fallbacks, visit ISDA&rsquo;s benchmark reform and transition from LIBOR page on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2022/05/16/benchmark-reform-and-transition-from-libor/">ISDA website</a>.</p>

<title>EBA, EIOPA And ECB Set Up A Joint Governance Framework For The Collaboration On The DPM 2.0 Standard</title>

<br>
The EBA, EIOPA, and ECB have formed an alliance to govern the DPM 2.0 standard, aiming to facilitate data exchange and promote efficient reporting processes.
<br><br>Summary: The EBA, EIOPA, and ECB have formed an alliance to govern the DPM 2.0 standard, aiming to facilitate data exchange and promote efficient reporting processes. <div>
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA), the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) and the European Central Bank (ECB) set up a Data Point Model (DPM) alliance, establishing a common governance framework for the collaboration on the DPM 2.0 Standard. Together with the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/ecb-and-eba-step-efforts-make-banking-industry-data-reporting"><span>establishment of a Joint Bank reporting Committee (JBRC)</span></a><span>&nbsp;between the EBA and ECB, this alliance is another step in the process of building an integrated reporting system.</span></p>
<p>Following the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-and-eiopa-publish-data-point-modelling-standard-20-foster">publication by the EBA and EIOPA of the DPM 2.0 standard in June 2023</a>, the two ESAs together with the ECB have agreed on the common arrangements that will govern their cooperation on DPM 2.0 (the DPM alliance).</p>
<p>Under the DPM alliance, the EBA, EIOPA and ECB will together govern the DPM 2.0 standard and cooperate in the DPM methodology for modelling reporting requirements, the metamodel used for populating the reporting requirements and the associated documentation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The DPM alliance seeks to facilitate the definition and exchange of regulatory data within the financial sector; increase efficiencies and avoid duplication of efforts; promote more efficient processes for defining and communicating reporting requirements, and for collecting and exchanging data and metadata amongst reporting entities, national authorities and European authorities; and facilitate good practices in the definition and exchange of regulatory reporting data and information.</p>
<p>The DPM alliance is established through a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-04/f40d42b9-3480-477d-841c-c05614dcfc54/Memorandum%20of%20Understanding%20on%20the%20DPM%20governance%20framework.pdf" title="Memorandum of Understanding on the DPM governance framework">Memorandum of Understanding that was signed by the EBA, ECB, and EIOPA</a>.</p>
<h4>Note to the editors</h4>
<p>The Data Point Model (DPM) is the data dictionary providing the structured representation of the data required for regulatory purposes by the EBA. It encompasses its regulatory processes and integrates the data of different EBA Technical Standards and Guidelines. The DPM may include also other data definitions relevant to the common understanding of the EBA regulatory data - business concepts and their relations, as well as their validation and calculation rules.</p>
<p>Since its inception, the EBA has been using the same DPM Standard 1.0 and together with the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) has worked on a DPM Refit project aimed at achieving a common&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document_library/Risk%20Analysis%20and%20Data/DPM%20data%20dictionary/DPM%202.0/1056372/Factsheet%20on%20DPM%20standard%202.0.pdf">DPM Standard 2.0</a>, which is better prepared to address the new challenges of regulation of financial sector.</p>
<p>At EBA the two models will coexist with the same integrated data during a transitional period in order to enable a smooth evolution to all stakeholders involved in regulatory processes.</p>

Summary:<br />
FIA urges international bodies to improve resilience of derivatives markets through transparency in initial margin requirements to reduce liquidity risk. <div>
<table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="body-text">FIA today&nbsp;<a href="https://email.fia.org/c/1284fjzdhwpdXI6uZcFXy2LkjIpozu">filed a letter</a>&nbsp;with international standard-setting bodies urging further progress on efforts to increase the resilience of global derivatives markets in times of stress.<br /><br />The letter was submitted in response to a consultation on initial margin requirements in centrally cleared derivatives markets that was issued in January by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), the Bank for International Settlements' Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO).<br /><br />The standard-setting bodies called for comment on 10 policy proposals that aim to improve participants' understanding of initial margin calculations and potential future margin requirements.<br /><br />The FIA response expressed strong support for the proposed requirements for increased transparency into the process used by central counterparties to set IM requirements, saying it will give clearing members and their clients more ability to prepare for margin calls and thereby reduce liquidity risk in financial markets. As observed during recent periods of market stress, IM requirements can rise very fast when prices are volatile, and the resulting calls for additional margin can put stress on the ability of clearing members and market participants to fund these calls.<br /><br />"We strongly support the proposed requirements on CCPs to provide additional disclosures and margin simulation tools," said Jacqueline Mesa, global head of policy, FIA. "We believe that, if implemented and monitored consistently across jurisdictions, these proposals will increase transparency and enhance understanding of CCP margin models, their main components and their responsiveness to changing market conditions. This will help clearing members, their clients and more broadly, market participants, to be better prepared for sudden spikes in margin requirements."<br /><br />Addressing the challenges created by the volatility of IM requirements has been a top priority for FIA and its members for several years. As explained in&nbsp;<a href="https://email.fia.org/c/1284fk2RRAhVm4Q7qHtDDcKlKwIcmn">a&nbsp;white paper</a>&nbsp;issued by FIA in 2020, sudden increases in margin requirements can create a type of feedback loop called procyclicality. Margin calls drive demand for liquid assets at a time when those assets are scarce due to market stresses. This demand for liquid assets can spill over into other financial markets such as repo markets and can contribute to systemic risk.<br /><br />This issue of margin procyclicality was demonstrated during abrupt market moves resulting from the Covid 19 pandemic in 2020, Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and the "mini-budget" crisis in September 2022 &ndash; all of which led to sharp rises in IM requirements in centrally cleared derivatives markets.<br /><br />FIA strongly believes that CCPs must retain the ability to adjust IM requirements in response to changing market conditions. Indeed, this is one of the strengths of the central clearing system. However, FIA also strongly believes that more transparency into margin models would help market participants better anticipate changes in IM requirements and prepare for margin calls, thereby reducing liquidity risk for both individual firms and the financial system as a whole.&nbsp;<br /><br />Background:<br /><br />FIA is the leading global trade organization for the futures, options, and centrally cleared derivatives markets. FIA&rsquo;s mission is to support open, transparent, and competitive markets; protect and enhance the integrity of the financial system; and promote high standards of professional conduct. FIA&rsquo;s membership includes clearing firms, exchanges, clearinghouses, trading firms and commodities specialists from more than 48 countries, as well as technology vendors, lawyers and other professionals serving the industry.<br /><br />FIA has published several papers over the past few years exploring and recommending best practices for CCP risk management.

<div> Transparency, PQDs, Margin simulators, Margin responsiveness, Discretionary judgement<br />
Summary:<br />
- EACH believes CCP transparency is sufficient
- Public Quantitative Disclosure is backward-looking
- Margin simulators balance cost and reliability
- Volatility measurement has limitations
- CCPs should retain discretionary judgement <div>
<p>EACH has today responded to the &lsquo;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d568.htm" target="_blank">BCBS-CPMI-IOSCO consultative report</a>&nbsp;on transparency and responsiveness of initial margin in centrally cleared markets&rsquo;. We commend authorities for analysing the important and challenging issue of responsiveness of cleared initial margin, and appreciate the opportunity to contribute. We also welcome that the authorities are considering the need for adequate transparency across the full clearing value chain, from CCPs to Clearing Members (CMs) and from CMs to clients. We believe that it is crucial to ensure that any additional measures prescribed are also taken into account by CMs and Clients in their liquidity preparedness exercises.</p>
<p>The detailed answers can be read in our response&nbsp;<a href="https://eachccp.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EACH-Response-%E2%80%93-BCBS-CPMI-IOSCO-consultative-report-on-transparency-and-responsiveness-of-initial-margin-in-centrally-cleared-markets-April-2024.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>, and a summary of our main ideas is included below:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Transparency</b>&nbsp;&ndash; EACH believes that the level of transparency measures required from the CCPs at present are considered sufficient, as CCPs provide a wide range of measures from Margin simulators and PQDs to website disclosures and private disclosures to CMs and clients.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Public Quantitative Disclosure</b>&nbsp;(<b>PQDs</b>) &ndash; We emphasise that the information contained within PQDs is not portfolio specific and is backward-looking, making it unclear how this increase could be used for liquidity preparedness which is by nature forward-looking.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Margin simulators</b>&nbsp;&ndash; We are of the opinion that the main challenge consists in finding a balance between the cost of implementation and operating the simulation tool and the reliability of the results. EACH&nbsp;recommends against forward looking scenarios, which we do not believe provide meaningful added value to users, could put an undue liability on CCPs and will have significant implementation and maintenance costs. Additionally, CCPs note that margin simulators show very little use by CMs and clients.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Measuring margin responsiveness</b>&nbsp;&ndash; EACH highlights that using volatility as a way of measuring responsiveness has different limitations, such as it being not observable and it changes not fully capturing the drivers of margin procyclicality that are within CCPs' control. We suggest considering an&nbsp;<b>alternative proposal</b>, that focuses on analysing how initial margin would change under different market stress scenarios, namely historical periods of volatility. We recommend that the design of the&nbsp;approach is&nbsp;left to the CCPs, subject to CCPs internal policies and procedures standards.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Measures on</b>&nbsp;<b>discretionary judgement by CCPs</b>&nbsp;&ndash; We highlight that there may be events that will go beyond the circumstances covered by the CCP rulebook. For this, CCPs believe it is important for them to retain a degree of discretionary judgement.</li>
</ul>

Summary:<br />
1. Historical evolution of monetary policy under uncertainty
2. Importance of uncertainty in guiding policy decisions
3. Need for a context-specific policy response to uncertainty
4. Lessons from past crises and economic events
5. Current outlook on inflation and economic growth

Summary: <div>
<p>Thank you, Matteo. It is my pleasure to welcome you to the 13th International Research Forum on Monetary Policy. The vibrant discussions you will engage in at this conference, and your research more broadly, will help us to understand better the origins and implications of uncertainty. I became a member of the Federal Reserve Board just as it was grappling with the economic after-effects of the pandemic, a once-in-a-century disturbance of worldwide significance. As a result, I know from firsthand experience that understanding the main sources of uncertainty and how best to make monetary policy decisions in the presence of uncertainty are crucial to policymaking.</p>
<p>I will take this opportunity to do a couple of things. First, I will review a few historical examples of how economic thinking on monetary policymaking in the presence of uncertainty has evolved. Second, I will consider lessons learned from these examples that could influence how monetary policymakers think about the policy choices the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) faces currently.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20240416a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 1960s to the 1980s</strong><br />In the 1960s, during the heyday of Keynesian macroeconomics, researchers widely believed that monetary policymakers faced a long-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, and that the tradeoff could be calibrated to keep unemployment indefinitely low at an acceptable cost in terms of higher inflation. Improvements in econometric modeling abounded, and the harnessing of&nbsp;<em>optimal-control</em>&nbsp;methods developed in the field of engineering held out the prospect that business cycle fluctuations could be stabilized.</p>
<p>There were contrarians, of course, most notably Milton Friedman, who highlighted the necessity of monetary policymakers to consider what they&nbsp;<em>don't</em>&nbsp;know in their decisionmaking process (Friedman, 1968). Friedman's statement that monetary policy works with "long and variable lags" was, among other things, an argument against policymakers trying to fine-tune the level of economic activity. In recognition of policymakers' limited knowledge of short-run economic relationships, Friedman advocated the use of simple rules for monetary policy, such as the&nbsp;<em>k</em>-percent money growth rule. He argued that rules that focused on monetary growth and that eschewed direct feedback on macroeconomic variables would work reasonably well, on average, and avoid the hubris of fine-tuning policy in a dynamic and uncertain world.</p>
<p>History proved Friedman right in his take on the importance of uncertainty, even if his prescription of a&nbsp;<em>k</em>-percent money growth rule fared less well.</p>
<p>During roughly the same period when Friedman authored his famous presidential address to the American Economic Association disputing the purported long-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, William Brainard published an influential paper on the implications of uncertainty. Brainard (1967) argued that uncertainty about the power of monetary policy implied that policy should respond more cautiously to shocks than would be the case if this uncertainty did not exist. Brainard's&nbsp;<em>attenuation principle</em>&nbsp;is a classic example of what is today known as the Bayesian approach to uncertainty.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20240416a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;The Brainard approach to uncertainty consisted of two steps. The first step is to compute the optimal policy for a world without uncertainty; that is, the&nbsp;<em>certainty equivalence</em>&nbsp;case. The second step is to adjust that policy response to account for the particular uncertainty under study. One strand of research followed these steps through the 1970s and beyond.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20240416a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;A parallel strand of research that embraced at least part of the message of Friedman was also under way. It bypassed the optimal policy benchmark altogether, on the grounds that uncertainty is pervasive, and sought instead to find simple rules that performed well across a large class of models and for a large range of conditions.</p>
<p>Brainard's insight was important. There are many circumstances in which the principle of gradualism applies, but as I will discuss later, economic research has also found that there are circumstances in which the presence of uncertainty does not warrant a gradual policy response.</p>
<p><strong>The 1990s and 2000s</strong><br />Jumping ahead to the 1990s, a "new economy" was emerging. The unemployment rate was below what many analysts at the time judged to be its natural rate, and many FOMC participants and others were forecasting growth above the economy's potential. Chairman Alan Greenspan, however, suspected that technological advances and other forces were fostering a "new economy" of sustained high productivity growth that would allow a period of persistently low unemployment without generating inflationary pressure. In the absence of hard evidence to the contrary, he was able to persuade the FOMC to go along with him by implicitly employing the Bayesian logic of Brainard's attenuation principle with a disarmingly simple suggestion: Let's just wait one more meeting and see. Chairman Greenspan repeated this message as inflation fell from above 2 percent in 1996 to below 2 percent in 1997 and 1998 while the economy added 9.3 million jobs, and the FOMC raised the federal funds rate just once.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20240416a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a></p>
<p>Around the same time, there was an explosion of interest in&nbsp;<em>simple policy rules</em>&nbsp;for monetary policy, beginning, in most people's reckoning, with the rule John Taylor (1993) published in the early 1990s. These simple feedback rules, which specify how central banks' policy instrument would respond to the state of the economy, differed from their predecessors by replacing monetary aggregates as the instrument of monetary policy with a short-term policy interest rate. This research embraced the message that restricting feedback to a small number of key macroeconomic variables would result in more robust outcomes than adhering to the prescriptions of, say, optimal-control policies, which in essence imposed feedback on all aspects of these models.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20240416a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;Whether much of the robustness gains of simple rules can be realized when central banks only use such rules as "guides" for monetary policy is a topic worthy of further research.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20240416a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a></p>
<p>The claimed robustness of simple rules across a set of fixed models is arguably only part of their appeal. Another part is the notion that their parsimony presumably makes simple rules relatively easy for households, businesses, and financial market participants to learn. One useful finding was that gradualism in policy setting, in the form of a sizable weight on the lagged policy rate in the policy rule, is helpful for facilitating learnability.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20240416a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;In any event, the literature on learning in macroeconomics extended the dimension of uncertainty for monetary policymakers from the cross section of candidate models to the time dimension of any given model.</p>
<p>The bulk of the early literature assumed private-sector decisionmakers were knowledgeable, rational agents, while policymakers lacked detailed knowledge of the structure of the economy. The assumed imbalance of information and knowledge was striking. It was usually assumed, sometimes only implicitly, that private agents understood not only the economic environment in which they operated, but also the policy regime that was in place. Considering this background, some more recent contributions explored two related departures from the assumption of a fixed model with uncertain parameters: time-variation in the true (population) model, and private agents learning about the economy.</p>
<p>As I just observed, the rational expectations paradigm presupposes that economic agents have a great deal of knowledge about their environment, but policymakers do not know the true (population) parameters of the models they use. Instead, they must use estimates of those parameters. As Sargent (1993) noted, it makes sense to assume that the decisionmakers within the models that policymakers employ are no more sophisticated than the econometricians who estimate them. Doing so means accepting that the true (population) parameters of one's model could be time varying&mdash;the outcome of the interplay between shocks, uncertainty, learning, and policy. That realization changes the way you think about monetary policy.</p>
<p>How might this matter? Let me give you one example. As many of you know, econometricians have found sizable declines in recent decades in the response of inflation to the unemployment rate.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20240416a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;Taken at face value, these declines in the slope of the Phillips curve have important implications for the optimal conduct of monetary policy. But what should policymakers take from such econometric results? Some researchers argue that the apparent decline in the response to slack in the Phillips curve could be a manifestation of the improved control of inflation by the central bank.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20240416a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;That is, policymakers could be "victims of their own success" in the sense that good performance in controlling inflation over the Great Moderation period may have weakened the information content of the data.</p>
<p>Now, take this notion a step further, as a strand of the literature does, and suppose that private agents within our models are themselves skeptical&mdash;that is, that they have doubts about their methods for formulating expectations and making decisions, and that they act accordingly. Economists now have new means of modeling uncertainty both&nbsp;<em>within</em>&nbsp;a given model and&nbsp;<em>across</em>&nbsp;a set of rival models. These methods draw on theories of&nbsp;<em>ambiguity aversion</em>.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20240416a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;Under ambiguity aversion, agents are particularly concerned about types of uncertainties that do not lend themselves to being represented in terms of probabilities. Agents' choices are motivated, in part, by an incentive to minimize the adverse consequences of these types of uncertainties. The ambiguity aversion approach to uncertainty suggests that to protect against uncertainty over which a policymaker is unwilling or unable to attach prior probabilities, the appropriate response is often anti-attenuation; that is, policy should apply&nbsp;<em>stronger</em>&nbsp;monetary medicine than in the certainty equivalence case.</p>
<p>For the reasons I have outlined, there are circumstances when uncertainty might appropriately induce a gradual response and other circumstances when a nongradual response to uncertainty may be justified. Furthermore, under either the Bayesian approach or the ambiguity aversion approach, the best response to uncertainty is context specific and can vary over time.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20240416a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;Sometimes the context leads to the same conclusion, broadly speaking, regardless of the approach. One case of perennial interest to central bankers is inflation persistence where the Bayesian approach, the ambiguity aversion approach, and its close cousin, robust control, all tend to lead to policy that is stronger than the certainty equivalent case to forestall the possibility of inflationary forces becoming embedded in inflation expectations.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20240416a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a>&nbsp;Another case is that of crisis periods.</p>
<p><strong>The Global Financial Crisis</strong><br />Take, for example, the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. During this period, the tension between caution, on the one hand, and vigorous action, on the other, as a way to conduct monetary policy in the face of uncertainty was evident. In September 2007, the FOMC decided to lower its target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to "forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets" and noted that "developments in financial markets since the Committee's last regular meeting have increased the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20240416a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a>&nbsp;In subsequent meetings, the FOMC gradually lowered its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points and, in January 2008, decided to quicken its pace by lowering the target by 75 basis points in an unscheduled meeting and by 50 basis points, 75 basis points, and 25 basis points in subsequent meetings. Inflation, however, was rising over that period. By June 2008, it was well over 2 percent and still increasing, and the FOMC paused its rate cutting. It was a decision that weighed the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations with the downside risks to economic growth.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20240416a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;In September 2008, the circumstances changed precipitously, as did the FOMC's approach to policy. The Committee quickly cut the federal funds rate effectively to zero and took extraordinary steps to stabilize the financial system and support the economy. The motivation to respond assertively to the emerging crisis, and the uncertainty surrounding it, was no doubt accentuated by the knowledge that future policy actions might be circumscribed by a lengthy spell of the funds rate at its lower bound, which would magnify losses associated with adverse outcomes.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20240416a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a>&nbsp;My conclusion, as Chair Powell mentioned in a speech in 2018, is that during crisis periods, words like "we will do whatever it takes" will likely be more effective than "we will take cautious steps."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20240416a.htm#fn16" title="footnote 16"><span>16</span></a><a name="f16"></a></p>
<p><strong>Lessons Learned</strong><br />Some clear lessons flow from the history that I have summarized. First, when uncertainty is high, policymakers should sometimes act quickly and should sometimes act cautiously. The right action depends on the circumstances. Second, while simple monetary policy rules are appealing for several reasons, rigid adherence to the prescriptions of simple rules is unwarranted. Historically, policymakers have only used rules as "guides" or benchmarks in setting policy, and there are good reasons for this. It is clearly beneficial to look at the totality of the data to identify changes in the economy in real time, to embrace the risk-management considerations associated with uncertainty that factor into FOMC decisions, and to adapt policy to the evolution of the economy. Third, in the presence of a high degree of uncertainly, policymakers benefit from a healthy dose of humility. There are limits to what we know about the economy, especially after periods of economic upheaval such as a pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>Current Situation</strong><br />Reflecting on the situation we are facing today, over the past year, inflation has come down significantly but is still running above the FOMC's 2 percent goal. In March, headline personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation was 2.7 percent over the past 12 months based on the Federal Reserve's staff estimates. A year earlier, it was 4.4 percent. Core PCE inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy components, stood at 2.8 percent; a year ago, it was 4.8 percent. While we have seen considerable progress in lowering inflation, the job of sustainably restoring 2 percent inflation is not yet done.</p>
<p>Real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 3.4 percent, and I expect first-quarter economic growth to slow down but remain solid as indicated by the solid growth in retail sales in March and February. Recent readings on both job gains and inflation have come in higher than expected. The economy added an average of 276,000 nonfarm jobs per month in the three months through March, a faster pace than we have seen since last March. And the inflation data over the past three months were above the low readings in the second half of last year.</p>
<p>My baseline outlook continues to be that inflation will decline further, with the policy rate held steady at its current level, and that the labor market will remain strong, with labor demand and supply continuing to rebalance. Of course, the outlook is still quite uncertain, and if incoming data suggest that inflation is more persistent than I currently expect it to be, it will be appropriate to hold in place the current restrictive stance of policy for longer. I am fully committed to getting inflation back to 2 percent.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />I would like to conclude by saying that in this environment of heightened uncertainty, it is increasingly important to comprehend what is driving uncertainty and how monetary policy might play a role in limiting the negative impact of uncertainty on businesses, households, and financial markets. Many of you in this audience have devoted a considerable amount of time to understanding the intricate link between uncertainty and economic outcomes. Your work has enriched our collective knowledge and has been instrumental in helping us policymakers understand the complexities of our decisions. Please keep it up!</p>

<p><a name="fn1"></a>1. The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn2"></a>2. For example, in 1998, Alan Blinder wrote that the Brainard result was "never far from my mind when I occupied the Vice Chairman's office at the Federal Reserve. In my view . . . a little stodginess at the central bank is entirely appropriate" (Blinder, 1998, p. 12).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn3"></a>3. An incomplete list of the early contributions includes Prescott (1972), Chow (1976), Craine and Havenner (1977), and Kendrick (1982).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn4"></a>4. The estimate of 9.3 million jobs uses total nonfarm seasonally adjusted numbers from the&nbsp;<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/">St. Louis Fed FRED database</a>&nbsp;(PAYEMS series) and takes the difference between the December 1998 and January 1996 numbers.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn5"></a>5. Optimal-control policies are optimal conditional on the structure of the model to which they are applied. Provided the model is a reliable approximation of the true economy, and policymakers' preferences are correctly specified, the policy prescriptions derived from optimal-control exercises are, by definition, the best that can be achieved. However, the underlying assumptions are stringent in many applications. There is also a literature on risk-adjusted optimal control dating back at least to Whittle (1981). See Taylor and Williams (2010) and references therein for a detailed argument on the efficacy of simple rules as hedges against model misspecification. Svensson (2003) is a critique of the use of all simple monetary policy rules&mdash;sometimes referred to as&nbsp;<em>instrument rules</em>&mdash;as opposed to what are called&nbsp;<em>targeting rules</em>. In a 2012 speech, then Vice Chair Janet Yellen observed, "In evaluating the stance of policy, I find the prescriptions from simple policy rules a logical starting point" (Yellen, 2012). She went on to argue that simple rules "by no means deserve the 'last word'" on guidance for monetary policy, in part because they do not fully account for factors that might be idiosyncratic, such as risk-management concerns. That speech introduced the Fed's optimal-control simulations to the public as an alternative source of guidance for monetary policy that could be used alongside that of simple monetary policy rules, together with judgment. Since 2017, the&nbsp;<em>Monetary Policy Report</em>&nbsp;has discussed simple monetary policy rules and their limitations.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn6"></a>6. Nikolosko-Rzhevskyy, Papell, and Prodan (2014), among others, explore this question.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn7"></a>7. By "learnable" I mean in the sense that least-squares learning would converge, in the limit, on rational expectations equilibrium. See Evans and Honkapohja (2001) for a textbook treatment of learning in macroeconomics. Bullard and Mitra (2002) established the benefits of inertia in monetary policy for making a wider set of models "E-stable," meaning the process of least-squares learning leads to a unique and stable equilibrium. Tetlow and von zur Muehlen (2009) broadened that conclusion to a wider set of learning rules.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn8"></a>8. See, for example, Stock and Watson (2021) for time-series evidence and Smith, Timmermann, and Wright (2023) for panel data results.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn9"></a>9. See, for example, Bullard (2018) for a demonstration and McLeay and Tenreyo (2019) for a detailed argument along these lines.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn10"></a>10. The literature on robust control in economics (for example, Hansen and Sargent, 2008) began with the normative case of how policymakers might address their doubts. The literature on ambiguity aversion (for example, Epstein and Schneider, 2003) had agents within models confront their doubts in making decisions. Works at the intersection of these two strands of the literature expand the concept of uncertainty (in the sense of Knight, 1921) in a micro-founded manner and relax the rational expectations hypothesis in a disciplined way. See, for example, Hansen and Sargent (2021).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn11"></a>11. See Barlevy (2011) for an accessible survey and Tetlow and von zur Muehlen (2001) for a more technical treatment.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn12"></a>12. S&ouml;derst&ouml;m (2002) establishes the result for the Bayesian case. Tetlow (2019) is a simple demonstration of that case alongside an ambiguity aversion case. With uncertain inflation persistence, the Bayesian and ambiguity aversion approaches lead to a policy that is stronger than the certainty equivalent case because a symmetric distribution for inflation persistence results in asymmetric (downward-skewed) distributions for economic outcomes when evaluated for the certainty equivalent policy. Adam and Woodford (2012) show that uncertainty regarding the data generating process for inflation in the New Keynesian model retains as the optimal policy the same general form as in the standard model but with a more aggressive response to inflation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn13"></a>13. See paragraphs 2 and 4 of the September 2007 FOMC statement, which is available on the Federal Reserve Board's website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm">https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn14"></a>14. See paragraph 4 of the June 2008 FOMC statement, which, in explaining the FOMC's decision to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 2 percent at that meeting, noted, "Although downside risks to growth remain, they appear to have diminished somewhat, and the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have increased." See also the minutes of the June 24&ndash;25, 2008, FOMC Meeting, in particular the summary of the Committee's discussion on downside risks to growth and upside risks to inflation on pages 7 and 8. Both documents are available on the Federal Reserve Board's website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm">https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn15"></a>15. The literature on the implications of the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates for the conduct on monetary policy is large and includes Reifschneider and Williams (2000).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn16"></a>16. See Powell (2018).&nbsp;</p>

The multi-million-pound deal will see the two companies merge under the Zevero brand and expand operations across Asia, Europe and the U.S., fuelling Zevero's access to the global $15 billion<sup>*</sup> carbon accounting market.</p>
<p>Zevero's innovative software platform uses AI-driven carbon modelling, automated emissions calculations and real-time analytics to help companies within the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry to accurately measure, manage and reduce their carbon footprint across their entire supply chain. In bringing together these capabilities with LEVELUP's extensive agriculture industry expertise, the new combined offering will be a powerful tool in the global fight against climate change.</p>
<p>"In just three years, Zevero has proven its ability to provide full-stack carbon accounting to clients in over 13 countries,"&nbsp;<b>said Shigeo Taniuchi, incoming CEO of Zevero - previously of LEVELUP.&nbsp;</b>"Combining Zevero's strong product foundations and UK market experience with our team's expertise across Asia will rapidly accelerate our shared mission to become the definitive carbon management solution for businesses worldwide."</p>
<p>Zevero was founded in 2020 by friends Ben Richardson and George Wade, then both just 23. The pair grew frustrated at how challenging it was for businesses to understand their carbon impact end-to-end. With increasing environmental-focused regulation at the time impacting more and more industries, Ben and George recognised a critical need to digitise the carbon accounting process and make it possible for businesses to see the full picture of their carbon impact throughout each stage of their supply chain. As, only through having this visibility, can businesses make any impactful changes to their operations.</p>
<h4><b>A strong footing in the UK</b></h4>
<p>Zevero initially made its name in the UK carbon accounting market, quickly acquiring customers in the food and beverage industry - such as Brixton Brewery and MOTH, amongst others. Rising consumer demand for environmentally-friendly products and services, increasing regulatory enforcement and consequent supply chain pressures are driving the need for accurate emissions data and credible decarbonisation strategies - both areas in which many companies currently lack the right resources, knowledge and tools.</p>
<p>"Climate change is the biggest threat facing society. For most companies, there are multiple challenges in their way."<b>&nbsp;said Ben Richardson, Co-Founder of Zevero.</b>&nbsp;"Despite pressure to act, they lack the capabilities to see the full impact of their products on the environment. Without that transparency, it's impossible to set realistic emission reduction targets and drive meaningful change."</p>
<p>"Traditionally, calculating corporate emissions has relied on spreadsheets and static PDFs. Zevero makes it easier and more accurate for companies to measure, reduce and report on their carbon emissions in real-time, not just once a year,"&nbsp;<b>said George Wade, Zevero's other Co-Founder.&nbsp;</b>"Much has been said about brands greenwashing, but what we're hearing from these businesses is that they actively want to make drastic changes to clean up their supply chains - but up until now they haven't had the data to make those decisions confidently. Zevero has created a solution for that."</p>
<p>Through the acquisition, Ben and George will remain actively involved as Co-Founders - together with other Co-Founders, seasoned executive, Shigeo Taniuchi and serial entrepreneur, Yuya Kuratomi - and will be responsible for driving Zevero's product roadmap and growth initiatives. Zevero's diverse leadership team will integrate LEVELUP's extensive presence and network in Asia to accelerate the expansion and impact of Zevero.</p>

<h4>2023 HIGHLIGHTS:&nbsp;<b>BUILDING A POSITIVE HUMAN FUTURE&nbsp;</b></h4>
<h5><b>Breakthrough technologies made real&nbsp;</b></h5>
<p>Over the past year, organisations turned to PA when looking to deliver technology-enabled real-world innovation &ndash; whether the answer to their challenge required a change in strategy, a new product or service, or a wider enterprise transformation.</p>
<p>PA's pioneering approach can be seen in its work for&nbsp;<a href="http://email.prnewswire.com/ls/click?upn=u001.v-2BJ3gj6ki5QD5j-2Fn6dQLioQ6EYAs9Md2mZHIRRJulyhgbima7cpLsIjwr5-2B-2Bpa8oVRlV30mC9r9goHd07dmlZsAA2DuFcThsrn8VxXOQDPCTyNP2fN-2FbVEsWBqYTBYwflgIx-2B1KxQ-2FHURSQ4fXRecGaUSXXSOpJnURtF4B9yEX8-3DuGh2_pIbxPfpDI69aAybPrpOfg1n6CWmKMnb3conIyNKCYgr-2BTRqxLAwMRExIXLpGb5DJPEaj7QMmqnrbmrwO6AwVP1EBCbJwQUD4trajjKODRYvfcgOlfAuep0wWN6Vz4oZMAF2z5NcyJqAkDbW4RNGUCOP3w3bkzJZ1y6-2FodfGNEYU1HWc5APniacyWP5EqP5mL62u3IeYchRqAE5cc9CTQ-2BGSlusff2I5BhreHfism3G1Y2p5LFyuFZbq0sci-2F9IXL-2Floe9EL4FeKhRAwbuGByWUFwa7kavU9q2nmzN0GXsRlTW6x7FjXJjV-2FDXwcKGqPKk68RVKJvRlKRb59M5ciMLZCNDSdIkyOxtXhi4WP3EqwUooMVe5cSE7PxvR36ZArW" target="_blank">Hubly Surgical</a>, which is on a mission to transform bedside neurosurgery. In 2023, a PA designed life-saving bore drill to replace archaic and high-risk methods in intracranial surgery, received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance in the US. This new-to-world neurotechnology can now be brought to market to save lives.</p>
<h5>Innovation accelerates results&nbsp;</h5>
<p>For innovation to achieve real impact, PA believes it needs to be viewed through a full lifecycle, end-to-end lens. Understanding the impact of potential changes across a complex system is imperative to secure a rapid return on&nbsp;innovation investment.</p>
<p>This approach was evidenced through PA's work, in strategic partnership with Jacobs, for the UK's&nbsp;<a href="http://email.prnewswire.com/ls/click?upn=u001.v-2BJ3gj6ki5QD5j-2Fn6dQLioQ6EYAs9Md2mZHIRRJulyj4UbDArMPrpldD8j3Drk7zp3a4y6oISQ-2FOZj0NFB5ADo14JCO4-2B9VglP-2FF-2F-2FgqCaLdw-2FTg3mLVbav4HWt91JCoSRyXfvGmx4WtNMlQ-2By7SqsAI48d7WRVRcTG2LOTW7p-2F9PJe7szq719tzEZANRCfsIDjzdNwc6CFHLrgrm-2Biz3QOz2evbqNvDHMvcRyVvG1I-3DYc3V_pIbxPfpDI69aAybPrpOfg1n6CWmKMnb3conIyNKCYgr-2BTRqxLAwMRExIXLpGb5DJPEaj7QMmqnrbmrwO6AwVP1EBCbJwQUD4trajjKODRYvfcgOlfAuep0wWN6Vz4oZMAF2z5NcyJqAkDbW4RNGUCOP3w3bkzJZ1y6-2FodfGNEYU1HWc5APniacyWP5EqP5mL62u3IeYchRqAE5cc9CTQ-2BGSlusff2I5BhreHfism3G1uz9gNfLWPqjpyk5NgSjMHdNcKKT-2B1-2FIoOumVnsrV-2BD-2FSk1oa26soHXrJFREZEvgKLzBTx8jLJCqu8aEfEX7WGWbMYUrx-2BNLpPCw-2BOgePenmEcGS7VVaojC7dH5SEXqZ-2BhEcU7BOxjdrJnweDOrUbm" target="_blank">Nuclear Decommissioning Authority</a>&nbsp;(NDA). The PA and Jacobs team led a digital enterprise asset transformation journey within a highly regulated landscape. The team combined nuclear sector expertise alongside digital, data, organisational design, and people and change skills to rapidly transform NDA's asset support capability, resulting in major savings for safety critical, regulated assets.</p>
<h5>Diverse experts unlock opportunity&nbsp;</h5>
<p>Diversity of expertise &ndash; from perspective to experience &ndash; leads to better ideas. To deliver innovative and effective solutions to previously unsolvable problems, organisations need the right blend of diverse experts in combination with emerging technologies.</p>
<p>In 2023, PA's strategists, innovators, designers, consultants, digital experts, scientists, engineers, and technologists helped a wide range of clients, including the team at&nbsp;<a href="http://email.prnewswire.com/ls/click?upn=u001.v-2BJ3gj6ki5QD5j-2Fn6dQLioQ6EYAs9Md2mZHIRRJulyhgbima7cpLsIjwr5-2B-2Bpa8oG4oraomjawZuSLHTNOROg2q-2B52-2FJF69Jyts2kdNENItKpKBNC4rcw-2BmzU-2Fx7fJtUjVwP-2FJYdkUMbPyzCtoQKSYfERfCkUPirjd6O5dVccb194t21APmk8EMTquT-2BUAWKalWw_pIbxPfpDI69aAybPrpOfg1n6CWmKMnb3conIyNKCYgr-2BTRqxLAwMRExIXLpGb5DJPEaj7QMmqnrbmrwO6AwVP1EBCbJwQUD4trajjKODRYvfcgOlfAuep0wWN6Vz4oZMAF2z5NcyJqAkDbW4RNGUCOP3w3bkzJZ1y6-2FodfGNEYU1HWc5APniacyWP5EqP5mL62u3IeYchRqAE5cc9CTQ-2BGSlusff2I5BhreHfism3G3BEXYG8u8Ej82gxrMBfF-2BRhogNzEPhlyyOdeKpu7KnEDepBeFGICBA9PdBLvJD0l18TNZNXaX7sJCML6hUH10d9ZYkyRzA00ItxYf41vh7hmW6mAZnYMMFFLzxJr429MWAqJ4Yz7Il7yiIh4Ekc1j1" target="_blank">Amsterdam Airport Schiphol</a>. As one of the world's busiest airports, moving over 72 million passengers a year, Schiphol needed a way to assess the&nbsp;carbon footprint of its technology and data. PA worked with their teams to discover how technology and data can help turn their ambition to be the world's most sustainable airport into reality.</p>
<h5><b>Progress through collaboration&nbsp;</b></h5>
<p>PA's team thrives on solving the most complex challenges, creating strategies, and leading transformations across organisations and industries. This involves bringing together different perspectives and stakeholders &ndash; regulators, the public sector, the private sector, start-ups, supply chains, the science community, and more &ndash; to unlock new value.</p>
<p>As part of PA's new defence and security consortia,&nbsp;<a href="http://email.prnewswire.com/ls/click?upn=u001.v-2BJ3gj6ki5QD5j-2Fn6dQLioQ6EYAs9Md2mZHIRRJulyiM3ZP8MMLZmi6HQgAexlxZo6WDxvxEtZu-2BblG8dE7Ml9V-2BAA9hJJsC7yK4X8G-2BJkNFNYe-2Bpg86bAI7NkvecvMz4Wj3cC7u2mkTghEzUyyaJPHDAsdIbEqpxkZ5Q4-2BhoE2p7n4nWkKdUluLaLlOqQveKL8EA5L1ypDvJ1HmQt0diQ-3D-3DZ6jc_pIbxPfpDI69aAybPrpOfg1n6CWmKMnb3conIyNKCYgr-2BTRqxLAwMRExIXLpGb5DJPEaj7QMmqnrbmrwO6AwVP1EBCbJwQUD4trajjKODRYvfcgOlfAuep0wWN6Vz4oZMAF2z5NcyJqAkDbW4RNGUCOP3w3bkzJZ1y6-2FodfGNEYU1HWc5APniacyWP5EqP5mL62u3IeYchRqAE5cc9CTQ-2BGSlusff2I5BhreHfism3G2r5J5wcCql9taYne8o7IyGUiwZigeaLcveIDoHFrrkNScx-2FdO6mqaIS6D6y7OFpPcjGCwmdsbJGLBSMuiG83WCm4fRXvuu2qQDWCpXBMoLQKKrscdx4BXWMFeX-2BDVako7XZrUa6FbaACwI7pkhtMtq" target="_blank">TeamProtect</a>, it is collaborating with the UK's Ministry of Defence (MOD) to deliver CRENIC &ndash; a project that will keep soldiers safe from radio-controlled threats. The project has so far brought together 110 diverse and globally dispersed tech, innovation, and AI businesses into the same ecosystem &ndash; breaking down some of the traditional barriers around public sector procurement to fast-track innovation.</p>
<h4>CELEBRATING LIFE AT PA</h4>
<p>PA's people are its driving force, and the company offers exceptional career opportunities. As well as purpose-driven work, PA is committed to making the company a great place to work by creating a culture that's collaborative, diverse, inclusive, and rewarding.

<h5>Support for local communities</h5>
<p>PA people, and The PA Foundation, share a goal to develop and inspire people, particularly those facing disadvantage, to be the innovators and leaders of tomorrow. Over the past year, PA volunteers have continued to grow and support their local communities.</p>
<p>In the UK, PA volunteers helped support immigrants and refugees to gain employment, coached ex-prison offenders to help prepare them for future interviews, and even went back to school &ndash; getting involved with education initiatives that help break down limiting beliefs among disadvantaged students to inspire the young leaders of the future. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In the US, The PA Foundation worked with&nbsp;<a href="http://email.prnewswire.com/ls/click?upn=u001.v-2BJ3gj6ki5QD5j-2Fn6dQLiu9PcAKbU8Um6JK1NU-2BjNbpRxhU3S6wLCWmTlpBk4b-2FECQwg_pIbxPfpDI69aAybPrpOfg1n6CWmKMnb3conIyNKCYgr-2BTRqxLAwMRExIXLpGb5DJPEaj7QMmqnrbmrwO6AwVP1EBCbJwQUD4trajjKODRYvfcgOlfAuep0wWN6Vz4oZMAF2z5NcyJqAkDbW4RNGUCOP3w3bkzJZ1y6-2FodfGNEYU1HWc5APniacyWP5EqP5mL62u3IeYchRqAE5cc9CTQ-2BGSlusff2I5BhreHfism3G1mLLISud43wtvdOfLLWfFF9zm1ahN28c9Tp18-2FWT2SLVeHExR4dmMKqc8d9ALFjydy-2Fj1sMs397LJQpsDulO9XV2BAhci-2BW1EjSP5WnM-2Bwj7HEfmaawCK2hYFpN4HBM4jlCbb6sRLNCSzKzh5KUcQw" target="_blank">Upwardly global</a>, providing mentoring to help eliminate employment barriers for immigrant and refugee professionals and advance the inclusion of their skills into the US economy.

<h5>Responsible business</h5>
<p>PA is committed to working across industry to drive change and create lasting impact.

With the Ministry of Defence UK Space Command, PA brought together academics, government stakeholders, the wider space industry, and sustainability experts to explore the challenges and opportunities for space to protect our planet.&nbsp; Throughout 2023, PA continued to uncover and accelerate ways to safeguard the planet securing it various industry awards for its expertise in sustainability.</p>

<p><span><span>The&nbsp;vLEI is a new form of digitized organizational identity that meets the global need for automated authentication and verification of legal entities across a variety of industries. By wrapping new and existing LEIs in digital credentials that can be verified, the vLEI offers a digitally trustworthy version of the LEI which can be used to verify the identities of legal entities and their authorized representatives across a rapidly growing number of automated interactions. The vLEI can be used as a signing tool for corporate, digital identity and persons with delegated signing authority rights. Using the vLEI, government organizations, companies, and all legal entities will be able to confirm ownership structures and authorized representations in a growing number of digital business activities. Examples of known use cases include approving business transactions and contracts, onboarding customers, transacting within import/export and supply chain business networks, and submitting regulatory filings and reports.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The vLEI ecosystem utilizes the existing Global LEI System as the only open, standardized, and regulatory-endorsed system for legal entity identification. It is based on the Trust over IP Governance metamodel and leverages open standards including the ACDC (Authentic Chained Data Container) specification, the KERI (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure) protocol for key management, and&nbsp;the CESR (Composable Event Streaming Representation) capabilities for secure digital signing.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>By using secure credentials and open standards, the vLEI creates a verifiable link between an organization and its representatives. These digital credentials are not only tamper-resistant but also verifiable in a decentralized manner, providing an ideal foundation on which to establish a secure chain of trust with GLEIF at the root.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>There are two types of vLEI organizational credentials in the vLEI ecosystem that can be issued to authorized representatives of an organization; the Official Organization Role (OOR), which leverages the ISO 5009 standard and can be verified by the organization and against public sources; and the Engagement Context Role (ECR), which are credentials defined and verified by the vLEI holder itself.&nbsp;<span lang="EN-US">By combining these three concepts &ndash; the organization&rsquo;s identity, represented by the LEI, a person&rsquo;s identity, and the role that the person plays for the organization, vLEI credentials can be issued.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Anders &Aring;str&ouml;m, CEO and Co-founder of NordLEI, comments: "Nord vLEI is proud to lead the way as the first QVI based in Europe. The strength of the global economy lies in its transparency and trust. The vLEI enables functional, reliable, and ethical interactions on a scale never seen before and significantly reduces the potential for fraud and inefficiencies. As a QVI we will deliver the same quality as we have come to be known for with NordLEI."</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Rickard Israelsson, Co-founder of NordLEI, comments: "Achieving the status as a Qualified vLEI Issuer affirms our vision of being at the forefront of the digital transformation in identification and authentication, something we have been striving for since the inception of NordLEI in 2014. The vLEI makes trustworthy and reliable digital transactions and interactions possible and efficient. It is an honor to be the first QVI in Europe."</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Stephan Wolf, CEO of GLEIF, comments: "The vLEI has truly universal applicability due to its unparalleled capacity to bridge the trust deficits that inhibit digital transactions and interactions. Welcoming Nord vLEI as a QVI marks an important step forward for the vLEI ecosystem, reaffirming our ongoing commitment to developing the supporting infrastructure to establish the vLEI as a fundamental enabler of digital trust across the global economy."</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Becoming a member of the vLEI ecosystem via GLEIF qualification is a globally recognized designation of commitment to trusted organizational digital identity. Nord vLEI builds upon the expertise and reputation of NordLEI. Nord vLEI focuses on the development, management, and implementation of the vLEI. In 2023, NordLEI was recognized by GLEIF as the best performing LEI issuer in the Mid-Cap Category.</span></span></p>

<div> research, initial margin, reactiveness, procyclicality, uncertainty
Summary: 
- WFE and Dr. David Murphy introduce a novel measure of initial margin model reactiveness.
- Proposed methodology overcomes limitations of current measures of model procyclicality.
- Results show trade-offs between model reactiveness and uncertainty, as well as impact of anti-procyclicality tools.
- Adoption of an outcome-based approach to procyclicality is supported.
- Research highlights the need for adaptation of current methodology proposed by BCBS-CPMI-IOSCO. 
- The study sheds light on the shortcomings of current approaches and proposals to measure model reactiveness and provides an alternative method for consideration. <div>
<p>With standard setters considering further guidance on initial margin in centrally cleared markets, the World Federation of Exchanges (&ldquo;WFE&rdquo;) has today published joint research with Dr. David Murphy, Visiting Professor at the Department of Law of the London School of Economics (&ldquo;LSE&rdquo;) introducing a novel measure of initial margin model reactiveness (or &ldquo;procyclicality&rdquo;) that, unlike other measures, does not rely on particular risk factor paths and quantifies the uncertainty in the measurements.&nbsp;<br /><br />The WFE Research Working Paper, &ldquo;The Impulsive Approach to Procyclicality&rdquo;, arrives soon after the recent BCBS-CPMI-IOSCO Review of Transparency and Responsiveness of Initial Margin in Centrally Cleared Markets, which seeks to establish a standardised measure of margin responsiveness across the international clearing community.&nbsp;<br /><br />The responsiveness of initial margin models, both for centrally and non-centrally cleared trades, has been part of the discussions about how to best manage liquidity pressures in the financial system. However, the debate about how reactive margin should be to changes in market conditions has been hampered by the lack of a generally accepted and statistically sound way of measuring such reactiveness.&nbsp;<br /><br />Common measures of model procyclicality, including the method being proposed by the Joint Working Group on Margin (&ldquo;JWGM&rdquo;) set up by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, are strongly dependent on the individual scenarios and, as a consequence, cannot be used to compare margin models across different market conditions and are unlikely to provide a sufficient understanding of how models (and anti-procyclicality tools) could behave when there is an unanticipated change in market conditions. They also ignore the uncertainty surrounding the measurements.<br /><br />The methodology proposed in this research overcomes these limitations, measuring margin responsiveness to shifts in volatility and market dynamics by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Utilising an impulse response function (IRF) in a Monte Carlo simulation setting,</li>
<li>Capturing the variability (uncertainty) surrounding margin model reactiveness,</li>
<li>Providing a tool to assess and compare models that does not depend on a particular scenario.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The results presented demonstrate that a model&rsquo;s impulse response is a robust and useful measure of its reactiveness. Using this measure, the analysis also sheds light on different aspects of procyclicality management:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a trade-off between model reactiveness and the uncertainty of future model behaviour,&nbsp;</li>
<li>The use of a stress period and the addition of a buffer, two commonly used anti-procyclicality (APC) tools, do not significantly reduce the likelihood of a model over- or under-reacting. In particular, the buffer performs poorly.</li>
<li>The impact of the choice of core margin model far exceeds the impact of the APC tools analysed,</li>
<li>While the filtered Value at Risk (VaR) models analyzed offer the benefit of higher speeds of reaction, they tend to over-react to sharp, stepwise increases in volatility.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These results support the adoption of an outcome-based approach to procyclicality, recognising that there is no single correct level of procyclicality, but only acceptable choices given a specific situation (including risk factor dynamics, portfolio characteristics, participants&rsquo; funding liquidity arrangements), and the desired trade-off between reactiveness, potential extent of over-reaction, and margin accuracy.<br /><br />This research also highlights the need for an adaptation of the current methodology proposed by BCBS-CPMI-IOSCO before it is put into effect: either by capturing the degree of uncertainty in the measurement, or by including an appropriate warning of the standard setter&rsquo;s proposed method&rsquo;s limitations.&nbsp;<br /><br />Please find the full study&nbsp;<a href="https://world-exchanges.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=48ddcbc11eb58f141a51219ea&amp;id=0d55f0209c&amp;e=979576350c" target="_blank">here</a>.<br /><br /><strong>Pedro Gurrola-Perez, Head of Research at the World Federation of Exchanges,</strong>&nbsp;commented &ldquo;As the policy landscape looks set for change in this area, the research we have published today contributes to the sum of knowledge on this topic, sheds light on the shortcomings of the current approaches and proposals to measure model reactiveness (shortcomings which have often obscured the debate around procyclicality), and provides an alternative method for consideration which brings clarity to the discussion and provides the concepts of a model being over- or under-reactive with a statistically robust footing.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Dr. David Murphy, Visiting Professor at the Department of Law, LSE,</strong>&nbsp;commented &ldquo;As someone who has been studying the procyclicality of initial margin for some years, I am very happy to have been involved with this work. The importance of the measurement of procyclicality is increasingly recognised. For the first time, this paper presents a measure that allows different initial margin models to be robustly compared.&rdquo;</p>

<div> Female founders, FinTech growth, regional scaleups, UK FinTech, diversity<br />
Summary:<br />
Firms with female founders have higher turnover growth. Multi-founder FinTechs raise more funding. Regional UK FinTechs show potential for growth. Suggestions for entrepreneurs, investors, and policymakers. Innovate Finance, Whitecap Consulting, and Streets Consulting's research reveals insights into regional FinTech scaleups. <div>
<ul>
<li> <strong><span>Firms with female founders achieved over 30% more turnover growth than those with male only founders - yet only 16% of firms had a female founder</span></strong> </li>
<li> <strong><span>Firms in Lending, Banking, InsurTech, Money Management and WealthTech enjoy the strongest revenue growth</span></strong> </li>
<li> <strong><span>More than half of FinTechs had more than one founder; and the more founders, the higher their revenue growth rate</span></strong> </li>
<li> <strong><span>9 out of 10 firms that attended an accelerator went on to raise funding</span></strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Innovate Finance, Streets Consulting and Whitecap Consulting have published the &lsquo;Scaling UK Regional FinTech&rsquo; research report. The new, unique study, born from the collective expertise of the three organisations deeply embedded in the UK&rsquo;s FinTech ecosystem, provides valuable insights into accelerating the growth of regional scaleups* based outside of London and the South East.</span></p>
<p><span>The research project, undertaken by Whitecap Consulting and co-published with Innovate Finance and Streets Consulting, was designed to answer a fundamental question for the FinTech industry and the wider UK economy:&nbsp;</span><em><span>How do we enable more FinTech firms to successfully scale up in the UK?</span></em></p>
<p><span>The &lsquo;Scaling UK Regional FinTech&rsquo; research report delves into the growth and development data of 250 of the UK's regional FinTech scaleups outside of London and is supported by interviews with leaders and entrepreneurs. It reveals the challenges and opportunities FinTech scaleups face as they grow, navigate the current economic climate and strive to bring the innovation and growth that the UK economy needs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><strong><span>Background</span></strong></h4>
<p><span>According to the latest data published in the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.gov.uk%2Fgovernment%2Fpublications%2Fthe-kalifa-review-of-uk-fintech/1/0102018ee21d21c8-53339280-2740-4391-b321-2f38152a7004-000000/ESCnwv_UVcBIdwxgl9dLeUgmDPA=369" target="_blank"><span>Kalifa Review</span></a><span>, UK FinTech accounts for 10% of the global industry, comprising around 2,500 UK companies. The Kalifa Review also stated that by 2030, FinTech&rsquo;s direct Gross Value Add (GVA) contribution to the UK economy is predicted to reach&nbsp;</span><a href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fassets.publishing.service.gov.uk%2Fmedia%2F607979c7d3bf7f400f5b3c65%2FKalifaReviewofUKFintech01.pdf/1/0102018ee21d21c8-53339280-2740-4391-b321-2f38152a7004-000000/Jvec2T5ka-hBU3qM3Fd2xwPSgFM=369" target="_blank"><span>&pound;13.7bn</span></a><span>, with job creation contributing to 70% of this value.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The UK attracts more FinTech investment than the rest of Europe combined and is second only to the United States, according to the latest investment report by&nbsp;</span><a href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.innovatefinance.com%2Fcapital%2Ffintech-investment-landscape-2023%2F/1/0102018ee21d21c8-53339280-2740-4391-b321-2f38152a7004-000000/OB-CpKzTaED9ZpAyP15iilk4hc8=369" target="_blank"><span>Innovate Finance</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Six of the top 10 fintechs ranked by Fintech50 have headquarters in London.</span></p>
<p><span>As recently as the Autumn Statement 2023, the UK Chancellor announced a series of measures to support&nbsp;</span><a href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.innovatefinance.com%2Fpolicy-blogs%2Fautumn-statement-22nd-nov-headlines-key-points-for-fintechs%2F/1/0102018ee21d21c8-53339280-2740-4391-b321-2f38152a7004-000000/RAuGti8dU-hEF5SyHWgcWv6t830=369" target="_blank"><span>high-growth innovative FinTech companies in the UK</span></a><span>&nbsp;which struggle to raise scaleup capital.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In order to support the UK in its aspirations to grow the UK FinTech scaleup sector and maintain the UK&rsquo;s current position as a global leader in FinTech, Innovate Finance, Streets Consulting and Whitecap Consulting sought to understand the lessons that can be learned from FinTechs located outside London and the South East, all successfully scaling today.</span></p>
<h4><strong><span>Report Findings:</span></strong></h4>
<h5><strong><span>People</span></strong></h5>
<ul>
<li> <span>Firms with female founders achieved over 30% more turnover growth than those with male only founders - yet only 16% of firms had a female founder.</span> </li>
<li> <span>More than half of FinTechs had more than one founder; the average age of all founders is 38 years old.</span> </li>
<li> <span>The more founders, the higher their revenue growth rate (companies with up to 4 founders were part of the study).</span> </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong><span>Finances</span></strong></h5>
<ul>
<li> <span>Raising investment correlates to higher employee and revenue growth, but revenue grows at a proportionally lower rate.&nbsp;</span> </li>
<li> <span>9 out of 10 firms that attended an accelerator went on to raise funding.</span> </li>
<li> <span>Firms in Payments and WealthTech account for the largest number of scaleups, but PropTech firms are most likely to successfully raise funding.</span> </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong><span>Market</span></strong></h5>
<ul>
<li> <span>87% of FinTechs analysed have a B2B element to their go to market strategy, compared to 30% B2C (16% have both).</span> </li>
<li> <span>On average, B2C firms that obtain funding achieved double the revenue and employee growth of B2B only firms.</span> </li>
<li> <span>Firms in Lending, Banking, InsurTech, Money Management and WealthTech enjoy the strongest revenue growth.</span> </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong><span>Recommendations from the report</span></strong></h4>
<p><span>Based on the analysis and interviews undertaken during the research report, the evidence suggests the following actions would help create more FinTech scaleups across the UK:</span></p>
<h5><span>For entrepreneurs:</span></h5>
<ol>
<li><strong><span>Vocation, not location.</span></strong><span>&nbsp;What you do and how you do it will define your success, not your location.</span></li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t go it alone.&nbsp;</strong><span>FinTech firms with multiple founders are more likely to successfully scale.</span></li>
<li><strong>Ensure gender diversity</strong><span>. Firms with one or more female founders outperform male-only founder teams.</span></li>
<li><strong>Join an accelerator.&nbsp;</strong><span>Companies which were part of an accelerator raised investment more successfully; the coaching, guidance and contacts within accelerator cohorts can provide assistance as organisations scale.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<h5><span>For investors, policymakers and the wider FinTech sector:</span></h5>
<ol>
<li><strong><span>Think nationally.</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Our analysis shows that location doesn&rsquo;t matter, although being in a city has a positive impact on growth.</span></li>
<li><strong>Reduce risk for entrepreneurs.</strong><span>&nbsp;More support is required in terms of tax relief schemes and access to&nbsp;</span><span>funding.</span></li>
<li><strong>Encourage diversity in FinTech leadership.</strong><span>&nbsp;More initiatives are required, building on the new government taskforce to create dedicated funding for female-founded businesses and to provide support for other challenges faced by female entrepreneurs.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span>Janine Hirt, CEO of Innovate Finance, said:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>&ldquo;We are delighted to partner with Whitecap and Streets Consulting on this important piece of research providing insightful advice from FinTech scale ups and recommendations for policy-makers. The report tells the inspiring story of FinTech innovators across the UK, showing their incredible contributions and determination to grow successful businesses and drive so much positive change for a more democratic, transparent and inclusive financial services sector that benefits both consumers and businesses alike.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Julian Wells, Director &amp; FinTech Lead at Whitecap Consulting, said:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re delighted to present these findings to the FinTech community and we&rsquo;re proud to work with Innovate Finance and Streets Consulting to make this happen.&nbsp; The research highlights some fascinating and surprising trends, but also contains valuable advice from those founders who have &lsquo;been there and done that&rsquo; in terms of creating and growing new FinTechs.&nbsp; The main message for us from this report is that in today&rsquo;s world&nbsp;</span><em><span>where&nbsp;</span></em><span>you scale a business is nowhere near as important as&nbsp;</span><em><span>how&nbsp;</span></em><span>you scale a business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>He added:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>&ldquo;What is not a surprise to us, is to see so many regional FinTech innovators succeeding outside of London - there is an extremely vibrant ecosystem of FinTech innovators across all four corners of our nation.&nbsp; These are exactly the kinds of data and insights which can help shape the UK&rsquo;s effort to maintain its position as a true leader in global FinTech.&rdquo;</span></p>

<div> Partnership, Credit check, Dutch market, Open banking, Risk management
Summary:
Worldline and RiskQuest partner for credit check solutions tailored to the Dutch market, leveraging open banking capabilities for efficient, innovative, and secure credit assessment. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p><span>Worldline [Euronext: WLN], a global leader in payment services, has signed a partnership agreement with the leading risk consultancy firm in the Netherlands RiskQuest BV, part of the Zanders Group, to provide best-in-class credit check processes specific to the Dutch market. Worldline and RiskQuest will join forces to create an open banking-based credit analysis that addresses consumer, private and SME lending, and leasing in relation to the unique characteristics of the Dutch financial landscape. Through this partnership, Worldline's Credit Insight solution will incorporate RiskQuest's significant market expertise, bolstering the already industry-leading services available to Worldline customers.</span></p>
<p>Combining RiskQuest&rsquo;s significant experience and insights on the Dutch financial environment with Worldline&rsquo;s global status as an innovative partner for payment services, this partnership will leverage their joint capabilities and further enhance Worldline&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://worldline.com/en/home/main-navigation/resources/resources-hub/blogs/2023/the-benefits-of-open-banking-and-the-power-of-worldline-credit-insight-solution.html">Credit Insight solution</a>&nbsp;which was launched last year. Creating a credit risk analysis solution that is adapted to the unique needs of the Dutch market and is available in a single API, provides a huge advantage as it eliminates the need for multiple connections and multiple formats from and towards many banks.

<div> Tokyo, Singapore, derivatives trading, Asia-Pacific, survey<br />
Summary:
- Tokyo and Singapore to dominate derivatives trading
- Japan's potential for interest rate and FX derivatives
- Optimism about growth potential in IRD and FX trading in Asia
- India seen as having more derivatives market potential than China
- International Swaps and Derivatives Association’s (ISDA) 38th Annual General Meeting features key speakers and sessions <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Tokyo and Singapore will be the top locations for derivatives trading in the Asia-Pacific region over the next three to five years, according to market participants who responded to a survey to mark the start of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association&rsquo;s (ISDA) 38<span>th</span>&nbsp;Annual General Meeting (AGM) in Tokyo on April 16-18.</p>
<p>Asked to rank the importance of a selection of Asia-Pacific cities, respondents cited Singapore (with a ranking score of 4.23), Tokyo (4.08), Hong Kong (3.74), Shanghai (3.73) and Sydney (3.63).</p>
<p>Nearly two-thirds (64.6%) of respondents anticipate a shift to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.boj.or.jp/en/mopo/mpmdeci/mpr_2024/k240319a.pdf">higher interest rates</a>&nbsp;will be a catalyst for increased interest rate derivatives (IRD) activity and risk management in Japan. Close to half (45.6%) believe Japan&rsquo;s share of global foreign exchange (FX) derivatives trading will increase given government debt levels, economic activity and currency volatility. According to the&nbsp;<a href="https://data.bis.org/topics/DER/tables-and-dashboards">Bank for International Settlements (BIS) latest triennial survey</a>, the share of IRD and FX derivatives global average daily turnover reported by sales desks in Japan stood at 0.9% and 4%, respectively, in April 2022.</p>
<p>The overwhelming majority of survey participants (93%) stated that derivatives will be important in realizing the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsa.go.jp/en/policy/pjlamc/20231214.html">Japanese government&rsquo;s ambition</a>&nbsp;to position the country as a hub for asset management, with 50.0% identifying derivatives as very or extremely important.</p>
<p>Market participants are also optimistic about the growth potential of IRD trading in Asia excluding Japan in the coming three to five years. Two-thirds of respondents (65.6%) expect an expansion of the region&rsquo;s share of IRD global average daily turnover, which stood at 11% in April 2022 (based on location of the sales desks), according to the BIS. Interest rate volatility and economic growth were cited as potential catalysts.</p>
<p>FX derivatives trading in Asia ex-Japan is similarly expected to grow from its current level of 22% of global average daily turnover based on BIS 2022 triennial survey analysis. The proportion reported by sales desks in the region is anticipated to increase at least moderately over the next three to five years by 72% of respondents, with 22% believing it will rise substantially. Global trade partnerships and enhanced credit activities are identified as potential drivers. Just 5% of respondents think the share of FX trading will fall.</p>
<p>India was seen as having more derivatives market potential than China by 75% of respondents, with economic growth and the development of capital and financial markets the most cited reasons.</p>
<p>The survey involved 155 global market participants with operations and/or activity in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s AGM features sessions on the economic outlook in Japan and geopolitical risks in Asia Pacific and beyond. The event also includes panels on regulatory efforts to address perceived vulnerabilities posed by non-bank financial intermediation, the global impact of US Treasury clearing requirements and the cost of implementing Basel III.</p>
<p>Keynote speakers include&nbsp;<span>Rostin Behnam</span>, Chairman of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission,&nbsp;<span>Marco Casalaina</span>, Vice President of Products at Azure AI,&nbsp;<span>Masahiko Kato</span>, president and CEO of Mizuho Bank,&nbsp;<span>Teruhisa Kurita</span>, Commissioner at Japan&rsquo;s Financial Services Agency,&nbsp;<span>Thomas Montag</span>, CEO of Rubicon Carbon,&nbsp;<span>Yutaka Nakajima</span>, Deputy President Director, Representative Executive Officer, Nomura Holdings,&nbsp;<span>Seiichi Shimizu</span>, Executive Director, Bank of Japan, and&nbsp;<span>Eiji Ueda</span>, Executive Managing Director and Chief Investment Officer, Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF), Japan.</p>

<div> Securities and Exchange Commission, Enforcement Director, AI, investors, compliance<br />
Summary:<br />
SEC Enforcement Director discusses risks of AI in financial markets, urges proactive compliance to avoid potential investor harm. <div>
<p>Professor Arlen, thank you for the introduction, and thank you to PCCE for inviting me to participate in today&rsquo;s 10<span>th</span>&nbsp;anniversary program.</p>
<p>As is customary, my remarks this afternoon are in my official capacity as SEC Enforcement Director, and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Commission, the Commissioners, or other members of the staff.</p>
<p>One of the hallmarks of PCCE is that it brings together academics, regulators, and industry professionals, and allows us to have candid conversations about corporate misconduct and the ways in which we can all work together to improve compliance.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s precisely what I&rsquo;d like to do this afternoon. As we gather to mark ten years of dialogue, I think it&rsquo;s important to both summarize what we&rsquo;ve learned during this period and see how we can leverage those lessons to effect better compliance in the future.</p>
<p>If the last decade has shown us anything in this regard, it&rsquo;s that many of the major financial scandals of the time have had a number of things in common. And that is, when you combine charismatic leaders with strong investor interest, noncompliance, weak controls, or under-empowered gatekeepers, it creates a perfect storm of risk and the potential for great investor harm.</p>
<p>Most recently, we&rsquo;ve seen these storms ravage investors in the crypto markets with the spectacular collapses of FTX and Terraform, among others.</p>
<p>With respect to the former, it&rsquo;s been referred to as one of the largest financial frauds in U.S. history, and it&rsquo;s principal architect was recently sentenced to 25 years in federal prison.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-pcce-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Tellingly, John Ray, who was appointed FTX CEO as part of its bankruptcy proceedings, observed that &ldquo;in his 40 years of legal and restructuring experience,&rdquo; which included the Enron bankruptcy, he had never seen &ldquo;such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-pcce-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>With respect to the latter, just over a week ago, the SEC prevailed on its fraud claims against Terraform and its founder Do Kwon.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-pcce-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;A jury in the Southern District of New York found the defendants liable for misleading investors in multiple ways before the collapse of their stablecoin, along with the rest of their ecosystem, in 2022. That collapse wiped out $40 billion from the crypto markets, decimated countless investors, and precipitated a chain of bankruptcies and events that ultimately contributed to the Crypto Winter of 2022.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-pcce-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Now, I recently spoke at length about our efforts to address this decade of non-compliance and investor harm in the crypto markets, and won&rsquo;t go further into other examples of similar misconduct today. I&rsquo;ll simply note they exist.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-pcce-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not just in the crypto markets. We experienced perfect storms of risk during the SPAC boom with frauds like the one that the SEC alleges was perpetrated by Trevor Milton and the EV company, Nikola.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-pcce-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;And we&rsquo;ve seen them in any number of recent alleged frauds by founders, including the collapse of Theranos and the prosecutions of its founders Elizabeth Holmes and Sunny Balwani.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-pcce-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>I am certain that those who have studied these and other recent financial frauds at greater length than me, or than my remarks allow discussing, will undoubtedly point to other contributing or distinguishing factors. But at minimum, one throughline is that&nbsp;<i>elevated investor interest</i>&nbsp;in rapidly developing technology or offerings often leads to&nbsp;<i>elevated investor risk</i>.</p>
<p>Put another way: any time you have individuals or corporations trying to capitalize and profit on FOMO, or the &ldquo;fear of missing out,&rdquo; around a new technology or offering, it should raise red flags for regulators and compliance professionals alike. After all, effective enforcement and governance require anticipating risk areas.</p>
<p>So looking ahead, where do we see potential risk?</p>
<p>Every day, we see revolutionary technological advancements in artificial intelligence, or AI, that promise to transform nearly every aspect of our lives, including our financial decision making.</p>
<p>Every day, we see individuals, corporations, analysts, and others touting these developments.</p>
<p>Every day, we see investors looking to incorporate AI into their investment strategies, or using it to analyze and recommend investments.</p>
<p>Every day, we see companies attempting to not only develop AI capabilities, or harness it to improve their productivity and growth, but also to attract and retain investors.</p>
<p>And in the end, every day, we see investors making larger and larger investments in these issuers or financial products.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-pcce-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p>Indeed, according to a recent survey, 61% of investors believe that faster adoption of AI is very, or extremely, important to a company&rsquo;s value.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-pcce-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;That jumps to 85% when including investors who believe it is moderately important.</p>
<p>As a result, it may be an understatement to say that there is not only immense investor interest, but also immense market interest, in AI.</p>
<p>While perhaps not quite yet a perfect storm, there&rsquo;s certainly one brewing around AI. And it is incumbent on each of us to make sure it does not come to pass and that investors are not harmed by noncompliance with the securities laws when it comes to this new technology.</p>
<p>How then should we be preparing for, and addressing, these potential risks?</p>
<p>Our experience with ESG investing provides an instructive starting point. With ESG, we saw large swaths of investors become interested in firms and companies that incorporated ESG into their investment strategies and business plans.</p>
<p>That meant that companies had meaningful financial incentives to exaggerate, or make misleading statements about, their supposed ESG activities or products. After all, saying that you have an investment strategy or business plan that incorporates ESG considerations is pretty easy; creating one and sticking to it is another matter. And over the last several years, we have brought a number of enforcement actions addressing this type of misconduct.</p>
<p>For example, the SEC charged a Deutsche Bank subsidiary with making materially misleading statements about its supposed ESG-related investment products.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-pcce-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;According to the SEC&rsquo;s order in that case, the firm marketed itself as a&nbsp;<i>leader</i>&nbsp;in ESG and claimed that it adhered to specific policies for integrating ESG considerations into its investments. It even advertised that ESG was in its &ldquo;DNA.&rdquo; But as it turned out, the firm did not ensure that its investment professionals actually followed all aspects of the ESG investment processes that it marketed. In the end, it paid a $19 million civil penalty to settle those claims.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, we are now seeing the same thing with AI. Just last month, the SEC announced settled charges against two registered investment advisers for making false and misleading statements about their purported use of AI.</p>
<p>One firm claimed it used it to analyze client data and predict which companies were going to &ldquo;make it big.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-pcce-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;The other claimed it provided &ldquo;expert AI-driven forecasts.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-pcce-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;Both statements were false and misleading. Neither had the AI capabilities that they claimed.</p>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p>I hope these actions put the investment industry on notice. If you are rushing to make claims about using AI in your investment processes to capitalize on growing investor interest, stop. Take a step back, and ask yourselves: do these representations accurately reflect what we are doing or are they simply aspirational?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s the latter, your actions may constitute the type of &ldquo;AI-washing&rdquo; that violates the federal securities laws.</p>
<p>The bottom line: you must ensure that your representations regarding your use of AI are not materially false or misleading.</p>
<p>Now, I know that many of you here are in-house counsel and compliance personnel at public companies. AI-washing is not just an issue for investment firms; it should concern each of you as well.</p>
<p>There are any number of reasons that a public company may disclose AI-related information. It may be in the business of developing AI applications. It may use AI capabilities in its own operations to increase efficiency and value for shareholders. Or, it may discuss security risks or competitive risks from AI.</p>
<p>But irrespective of the context, if you&rsquo;re speaking on AI, you too must ensure that you do so in a manner that is not materially false or misleading. This becomes ever more significant as AI-related disclosures by SEC registrants are increasing.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-pcce-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p>So how do you help ensure that your companies and clients comply with securities law requirements as they relate to AI?</p>
<p>Here, I think we can draw from general principles of what I&rsquo;ve called &ldquo;proactive compliance.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-pcce-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;As I&rsquo;ve said before, proactive compliance requires three things: education, engagement, and execution.</p>
<p>First,&nbsp;<span><i>educate</i></span>&nbsp;yourselves about emerging and heightened AI risk areas as they relate to your businesses. That means reading the AI-related enforcement actions I mentioned. It means reviewing any future enforcement actions that may follow in this space.</p>
<p>It also means reviewing speeches like Chair Gensler&rsquo;s recent speech on AI, which highlighted multiple other ways in which a firm&rsquo;s AI use may heighten risk or implicate the federal securities laws.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-pcce-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;He specifically discussed the conflicts of interests raised by AI for advisers, the problems presented by AI hallucinations, and the threat that AI could pose to the stability of our markets.</p>
<p>And it means staying abreast of how potential AI-related issues are actually impacting companies in the real world. Take for example, the recent reporting around an airline&rsquo;s chatbot offering a customer incorrect information about its refund policy.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-pcce-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a></p>
<p>Second, take what you&rsquo;ve learned from our orders and public pronouncements, and your own research, and&nbsp;<span><i>engage</i></span>&nbsp;with personnel inside your company&rsquo;s different business units to learn how AI intersects with their activities, strategies, risks, financial incentives, and so on.</p>
<p>Ask: what public statements are we making about our incorporation of AI into our business operations? Are they accurate, or are they aspirational? Does AI present a material risk to our business operations in some way?</p>
<p>Now, is the time to engage.</p>
<p>And third,&nbsp;<span><i>execute</i></span>. Does your use of AI require updating policies and procedures and internal controls? If so, are those policies and procedures bespoke to your company? And here, let me be clear: it&rsquo;s not enough to go to ChatGPT or a similar tool and ask it to produce an AI policy for you.</p>
<p>And then, have you taken the steps necessary to implement those policies and procedures? As we have seen time and again, adoption is only part of the battle; effective execution is equally important and that&rsquo;s where many firms fall short.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-pcce-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></p>
<p>Let me finish by touching on a topic that comes up often in these conversations: individual liability. As I mentioned, a public company may find it necessary to disclose information regarding security risks from AI. In fact, by some measures, most public company disclosures about AI relate to security and competitive risks from AI.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-pcce-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a>&nbsp;Individual liability for disclosure failures related to AI as a security threat may therefore be of particular interest to you.</p>
<p>Here, I would look to our approach to cybersecurity disclosure failures generally: we look at what a person actually knew or should have known; what the person actually did or did not do; and how that measures up to the standards of our statutes, rules, and regulations. And as I&rsquo;ve said before in the context of CCO and CISO liability, and I will say it again in the context of AI-related risk disclosures: folks who operate in good faith and take reasonable steps are unlikely to hear from us.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-pcce-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a></p>
<p class="text-align-center">***</p>
<p>In the end, while AI may be transformative to many aspects of our lives, the SEC&rsquo;s experience with other developing technologies and investment products illustrates not only the elevated investor risk presented by potentially false or misleading claims about its use, but also the steps market participants can take to help ensure compliance with AI-related disclosures and how we might approach liability in this area.</p>
<p>I look forward to working with you to further our shared goal of protecting investors, while harnessing the benefits of AI and avoiding the next perfect storm of risk.</p>
<p>Thank you again to PCCE for the invitation and congratulations on 10 years of these types of candid conversations.</p>
<p>I now look forward to discussing a few additional topics with Professor Arlen and with each of you.</p>

<div> consent order, restitution, civil monetary penalty, fraud, CFTC<br />
Summary: The CFTC imposed a consent order for fraud, requiring $4.5 million in restitution and a civil penalty against Nawabi Enterprises for forex trading fraud. <br /><br /> <div>
<p><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced the entry of a consent order in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California imposing restitution and a civil monetary penalty against&nbsp;<span>Eshaq M. Nawabi,&nbsp;</span>d/b/a/<span>&nbsp;Nawabi Enterprise,</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span>Hyperion Consulting Inc.</span>&nbsp;The order requires the defendants to pay $4.5 million in restitution to victims of the fraud and a $4.5 million civil monetary penalty.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Today&rsquo;s order follows a prior consent order the court entered on December 6, 2023, which, in addition to finding the defendants liable for fraud, enjoins them from future violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations, as charged in the complaint, and permanently bans them from registering with the CFTC and trading on any registered entity. Today&rsquo;s order fully resolves the CFTC action filed on April 26, 2022. [See CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8524-22">8524-22</a>].</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Case Background</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The order finds from approximately October 2019<span>&nbsp;</span>through April 22, 2022, the defendants solicited pool participants to deposit money to trade forex. To persuade pool participants to send them money, the defendants made fraudulent and material misrepresentations and omissions including: the defendants had historically made large profits (between 8&ndash;25% per month) for themselves and pool participants from trading forex; pool participants would realize profits of 8&ndash;25% per month on their funds with minimal risk; the defendants would trade forex with the funds the pool participants deposited; and upon request, pool participants could withdraw their money within three to five business days of any such requests. Instead of trading pool participant funds as promised, the defendants misappropriated the pool participants&rsquo; money for Nawabi&rsquo;s own personal benefit as well as to pay other pool participants in a manner akin to a Ponzi scheme. To conceal their misappropriation, the defendants created and issued false account statements that misrepresented trading returns the pool participants supposedly earned. The defendants failed to return funds to the pool participants despite repeated requests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The CFTC cautions that orders requiring repayment of funds to victims may not always result in the recovery of lost money because the wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this case are Sarah Matlack Wastler, James H. Holl, III, Maura Viehmeyer, Erica Bodin, and Rick Glaser.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>******</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>CFTC&rsquo;s Forex</span>&nbsp;<span>Fraud Advisory</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The CFTC has issued several customer protection&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/index.htm">Fraud Advisories and Articles</a>&nbsp;that provide the warning signs of fraud, including the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/ConsumerProtection/FraudAwarenessPrevention/CFTCFraudAdvisories/fraudadv_forex.html">Foreign Currency (Forex) Trading Fraud Advisory</a>, which alerts customers to forex fraud and lists simple ways to spot forex scams.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The CFTC also strongly urges the public to verify a company&rsquo;s registration with the CFTC before committing funds. If unregistered, a customer should be wary of providing funds to that entity. A company&rsquo;s registration status can be found using&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nfa.futures.org/basicnet">NFA BASIC</a>.</span></span></p>

<div> Joint Forum, financial market regulators, artificial intelligence, Total Cost Reporting, digital transformation
Summary: 
The Joint Forum of Canadian financial market regulators discussed AI, Total Cost Reporting, and digital transformation at their annual meeting.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The Joint Forum of Financial Market Regulators (Joint Forum) held its annual meeting on April 10, 2024, bringing together members of the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA), the Canadian Council of Insurance Regulators (CCIR), the Canadian Association of Pension Supervisory Authorities (CAPSA) and representatives from the Canadian Insurance Services Regulatory Organizations (CISRO), as well as the Mortgage Broker Regulators&rsquo; Council of Canada (MBRCC).<br /><br />As part of the plenary session, moderated by the Chair of the CSA Financial Innovation Hub Lise Estelle Brault, Joint Forum regulators heard from experts on how artificial intelligence (AI) technologies bring emerging benefits for financial markets participants, but also pose new risks.<br /><br />&ldquo;We are adapting to the new and ever-evolving dynamics of regulation in a digital world. The integration of AI can lead to the development of new financial products and services but can also create new risks and the need for new governance considerations,&rdquo; said Stan Magidson, CSA Chair and Chair and CEO of the Alberta Securities Commission. &ldquo;As regulators, we will maintain fair and efficient capital markets and remain vigilant in promoting the responsible development of AI in finance.&rdquo;<br /><br />Luc Sirois, Chief Innovator and President of the Council of Innovation of the Government of Qu&eacute;bec, shared his perspectives on digital transformation in the different financial sectors and the need to connect research and practice through inter-disciplinary collaboration. He noted that such advances have disruptive potential that requires enhanced partnership between government and business to address challenges, such as speed of technological change.<br /><br />Joint Forum members provided updates on important initiatives within their organizations. Members also discussed key information on the cross-sectoral efforts to implement the Total Cost Reporting (TCR) reforms, which are aimed at increasing investors&rsquo; and policyholders&rsquo; awareness of the ongoing costs of owning investment funds and individual segregated fund contracts. The TCR Implementation Committee, established in 2023 to provide guidance and assistance to registrants and insurers as they operationalize the enhancements, presented current work being completed to support the transition. Angela Mazerolle, CAPSA Chair and Vice-President, Regulatory Operations with the New Brunswick Financial and Consumer Services Commission stated &ldquo;CAPSA continues to support the important work of the Joint Forum and the sharing of information between the member organizations. We were pleased to report on our work in updating the 2004 Guidelines for Capital Accumulation Plans, originally developed by the Joint Forum, with the intention to have this important updated Guideline finalized this summer.&rdquo; Huston Loke, Chair of CCIR and Executive Vice President, Market Conduct at FSRA also added &ldquo;Consumers are better protected when the performance and costs of the funds they own are disclosed on a consistent and harmonized basis The Total Cost Reporting project is a testament to the Canadian Council of Insurance Regulators&rsquo; (CCIR) and the Canadian Securities Administrators&rsquo; shared commitment to supporting a stable and innovative marketplace in which industry can compete and the Canadian public can have confidence that consumers are being treated fairly.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>The CSA</strong>, the council of the securities regulators of Canada&rsquo;s provinces and territories, co-ordinates and harmonizes regulation for the Canadian capital markets.</p>
<p><strong>CCIR</strong>&nbsp;is an inter-jurisdictional association of insurance regulators. The mandate of the CCIR is to facilitate and promote an efficient and effective insurance regulatory system in Canada to serve the public interest.<br /><br /><strong>CAPSA</strong>&nbsp;is a national association of pension regulators whose mission is to facilitate an efficient and effective pension regulatory system in Canada. It develops practical solutions to further the coordination and harmonization of pension regulation across Canada.</p>

<title>ISDA derivatiViews: Capital For Clearing Must Be Risk Appropriate</title>

<div> capital requirements, derivatives, US banks, central clearing, risk management services
Summary:<br />US capital proposals would significantly increase capital requirements for derivatives, impacting US banks' ability to provide risk management services and access to central clearing.<br /> <div>
<p>Our analysis of the US capital proposals paints a very clear picture &ndash; the rules would dramatically increase capital requirements for derivatives, which will impact the ability of US banks to provide intermediary and risk management services. The consequences are particularly stark for the provision of access to central clearing, an activity that is widely seen as risk reducing yet faces an eye-watering capital increase because of the proposals.</p>
<p>According to the results of an industry impact analysis based on input from US global systemically important banks (G-SIBs), the proposed Basel III &lsquo;endgame&rsquo; and G-SIB surcharge rules would increase capital for client clearing businesses by more than 80%. A tax of this size on a low-risk, low-margin business will inevitably affect the ability of US banks to offer client clearing services, reducing capacity and increasing costs.</p>
<p>Mandatory central clearing of derivatives has been a regulatory priority since the 2008 financial crisis as a means of reducing counterparty credit risk. And it has worked well. According to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/a/pOlgE/SwapsInfo-Full-Year-2023-and-the-Fourth-Quarter-of-2023-Review.pdf">ISDA&rsquo;s SwapsInfo</a>, which is based on transactions reported to the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation&rsquo;s swap data repository under US Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulations, 78.2% of interest rate derivatives traded notional was cleared in 2023. Following adoption of rules by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last December, mandatory clearing is now being extended to certain US Treasury securities &ndash; a policy&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-247">SEC chair Gary Gensler</a>&nbsp;says will &ldquo;help to make the Treasury market more efficient, competitive and resilient&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The US capital proposals contradict that. Imposing such a burdensome tax would be inconsistent with the post-financial crisis policy objective to promote central clearing and would serve as a retrograde step by reducing the capacity of banks to support this business.</p>
<p>The increase comes from two specific elements of the proposals. First, changes in the US Basel III proposals, which include counting the client-facing leg of a cleared derivatives transaction in the credit valuation adjustment framework, will&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/01/16/isda-and-sifma-response-to-us-basel-iii-npr/">add $2 billion to US G-SIB capital requirements</a>. Second, proposed modifications to the complexity and interconnectedness categories of the G-SIB surcharge to include client derivatives cleared under the agency model, among other things, will&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/01/16/isda-and-sifma-response-to-g-sib-surcharge-framework-consultation/">add $5.2 billion to required capital</a>.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve set out our concerns to US prudential regulators and have proposed a variety of calibration changes to make the rules more risk appropriate. We will continue to warn that these regulations risk inhibiting the ability of banks to provide vital intermediation services, including access to clearing for their clients.</p>
<p>We strongly believe central clearing has made the derivatives market safer and more efficient, an opinion widely shared by regulators and academics. Given that, we see no basis for justifying such a large increase in capital for this business. We continue to advocate for capital rules that are appropriate and risk sensitive. We feel the US prudential approach on clearing is neither.</p>
<p><span>This topic will be discussed at ISDA&rsquo;s Annual General Meeting in Japan on April 16-18. It&rsquo;s the last chance to register,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://agm.isda.org/"><span>so sign up today</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<title>There’s Got To Be A Better Way: Statement Of Dissent Regarding Wayzata Investment Partners LLC, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, April 15, 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Commission, pay-to-play rule, investment adviser, campaign contribution, political process
<br />
The Commission settled a case under the pay-to-play rule. The rule penalizes covered associates for political donations, hampering political participation. Dissent supports legitimate political involvement.
<br /> 
Summary: The pay-to-play rule penalizes investment advisers for political donations, hampering political involvement and disadvantaging industry candidates. <div>
<p>Today the Commission instituted and settled an administrative proceeding under the investment adviser pay-to-play rule.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-wayzata-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;The facts here are similar to those of other pay-to-play cases: In April 2022, a covered associate of an investment adviser made a campaign contribution to a candidate for elected office. The office the candidate sought had influence over selecting investment advisers for a state investment board. The Commission&rsquo;s order, however, does not allege any link between the donation and the investments. In fact, the state investment board had invested in closed-end funds advised by Respondent several years prior to the contribution. Respondent&rsquo;s violation stems not from any attempt to obtain additional investments from the state investment board, but from the fact that it continued to provide advisory services for compensation in connection with the board&rsquo;s longstanding closed-end fund investments. This case is yet another illustration of the overbreadth of the pay-to-play rule and another reminder of the way the rule hampers legitimate political participation. Accordingly, I did not support the case.</p>
<p>I have dissented from past pay-to-play cases,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-wayzata-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;but write again to underscore the serious consequences of the rule on the political process. If a person covered by the rule&mdash;and that includes, among others, general partners, managing members, executive officers, employees who solicit a government entity for the investment adviser, and their supervisors<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-wayzata-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&mdash;makes a donation of more than $350,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-wayzata-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;the investment adviser cannot provide investment advice for compensation for two years after the donation. The rule allows for exemptions,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-wayzata-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;but the Commission has rarely granted them. To avoid questions from Commission examiners, the easiest course is not to contribute to political campaigns. So, the cost of working for an investment adviser is that you have to give up your right to contribute to certain political campaigns.</p>
<p>A further repercussion of the rule that was recently brought to my attention is that an investment adviser who chooses to run for office cannot collect campaign donations from acquaintances and supporters in the industry. Not being able to solicit for campaign contributions people with whom you have worked for years is a serious disadvantage to political candidates coming from the investment advisory industry. This consequence of our pay-to-play rule is yet another reason to worry that it impedes political participation.</p>
<p>The concerns about public corruption underlying the rule are worthy of attention. Politicians should not select advisers to manage public funds based on who has made the highest campaign contributions. But there has to be a better way to get at public corruption. Other government bodies exist to pursue such misconduct, and we are able to bring cases when there has been actual adviser misconduct involving payments to public officials.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-wayzata-041524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;Pursuing instances in which public officials, for personal or political benefit, have entrusted public money to advisers is vital. By contrast, a rule that penalizes people already subject to fiduciary obligations who donate money without any intent to do anything other than express their political preferences does not improve the political process.</p>

<div> Euronext, Mid-Point Match, dark trading, liquidity, execution quality <br />
Summary:
Euronext launches Mid-Point Match with dark, mid-point, and sweep functionalities for increased liquidity and accurate execution with no latency. <br /> <div>
<p align="justify"><span>Euronext, the leading pan-European market infrastructure, today announced the successful launch of Euronext Mid-Point Match, its advanced suite of dark, mid-point and sweep functionalities embedded within Euronext's Central Order Book. These enhancements allow trading members and buy-side firms to trade at the real mid-point, without incurring implicit latency costs, to access increased liquidity, while tapping into Euronext&rsquo;s unique pool of liquidity fostered by local brokers and investors. First introduced on the Brussels market on 18 March 2024, Euronext Mid-Point Match was launched across all Euronext markets on 8 April 2024.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Euronext Mid-Point Match offers a sweep functionality, allowing intermediaries to leverage both Euronext&rsquo;s dark and lit liquidity pools, to increase execution opportunities and flexibility across Euronext seven regulated markets. Dark orders in Euronext Mid-Point Match are pegged to the real-time mid-point of the Euronext Primary Best Bid and Offer, and provide traders with accurate execution opportunities. This results in lower market impact compared to London-based Multilateral Trading Facilities, which typically exhibit a 7-8 millisecond delay in displaying the Primary mid-point. Furthermore, dark-to-lit sweep orders interact seamlessly with the Euronext Central Order Book with zero latency, facilitating swift and efficient execution.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Under the Reference Price Waiver for small trades and Large In Scale Waiver for block trades, investors benefit from flexibility in their execution strategies.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>To safeguard execution quality, Euronext Mid-Point Match offers Minimum Acceptable Quantity and Minimum Execution Size features, providing traders with additional control over their orders.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Nicolas Rivard, Global Head of Cash Equity and Data Services at Euronext, said:&nbsp;</span><span>&ldquo;We are proud to offer a dark trading facility to our clients, to provide them with enhanced execution opportunities. Thanks to our state-of-the-art Core Data Centre, Euronext Mid-Point Match offers a high value proposition with no latency, no new membership, and direct access to Europe&rsquo;s largest liquidity pool, as well as the possibility to switch from dark to lit books when trading. Since 18 March, we have been pleased to see new members joining at a strong pace.&rdquo;</span></p>

<li><strong>Scope for central government arm&rsquo;s length bodies</strong>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;size thresholds have been clarified to include&nbsp;total operating income and funding received (including grant-in-aid) exceeding &pound;500 million. This is relevant for Arm&rsquo;s Length Bodies that rely on sponsor departments for income rather than from sales of goods and services.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Sector specific and industrial grouping</strong>&nbsp;- additional guidance clarifying where entities&rsquo; operations partially fall into TCFD&rsquo;s sector and industrial group guidance has been clarified.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Reporting requirements for principal risks</strong>&nbsp;- a table and flow chart have been added to aid preparers in identifying reporting requirements depending on whether climate is a principal risk.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Reporting boundaries</strong>&nbsp;- additional details was added setting out the qualitative and quantitative disclosures, which have been clarified, focusing on entity-level reporting (rather than group-level reporting) for the latter.</li>
<li><strong>Assurance arrangements</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; simplified the technical wording on assurance procedures.</li>
<li><strong>Opportunities</strong>&nbsp;- added high-level guidance on reporting climate-related opportunities, leveraging from existing performance reporting principles.</li>
</ul>

<p>This Exposure Draft is to consult on new climate-related financial disclosures in entity-level annual reports that align with the TCFD&rsquo;s recommendations.</p>
<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>The Phase 2 Exposure Draft addresses the recommended disclosures for the Risk Management and Metrics and Targets pillars of the TCFD framework.</p>
<p>Preparers, experts, and other stakeholders from across central government and the wider public sector are asked to provide feedback on the proposed public sector adaptations, interpretations, and considerations &ndash; as well as the overall completeness and clarity of the guidance.</p>
<h4 id="structure">Structure</h4>
<p>This application guidance is additive, with Phase 2 expanding on the&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tcfd-aligned-disclosure-application-guidance">TCFD-aligned disclosure application guidance for Phase 1</a>. The Phase 1 application guidance was published in July 2023 and addresses the recommended disclosures for the Governance pillar, applying to in-scope central government bodies&rsquo; annual reports and accounts from 2023-24.</p>
<h4 id="remit">Remit</h4>
<p>This Exposure Draft covers the whole UK public sector, which is the boundary for the Whole of Government Accounts. However, the relevant authority for each jurisdiction within that boundary will have their own due process for proposing and approving changes to their reporting regime. This consultation does not supplant those processes.</p>
<p>The proposed changes are published for comment only. The proposals may be modified before being formally presented to the Financial Reporting Advisory Board (FRAB) for its approval.</p>
<h4 id="effective-date">Effective date</h4>
<p>The proposed effective date for central government bodies is 1 April 2024, with Phase 2 disclosures required in annual reports and accounts for 2024-25 on a comply or explain basis.</p>
<p>Other public sector bodies should follow the direction from their respective relevant authority. Public sector bodies may choose to voluntarily apply this guidance - in full or in part.</p>

<div> Hong Kong, Spot ETFs, ETC Group, Approval, Bitcoin
Summary:
Spot ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum approved in Hong Kong, reflecting global impact and establishing crypto as investable assets. Long-term demand expected to increase. Target price revisions predicted to exceed $100k by 2025.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Following the approval of Spot Bitcoin and Spot Ethereum ETFs by Hong Kong&rsquo;s Securities and Futures Commission, Tim Bevan, CEO at ETC Group, has commented below. ETC Group is Europe&rsquo;s leading provider of institutional-grade exchange-traded products in digital assets. In 2020, ETC Group blazed a trail in the industry with the debut of the ETC Group Physical Bitcoin ETP as the first crypto-linked product on XETRA, recognised by its ticker BTCE. Continuing the innovative streak, recent additions to ETC Group's market-leading product line-up include ET32, a unique total return Ethereum staking ETP linked to a transparent staking benchmark, and DA20, the only broad-market Crypto Basket ETP tracking an MSCI digital assets benchmark of the top 20 investable cryptocurrencies.</p>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tim Bevan commented. &ldquo;Hong Kong approving spot ETFs soon after the announcement of the LSE reiterates the global ripple effect of the spot ETF approvals in the US. This is further confirmation that Bitcoin is now an established investable asset amongst the traditional finance community globally and will create further demand pressure over time. Whilst we may see short-term volatility around the halving event and the escalation of geopolitical risk, the long-term supply/demand dynamics are skewed heavily to the upside, and we expect to see target price revisions for 2025 well in excess of $100k.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Speech</h3>
<h4><a id="_Hlk163427203"></a>Innovation in money and payments</h4>
<p>The money we use to support economic and financial activity, and the payment systems we use as we do so, are fundamental to the Bank of England&rsquo;s role to maintain monetary and financial stability. Money and payments have been no stranger to technological innovation over many centuries.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;But the pace, breadth and depth of technological change we see now suggests even more radical change may be ahead of us.</p>
<p>My aim today is to set out how the Bank of England is seeking to ensure that we will be able both to capture the benefits of these advances and to ensure they are safe. I&rsquo;ll discuss how, as we consider the payments landscape in its entirety, we are increasingly focused on innovation in wholesale payments and the importance of payments innovation by banks. We&rsquo;ll publish a Discussion Paper on these areas this summer to draw on input and collaboration from the private sector, as a complement to the work we&rsquo;ve been doing on stablecoin regulation and retail central bank digital currency (CBDC).</p>
<p>Looking back nearly five years ago, Facebook and others proposed a Libra stablecoin that aimed to apply technologies pioneered in the crypto-asset ecosystem to retail payments in the real-world on a global scale. That was somewhat of a bolt from the blue.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[2]</a></sup>&nbsp;It reminded us in the UK that, notwithstanding an apparently quick and seamless payments experience for many people (with near ubiquitous contactless card payments and new wallet apps like Apple Pay), technological innovation in money and payments was far from over.</p>
<p>Today, we see examples of interbank retail payment systems around the world &ndash; the Unified Payments Interface in India, Pix in Brazil, Swish in Sweden &ndash; that are used alongside cards for retail payments in a way that doesn&rsquo;t yet happen in the UK. Individuals can pay retailers in-store or online out of their bank accounts without going via cards &ndash; offering savings particularly for small businesses.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[3]</a></sup>&nbsp;And people increasingly make payments between different banks using only the recipient&rsquo;s mobile phone number or a QR code.</p>
<p>As we look ahead, we appear to be on the cusp of widespread, more fundamental technological change. Technologies loosely grouped under the broad heading of &lsquo;tokenisation&rsquo; &ndash; distributed ledger technology (DLT) and the potential for atomic settlement and programmability, as pioneered in crypto-asset markets &ndash; have the potential to offer greater efficiency and functionality for &lsquo;real world&rsquo; retail and wholesale payments. That innovation matters for our role in maintaining monetary and financial stability, and also has the potential to offer significant benefits for customers and businesses, economic activity and growth.</p>
<p>In retail payments (the high volume, low value payments made between households and businesses), our experiments with the private sector and the London Centre of the Bank for International Settlements&rsquo; Innovation Hub have already shown how use cases for these technologies can embed payments more deeply, automatically and efficiently into our increasingly digital lives.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Such technologies can enhance online shopping by enabling a buyer&rsquo;s funds to be reserved at time of purchase and automatically released to the seller only once physical delivery of goods is confirmed. That could enable greater competition in online retail if consumers are more confident to shop online with a new merchant or platform. Similarly (and perhaps I&rsquo;m playing to the gallery for those who&rsquo;ve travelled long distances today), they could allow commuters to purchase train tickets and be refunded immediately and automatically if the train arrives late, without a need for separate forms and payment instructions. In the context of supply chains, automatic payment upon delivery could help alleviate the perennial challenge of late payments to small businesses.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[5]</a></sup>&nbsp;And finally, these technologies could meaningfully reduce the cost of retail payments. Libra was proposing to enable cross-border payments like remittances at a fraction of the 6-7% average cost at the time. And lower cost payments could make micropayments (those for very small amounts) more economical, so that, for example, I pay for the article I read rather than needing an entire newspaper subscription.</p>
<p>I highlight these examples not as a comprehensive description of what these technologies have to offer. Rather, they simply highlight to me that there is genuine potential for these technologies to improve our everyday lives.</p>
<p>Such technologies also offer the opportunity to enhance wholesale payments and settlement &ndash; low volume, high value activity between financial and corporate institutions, which includes interbank payments as well as the payments that settle financial market activity.</p>
<p>Here, while the execution of financial market transactions today takes place at speed, its clearing and settlement is far slower, as the multiple entities involved (central securities depositories, central counterparties, custodians, banks and end-investors) each update their records. DLT allows a single, definitive database to be shared and updated simultaneously across all network participants, rather than each party maintaining its own records. It thus enables all participants in a network to have the same, single source of truth, without the need for manual reconciliation. This can facilitate faster, more efficient processes with fewer intermediaries, and increase the speed at which a transaction can settle &ndash; all of which could reduce the risks and costs involved. Tokenisation could also increase the liquidity of a wider range of financial assets (for example private assets, units in investment funds, or even real estate), enabling them to be held, traded or perhaps used as collateral by a broad set of players, and 'fractionalised' so that investors can hold a portion if they can't afford the whole.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[6]</a></sup></p>
<h4>The Bank of England&rsquo;s role in payments innovation</h4>
<p>I like to think of money and payment systems in terms of trains and rails &ndash; money is the train, and the payment system is the set of rails by which that asset travels from sender to receiver. The Bank of England&rsquo;s role for each is two-fold &ndash; both provider and regulator.</p>
<p>First, we provide trains and rails of our own. We issue our own money (cash and central bank reserves) and run the Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) infrastructure (the system by which reserves are transferred between financial institutions). These sit at the heart of the economy and financial system,&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk163414309"></a>and together deliver trust in money and payments, which underpins monetary and financial stability.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-7" id="footnote-ref-7"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[7]</a></sup>&nbsp;They are also an important foundation on which the private sector can provide services and innovate.</p>
<p>Second, we regulate the trains and rails provided by the private sector &ndash; the money issued by commercial banks, and the interbank payment systems and card schemes through which that money is transferred.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-8" id="footnote-ref-8"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[8]</a></sup>&nbsp;Again, our aim is to deliver trust in money and payments and so monetary and financial stability &ndash; by ensuring this private sector activity is safe. In so doing, we support safe innovation.</p>
<p>The technological innovation I&rsquo;ve described requires us to look ahead to identify what changes in our role as provider and regulator might be needed. I&rsquo;d highlight three reasons for that.</p>
<p>First, some of these technologies can reduce risks in the financial system. For example, collapsing the myriad of post-trade clearing and settlement activities and intermediaries into a potentially instantaneous smart contract could reduce, or even remove, counterparty credit and settlement risks. This could bring some new challenges to manage (the ability to net transactions before settlement is reduced, for example). But the direction of travel towards more efficient post-trade processes in financial markets is clear.</p>
<p>Second, as the central bank, we issue the safest form of money in the economy and that plays a crucial foundational role for monetary and financial stability. And so, as technology advances and new players introduce welcome competition, we need to ensure that we provide central bank money and payments infrastructure with the requisite functionality so that its role as an anchor of confidence in different types of money in the economy is not eclipsed.</p>
<p>Third, a regulated financial system that isn't delivering at the frontier in terms of outcomes for the real economy and financial market participants is vulnerable to new players growing quickly outside of the regulatory perimeter. Such players might quickly get to systemic scale and, in so doing, create risks that are hard retrospectively to address &ndash; a phenomenon we&rsquo;ve seen as technological innovation has hit other sectors of the economy.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-9" id="footnote-ref-9"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[9]</a></sup></p>
<h4>Our work on retail innovation</h4>
<h4>Stablecoin regulation</h4>
<p>We were reminded starkly of this final point by the Libra announcement in 2019. We faced the prospect of Facebook harnessing its network of (then) over two billion users to drive adoption both of a new form of money for retail payments (a stablecoin) and of new DLT rails for it to travel on. On both fronts, the risks were not adequately addressed by the regulatory frameworks then in place. And that meant trust in money and payments would not be assured.</p>
<p>While the Libra/Diem<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-10" id="footnote-ref-10"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[10]</a></sup>&nbsp;proposal came to naught, the possibility of stablecoins coming to be used at scale for retail payments (including by harnessing large firms&rsquo; existing user bases) remains. PayPal launched a dollar stablecoin with Paxos last year. And Visa is experimenting in the US, enabling merchants to receive payments in Circle&rsquo;s USD Coin.</p>
<p>So in November, we published a Discussion Paper proposing a regulatory regime for stablecoins used at systemic scale in retail payments, while the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) proposed a regime for stablecoins more broadly.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-11" id="footnote-ref-11"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[11]</a></sup>&nbsp;We&rsquo;ve received valuable feedback from a range of stakeholders in the crypto, payments and banking sectors, as well as from academics and civil society.</p>
<p>Our proposals are focused on ensuring the new train (the stablecoin itself) and the new rails (the system that transfers the stablecoins from payer to payee) meet our and the public&rsquo;s expectations for them to be as safe as those currently used for retail payments (commercial bank money and interbank payment systems respectively).</p>
<p>As with commercial bank money, safety comes from the financial resources stablecoin issuers hold to reduce the likelihood of failure and the resolution arrangements in place in case they do. It will be impossible to provide deposit insurance-style protections for stablecoins, since there isn&rsquo;t a broader industry among which to share the costs. And so that means tighter requirements on financial resources than for commercial bank money. We have proposed that stablecoins used at systemic scale for payments be backed 100% by central bank deposits. And that these would be unremunerated, as stablecoin issuers would not be engaged in lending or in money market activity, and so not expected to play a role in monetary policy transmission.</p>
<p>In the absence of revenues from backing assets, revenues for stablecoin issuers would have to come from other sources. This could be from fees for the use of the payment rails themselves, as is the case for interbank payment systems, including card companies, today. Or it could be through providing ancillary services, in the way that Open Banking firms today neither issue money nor provide payment rails, but rather offer users services such as budgeting tools based on access to payments data. (At the risk of straining my metaphor, such firms offer neither the train nor the rail, but rather the onboard concessions delivering services to passengers.)&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk163473136"></a>But my fundamental point is that business models wanting to offer a systemic means of payment and earn revenues from maturity and liquidity transformation should be regulated as banks.</p>
<p>In feedback to the Discussion Paper, some respondents said these requirements would challenge stablecoin issuers&rsquo; business models and so might effectively bar use of stablecoins at systemic scale. We&rsquo;ll of course closely consider all feedback received and we will then consult further on a draft rulebook &ndash; guided always by the principle that the same risks in different business models need to be addressed to achieve the same regulatory outcome.</p>
<h4>Exploration of retail CBDC</h4>
<p>At the same time as considering how to regulate new tokenised money for retail payments issued by the private sector, we are also exploring whether to provide such money ourselves. Hence, the Bank of England and HM Treasury (like many other countries around the world) are exploring whether or not to issue a retail CBDC in the UK.</p>
<p>Use of cash in UK retail transactions has already fallen from around two-thirds of transactions twenty years ago to 14% in 2022.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-12" id="footnote-ref-12"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[12]</a></sup>&nbsp;And the possibility of large technology companies issuing money risks bearing down further on the role of central bank money in retail payments. To be clear, we will issue banknotes for as long as people wish to use cash. But these trends do raise concerns for the Bank of England&rsquo;s objectives that may warrant a response.</p>
<p>A core tenet of monetary and financial stability is that the public can be confident in the value of money, regardless of its form and issuer, and that all types of money can be easily exchanged, delivering so-called uniformity of money. Wide access to banknotes &ndash; alongside bank regulation and provision of RTGS &ndash; has provided the anchor for our financial system and our economy for generations - since it ensures different forms of private money (like bank deposits) can always be converted into financially risk-free public money.</p>
<p>The fall to date in the use of cash hasn&rsquo;t yet challenged this uniformity of money. The risk that it might do so in future is hard to quantify and may be remote. But this uncertainty and the severity of the impact should it crystallise is an important motivation for our exploration of a retail CBDC. I firmly believe that, as technological innovation takes place, we must not forget the contribution that retail central bank money has made to monetary and financial stability.</p>
<p>There is also a risk that new players issuing money may impede other firms&rsquo; ability to provide wallets and other payment services for it (so-called &lsquo;walled gardens&rsquo;), or issue money in such a way that users cannot transact with users outside of their platform. This could challenge uniformity of money, since this money might not always be easily converted into other types of money. Such dynamics would also challenge competition in the payments market &ndash; and we&rsquo;ve of course seen in other sectors of the economy how digital, highly networked markets can present challenges to competition regulation.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-13" id="footnote-ref-13"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Given that context, we consulted with HM Treasury last year on a retail digital pound, and we published in January our response to the over 50,000 responses we received.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-14" id="footnote-ref-14"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[14]</a></sup>&nbsp;Many people raised important concerns around ensuring privacy and control over how they spend their money should a digital pound be launched.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-15" id="footnote-ref-15"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[15]</a></sup>&nbsp;We take these concerns seriously. In response, the Government has committed to introducing primary legislation to Parliament before a digital pound could be launched (and to consult further before doing so). And that legislation would guarantee users&rsquo; privacy and control of their digital pound payments.</p>
<p>Let me emphasise &ndash; we have not taken any decision on whether or not to issue a digital pound. But preparatory work is prudent to ensure the option to issue is available if needed. Our work over the next two years or so will be focused on making a robust and objective assessment of potential benefits and costs, including operational and technical feasibility. To do that, we will consider the potential design of a digital pound in greater detail, informed by technology experimentation and proofs of concept with the private sector. We will continue to engage widely with external stakeholders. And importantly, we will be informed by how innovation in the wider payments landscape evolves.</p>
<p>Indeed, key inputs into any decision to proceed with a retail CBDC will be the nature and scale of innovation in other forms of retail money (in particular, commercial bank money), as well as how our own wholesale payments infrastructure might evolve in support. Let me cover both in the rest of this speech, starting with our work&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk163453331"></a>supporting innovation in wholesale payments and settlement &ndash; an area on which we&rsquo;re increasingly focused.</p>
<h4>Our increased focus on wholesale innovation</h4>
<h4>Settlement</h4>
<p><a id="_Hlk163421093"></a>I spoke earlier about how tokenisation could drive greater speed and efficiency in post-trade financial market processes, through less need for manual reconciliation and long chains of intermediaries. As regulator of financial market infrastructure (FMI), we&rsquo;re proactively encouraging firms to explore these technologies.</p>
<p>New legislation passed last year gave HM Treasury the power to establish so-called &lsquo;FMI sandboxes&rsquo; &ndash; where we modify regulations to allow firms to experiment with new technology. Earlier this month, the Bank of England and the FCA consulted on our approach to the first such sandbox, the Digital Securities Sandbox.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-16" id="footnote-ref-16"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[16]</a></sup>&nbsp;This will enable the private sector to set up real-world trading venues and settlement systems using new technologies such as DLT. We will review feedback to our consultation closely, and plan to open the sandbox to applications this summer.</p>
<p>I want to emphasise the &lsquo;real world&rsquo; aspect, because &ldquo;sandbox&rdquo; as a moniker probably undersells the innovation we&rsquo;re making as regulators here. These won&rsquo;t merely be prototypes or experiments. Our aim is to design the sandbox so that sandbox entrants and the digital securities in it are used in broadly the same way as in the conventional financial system.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-17" id="footnote-ref-17"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[17]</a></sup>&nbsp;So this is a really exciting opportunity for market participants and regulators to gain practical insights into the potential benefits of new technologies, while placing limits on activity to enable that innovation to take place safely.</p>
<p>The sandbox will last for five years, during which time the Bank of England, FCA and HM Treasury intend to learn from firms&rsquo; activity and, subject to that, to create a new permanent regulatory regime for the trading and settlement of digital securities. The government has the tools to put that in place reasonably quickly. In that sense, the sandbox ought not be a &lsquo;bridge to nowhere&rsquo;, but rather a means to test and then embed durable and safe innovation.</p>
<h4>Payments</h4>
<p>As securities are transferred from buyers to sellers, so money needs to be transferred the other way. Our starting point here is that there are clear benefits to financial stability from settling wholesale transactions in central bank money. It is the ultimate risk-free asset and safest form of money in the economy, and it enables an unequivocal discharge of obligations between parties.</p>
<p>Of course, some wholesale transactions settle in commercial bank money today.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-18" id="footnote-ref-18"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[18]</a></sup>&nbsp;And commercial bank money is a much safer asset than it was at the time of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), thanks to reforms to bank regulation and central bank liquidity insurance, as well as the establishment of resolution regimes.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk163473488"></a>That said, there is a tail risk from too much wholesale settlement taking place in privately issued money. Banks holding money with each other in order to settle payments creates interconnectedness &ndash; and this could amplify a banking stress, as banks pull wholesale deposits from each other, leading to wider deleveraging and losses (dynamics that were clearly at play during the GFC). Moreover, a payment system settling in commercial bank money would struggle quickly to switch to central bank money in a banking stress, impairing the economic activity being conducted through it.</p>
<p>Settlement of wholesale transactions in central bank money on the other hand can be an anchor of confidence and stability in a stress. We have a low risk appetite at the Bank of England for a significant shift away from settlement in central bank money towards private settlement assets. And so, as the technology for trading, payments and securities settlement evolves, we need to ensure our wholesale payments infrastructure keeps pace.</p>
<p>We have already made significant headway in renewing the UK&rsquo;s RTGS system. It now operates using global messaging standards, to enable more automatic processing of payments domestically and cross-border. Later this year, it will transition to a more resilient and capable core settlement engine (including with capability to move to near 24/7 operation in future). And we are reviewing how best to expand further the number of financial institutions with direct access to RTGS.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-19" id="footnote-ref-19"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>At the moment, the tokenised securities transactions in the Digital Securities Sandbox would not be able to settle in central bank money. Rather, they would have to use privately issued settlement assets, such as tokenised bank deposits. We are therefore increasingly focused on how best our wholesale infrastructure should evolve to support the settlement of tokenised transactions, to ensure the continued role of central bank money in wholesale payments.</p>
<p>Already, we have established a new &lsquo;omnibus&rsquo; account in the current RTGS system to allow private sector payment systems using DLT to offer settlement in a tokenised representation of central bank money.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-20" id="footnote-ref-20"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[20]</a></sup>&nbsp;Indeed, the first such payment system entered its initial phase of operations at the end of last year under limits from the Bank of England. Returning to my trains/rails framing,&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk163823244"></a>such a solution in effect allows the private sector to offer a train with the safety of central bank money, travelling on privately operated payment rails using the latest DLT technology &ndash; even though the underlying central bank money continues to employ a traditional centralised ledger.</p>
<p>More broadly, the Bank of England is exploring with the industry the benefits of extending the renewed RTGS system in future to offer synchronised settlement in a variety of assets, by linking the traditional centralised RTGS ledger to other ledgers, including those using DLT.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-21" id="footnote-ref-21"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>Money could move on our RTGS system at the same time as tokenised securities move in financial market transactions. Or money in RTGS could move at the same time as money on another central bank&rsquo;s distributed ledger in foreign exchange transactions. Such &lsquo;atomic settlement&rsquo;, with the simultaneous movement of money and assets on different ledgers, can effectively extend Delivery versus Payment or Payment versus Payment to a greater range of use cases.</p>
<p>Indeed, in a project with the BIS Innovation Hub last year, we explored how such synchronisation might work in practice to enhance housing purchases. Movement of funds in RTGS could automatically take place at the same time as the change in home ownership is recorded on a digitised title deed, meaning less need for costly and risky chains of intermediaries.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-22" id="footnote-ref-22"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[22]</a></sup>&nbsp;(And all this was coordinated by a &lsquo;synchronisation operator&rsquo;, which &ndash; now probably stretching my analogy to breaking point &ndash; is akin to managing the train timetable so that money and assets move on different rails at the same time.)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some other central banks are experimenting with going further, tokenising central bank money themselves on a separate, distributed ledger &ndash; so-called wholesale CBDCs.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-23" id="footnote-ref-23"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[23]</a></sup>&nbsp;The question we are keen to consider is how these different models for central bank infrastructure compare, including whether there are important differences in the payment use cases they can support.</p>
<p>The evolution of wholesale payments will also be relevant to our consideration of a retail CBDC, since both could help support the future uniformity of money in the UK. Today, the equal value of money issued by different banks is supported not only by being able to convert them one-for-one into cash, but also by payments between those banks settling across the books of the central bank, in reserves, through RTGS.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-24" id="footnote-ref-24"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[24]</a></sup>&nbsp;Similarly, as the technology underlying privately issued money evolves (whether through tokenised bank deposits or regulated stablecoins), this uniformity of money could potentially be bolstered not just by retail CBDC, but also by enhancing the Bank of England&rsquo;s wholesale payments infrastructure so that it can continue to play its key role in supporting settlement between these new forms of private money.</p>
<h3>Payments innovation by banks</h3>
<p>I want to finish on what the coming wave of technology innovation in payments means for commercial bank deposits &ndash; which of course support the vast majority of retail payments in the UK at present.</p>
<p>As Andrew Bailey said in his call to action at Mansion House last year, we don&rsquo;t want the central bank to be left as the only game in town when it comes to payments innovation.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-25" id="footnote-ref-25"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[25]</a></sup>&nbsp;In addition to our exploratory work on retail CBDC and our proposed regime for regulated stablecoins, we want to encourage more thinking and, crucially, action by banks in payments innovation. That needs to cover trains and rails &ndash; both how tokenisation might be applied to bank deposits to enhance their functionality across the full range of retail payments use cases, and what interbank payment rails would be needed to support this.</p>
<p>I am firmly of the view that the technology revolution will hit &ndash; indeed, is hitting &ndash; finance in the way that it has hit other sectors of the economy. It strikes me that, for banks (as the incumbents), payments innovation is both a first-tier opportunity (given the potential benefits for them and their customers of additional payments functionality) and a first-tier threat (given the risk of disintermediation by new players). That in my view demands urgent action.</p>
<p>For the Bank of England&rsquo;s part, we&rsquo;ll support this both as a regulator by setting out clear expectations<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-26" id="footnote-ref-26"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[26]</a></sup>, and as a provider of the wholesale infrastructure via which interbank payments ultimately settle. On the latter, we are experimenting with six other central banks, the Bank for International Settlements and the private sector on &lsquo;Project Agor&aacute;&rsquo;, which will explore how tokenised commercial bank deposits could be integrated with tokenised wholesale central bank money to enhance payments efficiency and functionality, including cross-border.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-27" id="footnote-ref-27"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>To pause for a moment on this international dimension before I conclude, central banks all around the world are facing questions similar to those I&rsquo;ve set out today. Projects like Agor&aacute; will help us pool our resources in tackling them. But importantly, they will also help ensure we tackle them in a way that is coherent, helps reduce rather than add to frictions in cross-border payments, and importantly (and definitely a subject for a speech on another day) helps us understand the implications for the international monetary system should digital money lead to more frictionless cross-border money holdings and payment flows.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-28" id="footnote-ref-28"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[28]</a></sup></p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>New technologies offer the prospect of enhanced retail and wholesale payments functionality in the UK. Our immediate focus at the Bank of England following Facebook&rsquo;s Libra announcement in 2019 has rightly been on establishing regulatory regimes for stablecoins to be used safely for retail payments, and on considering whether a retail CBDC might be needed in future.</p>
<p>But we are increasingly complementing that work with a focus on how we can best support innovation both in wholesale payments and financial markets (including through modernisation of the Bank of England&rsquo;s wholesale payments infrastructure) and in banks&rsquo; retail payments offerings. To do that will require input and close collaboration from the private sector, and so we are planning to set out our thinking in these areas in a Discussion Paper this summer.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/april/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit-2024#footnote-29" id="footnote-ref-29"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[29]</a></sup>&nbsp;We look forward to harnessing the expertise and creativity of the people in this room as we do so.</p>

<div> Geopolitical tensions, market capitalization, 2024 Q1 performance, CME Group, Nairobi Securities Exchange <br />
Summary: Market volatility due to geopolitical tensions. CME's dominance challenged. Nairobi Exchange top performer, B3 SA worst, overall increase in Q1 performance. <div>
<p>In the first quarter of 2024, markets were attuned to the balance between decreasing macroeconomic risks and escalating geopolitical tensions. These opposing forces could lead to sharp reversals, heightened volatility, and market dislocation. A retreat in market sentiment could occur as these dynamics unfold.</p>
<p>The FTSE Mondo Visione Exchanges Index closed at 73,589.92 points at the end of March, marking a 0.1% decrease from its February 2024 value of 73,691.53.</p>
<p>The top 5 exchanges by market capitalisation at the end of March were:</p>

<p>Herbie Skeete, Managing Director of Mondo Visione and Co-founder of the Index said: "CME Group has long been recognised as a powerhouse in the global exchange arena. However, signs of vulnerability are beginning to show in its once unassailable dominance. The CFTC approved a proposal in January that permits the trading of U.S. Treasury and SOFR futures on FMX, a platform owned by Howard Lutnick's BGC Group. This move signals BGC's emergence as a potential challenger to CME. However, immediate competition remains between ICE and CME, which are fiercely battling to become the largest exchange through market capitalisation. Currently, ICE appears to have the upper hand, thanks to a surge in its energy complex, a bullish outlook in its fixed-income business, and a series of client acquisitions in the mortgage sector."</p>

<div> CEO, secondment, retirement, leadership, transformation
<br />
Greg Yanco appointed Interim CEO, Warren Day joins CDPP, Tim Mullaly retires, new executive director roles, ongoing transformation.
<br /><br />Summary:
Warren Day joins CDPP, Tim Mullaly retires. Greg Yanco appointed Interim CEO. New executive director roles, ongoing transformation of ASIC. <div>
<p>The Australian Securities and Investments Commission today confirmed a number of changes to its senior executive leadership team.</p>
<h4>Chief Executive Officer</h4>
<p>ASIC Chair Joe Longo has accepted a request from the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions for ASIC CEO Warren Day to join the CDPP on secondment as the Director&rsquo;s Executive Officer, effective 1 June 2024.</p>
<p>The Chair said the request recognised the contribution Mr Day had made to ASIC as CEO, in particular supporting its organisational transformation since 2021.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Warren has been a significant contributor to ASIC for more than 20 years across virtually every part of ASIC&rsquo;s remit. This is an opportunity for him to bring the skills and experience he has gained at ASIC to an agency we have a shared interest in supporting and seeing succeed,&rdquo; Mr Longo said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since I embarked on the review of ASIC&rsquo;s infrastructure and operations on my first day as ASIC Chair, Warren has played a significant leadership role, particularly with leading the organisational redesign, the delivery of our strategic and enforcement priorities, and the management of ASIC&rsquo;s Executive Leadership Team.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Warren leaves with our full support and his appointment underpins the critical institutional relationship ASIC holds with the CDPP, which is core to our enforcement work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the CDPP secondment, Mr Day has indicated he will not return to ASIC.</p>
<p>The ASIC Chair said Mr Day&rsquo;s secondment to the CDPP came as ASIC enters the next phase of its transformation.</p>
<h4>Regulation and Supervision  &nbsp;</h4>
<p>Executive Director of Regulation and Supervision Greg Yanco will be appointed as ASIC&rsquo;s Interim CEO effective 1 June 2024. Mr Yanco was previously Executive Director Markets between January 2019 and June 2023 before commencing in his current role. He has more than 30 years of experience in financial market development, regulation, and supervision.</p>
<p>Mr Yanco has informed the Commission that he expects to retire in mid-2025. A local and global search for a permanent CEO will commence in early 2025.</p>
<h4>Enforcement and Compliance</h4>
<p>Following more than 25 years of service to ASIC, Executive Director of Enforcement and Compliance Tim Mullaly has also advised that he will be retiring from ASIC at the end of July 2024.</p>
<p>Mr Mullaly has held executive roles at ASIC for the last 12 years, leading the Financial Services Enforcement team for 11 years and, for the last year, Enforcement and Compliance (E&amp;C) team. In this role and as a member of ASIC's Executive Leadership team, Mr Mullaly was critical to implementing the new E&amp;C structure, overseeing a team of 450 staff focused on delivery of enforcement and compliance outcomes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tim has for many years played a crucial role in ensuring that ASIC has maintained a strong and strategic pipeline of enforcement work. ASIC is in court every day, and we are launching new investigations every second day of the week, all aligned to the priorities we have set out,&rdquo; Mr Longo said.</p>
<p>Local and global searches for the Executive Director Regulation and Supervision and Executive Director Enforcement and Compliance roles will commence shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Filling these positions is an opportunity for executive renewal and ASIC&rsquo;s ongoing transformation towards being a modern, ambitious and confident regulator. As the ongoing impact of our work continues to be realised, we also have opportunities for exceptional leaders to drive the next phase of ASIC&rsquo;s transformation,&rdquo; Mr Longo said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to thank Warren and Tim for their significant contribution to ASIC over many years and thank Greg for stepping into the Interim CEO role.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Background  &nbsp;</h4>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s executive leadership team is also being strengthened with the addition of a new Executive Director role for Registry and Intelligence &ndash; following the transition of Registry services back to ASIC from the ATO &ndash; as well as a Chief People and Culture Transformation Officer. ASIC also recently appointed Joanne Harper as Executive Director for Data, Digital and Technology.</p>

<div> Delisting, TMX Group, Debentures, TSX, OTC
Summary:<br /><br />TMX Group delists Series D, E, and F Debentures from TSX, citing limited trading and OTC market liquidity. New series continues trading OTC. <div>
<p class="sizeable">&nbsp;TMX Group Limited (TMX Group or the Company) today announced that its board of directors and Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) have approved the voluntary delisting of the Company's non-convertible Series D, E and F Debentures from TSX. In making the decision to delist, the Company considered, among other things, the fact that secondary market trading in Canadian non-convertible corporate bonds occurs predominantly via over-the-counter markets (OTC), and this decision allows our fixed income investors access to the deepest pool of liquidity. The total value of the Canadian corporate bond market is estimated at approximately $527 billion, according to the FTSE Canada Corporate Bond Index. Originally listed in July 2021, TMX Group's Series D, E and F Debentures have traded less than $20 million in aggregate on TSX, through the end of February 2024.</p>
<p class="sizeable">TMX Group intends to delist these debentures on or about April 26, 2024, and following delisting, they can continue to trade on the OTC markets. Neither the TSX nor the terms of the trust indenture under which these debentures were issued require the Company to obtain approval from debenture holders prior to delisting them from TSX.</p>
<p class="sizeable">The delisting impacts the following TMX Group debentures:</p>
<ul class="sizeable">
<li>Series D (TSX: X.DB.A): $300 million aggregate principal amount of 2.997% Series D Senior Unsecured Debentures due December 11, 2024;</li>
<li>Series E (TSX: X.DB.B): $200 million aggregate principal amount of 3.779% Series E Senior Unsecured Debentures due June 5, 2028; and</li>
<li>Series F (TSX: X.DB.C): $250 million aggregate principal amount of 2.016% Series F Senior Unsecured Debentures due February 12, 2031.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="sizeable">TMX Group series G, H and I debentures, issued in February 2024, are not listed on TSX and continue to trade OTC.</p>
<p class="sizeable">This news release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the TMX Group Debentures or any other securities of TMX Group in any jurisdiction, and is not an offer for sale within the United States of any securities of TMX Group. Securities of TMX Group, including any debt securities, may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration under U.S. securities laws or unless exempt from registration under such laws.</p>

<title>UK And U.S. To Clamp Down Harder On The Trade Of Russian Metals</title>

<div> London Metal Exchange, Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Russian metal exports, UK, US

Summary:
The UK and US ban Russian metal exports, including aluminium, copper, and nickel, from the London Metal Exchange and Chicago Mercantile Exchange. This action aims to reduce revenue for the Kremlin and support Ukraine. Sanctions Minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan and Minister for Trade Policy Greg Hands provided statements regarding this action. There are no restrictions on acquiring existing stockpiles of Russian metals on the exchange. This action does not cover titanium or platinum group metals. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<ul>
<li>Russian metal producers blocked from profits from the London Metal Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, reducing a crucial source of revenue for the Kremlin.</li>
<li>Joint UK and U.S. action builds on ban of metal imports, targeting $40 billion of Russian exports of aluminium, copper and nickel.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The UK and the U.S. have together announced joint action to clamp down harder on prohibited Russian metal exports, by today bringing the world&rsquo;s two largest metal exchanges into the scope of the existing bans.</p>
<p>The London Metal Exchange (LME) and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) will no longer trade new aluminium, copper and nickel produced by Russia. Metals are Russia&rsquo;s largest export commodity after energy, though their value has been decreasing since Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine. In 2022 they were $25 billion, dropping to $15 billion in 2023 due to the efforts of the G7 and allies to curtail the market. Today&rsquo;s action will go further to constrain Russia&rsquo;s ability to make money from its shrinking metals exports, dealing another blow&nbsp;to President Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s funding for his illegal war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Jeremy Hunt, Chancellor of the Exchequer, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="last-child">Disabling Putin&rsquo;s capacity to wage his illegal war in Ukraine is better achieved when we act alongside our allies. Thanks to Britain&rsquo;s leadership in this area, our decisive action with the U.S. to jointly ban Russian metals from the two largest exchanges will prevent the Kremlin funnelling more cash into its war machine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Janet L. Yellen, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our new prohibitions on key metals, in coordination with our partners in the United Kingdom, will continue to target the revenue Russia can earn to continue its brutal war against Ukraine.</p>
<p class="last-child">By taking this action in a targeted and responsible manner, we will reduce Russia&rsquo;s earnings while protecting our partners and allies from unwanted spillover effects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Prime Minister first announced the intention to act on banning Russian metals in May 2023. UK legislation to directly ban imports of Russian metals, including aluminium, copper and nickel was introduced in December. Separately, the U.S. put in place tariffs on various Russian metal imports.</p>
<p>Together, the UK and the U.S. have today gone one step further and brought both metal exchanges into the scope of these measures &ndash; reinforcing a shared commitment to constrain Russia and support Ukraine. This follows a dialogue between the two countries to maximise the impact of the policy, which is a technically complex measure requiring time to work through the details to ensure its effectiveness and minimise the risk of market disruption.</p>
<p>Metal exchanges provide a central role in facilitating the trading of industrial metals around the globe. The London Metal Exchange and Chicago Mercantile Exchange both have warehouses all over the world. Together, they are the world&rsquo;s two largest metal exchanges and set global benchmark prices for the trade of base metals.</p>
<p>Both the UK and U.S. measures will exempt the existing stock of Russian metal on these global exchanges so they can still be traded and withdrawn. This is to minimise the risk to market stability.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s announcement to strengthen the UK&rsquo;s existing ban on Russian metals builds on ongoing work to support Ukraine. Since Putin&rsquo;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the UK has introduced the largest and most severe package of sanctions ever imposed on any major economy. Over 2,000 individuals and entities have now been sanctioned, and it is estimated that without sanctions, Russia would have over $400 billion more to fund its war &ndash; which could be enough to do so for an additional four years. The UK has also provided almost &pound;12 billion in military, humanitarian and economic support to Ukraine and has often been the&nbsp;first mover&nbsp;on vital lethal aid.</p>
<p>Sanctions Minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today&rsquo;s action ratches up economic pressure on Putin, further depriving him of the key resources and revenue streams he needs to fund his illegal war in Ukraine.</p>
<p class="last-child">We have now imposed extensive trade sanctions on Russian-origin oil, gas, gold, diamonds, iron, steel, and base metals, dealing a heavy blow to Putin&rsquo;s war economy. But we must continue to work with our allies to further tighten the screws on the Kremlin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Minister for Trade Policy Greg Hands said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The UK has already imposed the most severe package of bans that we&rsquo;ve ever seen on a major economy, including on Russian metals which is Russia&rsquo;s largest export commodity after oil and gas.</p>
<p class="last-child">Now, we&rsquo;re going even further. By strengthening our sanctions on Russian metals, alongside the U.S., we will reduce Russian revenue which it uses to fund Putin&rsquo;s war machine.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="further-information">Further information</h4>
<ul>
<li>There are no restrictions on acquiring existing stockpiles of Russian metals already on exchange, in order to prevent disruption to markets.</li>
<li>This action does not cover titanium or platinum group metals, such as platinum and palladium, which were not included in the UK&rsquo;s prohibition in December due to supply chain sensitivities.</li>

<title>Comment On FinCEN’s AML/CFT Program And SAR Filing For Registered Investment Advisers And Exempt Reporting Advisers Proposal, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, April 12, 2024</title>

<div> FinCEN, AML/CFT, investment advisers, suspicious activity reports, regulatory gap
Summary: FinCEN proposes AML/CFT regulations for investment advisers, lacking solid evidence of illicit activity, and potentially imposing heavy costs. <br /><br /> <div>
<h4>Re: FINCEN&ndash;2024&ndash;0006 and RIN 1506&ndash;AB58; Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the &nbsp;&nbsp;Financing of Terrorism Program and Suspicious Activity Report Filing Requirements for Registered Investment Advisers and Exempt Reporting Advisers.</h4>
<p>Dear Director Gacki:</p>
<p>The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Treasury bureau responsible for administering the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), once more has proposed to subject certain investment advisers to a range of anti-money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regulations.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-fincen-04122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp; Eight and a half years have gone by since FinCEN&rsquo;s last proposal, so one would assume that the case for revisiting this initiative after so many years would be strong.&nbsp; Because it is not, I submit this comment in opposition to this proposal.</p>
<p>None of the justifications offered in support of this latest proposal is convincing or compelling. One concern is that registered investment advisers (RIAs) and exempt reporting advisers (ERAs) are an entry point for financial criminals and/or hostile state actors because they lack minimum standards for AML/CFT programs and need not report suspicious activity to FinCEN.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-fincen-04122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp; In a vacuum, this concern might hold water, but broker-dealers, mutual funds, futures commission merchants, and banks are all subject to the full panoply of BSA requirements.&nbsp; It is hard to conceive of an adviser-related activity that would not fall within the regulatory ambit of some or all of those covered financial institutions.&nbsp; The regulatory gap described, therefore, is more optical than substantive; closing it amounts to little more than grade-grubbing.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-fincen-04122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>The Proposal is thin on actual examples of RIAs serving as gateways to illicit activity.&nbsp; If the identified gap is really a problem, after so many years we should have a wide array of examples of how advisers were used by financial criminals. &nbsp;Instead, the threat unregulated RIAs pose to our national security and financial system seems to be largely notional. &nbsp;For example, a 2024 Treasury analysis cited in support of imposing BSA obligations on RIAs and ERAs, indicates that &ldquo;15.4 percent of RIAs and ERAs were associated with or referenced in at least one [Suspicious Activity Report (SAR)].&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-fincen-04122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, FinCEN explains that &ldquo;the number of SAR filings associated with an RIA or ERA increased by approximately 400 percent between 2013 and 2021&mdash;a disproportionately higher increase than the overall increase in SAR filings, which was approximately 140 percent.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-fincen-04122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp; To be meaningful, however, those numbers need context, which the Proposal lacks. &nbsp;How many reports are actually in question?&nbsp; How many of the number are mentions of an adviser in a SAR narrative?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-fincen-04122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp; Moreover, as the &ldquo;S&rdquo; in S-A-R indicates, what is being reported on these forms is a reporting entity&rsquo;s&nbsp;<i>suspicion</i>&nbsp;that something may be amiss in a transaction; it is not proof and may reflect the filer&rsquo;s self-protective instinct, rather than a real suspicion of any wrongdoing.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-fincen-04122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>The Proposal&rsquo;s specific examples of adviser-related financial crime prove little. &nbsp;One of the leading examples &mdash;a private equity fund being used to launder criminal proceeds&mdash;involved an adviser&nbsp;<i>complicit</i>&nbsp;in the illegal activity.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-fincen-04122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp; The Proposal acknowledges that the adviser was actively engaged in the crime, but still treats this as evidence that, absent these proposed rules, otherwise innocent advisers might accidently facilitate financial crime.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-fincen-04122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In another example, funds stolen from the Malaysian government were used to acquire a minority interest in a US private equity firm.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-fincen-04122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp; The funds &ldquo;were moved through multiple accounts owned by different entities on or about the same day&rdquo; to conceal their origin.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-fincen-04122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Proposal accurately describes the transfers as &ldquo;unnecessarily complex [] with no apparent business purpose,&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-fincen-04122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;and argues that the way to prevent certain advisers from being used as conduits for dirty money in such circumstances is to require them to &ldquo;determine the source of wealth and purpose for a customer.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-fincen-04122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp; FinCEN oversells the necessity of the proposed rules by downplaying that these malefactors were caught, perhaps because of the existing BSA rules for banks.&nbsp; Accordingly, before it adds yet another level of redundancy to the already multi-layered AML/CFT regulatory regime, FinCEN must do more than contend that the lack of omniscience equates to unacceptable vulnerability.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-fincen-04122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proposed rules would impose yet more costs on RIAs already staggering under the weight of two years of SEC regulatory excesses, along with new mandates from other regulators.&nbsp; I am particularly worried about how these new rules could affect smaller advisers, especially with a wholly unreasonable proposed compliance date of twelve months.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-fincen-04122024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I urge FinCEN to be mindful of the detrimental effect these proposed rules would have on adviser costs&mdash;especially for smaller advisers.&nbsp; If FinCEN decides to move forward with this Proposal, which I urge it not to do, please be open to commenter suggestions on how to reduce the scope of the rules to reflect actual, demonstrable risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Hester M. Peirce<br />Commissioner</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ms.<span class="x">&nbsp;</span>Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), issued the following statement today:</p>
<p><span>&ldquo;I am<span class="x"></span><span>deeply grateful for the trust and support of the Fund&rsquo;s Executive Board, representing our 190 members, and</span><span class="x">&nbsp;</span>honored to continue to lead the IMF as Managing Director for a second five-year term.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2024/04/12/-/media/C995E031FD0E4FC89F3DB6C9038D1A18.ashx?h=360&amp;w=240" /><br /></span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;In recent years, the IMF has helped our member countries to navigate successive shocks, including the pandemic, war and conflicts, and a cost-of-living crisis. &nbsp;We also stepped up our work on&nbsp;<span>climate change, fragility and conflict, and the digital transition, in line with their increased</span>&nbsp;significance for macroeconomic and financial stability, growth and employment. The IMF&rsquo;s financial support, policy advice and capacity development work&mdash;delivered by our exceptional staff&mdash;have contributed to countries' capacity to deal with high uncertainty and abrupt shifts in economic conditions. We are and will remain a transmission line of good policies for our members and will continue to strive to be more effective, incisive and a welcoming place for countries to come together to tackle global challenges.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;I look forward to continue serving our membership, together with the highly professional and committed staff of the IMF.&rdquo;</span></p>

<title>IMF Executive Board Selects Kristalina Georgieva To Serve A Second Term As Managing Director</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today selected Kristalina Georgieva to serve as IMF Managing Director for a second five-year term starting on October 1, 2024. The Board&rsquo;s decision was taken by consensus.</p>
<p>In line with the selection process it had established on March 13, 2024 (<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2024/03/13/pr2386-imf-exec-board-initiates-selection-process-next-md">See Press Release No. 24/86</a>), the Board held several discussions, including with Ms. Georgieva,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2024/04/04/pr24106-imf-executive-board-statement-managing-directors-selection-process">the sole candidate nominated for the position</a>, before making its decision today. Following today&rsquo;s meeting, the Coordinators of the Executive Board, Mr. Afonso S. Bevilaqua and Mr. Abdullah F. BinZarah, made the following statement:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In taking this decision, the Board commended Ms. Georgieva&rsquo;s strong and agile leadership during her term, navigating a series of major global shocks. Ms. Georgieva led the IMF&rsquo;s unprecedented response to these shocks, including the approval of more than $360 billion in new financing since the start of the pandemic for 97 countries, debt service relief to the Fund&rsquo;s poorest, most vulnerable members, and a historic Special Drawing Rights (SDR) allocation equivalent to $650 billion. Under her leadership, the Fund introduced innovative new financing facilities, including the Resilience and Sustainability Facility and the Food Shock Window. It replenished the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust, with the capacity to mobilize concessional loans to its poorest members, and co-created the Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable. It also secured a 50 percent quota increase to bolster the Fund&rsquo;s permanent resources and agreed to add a third Sub-Saharan African chair to the IMF Board.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looking ahead, the&nbsp;Board welcomes Ms. Georgieva&rsquo;s ongoing emphasis on issues of macroeconomic and financial stability, while also ensuring that the Fund continues to adapt and evolve to meet the needs of its entire membership. It recognizes her focus on strengthening the Fund&rsquo;s support to its members through effective policy advice, capacity development and financing. The Board looks forward to continuing to work closely with the Managing Director.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>Ms. Georgieva has served as Managing Director since October 1, 2019&nbsp;<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2019/09/25/pr19351-imf-executive-board-selects-kristalina-georgieva-as-managing-director">(See Press Release No. 19/351)</a>. The Managing Director is the chief of the IMF&rsquo;s operating staff and Chair of the Executive Board. The Managing Director is assisted by four Deputy Managing Directors in overseeing the Fund&rsquo;s operations, which serve its membership through about 3,100 staff.</p>
<p>Ms. Georgieva, a national of Bulgaria, has been the IMF&rsquo;s Managing Director since 2019. Previously she served as Chief Executive Officer of the World Bank from &nbsp;January 2017. From February 1, 2019, to April 8, 2019, she was the Interim President for the World Bank Group. She previously served at the European Commission as Commissioner for International Cooperation, Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response, and as Vice President for Budget and Human Resources. Ms. Georgieva has a Ph.D. in Economic Science and a M.A. in Political Economy and Sociology from the University of National and World Economy in Bulgaria, where she also taught from 1977 to 1991.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The&nbsp;<span dir="ltr" lang="fr">Autorit&eacute; des march&eacute;s financiers</span>&nbsp;(AMF) today announced a consultation with certain Qu&eacute;bec financial institutions for a targeted Standardized Climate Scenario Exercise&nbsp;(SCSE).</p>
<p>The SCSE will be conducted in collaboration with the&nbsp;<a class="is-external" href="https://www.osfi-bsif.gc.ca/fr" target="_blank">Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions&nbsp;<span class="icon-wrapper external-wrapper typo3-search-exclude"><img class="external" height="10" src="https://lautorite.qc.ca/typo3conf/ext/amf_site_lautorite/Resources/Public/Assets/svg/originals/external.svg" width="10" /></span><span class="visuallyhidden typo3-search-exclude">This link will open in a new window</span></a>&nbsp;(OSFI). The goals of the SCSE are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>increase financial institutions' understanding of their potential exposures to climate-related risks;</li>
<li>build institutions' capacity to conduct climate scenario analysis and risk assessments; and</li>
<li>measure the potential financial exposures to climate-related risks across institutions.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The AMF, jointly with OSFI, is proposing a draft methodology and workbook with instructions, developed using feedback received by the OSFI from a first consultation phase held in the fall of&nbsp;2023. A summary of the consultation feedback can be found in the report&nbsp;<a class="is-external" href="https://www.osfi-bsif.gc.ca/en/consultations/consultation-summaries/what-we-heard-consultations-draft-standardized-climate-scenario-exercise-methodology" target="_blank">What we heard: Consultations on draft Standardized Climate Scenario Exercise Methodology&nbsp;<span class="icon-wrapper external-wrapper typo3-search-exclude"><img class="external" height="10" src="https://lautorite.qc.ca/typo3conf/ext/amf_site_lautorite/Resources/Public/Assets/svg/originals/external.svg" width="10" /></span><span class="visuallyhidden typo3-search-exclude">This link will open in a new window</span></a>.</p>
<p>The AMF-regulated financial institutions participating in the SCSE were selected by applying specific criteria based on their size, degree of exposure to climate-related risks and level of impact on the Qu&eacute;bec financial system. They can submit their comments at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:ScenarioClimatique@lautorite.qc.ca.">ScenarioClimatique@lautorite.qc.ca</a>&nbsp;by June&nbsp;7, 2024.</p>
<p>OSFI and the AMF will hold an information session on May&nbsp;2 at 1:00&nbsp;p.m.&nbsp;(ET). Interested stakeholders can&nbsp;<a class="is-external" href="https://osfibsif.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8x3nbJhGhrtrUI6?Q_Language=EN" target="_blank">register&nbsp;<span class="icon-wrapper external-wrapper typo3-search-exclude"><img class="external" height="10" src="https://lautorite.qc.ca/typo3conf/ext/amf_site_lautorite/Resources/Public/Assets/svg/originals/external.svg" width="10" /></span><span class="visuallyhidden typo3-search-exclude">This link will open in a new window</span></a>&nbsp;by May&nbsp;1 at 12:00&nbsp;p.m.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Financial institutions are exposed to the consequences of climate change. The joint exercise we are launching today with our OSFI colleagues will help institutions be better prepared to manage climate change risks. It will also enable us to take the necessary actions to support financial market stability and the protection of Qu&eacute;bec consumers,&rdquo; said Yves Ouellet, AMF President and CEO.</p>
<p>"The Standardized Climate Scenario Exercise will encourage financial institutions to adopt sound climate risk management practices. We are proud to collaborate with our colleagues at the&nbsp;Autorit&eacute; des march&eacute;s financiers. Expanding this exercise across Canadian supervisory jurisdictions will create a stronger financial system for all Canadians," added Peter Routledge, OSFI Superintendent of Financial Institutions.</p>
<h4>Additional information</h4>
<ul>
<li>The AMF and OSFI will only receive comments from the respective financial institutions they regulate.</li>
<li>Participating Qu&eacute;bec financial institutions can begin work on the sections of the methodology and instructions that are considered final:    
<ul>
<li>industry and regional sector classification for transition risks</li>
<li>geocoding and regional scope for physical risks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Will [Luther]. It is such a pleasure to be here this morning. I have a number of disclaimers. My first disclaimer is that I am not an economist, and this is not an academic presentation. Second, the views I express are my own as a Commissioner and not necessarily those of the Securities and Exchange Commission (&ldquo;SEC&rdquo; or &ldquo;Commission&rdquo;) or my fellow Commissioners. My third disclaimer is that my high-school French is very rusty. Members of the Acad&eacute;mie Fran&ccedil;aise might want to tune out.</p>
<p>On a trip to France last summer, I had a fascinating conversation with a ride share driver. He spoke admiringly of the United States as the land of opportunity and freedom. In the U.S., he explained, the question you get when you want to try something new is &ldquo;Pourquoi Pas,&rdquo; &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; By contrast, in many other countries, the question posed to the person trying to do something new is &ldquo;Pourquoi?,&rdquo; &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; One system encourages you to strive; the other challenges you for even wanting to do such a thing. One system admires people who try something new, even if they fail. The other punishes people for daring to be different, even if they succeed. When people want to do something new or different, the American spirit is inclined to respond with a laissez-faire &ldquo;why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The driver&rsquo;s enthusiasm for the American system&mdash;one in which people are able to stand out from the crowd, take risks, bring ideas to the market, benefit from their own labor and ingenuity, and, yes, to fail and try again&mdash;inspired me to consider how the SEC can support the free spirit of the country whose capital markets it regulates. How can we contribute to the legal framework that makes the United States the place about which so many people, including my French raconteur, dream?</p>
<p>Regulators help define a country&rsquo;s openness to new endeavors, new competitors, and new ideas. The SEC is only one of many regulators, but, because of the critical markets we regulate, we play an important role in determining how open this country is. The SEC establishes the ground rules for the capital markets that form the basis of the American economy, which in turn supports a healthy, prosperous, welcoming society. Effective securities regulation clears the pathways that allow people to access our markets by, for example, promoting transparency, protecting from fraud, manipulation, and other misconduct, and overseeing intermediaries who handle other people&rsquo;s money. Regulation that does these things naturally creates space for individuals and companies to develop new ideas and new business models, on which investors and customers can then pass judgment. This kind of regulation creates an environment in which investable capital meets people&rsquo;s plans for building new businesses or expanding existing ones. Not only do the particular businesses raising funds benefit, but their shareholders, customers, communities, and employees share in those the benefits too. Sensible regulation can encourage people to build and expand businesses and to invest in other people&rsquo;s companies. Careless regulation, by contrast, can drive businesses away, squelch entrepreneurs&rsquo; dreams, and make investors skittish about committing their capital.</p>
<p>Getting regulation right requires establishing and enforcing clear ground rules within which people have broad latitude to make decisions for themselves. The clear ground rules give people the confidence to participate in the marketplace; they can trust that other market participants generally are acting in good faith because there is an effective outside disciplining mechanism. A good regulatory framework affords latitude to individual decision-makers and thereby ensures that the markets are responsive to people&rsquo;s actual needs, rather than to regulators&rsquo; perceptions about what people need.</p>
<p>Securities regulation in the United States generally falls in the sensible regulation column. The United States has long been the place where the most interesting and dynamic companies in the world are born and where free-thinking iconoclasts bring their great ideas to life and build their lives. It also is the place where people from all over the world choose to invest their money. In a room full of economists, I dare not give securities regulation full credit for the magnetism of the United States&mdash;economists have disagreed on how much credit is due.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;I am comfortable saying that the American securities regulatory framework has helped to create the environment within which businesses and investors thrive. That said, there is still room for improvement. I want to walk you through why I believe our securities regulatory framework is fundamentally sound, why it is trending in the wrong direction, and what we can do to turn it back in the right direction.</p>
<p>When prudently pursued, the SEC&rsquo;s mission&mdash;protecting investors, facilitating capital formation, and maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets&mdash;helps to cultivate a healthy environment for investing and raising capital. We achieve this mission by carrying out the mandates set forth in several statutes,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;which give us responsibility for regulating companies selling securities, investors, stock exchanges, broker-dealers, investment advisers, mutual funds, and other participants in the equities, options, bond, and security-based swap markets.</p>
<p>These statutes give the SEC more prescriptive power over the markets and market participants than I would prefer, but Congress did not set up the SEC as the ultimate gatekeeper to the markets either. For example, a company seeking to raise money does not need to get the SEC&rsquo;s sign-off that it is a good company before selling its shares in the public markets. The company needs only make truthful disclosures necessary for investors to decide whether it is a company in which&nbsp;<i>they</i>&nbsp;want to invest. Similarly, the SEC does not have the authority to test would-be investment advisers on their capability in managing money. Instead, advisers registering with us have to make disclosures about who they are and what they do so that investors can decide whether they want these advisers to manage their money. Mutual funds marketed to the public have great leeway in the type and mix of assets they hold and the strategies they use, as long as fund disclosures accurately reflect them. Credit rating agencies have to disclose what methodologies they use, but the SEC cannot regulate those methodologies. Generally, Congress did not design the SEC to be a merit regulator, and the resulting flexibility for market participants is an important contributor to create the dynamic market environment where entrepreneurs thrive.</p>
<p>Even though Congress did not set the SEC up to be a merit regulator, the securities laws are not hands-off the markets either. Legislation in 1975, for example, gave the SEC authority to &ldquo;facilitate the establishment of a national market system,&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;a directive that puzzles me since markets tend to establish themselves organically without a government facilitator. The securities laws also require market infrastructure providers, such as exchanges and clearinghouses, to go through a Commission approval process when they begin operations and whenever they change their rules. Substantive provisions govern mutual fund structure and operations. Broker-dealers generally must be members of a self-regulatory organization. Statutory provisions govern the proxy process, tender offers, and the process for obtaining shareholder input on executive compensation. Congress prohibited certain transactions by investment advisers. In many other instances, the securities statutes prescribe or proscribe specific conduct. Importantly, however, even where there are statutory prescriptions, Congress often provided the SEC the ability to make exceptions to them and to condition those exceptions as appropriate. This escape hatch and tailoring feature of the securities laws is another important tool to achieve sensible regulation.</p>
<p>The statutory background is only one factor in determining the quality of our regulation. The SEC adopts regulations to implement its statutory mandates, and it administers, interprets, and enforces the securities laws. How the SEC carries out these functions is very relevant to the question of whether securities regulation cultivates or suppresses the American spirit that celebrates freedom of enterprise, initiative, and thought.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s record on this score was better in the past than it is now. Over its ninety-year history, the SEC has enacted many regulations to implement statutory mandates. Those regulations generally have been principles-based. For example, much of the rulebook governing public company disclosures has embodied an approach that directs companies to provide investors a window into the company through the eyes of management, rather than ticking through a prescriptive checklist of items for disclosure. This framework accommodates all sorts of companies of all sizes in all sorts of industries. Likewise, the SEC&rsquo;s regulation of investment advisers, consistent with the statute&rsquo;s grounding in fiduciary duty, largely avoided prescriptions.</p>
<p>In this century, however, the Commission&rsquo;s regulatory approach has turned increasingly prescriptive as we expand the rulebook at a record-breaking clip. Some of these prescriptions are statutory, but many are a product of the SEC&rsquo;s discretion. Public companies are subject to an ever-growing list of disclosure rules. Some mandates seem designed to change the way companies operate, rather than to elicit material disclosures. In the past year, for example, we have adopted rules requiring certain companies to make extensive cyber and climate disclosures. Investment advisers, too, have seen their regulatory regime become more prescriptive, including most recently a new set of rules directed at reshaping the relationship between hedge fund advisers and investors. Additional proposals would micro-manage investment advisers&rsquo; interactions with their custodians and other service providers. Prescriptive rulemaking is not limited to public companies and investment advisers. Broker-dealers also face proposed prescriptions, including a new rule proposal that would govern how they execute trades. These types of regulations, particularly when they are not scaled for small entities, often act as barriers to entry into the securities industry. Moreover, the complexity discourages innovation since fitting new products, processes, or technologies into a thicket of complex and inflexible rules is challenging.</p>
<p>Not only is our rulebook expanding through new rulemakings, but aggressive interpretations of existing rules and statutes also add to the rulebook. For example, we have used an enforcement action to expand disclosure requirements.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;Recently, we have brought enforcement cases that effectively expand an internal accounting controls rule designed to ensure that financial statements are accurate and reliable when disclosed to investors. Now it also covers issues unrelated to the financial statements, including share repurchases,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;insider trading,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;airline flight routes,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;and workplace harassment.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, Congress gave us broad exemptive authority: when the statutes do not work for an asset class, a product, a transaction, or a type of entity, we can adjust them. We have used this authority to good effect in the past. For example, in the 1990s, the Commission could have forced automated trading venues&mdash;known back then as electronic communications networks&mdash;into the regulatory framework for national securities exchanges.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;Doing this would have subjected them to onerous innovation-deterring requirements, such as having to operate as a self-regulatory organization and to seek Commission review and approval of all their rules. Instead, the Commission clarified the regulatory landscape by clearly stating that these venues did fall within the definition of exchange but simultaneously used its exemptive authority to exempt them from regulation as exchanges so long as they satisfied the disclosure-focused requirements of operating as an alternative trading system, or ATS.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p>We also used our exemptive authority to accommodate a new product in the investment company space&mdash;exchange-traded funds. These variants on traditional mutual funds required exemptions from certain rules. We began issuing exemptive orders with conditions to ensure investor protection, and eventually we crafted a rule specifically for exchange-traded funds. Getting from the first, firm-specific exemptive order to a rule that applied to the whole industry took too long, but the SEC showed a willingness to facilitate the introduction of a new product into the market, a product that has revolutionized the investment portfolios of many Americans.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;After the finalization of the ETF rule, the Commission continued to work with the industry on the introduction of non-transparent ETFs.</p>
<p>Too often these days, we take a different approach&mdash;rather than using our authority to accommodate new products, new technology, and new ways of doing things, we reject them out of hand. We ask questions, not out of curiosity to work through the puzzle of finding a compliant way forward for new products and processes, but as part of a process seemingly designed to grind down those who propose an alternative to the status quo.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate with the SEC&rsquo;s approach to bitcoin exchange-traded products (&ldquo;ETPs&rdquo;). In 2013, the SEC received its first application for a spot bitcoin ETP. More than ten years later, we approved the first such products,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;but only after a federal court effectively forced our hand.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;During this decade of back-and-forth with bitcoin ETP applicants, our nebulous, unprecedented approval standard shifted inexplicably, and would-be ETP sponsors incurred large costs, in the form of time, money, and frustration. In the meantime, investors could not access a product, one that has exhibited record-breaking popularity.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;I personally am agnostic on the merits of these spot bitcoin products, but dragging the sponsors seeking to meet investor demand through a grueling ten-year regulatory obstacle course is not the best approach to investor protection.</p>
<p>More generally with respect to crypto, the Commission has failed to use its exemptive authority to good effect. A tailored registration and disclosure regime for crypto projects could have helped to avoid some of the problems we have seen in the market, but the Commission instead insists the existing disclosure regime works just fine for crypto. Insisting on treating tokens offered by tiny crypto projects as if they are shares in an IPO-ready company is wrong-headed. Attorney Steve Lofchie explains: &ldquo;Crypto firms are not arguing that crypto assets should not be regulated . . . . They are arguing that the SEC regulatory scheme applicable to securities, debt and other ordinary securities that represent ownership in a corporation are ill-suited for crypto.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;Consequently, the Commission can point to a long list of enforcement actions as examples of what not to do, but not to any viable path forward for crypto projects in the United States. We did use our authority to create a time-limited, strictly constrained regime for special purpose broker dealers to custody crypto asset securities, but only one firm has been able to register under this Commission guidance, perhaps because it is so restrictive and unwieldy.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a></p>
<p>I believe the SEC&rsquo;s motives are generally good; the agency wants to create a regulatory framework that brings investors and companies into our markets. Many of my colleagues at the Commission see much of this rulemaking and enforcement activity and withholding of exemptive relief as justified or even required by our mandate to protect investors.</p>
<p>I fear, however, that actions that may seem beneficial to investors in the short-run may harm investors and our capital markets in the long-run. Operating from deeply ingrained aversion to risk, the SEC often focuses its efforts on discouraging people from investing in projects that might fail to pan out, prohibiting firms from pursuing technologies or business models that we do not fully understand, and excluding new firms with which we are not familiar. Whether intentional or inadvertent, we end up persuading companies and market participants with new ideas that our markets are not for them. A disproportionate focus on preventing failures can fence out the upstart, disruptive entrepreneur who lacks an army of lawyers on retainer or rich friends on speed dial. Investor protection can morph into incumbent protection.</p>
<p>We should modulate our regulations to ensure that we are doing our part to keep America open to innovators, entrepreneurs, and upstart competitors. Some basic principles can guide that new regulatory approach. First, foster regulatory predictability so people have the space to make reliable educated assessments of regulatory risk. Second, take a prudent, humble, and iterative approach to regulation that can respond nimbly to innovation and that can identify and correct regulatory missteps. Third, relish the intellectual challenge of dealing with novel legal questions raised by innovative companies and products. Fourth, explore ways in which new technologies can make us a better regulator. You, as academics, can hold us accountable to regulating according to these and other sensible regulatory principles.</p>
<p>First, the Commission should focus on fostering a predictable regulatory framework. Rules need to keep up with changes in the market, but predictability is an essential precondition to a vibrant entrepreneurial culture. Rules may change, but they should do so after adequate time for public discussion about the wisdom of such changes. Only after a sufficiently long compliance period, during which the regulator has worked with the industry on implementation, should the government enforce a rule. This kind of predictability in the rule set gives people the confidence to invest in building a new company, product, or service. If, instead, rules can change on a dime to outlaw previously lawful activities or sometimes to make legal what was once illegal, people will be reluctant to do things that turn on what the law is. Just as a homeowner under threat of eminent domain will not remodel the kitchen in her house, a financial firm will not invest in a new product line that it fears could be taken away by a sudden regulatory change or an enforcement action premised on an unprecedented interpretation of an existing rule. Unlike the homeowner who is bound by geography, the company can roll out that new product line in a jurisdiction where regulation is predictable. Regulatory predictability gives entrepreneurs the confidence to try something new. A would-be entrepreneur in the jurisdiction of a regulator that acts arbitrarily and unpredictably is likely to settle into a conventional profession, which is less likely to attract regulatory attention. My French ride-share chauffeur would have to shelve his dream, or move elsewhere to pursue them.</p>
<p>Some of the SEC&rsquo;s recent crypto cases illustrate the problem that a lack of predictability brings. These cases struck many, including me, as arbitrary. The Commission, for example, recently brought a case against ShapeShift, an online crypto trading platform that had been operational since 2014. As Commissioner Uyeda and I noted in our dissent:</p>
<p>It is entirely unclear how ShapeShift was to discern that the Commission would consider crypto assets generally&mdash;and any crypto asset in particular&mdash;a security in the form of an investment contract. Even now, ten years on, it is hardly more discernible. But perhaps that ambiguity is exactly the result the Commission wants. Now the next person who comes up with an idea for building something to help other people buy or sell crypto will think twice. Why spend time and effort creating something only to face an enforcement action ten years later?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></p>
<p>Similarly, the SEC sued LBRY, a small crypto-project run by an enthusiastic team that had built a functional blockchain on which a video-sharing service operated. LBRY lost a company-crushing lawsuit&mdash;not based on fraud, but on a failure to anticipate how the Commission would apply registration rules designed for traditional equity or debt securities to a completely new genre of business enterprises.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a>&nbsp;The case sends a message to the next aspiring set of entrepreneurs, and it is not a message about America being the land of opportunity. While we are quite predictable now (in the SEC&rsquo;s eyes, just about every crypto asset is a security and just about every person that works with crypto-assets must somehow register), we let an entire industry languish for years in uncertainty as to how it should engage with us and our regulations. As a result, the bold were punished, and the timid never even tried.</p>
<p>Regulatory vacillation was on full display in the adoption of Rule 30e-3 in June 2018 and its quick subsequent rescission.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>&nbsp;Rule 30e-3 allowed certain funds to an optional method to satisfy their obligations to transmit shareholder reports by putting required documents on their websites and sending a paper notice to investors that notified them of the online availability and their right to request a paper version. If existing funds wanted to take advantage of the new rule, they needed to put their investors on notice for&nbsp;<i>two years</i>. Starting on January 1, 2021, funds could rely on the rule. The following year, in October 2022, the SEC adopted a new tailored shareholder reports rule that, along with many good changes, quite controversially prohibited funds from relying on Rule 30e-3.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a>&nbsp;After a multi-year process, funds would now have to spend extensive resources to adopt a completely new process and likely field inquiries from frustrated and confused fund shareholders. Proposing to unwind a rule we had just adopted before that rule was fully implemented is hardly an example of regulatory predictability.</p>
<p>Second, the Commission should exercise prudence and humility when taking regulatory action. Regulatory prudence arises out of serious consideration of the limitations of our knowledge, whether of new technologies or of investor preferences or, simply, of the future. These limitations mean that abrupt, comprehensive changes are unlikely to produce satisfactory results. Accordingly, before proposing new rules, the Commission needs to do the hard work of identifying discrete problems that are susceptible to being addressed through regulation. We need our large team of economists to identify whether the benefits of the proposed solution to those problems are larger than the cost of that solution. We need the public&rsquo;s help too. And when the Commission has done this work and decides to propose new rules, it should do so in an iterative manner. A staggered approach allows the SEC to identify problems in a way that leaves space for the Commission to respond nimbly to continued experimentation, for new entrants to disrupt incumbent firms, and for the Commission to correct regulatory errors without significant market disruption.</p>
<p>Prudence does not describe the Commission&rsquo;s approach to proposing market structure reforms in December 2022. On a single day, the Commission proposed four rules that, if adopted, would bring sweeping changes to our equity markets. These proposals would make changes to how execution quality is reported, to minimum tick sizes for quoting bids and offers and executing orders, to the standards defining &ldquo;best execution,&rdquo; and to the way retail customer orders are required to be handled, including mandating that they generally be sent to a periodic auction.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a>&nbsp;Among other concerns with this approach, the Commission had difficulty pinpointing an actual problem it was trying to solve&mdash;retail investors, after all, are getting better execution quality at lower cost than ever before. Moreover, determining whether these simultaneous sweeping changes actually would improve execution quality for retail investors is difficult. The most controversial component of the proposed set of solutions&mdash;the retail auctions&mdash;would impose uniform, mandatory rules on how these untried auctions must be structured. The proposed prescriptive mandate came just as the Commission was beginning to receive proposals for innovative, voluntary ways of conducting such auctions.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a></p>
<p>A prudent regulator, by contrast, looks to learn from industry experimentation rather than declare a premature end to experimentation by imposing a mandatory framework. Prudence counsels engaging with innovators early and often. We must acknowledge that project funders and employees working on the project cannot wait for commercialization indefinitely. Consequently, large, well-funded firms that can finance the wait have a leg up over smaller firms. The latter, unfettered by a history of doing things the old way and the red tape that is inevitable in large organizations, may be much better at timely spotting problems and quickly developing solutions. We should facilitate small scale experiments early, which can then be expanded, adjusted, or ended depending on the results of those experiments. These experiments can be very instructive in helping us to understand how markets work.</p>
<p>Third, the Commission as an agency needs to embrace and relish the challenge of dealing with the intersection of new technologies and new business models with the financial markets. Determining how to apply a longstanding regulatory framework to 21<span>st</span>-century technologies can present extraordinarily difficult challenges, but developing new rules to advance our three-part mission in the regulation of firms using the latest new technologies is also a difficult task. Although creating and maintaining a nimble approach to financial markets regulation is difficult, the Commission attracts a smart and talented workforce in part with the promise of being able to spend one&rsquo;s workday looking for solutions to hard problems. The Commission should expect and empower its staff to approach these issues creatively.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, the SEC has met inquiries about blockchain technology with a stubborn and decidedly uncreative insistence that existing rules work just fine. We have not worked seriously with people in the industry to figure out how to achieve our regulatory objectives in a way that is tailored to the opportunities and risks of the technology.</p>
<p>Technology does not always require new rules. Sometimes existing rules, paired with some technology-specific guidance, work just fine. One example someone recently pointed out to me was when the Commission, in the mid-to-late 1990s, took an iterative process to respond to the regulatory issues raised by the rise of the internet. It gathered industry feedback on where clarity might help registrants and issued responsive no-action letters<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a>&nbsp;and interpretive releases.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a>&nbsp;To take one instance, in 1995, the Commission issued guidance under various existing Commission statutes on how market participants could use electronic media to deliver information. The Commission &ldquo;appreciate[d] the promise of electronic distribution of information&rdquo; and aimed to &ldquo;encourage continued research and development and use of such media,&rdquo; because this approach could help investors.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-association-private-enterprise-education-040824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a>&nbsp;Accordingly, the Commission never issued sweeping rules that either overregulated the industry or locked in technologies or processes that became obsolete with time.</p>
<p>The Commission faces a similarly disruptive technology today in the form of artificial intelligence, and a similar approach could be appropriate here. Artificial intelligence may transform aspects of many industries, including the financial industry. Rather than attempting to adopt a sweeping new rule to deal once and for all with AI, we may be better off approaching it in a manner similar to how we treated the internet last century. If regulated firms need guidance on how particular AI practices interact with the securities regulatory framework, we should listen carefully without prejudice or hostility and provide timely, meaningful feedback rooted in law.</p>
<p>Fourth, the Commission should embrace, as appropriate, new technologies in its work to enhance our ability to execute our mission and to give our staff the familiarity with these technologies so that they can have fruitful conversations with market participants. Regulatory agencies often find it difficult to keep up with the pace of technological development in the industries that they regulate, which can easily turn them into reactive, suspicious regulators. They are reluctant to engage in frank discussions of the benefits and risks of new technologies, much less to accede to their use by firms they regulate.</p>
<p>AI again provides an opportunity to put this fourth principle to work. To figure out how AI might be useful, we should educate our employees in how the underlying technologies work and how to use AI. Armed with the employees&rsquo; suggestions on how AI might help them do their jobs faster and better, we can then examine whether AI can enhance the work experience and work product of SEC employees. We can look at how it might streamline how the SEC consumes information. Perhaps it could help reduce human error. Perhaps automation of routine tasks, such as reviewing filings by registrants, could free our staff&rsquo;s time to think deeply about thornier disclosure issues and other difficult and urgent legal questions from market participants. Using AI ourselves will sharpen our understanding and thereby make us better able to regulate the technology sensibly.</p>
<p>Importantly, as we put AI and other technologies to use at the SEC, we must avoid the very real temptation to misuse it. Because technology makes it easier to identify violations, it might be tempting to punish every foot fault. That approach to regulating the securities markets misses the forest for the trees. AI also makes it easier to engage in mass surveillance of marketplace activity. Indeed, we are doing that already with our Consolidated Audit Trail, which watches everyone&rsquo;s trading activity. If we are to be regulate consistent with the American spirit, we must restore our commitment to our fellow Americans&rsquo; privacy.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s commitment to these principles of regulation is not alone enough to maintain America&rsquo;s status as the land for people willing to think for themselves and take risks to bring their dreams to life. The SEC and other parts of the government play an important role in creating the right environment, but the dreamers and doers are essential to cultivating the American spirit. To that end, I encouraged our Parisian driver to move to the United States. When he emigrated to France from Algeria, he could have come to America, but had chosen France because of the language. I tried to convey in my French, which was undoubtedly worse than his English, that he already had an American mindset&mdash;a love of freedom, a dislike of conformity (he was not, as he put it, part of the &ldquo;flock&rdquo; of sheep), a passion for hard work, an overflowing well of business ideas, and a determination to see that his son has greater opportunities than he has had. Rolling out the welcome mat for him includes ensuring that our regulatory environment fosters, rather than stifles, the American spirit.</p>
