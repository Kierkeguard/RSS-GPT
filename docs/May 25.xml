<div class="elementToProof">
<p class="elementToProof"><span>Financial scams are on the rise globally, resulting in billions in financial losses for both financial institutions and the individual consumers they serve. The Knoble, a coalition of financial service professionals, law enforcement, regulators, and non-profit organisations dedicated to combating human crime, and BioCatch, which prevents financial crime by recognising patterns in human behaviour, are pleased to announce the release of a scams control business case: &ldquo;Measuring the Impact of Authorised Push Payment Scams: A Practical Framework for Financial Institutions.&rdquo;<b>&nbsp;</b></span></p>
</div>
<p class="elementToProof"><span>This powerful resource package, comprised of a cost-justification calculator, a practical guide, and a strategic presentation, aims to equip financial institutions with the tools they need to build a compelling business case for proactively investing in scam-prevention controls. The initiative was developed with one goal in mind: To help banks articulate not only the ethical imperative of scam control programs but also their return on investment.</span></p>
<p class="elementToProof"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="elementToProof"><span>&ldquo;Scams are not isolated financial crimes; they are deeply connected to human exploitation,&rdquo; said Emma Campbell, Director of Program Delivery. &ldquo;Financial institutions play a critical role in disrupting human crime, and this toolkit gives them the tools to build the business case and take action.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="elementToProof"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="elementToProof"><span>Scams have evolved beyond isolated incidents, as organised criminal groups intertwine their scamming operations with human trafficking, elder exploitation, and a variety of other crimes. This comprehensive business case toolkit draws upon financial trends, global benchmarks, and case studies to illustrate how investing in scam prevention can yield substantial cost savings, foster customer trust, and mitigate the potential for long-term financial losses.</span></p>
<p class="elementToProof"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="elementToProof"><span>The cost calculator helps stakeholders quantify the impact of scam losses. The accompanying guide offers clear instructions on using the calculator, while the presentation deck helps fraud leaders advocate for strategic scam control funding across the C-suite.</span></p>
<p class="elementToProof"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="elementToProof"><span>&ldquo;Scammers today aren&rsquo;t only lone-wolf, individual operators,&rdquo; BioCatch Senior Global Advisory Director Seth Ruden said. &ldquo;Increasingly, scams originate from industrialised complexes staffed in large part by trafficked peoples. The transnational criminal operations behind these scam camps employ a crime-as-a-service business model and harness GenAI-powered tools to improve both the sophistication and success of their attacks. Financial institutions deserve equally sophisticated scam controls. Delaying a proactive response only guarantees a future built on reactive defences.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="elementToProof"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="elementToProof"><span>To support the rollout of this business case, The Knoble and BioCatch will co-host an exclusive webinar on June 5, 2025, at noon ET:&nbsp;<b>&ldquo;Justifying the Investment: The Business Case for Scam Controls.&rdquo;</b>&nbsp;The session will unpack the contents of the toolkit, walk through the calculator, and highlight key scam control strategies that become possible once buy-in is secured.</span></p>
<p class="elementToProof"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="elementToProof"><span>The full resource package is available exclusively to members through the&nbsp;<b>Knoble Network Member Center Resource Library</b>. Not yet a member?

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>Good morning. I am pleased to welcome everyone here today. Thomas Laubach's research and support of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) helped us better understand monetary policy, and it is fitting that this work will continue today in his name. Thank you to the authors of the papers, to the discussants, and to our panel participants. Thank you also to Trevor and his team for organizing this conference; a lot of work went into bringing us together.</p>
<p>As in our last review, the 2025 review consists of three key elements: this conference,&nbsp;<em>Fed Listens</em>&nbsp;events at Reserve Banks around the country, and policymaker discussions and deliberations, supported by staff analysis, at a series of FOMC meetings. In the current review we will reconsider aspects of our strategic framework in light of the experience of the last five years. We will also consider possible enhancements to the Committee's policy communication tools, regarding forecasts, uncertainty, and risks.</p>
<p><span>The Consensus Statement</span><br />In 2012, the FOMC first codified our monetary policy framework in a document entitled the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which we refer to as the consensus statement.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20250515a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;The language in the opening paragraph, which has never changed, articulates our commitment to fulfilling our congressional mandate and to explaining clearly what we are doing and why (<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/powell-figure1-20250515.png" id="fig2">figure 1</a>).<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20250515a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;That clarity reduces uncertainty, improves the effectiveness of our policy, and enhances transparency and accountability.</p>
<p>As Chair, Ben Bernanke led the Committee through the creation of that initial consensus statement, adopting a 2 percent inflation target, and outlining our approach to achieving our congressionally assigned dual mandate. The framework laid out in that document broadly aligned with best practices for a flexible inflation-targeting central bank.</p>
<p>The structure of the economy evolves over time, and monetary policymakers' strategies, tools, and communications need to evolve with it. The challenges presented by the Great Depression differ from those of the Great Inflation and the Great Moderation, which in turn differ from the ones we face today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20250515a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;A framework should be robust to a broad range of conditions, but also needs to be updated periodically as the economy and our understanding of it evolve.</p>
<p><span>2019&ndash;20 Review</span><br />From 2012 to 2018, the FOMC voted at each January meeting to reaffirm the consensus statement, in most years without substantive changes.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20250515a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;In 2019, we changed that practice, conducting our first-ever public review, and said that we would repeat such reviews at roughly five-year intervals. There is nothing magic about a five-year pace. We believe that frequency is appropriate to reassess structural features of the economy and to engage with the public, practitioners, and academics on the performance of our framework. Several of our global peers have adopted similar approaches to their framework reviews.</p>
<p>At the time of the last review, we had been living for about a decade in a new normal characterized by proximity to the effective lower bound, with low interest rates, low growth, low inflation, and a very flat Phillips curve. If I could capture that era with one statistic, it would be that the policy rate had been stuck at the lower bound for seven long years following the onset of the Global Financial Crisis in late 2008 (<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/powell-figure2-20250515.png" id="fig3">figure 2</a>). After liftoff in December 2015, we were able to raise the policy rate only very gradually over a period of three years to a peak of just 2.4 percent. Seven months later, we began reducing it, leaving the rate at 1.6 percent in late 2019, where it would be when the pandemic arrived a few months later. Policy rates in other major advanced economies were even lower, in many cases below zero, and in all such economies, inflation regularly ran below its target.</p>
<p>The sense at that time was that when the economy next experienced even a mild downturn, we would be right back at the lower bound, probably for another extended period. The post&ndash;financial crisis decade had demonstrated the pain that could bring. Inflation would likely decline in a weak economy, raising real interest rates as nominal rates are pinned at zero. Higher real rates would further weigh on job growth and reinforce the downward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations.</p>
<p>Reflecting these concerns, we adopted a policy to make up for persistent shortfalls from the inflation target, an approach that was common in the extensive literature on the risks associated with the lower bound.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20250515a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;Given the downside risks to employment and inflation from proximity to the lower bound and the need to anchor longer-term inflation expectations at 2 percent, we said that following periods in which inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, we would likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.</p>
<p>We also concluded that policy decisions would be informed by assessments of "shortfalls" rather than "deviations" from maximum employment. The change to shortfalls was not a commitment to permanently forswear preemption or to ignore labor market tightness.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20250515a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;Rather, it signaled that apparent labor market tightness would not, in isolation, be enough to trigger a policy response, unless the Committee believed that, if left unchecked, it would lead to unwelcome inflationary pressure.</p>
<p>This change reflected our experience with long expansions that featured historically low unemployment amid low and stable inflation, suggesting that a policy approach that carefully probed for the maximum level of employment could bring about the benefits of a strong labor market without risking price stability. In the years just prior to the pandemic, for example, unemployment was at multidecade lows while inflation ran below 2 percent. By December 2019, estimates of the longer-run unemployment rate had fallen sharply (<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/powell-figure3-20250515.png" id="fig4">figure 3</a>).<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20250515a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;The use of "shortfalls" acknowledged that a combination of low inflation and low unemployment does not necessarily pose an adverse tradeoff for monetary policy.</p>
<p>The economic conditions that brought us close to the lower bound and drove the changes in our consensus statement were thought to be rooted in slow-moving global factors that were likely to persist for an extended period&mdash;at least until our next five-year review.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20250515a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;And that might well have been the case had the pandemic not intervened.</p>
<p>The idea of an intentional, moderate overshoot proved irrelevant to our policy discussions and has remained so through today. There was nothing intentional or moderate about the inflation that arrived a few months after we announced our changes to the consensus statement. I acknowledged as much publicly in 2021.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20250515a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;We fell back on the rest of the framework, which called for traditional inflation targeting.</p>
<p>Through the end of 2021, FOMC participants continued to forecast that inflation was likely to subside fairly quickly in 2022, with only a moderate increase in our policy rate. That projection was consistent with other central banks with different frameworks and the vast majority of forecasters (<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/powell-figure4-20250515.png" id="fig5">figure 4</a>).<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20250515a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;When the evidence showed otherwise, we hiked 525 basis points over a period of 16 months. The most recent data suggest that 12-month PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation was 2.2 percent in April, far below its 7.2 percent peak in 2022.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20250515a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;In a welcome and historically unusual result, this disinflation has come without the sharp increase in unemployment that has often accompanied a campaign of rate hikes to reduce inflation.</p>
<p>The economic environment has changed significantly since 2020, and our review will reflect our assessment of those changes. Longer-term interest rates are a good deal higher now, driven largely by real rates given the stability of longer-term inflation expectations. Many estimates of the longer-run level of the policy rate have risen, including those in the Summary of Economic Projections (<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/powell-figure5-20250515.png" id="fig6">figure 5</a>).<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20250515a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a></p>
<p>Higher real rates may also reflect the possibility that inflation could be more volatile going forward than in the inter-crisis period of the 2010s. We may be entering a period of more frequent, and potentially more persistent, supply shocks&mdash;a difficult challenge for the economy and for central banks.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20250515a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a></p>
<p>While our policy rate is currently well above the lower bound, in recent decades we have cut the rate by about 500 basis points when the economy is in recession.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20250515a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;Although getting stuck at the lower bound is no longer the base case, it is only prudent that the framework continue to address that risk.</p>
<p>While the framework must evolve, some elements of it are timeless. Policymakers emerged from the Great Inflation with a clear understanding that it was essential to anchor inflation expectations at an appropriately low level. During the Great Moderation, well-anchored inflation expectations allowed us to provide policy support to employment without risking destabilizing inflation.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20250515a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a>&nbsp;Since the Great Inflation, the U.S. economy has had three of its four longest expansions on record.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20250515a.htm#fn16" title="footnote 16"><span>16</span></a><a name="f16"></a>&nbsp;Anchored expectations played a key role in facilitating these expansions. More recently, without that anchor, it would not have been possible to achieve a roughly 5 percentage point disinflation without a spike in unemployment.</p>
<p>Keeping longer-run inflation expectations anchored was a driving force behind establishing the 2 percent target in the 2012 framework. Maintaining that anchor was a major consideration behind the changes in 2020. Anchored expectations are critical to everything we do, and we remain fully committed to the 2 percent target today.</p>
<p><span>2025 Review</span><br />In the current review, the Committee is engaged in discussions about what we have learned from the experience of the past five years. We plan to complete consideration of specific changes to the consensus statement in coming months. We are paying particular attention to the 2020 changes as we consider discrete but important updates reflecting what we have learned about the economy, and the way those changes were interpreted by the public. In our discussions so far, participants have indicated that they thought it would be appropriate to reconsider the language around shortfalls. And at our meeting last week, we had a similar take on average inflation targeting. We will ensure that our new consensus statement is robust to a wide range of economic environments and developments.</p>
<p>In addition to revising the consensus statement, we will also consider potential enhancements to our formal policy communications, particularly regarding the role of forecasts and uncertainty. As we have been reviewing assessments of the 2020 framework and of policy decisions in recent years, a common observation is the need for clear communications as complex events unfold. While academics and market participants generally have viewed the FOMC's communications as effective, there is always room for improvement.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20250515a.htm#fn17" title="footnote 17"><span>17</span></a><a name="f17"></a>&nbsp;Indeed, clear communication is an issue even in relatively placid times. A critical question is how to foster a broader understanding of the uncertainty that the economy generally faces. In periods with larger, more frequent, or more disparate shocks, effective communication requires that we convey the uncertainty that surrounds our understanding of the economy and the outlook. We will examine ways to improve along that dimension as we move forward.</p>
<p>Let me end by saying thank you again for being here. We have been looking forward to the conversations that will occur over the next two days. These discussions will help broaden and deepen our thinking about these issues, and they are critical to the success of these reviews.</p>

<p><a name="fn2"></a>2. The first paragraph of the current consensus statement was the second paragraph of the initial statement in 2012. That initial consensus statement began with the following language: "Following careful deliberations at its recent meetings, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has reached broad agreement on the following principles regarding its longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy. The Committee intends to reaffirm these principles and to make adjustments as appropriate at its annual organizational meeting each January." In 2013, the first sentence of that preamble was deleted, and the second was moved to the end of the statement.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20250515a.htm#f2">Return to text</a></p>

<p><a name="fn4"></a>4. An exception was in January 2016, when the statement was amended to highlight the symmetric nature of the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective by noting, among other small changes, that "the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below this objective" (paragraph 3).&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20250515a.htm#f4">Return to text</a></p>

It is important to differentiate between the change from "deviations" to "shortfalls" in the strategy laid out within the consensus statement, and the subsequent tactical use of forward guidance beginning in the September 2020 FOMC.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20250515a.htm#f6">Return to text</a></p>
<p><a name="fn7"></a>7. In the January 2012 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), the range of estimates for the longer-run unemployment rate was 5 percent to 6 percent, and the median was 5.5 percent; by December 2019, that range was 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent, and the median had declined to 4.1 percent.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20250515a.htm#f7">Return to text</a></p>

<p><a name="fn10"></a>10. In December 2021, the median SEP projection anticipated core inflation declining from 4.4 percent in 2021 to 2.7 percent in 2022, while the federal funds rate projection for the end of 2022 was 0.9 percent, below its longer-run estimate of 2.5 percent. Similarly, the December 2021 Survey of Primary Dealers as well as the December 2021 Blue Chip consensus anticipated core inflation in 2022 of 2.5 percent and 2.6 percent, respectively, alongside average projections of short-term interest rates that remained below 1 percent throughout 2022.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20250515a.htm#f10">Return to text</a></p>

<title>SGX RegCo Consults On Measures In Line With A More Disclosure-Based Regime</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sgx-regco-consults-on-measures-in-line-with-a-more-disclosure-based-regime-2025515/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In line with an approach that adopts a pro-enterprise stance alongside measures to strengthen investor confidence, Singapore Exchange Regulation (SGX RegCo) is proposing regulatory changes towards a more disclosure-based regime. This is one part of recommendations announced by the Equities Market Review Group (Review Group) in February 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SGX RegCo will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Move towards ensuring robust disclosures and away from prescribing what companies should do. This shift recognises the increasing diversity and complexity of the market and investors, and emphasises giving investors sufficient information to make their own decisions.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
<li>Tighten the focus on the materiality of information that needs to be disclosed in a timely and accurate manner, so that the market can better discriminate in favour of companies with high standards of corporate governance and disclosure.</li>
<li>Address concerns of regulatory friction that impedes price discovery and market efficiency. These adjustments will strike a more proportionate balance in facilitating market discipline and achieving investor protection.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Maintain its focus on the admission of quality issuers and robust trade and corporate surveillance.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The intended changes will complement the other measures the Review Group announced to promote institutional participation, and foster an attractive and trusted market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The proposed measures will shift us towards a more market-driven, disclosure-based regime. This will smoothen the path for enterprises to access the capital markets, allowing investors an expanded range of investing opportunities and better ability to make investment decisions in reliance on relevant and material information,&rdquo; said Tan Boon Gin, CEO of SGX RegCo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The effectiveness of such a market-driven approach rests on a foundation of rules and standards that assure market participants that the information on which they base their decisions is accurate and accessible, and that the market is fair. This is the philosophy behind today&rsquo;s consultation. To that end, we will ensure that regulatory oversight of both corporate disclosures and trading activity remains rigorous, even as we refine the manner in which such oversight is conducted and communicated, to ensure relevant and material information for investors is disclosed,&rdquo; said Mr Tan.</p>
<p>Areas in which SGX RegCo has proposed reforms for public consultation include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="Style2"><strong>Streamlining qualitative Mainboard admission criteria</strong></p>
<p class="Style2">SGX RegCo intends to streamline the qualitative admission criteria for the Mainboard, while ensuring that listing applicants continue to be of high quality.&nbsp;SGX RegCo will maintain a prescriptive approach on the listing applicant&rsquo;s financial position and its directors, management and controlling shareholders, which are critical areas. The focus for other matters will be on ensuring relevant and robust disclosures for investors to make well informed decisions, rather than prescribing how such matters must be resolved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="Style2"><strong>Refining quantitative Mainboard admission criteria&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="Style2">SGX RegCo is also seeking views on potential calibrations to certain quantitative admission criteria, specifically, the profit test for Mainboard admission.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="Style2CxSpFirst"><strong>Removal of the financial watch-list</strong></p>
<p>SGX RegCo is seeking feedback on its intention to remove the financial watch-list<sup>[1]</sup>&nbsp;to address feedback from market participants on its unintended consequences on issuers, such as the negative impact on business confidence and difficulties in obtaining financing. Issuers must still make an announcement when they report losses for three consecutive years so investors are informed. Pending the outcome of the consultation, SGX RegCo will provisionally suspend the half-yearly reviews to place issuers on the watch-list. Issuers on the watch-list will remain listed during this time, regardless of their inability to exit the watch-list in accordance with the relevant criteria.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="Style2CxSpFirst"><strong>Other post-listing queries and obligations</strong></p>
<p class="Style2CxSpFirst">In addition to the proposed Listing Rule changes, SGX RegCo intends to adopt a more targeted approach in its administrationof post-listing queries and obligations to address market feedback that issuing queries, regardless of the materiality of the matter, may cause unnecessary alarm to the market. The more targeted approach aims to strike a better balance in facilitating market discipline and achieving investor protection.</p>
<p class="Style2CxSpFirst">The calibrated administration will include (a) shifting from publicly querying issuers to private engagement when unusual trading is detected; (b) focusing public disclosure requirements on information that is materially price-sensitive or trade-sensitive; (c) limiting the validity period of trade-with-caution alerts to an initial period of two weeks; and (d) refining its approach to the suspension of issuers.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Style2CxSpFirst">SGX RegCo&rsquo;s practices for other market surveillance activities will remain unchanged; this includes continuous monitoring of the market for unusual trading activity and, where necessary, taking actions to forestall market abuse. SGX RegCo will continue to decisively deploy the range of regulatory tools available and intervene when there are issues of serious trading irregularities and market manipulation. In addition, failure to comply with disclosure obligations may, as is currently the case, result in penalties under the Listing Rules and the Securities and Futures Act 2001. Where necessary, SGX RegCo will refer such cases to the Monetary Authority of Singapore and other relevant authorities for further enforcement action. The Review Group is also separately reviewing investor recourse avenues in instances of market misconduct.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enabling shareholder-requisitioned meetings</strong></p>
<p>SGX RegCo&nbsp;had last year consulted on a proposal to require companies to assist shareholders requisitioning general meetings so that the meetings can take place as soon as practicable. SGX RegCo expects to announce its response to the consultation in the coming months. The related rule change will further empower shareholders, thereby strengthening market discipline.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This consultation is found&nbsp;<a href="https://regco.sgx.com/public-consultations">here</a>&nbsp;and will close on 14 June 2025.</p>
<p><em><sup>[1]</sup>&nbsp;SGX RegCo will place an issuer listed on the Mainboard on the financial watch-list if it records pre-tax losses for the 3 most recently completed consecutive financial years (based on audited full year consolidated accounts) and an average daily market capitalisation of less than S$40 million over the last 6 months.&nbsp;</em></p>

<title>UOB Malaysia And Bursa Malaysia Collaborate To Support SMEs On Decarbonisation Journey</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uob-malaysia-and-bursa-malaysia-collaborate-to-support-smes-on-decarbonisation-j-2025515/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uob-malaysia-and-bursa-malaysia-collaborate-to-support-smes-on-decarbonisation-j-2025515/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>UOB Malaysia today announced a collaboration with Bursa Malaysia Berhad (Bursa Malaysia or the Exchange) to facilitate Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) in adopting sustainability practices and advancing their decarbonisation journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This collaboration is central to the Bank&rsquo;s newly expanded Sustainability Accelerator Programme 2.0 (SAP 2.0). First launched in October 2023, SAP 1.0 was designed to equip SMEs with foundational knowledge to kick-start their ESG journey, enabled through UOB&rsquo;s Sustainability Compass tool (co-developed with PWC) and customised financing solutions such as the U-Series (comprising U-Energy, U-Solar and U-Drive).</p>
<p>&nbsp;Building on the success of the initial phase, SAP 2.0 takes the Bank&rsquo;s commitment further by providing its SME clients with access to Bursa Malaysia&rsquo;s Centralised Sustainability Intelligence (CSI) Solution, reducing complexities of emissions calculation and facilitating uptake of relevant decarbonisation solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking at the launch held at UOB Plaza 1 Kuala Lumpur attended by senior representatives of both organisations, industry stakeholders and the bank&rsquo;s SME clients, Ms Ng Wei Wei, Chief Executive Officer of UOB Malaysia, said, &ldquo;We are honoured to be the first bank to partner with Bursa Malaysia. Under UOB&rsquo;s SAP 2.0 Programme, in addition to our enhanced suites of SME-centric solutions, the Bank will also fund Bursa&rsquo;s CSI Solution&rsquo;s subscription fees for our SME clients. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reporting can be a daunting aspect of the decarbonisation journey, and by lowering this barrier and helping them calculate and report their GHG emissions more effectively, we hope to empower more SMEs to transition. I truly believe that strong public-private collaboration is essential to help businesses to decarbonise&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dato&rsquo; Fad&rsquo;l Mohamed, Chief Executive Officer of Bursa Malaysia, said &ldquo;This collaboration with UOB Malaysia marks a significant step forward in expanding our CSI ecosystem to benefit a wider group of companies. Just as our CSI Solution has empowered public listed companies (PLCs) to meet disclosure obligations and guide their decarbonisation, we are now extending the same capabilities to SMEs, enabling them to progress confidently on their sustainability journey. We applaud UOB Malaysia for taking proactive steps in encouraging sustainable business practices among SMEs, particularly through the use of the CSI Solution. We look forward to seeing other financial institutions follow suit. These collective efforts will accelerate Malaysia&rsquo;s transition to a low-carbon economy&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The CSI Platform serves as the Exchange&rsquo;s designated sustainability reporting channel for all PLCs. As part of this designation, the platform supports the ISSB IFRS S1 and S2 disclosure requirements adopted under the National Sustainability Reporting Framework (NSRF). With the Scope 3 emissions disclosure requirement commencing in phases, starting 2027, SMEs within the PLCs&rsquo; supply chains will need to be prepared to meet these reporting obligations. The UOB-Bursa Malaysia collaboration aims to better equip participating SMEs to meet growing sustainability demands from stakeholders, including large customers like multinational corporations (MNCs) and public-listed companies (PLCs), for GHG emissions data for their Scope 3 supply chain emissions1 reporting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides Bursa Malaysia, UOB Malaysia has also joined forces with Control Union and DHL Express Malaysia to offer a suite of solutions in the areas of emissions data assurance, green certifications, green logistics, energy efficiency and renewable energy initiatives. UOB Malaysia&rsquo;s pioneering initiative under the SAP 2.0 programme reflects the Bank&rsquo;s steadfast commitment to promoting sustainable practices among SMEs, contributing to the broader goal of an inclusive and sustainable future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>(1) Scope 3 emissions refer to indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that occur throughout an organisation&rsquo;s value chain, both upstream and downstream, but are not directly owned or controlled by the company. These emissions arise from activities like supply chain operations, transportation, product usage, and disposal, and can represent a significant portion of a company&rsquo;s total carbon footprint.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<ul>
<li>Government delivers legislation to establish the Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System Sandbox (<abbr title="Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System Sandbox">PISCES</abbr>) &ndash; an innovative new type of stock market for private companies that will boost the growth companies of the future and support the UK&rsquo;s IPO pipeline.&nbsp;</li>
<li>This delivers on the Chancellor&rsquo;s Mansion House commitment to launch&nbsp;<abbr title="Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System Sandbox">PISCES</abbr>&nbsp;by May, with share trading taking place later this year.</li>
<li>The government will legislate to ensure that employees who have share options will be able to exercise them on&nbsp;<abbr title="Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System Sandbox">PISCES</abbr>&nbsp;and retain tax advantages, making the platform more attractive for companies and investors looking to use&nbsp;<abbr title="Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System Sandbox">PISCES</abbr>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Capital markets are set to be boosted, as part of this government&rsquo;s Plan for Change as we deliver legislation for&nbsp;<abbr title="Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System Sandbox">PISCES</abbr>, a new type of stock market which will give investors the chance to get in on the ground floor of some of the most exciting companies around, so supporting those businesses to grow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s announcement means that stock markets can launch their&nbsp;<abbr title="Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System Sandbox">PISCES</abbr>&nbsp;platforms in the coming months with shares likely to be traded in the Autumn.&nbsp;Thanks to&nbsp;<abbr title="Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System Sandbox">PISCES</abbr>, private company shareholders, which includes founders and early-stage investors, can more easily realise their gains and reinvest this in productive assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a boost to growth companies and start-ups, the government has also confirmed that it will legislate to ensure employees retain tax advantages on the share options they have, which will make&nbsp;<abbr title="Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System Sandbox">PISCES</abbr>&nbsp;more attractive and encourage even more businesses to use the platform.</p>
<p><strong>Emma Reynolds, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Getting&nbsp;<abbr title="Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System Sandbox">PISCES</abbr>&nbsp;up and running will support UK growth companies. This will boost our capital markets and help to grow our economy, putting more money in working people&rsquo;s pockets as part of our Plan for Change.</p>
<p class="last-child">We are also ensuring that employees will retain the tax advantages of shares traded on&nbsp;<abbr title="Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System Sandbox">PISCES</abbr>&nbsp;to boost the attractiveness of the product to high growth companies looking to expand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Simon Walls, Executive Director of Markets at the&nbsp;<abbr title="Financial Conduct Authority">FCA</abbr>, said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are laying the groundwork for a new private stock market that will give investors more opportunities to invest in growing companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="last-child">Today&rsquo;s legislation is a big step forward and we will set out the final rules for&nbsp;<abbr title="Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System Sandbox">PISCES</abbr>&nbsp;soon. Together, this will support an organised marketplace to buy and sell private shares.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To ensure employees can continue to benefit from the tax advantages on their shares, the law will be changed to extend to the existing Enterprise Management Incentives (EMI) and Company Share Option Plan (CSOP) contracts to also include&nbsp;<abbr title="Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System Sandbox">PISCES</abbr>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is in addition to the announcement in the Autumn Budget making&nbsp;<abbr title="Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System Sandbox">PISCES</abbr>&nbsp;transactions exempt from Stamp Taxes on Shares. Today&rsquo;s announcement on tax mean that employees as well as investors will benefit from the tax changes made, further increasing the attractiveness of the project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s reform delivers on the Chancellor&rsquo;s commitment at Mansion House to deliver&nbsp;<abbr title="Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System Sandbox">PISCES</abbr>, a new innovative market for trading private company shares, combining features of private and public markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Companies and investors using the platform will benefit from greater flexibility and have greater freedom to choose when and to whom their shares are traded with, and they will only be required to disclose information ahead of trading.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The platform will act as a stepping stone for companies eyeing a listing in future preparing and easing the journey to an IPO.</p>
<p>With many companies choosing to stay private for longer, there is increasing demand for investors, including angel investors and employees, to be able to trade shares in private companies more easily.</p>
<p>The Financial Conduct Authority will publish their rules underpinning&nbsp;<abbr title="Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System Sandbox">PISCES</abbr>&nbsp;shortly after the legislation comes into force. Thereafter, those wishing to operate&nbsp;<abbr title="Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System Sandbox">PISCES</abbr>&nbsp;trading events can apply to the&nbsp;<abbr title="Financial Conduct Authority">FCA</abbr>. We expect to see the first&nbsp;<abbr title="Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System Sandbox">PISCES</abbr>&nbsp;trading events take place later this year.</p>

<title>Capital.Com Reports $656 Billion In Client Trading Volumes In Q1 2025 - Staff Numbers Surpass 1,000 As The Company Grows Its Bench Strength Across Tech And Engineering Teams</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div><span id="gmail-docs-internal-guid-386e6cfa-7fff-cbd3-ee6d-cf3794638147">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Capital.com, the high-growth global trading platform and fintech group, today announced strong trading activity in the first quarter of 2025, marking a solid start to the year amid global market volatility and heightened client demand.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>For the period 1 Jan 2025 to 31 March 2025, the platform reported $656 billion in client trading volumes. This is 11% higher than the previous quarter.&nbsp;</span><span>Over the same period,&nbsp;</span><span>the</span><span>&nbsp;number of users who opened a new account on Capital.com reached over 800,000.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The platform&rsquo;s solid quarterly performance follows a record-breaking 2024, during which client trading volumes exceeded $1.7 trillion. As Capital.com continues to scale, the company has now surpassed 1,000 employees globally, marking a major milestone in its evolution from a fast-growing start-up to a high-growth fintech.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Ariel Segev, Chief Financial Officer at Capital.com</span><span>, commented:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>"With client trading volumes totalling $656 billion in Q1 alone, we&rsquo;re seeing extraordinary momentum across our global business. This growth not only reflects the strength of our platform but also our commitment to give clients access to a broader range of markets and smarter tools. As we grow our team beyond 1,000 people, our focus is on innovation, diversification, and delivering choice for every trader."</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Client engagement levels in Q1 were equally robust.&nbsp; The number of trades executed on the platform in Q1 2025 totalled 48 million, reflecting a 23% increase over the previous quarter. Strong client activity in the first quarter of this year coincides with Capital.com&rsquo;s commitment to speed and reliability where trades are executed in as little as 0.024 seconds and 91% of withdrawals are processed within 5 minutes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;We saw a significant rise in trading activity in Q1, driven by increased market volatility, macroeconomic uncertainty, and renewed interest in key markets like the Nasdaq 100 Index and gold,&rdquo; explained&nbsp;</span><span>Christoforus Soutzis, CEO, Capital.com Europe</span><span>. &ldquo;Our clients are responding to global events in real time, and our platform is enabling them to act quickly, confidently, and with greater speed than ever before,&rdquo; he added.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In the first quarter of 2025, the most actively traded markets on the Capital.com platform were major stock market indices, notably the Nasdaq 100 Index. This was followed by commodity markets, primarily gold.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;Interest in these markets were fueled by increased market attention surrounding the US presidential primaries, and sentiment regarding potential Trump administration policies. Meanwhile, ongoing inflation worries and geopolitical instability sustained the demand for gold as a safe-haven asset,&rdquo; explained Soutzis.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Clients from the Middle East were the most active traders in Q1 2025 and accounted for the highest volume of trades over the period (53%), followed by traders from Europe (24%), affirming Capital.com&rsquo;s growing presence in these markets.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Building on this momentum, Capital.com is actively expanding its product and engineering teams to support the development of new trading and investment products. The company is currently hiring across its global offices in Europe, the Middle East, and Australia. In&nbsp; late 2024, Capital.com announced plans to onboard 200 additional tech and engineering professionals</span><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>"Great products are built by great people. As we grow our global footprint, we are committed to matching top-tier talent with a bold product vision&mdash;ensuring we continue to lead the market with innovation that puts our clients first,"&nbsp;added Soutzis.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange (HOSE) has officially launched its next-generation trading platform, marking a major milestone in the modernization of Vietnam&rsquo;s capital market infrastructure. A key component of this transformation is the successful deployment of a Central Securities Depository (CSD) solution delivered by&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.cma.se/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CMA Small Systems AB</a>&nbsp;to the Vietnam Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation (VSDC).</p>
<p>Vietnam&rsquo;s capital market has witnessed rapid growth in recent years, with over 9.6 million investor accounts as of April 2025. The scale, complexity, and ambition of this project demanded a flexible, highly secure, and feature-rich depository platform capable of supporting high-volume, real-time operations and seamless integration with the new trading engine co-developed with the Korea Exchange (KRX).</p>
<p>The new CSD solution, based on CMA&rsquo;s DEPO/X platform, is now fully operational at VSDC. It covers a comprehensive range of post-trade functionalities including dematerialization, real-time settlement, corporate actions processing, registry services, and support for T+0 settlement cycles. The system is fully compliant with ISO 20022 messaging standards and includes a dedicated Securities Lending and Borrowing (SLB) module, expanding market liquidity and enhancing risk management.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vietnam&rsquo;s capital market required a solution that could meet both current demands and future ambitions,&rdquo; said Bulat Nizamov, Director of Capital Markets Products at CMA. &ldquo;With DEPO/X, we delivered a system tailored to the local context while fully aligned with international best practices. The inclusion of advanced modules like SLB and T+0 settlement makes it one of the most forward-looking CSD implementations in the region.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This achievement highlights our ability to deliver mission-critical financial infrastructure for complex and rapidly developing markets,&rdquo; said Maxim Neshcheret, Regional Director for Asia-Pacific and Central Asia at CMA. &ldquo;It further validates the strength, flexibility, and maturity of our DEPO/X solution and reconfirms CMA&rsquo;s position alongside major providers of exchange-integrated CSD platforms such as Nasdaq and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS).&rdquo;</p>
<p>With over 25 national CSD installations worldwide, CMA is one of the most trusted global providers of depository and registry solutions for stock exchanges, central banks, and financial market infrastructures&mdash;especially in high-growth and emerging markets.</p>
<p>The successful launch reflects strong cooperation between HOSE, VSDC, domestic stakeholders, and international partners. It reinforces Vietnam&rsquo;s readiness for broader market participation, regional integration, and sustainable capital market development.</p>

<title>European Stability Mechanism Selects Eurex Clearing For Voluntary Clearing Of Interest Rate Swaps</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="paragraph">
<ul class="rte--list">
<li>The ESM's decision to voluntarily clear OTC interest rate swaps underlines the importance of central clearing for financial stability and efficiency.</li>
<li>This contributes to the objectives of EMIR 3.0 and strengthens the EU clearing ecosystem.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Clear support for Eurex Clearing&rsquo;s efforts to build an alternative liquidity pool within the EU.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The European Stability Mechanism (ESM) has selected Eurex Clearing to voluntarily clear over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate swaps, demonstrating a clear commitment to strengthening the EU financial ecosystem. This decision recognizes the critical role of central clearing in promoting financial stability and actively supports Eurex Clearing&rsquo;s efforts to enhance the strong alternative liquidity pool within the EU, thereby advancing the European sovereignty agenda.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ESM was welcomed as a clearing member during today&rsquo;s Bell Ringing ceremony at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in the presence of ESM Managing Director Pierre Gramegna, CFO Kalin Anev Janse and Deutsche B&ouml;rse&acute;s CEO Stephan Leithner.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Strengthening the EU clearing ecosystem</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By voluntarily committing to CCP clearing, the ESM&rsquo;s decision contributes to the objectives of EMIR 3.0 and significantly strengthens Europe's attractiveness, actively supports the development of a robust and resilient clearing ecosystem in Europe and reduces the EU&rsquo;s dependence on third country clearing houses.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ESM provides financial assistance to euro area member states experiencing or threatened with severe financing difficulties, thereby safeguarding financial stability in the eurozone. Interest rate swaps are essential instruments for the ESM to manage its financial obligations and ensure cost-effective lending programs. By clearing its OTC IRS through an EU clearing house, ESM is taking proactive steps to mitigate counterparty risk, reduce risk management costs and further streamline its operational processes. Its decision in line with the EU Commission&rsquo;s call to public sector entities in EMIR 3.0 will increase the scope of active players and strengthen the EU based clearing environment, making an important contribution to enhancing safety and strategic sovereignty.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Supporting the Savings and Investment Union</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This step also contributes to the broader objectives of the EU's Savings and Investment Union by increasing market efficiency and transparency. Central clearing helps to create a more attractive investment environment and contributes to wider and more integrated European capital markets. The move strengthens Eurex Clearing's position as a central pillar of the European clearing landscape and reinforces its commitment to promoting financial stability and market integrity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"We are delighted to welcome the ESM as a clearing member," said Stephan Leithner, CEO of Deutsche B&ouml;rse AG. "The ESM&rsquo;s decision to CCP clear interest rate swaps in the EU is a key contribution to reinforcing financial stability and strategic autonomy within the region &ndash; a significant step forward for the entire European market. This underscores Eurex Clearing's vital role in providing secure and efficient clearing services, and positions us for continued growth and innovation within the evolving European financial landscape."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>&ldquo;This move is a message of trust in the European financial system and demonstrates the ESM's commitment to innovation and progress. It also supports the broader objective of deepening European capital markets, fostering economic growth and competitiveness,&rdquo; ESM Managing Director Pierre Gramegna said. &nbsp;&ldquo;I am very pleased to have Eurex as the ESM&rsquo;s partner in this journey.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<title>Securities Commission Malaysia : High Court Strikes Out Former MMM Executive Deputy Chairman’s Suit Challenging Validity Of Insider Trading Law</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The High Court (Special Powers Division) today struck out a civil suit filed by the former Executive Deputy Chairman of Malaysian Merchant Marine Berhad (MMM), Dato&rsquo; Ramesh Rajaratnam (Ramesh), against the Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) and the Government of Malaysia. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Justice Dato' Amarjeet Singh a/l Serjit Singh ruled that the originating summons filed by Ramesh was an abuse of court process and awarded costs of RM5,000 to the SC and the Government of Malaysia respectively.</p>
<p>On 10 September 2024, Ramesh commenced a civil suit at the High Court (Special Powers Division) and sought a declaration that section 188(2)(a) of the Capital Markets and Services Act 2007 (CMSA) was contrary to Articles 5(1), 8(1) and (2), 10(1)(a) and 13 of the Federal Constitution and therefore null, void, and of no effect immediately.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>In response, the SC filed an application on 8 October 2024 to strike out the civil suit on the grounds that it was barred by res judicata, amounted to an abuse of process, and was a collateral attack upon his criminal conviction by the Sessions Court and his ongoing criminal appeal before the High Court.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Ramesh was previously charged at the Kuala Lumpur Sessions Court on 29 April 2015 with three charges of insider trading under section 188(2)(a) of the CMSA. He was convicted following a full trial and was sentenced to five years imprisonment and a fine of RM3 million (in default three years imprisonment) for each charge. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In relation to the appeal to the High Court, Ramesh&rsquo;s conviction and sentence on all three charges were set aside on the grounds of judicial copying by the trial judge. The Court of Appeal subsequently reinstated his conviction and sentence for the first charge upon the Public Prosecutor&rsquo;s appeal and remitted the case to the High Court for the case to be heard on its merits. The appeal on merits is pending hearing before the High Court. &nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li><b><i>Regulated Crypto Services:</i></b><i> Licensed by the Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB), BitOasis provides secure, compliant, and reliable crypto trading services for retail, corporate, and institutional users across the GCC.</i> </li>
<li><b><i>Seamless Trading Experience:</i></b><i> With an intuitive interface for beginners and advanced features for experienced traders, BitOasis offers a versatile platform to meet the needs of every type of trader. Local bank transfer support ensures smooth deposits and withdrawals throughout the region.</i></li>
<li><b><i>Premium Services for High-Value Clients: </i></b><i>Exclusive VIP offerings and dedicated relationship support for high-net-worth individuals and institutional clients in Bahrain.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>BitOasis, the Middle East and North Africa&rsquo;s (MENA) leading regional virtual assets trading platform, has officially launched its operations in Bahrain, reinforcing its position as the region&rsquo;s most trusted, compliant, and locally rooted broker-dealer platform. BitOasis Bahrain will operate under a Crypto-Asset Services License from the Central Bank of Bahrain, delivering secure, compliant, and robust trading services for retail, corporate, and institutional users. Designed to cater to all types of traders, it offers an easy-to-navigate interface for beginners, while also providing advanced features for more experienced traders seeking sophisticated tools.</p>
<p>To expand its presence in the region, BitOasis has launched premium services for high-net-worth individuals and institutional clients, featuring exclusive VIP offerings and dedicated relationship support. The platform also supports local bank transfers, ensuring seamless and efficient deposits and withdrawals across the GCC.</p>
<p>Attendees at the launch event were joined by Ali Dashti, the General Manager of BitOasis Bahrain, Ola Doudin, CEO and Co-Founder of BitOasis, and Sumit Gupta, Co-Founder of CoinDCX.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today marks a significant milestone as we proudly launch BitOasis in Bahrain,&rdquo; said Ola Doudin, CEO and Co-Founder of BitOasis. &ldquo;BitOasis has always stood for trust, providing the best experience for users, and maintaining a robust platform. With the backing of CoinDCX for over a year now, we are accelerating that mission. CoinDCX&rsquo;s 200+ strong technology team now powers the platform&rsquo;s backend, unlocking faster performance, deeper liquidity, stronger security, and a significantly enhanced product suite. Our ambition is clear: to reach one million users across the region by 2026, setting the gold standard for compliance, innovation, and customer experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This milestone comes at a time when the MENA region is rapidly emerging as one of the fastest-growing virtual asset markets globally. Fueling this momentum are forward-looking government initiatives across the GCC. Countries like the UAE are making significant investments in blockchain and digital infrastructure&mdash;signaling strong institutional support for the long-term growth of the sector.</p>
<p>This commitment is further amplified by a young, tech-savvy population and proactive regulators working to establish a compliant and thriving crypto ecosystem. With internet penetration exceeding 99% in UAE and nearly 60% of the region&rsquo;s population under the age of 30, the GCC stands out as one of the most digitally native markets in the world, creating fertile ground for large-scale crypto adoption.</p>
<p>The numbers reflect this trajectory. According to IMARC Consulting, the <b>GCC cryptocurrency market</b> was valued at $744.3 million in 2024 and is projected to reach $3.5 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 16.75%. Additionally, approximately 38% of crypto users in the region have annual incomes exceeding USD 15,000, reflecting a strong base of financially empowered individuals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For CoinDCX, MENA is not a market to merely enter&mdash;it&rsquo;s a region to co-build. Since acquiring BitOasis in July 2024, we've seen tremendous progress. BitOasis secured a full VASP License from VARA in December 2024, and with its launch in Bahrain, we're further strengthening our regional presence. By joining forces, we're creating a platform that&rsquo;s local at heart but global in strength. Our goal is to transform the market, building the most secure, compliant, and future-ready crypto platform in the region,&rdquo; said Sumit Gupta, Co-Founder, CoinDCX.</p>
<p>Since its inception in 2016, BitOasis has processed over USD 7.4 billion in trading volume and raised over USD 40 million in funding. This expansion into Bahrain comes on the heels of BitOasis securing a full Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) License from Dubai&rsquo;s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority in December 2024.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) of ADGM (Note 1) have entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to enhance cooperation on supervision of investment managers of collective investment schemes based in either market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The signing of the MoU took place on the sidelines of the annual general meeting of the International Organization of Securities Commissions in Doha, the State of Qatar. The SFC&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer, Ms Julia Leung, and its Executive Director of Investment Products, Ms Christina Choi, joined FSRA&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer, Mr Emmanuel Givanakis, at the meeting held yesterday.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The MoU provides for a framework for consultation, cooperation and exchange of information in connection with supervision and oversight of regulated entities that engage in fund management, investment management or advisory activity on a cross-border basis.</p>
<p>Mr Emmanuel Givanakis, CEO of ADGM FSRA, said &ldquo;This MoU marks a significant step in strengthening our regulatory cooperation with the SFC. By enhancing information exchange between both authorities, we are not only improving oversight of cross-border fund management, investment, and advisory activities, but also ensuring that both jurisdictions benefit from greater transparency and more effective regulatory practices. This partnership fosters mutual trust and strengthens the stability and integrity of our respective financial markets, promoting investor protection and reinforcing the global financial ecosystem.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This MoU between the SFC and ADGM's FSRA marks an important milestone in forging closer regional market connectivity between Hong Kong and the Middle East and deepening the regulatory cooperation between the SFC and the FSRA,&rdquo; said Ms Leung. &ldquo;Specifically, the agreement would facilitate cross-market industry collaborations between ADGM and Hong Kong, especially on investment delegation and fund offerings through master-feeder structure.&rdquo; &nbsp;(Note 2).</p>

<title>ASIC Proposes To Remake Three Financial Advice-Related Legislative Instruments</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-proposes-to-remake-three-financial-advice-related-legislative-instruments-2025515/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC is seeking feedback on its proposal to remake three legislative instruments relating to financial advice into a single instrument and extend it for a further five years. The legislative instruments are scheduled to sunset on 1 October 2025.</p>
<p>The legislative instruments are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2015L01306/latest/text"><em>ASIC Corporations (Advertising by Product Issuers) Instrument 2015/539</em></a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2015L01307/latest/text"><em>ASIC Corporations (General Advice Warning) Instrument 2015/540</em></a>, and</li>
<li><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2015L01308/latest/text"><em>ASIC Corporations (Financial Services Guides) Instrument 2015/541</em></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>We have assessed that these legislative instruments are operating effectively and continue to form a necessary and useful part of the legislative framework. Aside from minor changes, the content of these instruments will remain largely unchanged.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Under the&nbsp;</span><em>Legislation Act 2003</em><span>, all legislative instruments are automatically repealed, or &lsquo;sunset&rsquo;, after 10 years, unless ASIC takes action to preserve them.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span>Providing feedback</span></h2>
<p><span>ASIC invites feedback on this proposal. Submissions should be sent by&nbsp;<strong>5pm AEST on 12 June 2025</strong>&nbsp;to </span><a href="mailto:rri.consultation@asic.gov.au"><span>rri.consultation@asic.gov.au</span></a>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span>Background</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2015L01306/latest/text"><span>ASIC Instrument 2015/539</span></a>&nbsp;<span>exempts financial product issuers from the requirement to hold an Australian financial services (AFS) licence for general advice in an advertisement for their product, provided the advertisement states that a person should consider whether or not the product is appropriate for them. It also exempts AFS licensees from the requirement to give a Financial Services Guide (FSG) and a general advice warning in relation to general advice in an advertisement about an offer or intended offer of their securities if the advertisement includes a like statement.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2015L01307/latest/text"><span>ASIC Instrument 2015/540</span></a>&nbsp;<span>exempts an AFS licensee and its authorised representative from the requirement to give a general advice warning for oral general advice if, at the time of providing the advice, the advice provider verbally warns the client that the advice is general advice and may not be appropriate for the client. ASIC Instrument 2015/540 also makes minor modifications to section 949A(4).</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2015L01308/latest/text"><span>ASIC Instrument 2015/541</span></a>&nbsp;<span>exempts an AFS licensee and their authorised representatives acting in the capacity as an expert from the requirement to give an FSG when they provide general advice in an expert's report, and this is included in a disclosure document prepared by or on behalf of another person. ASIC Instrument 2015/541 also exempts arrangers from the requirement to give an FSG when they provide a financial service consisting of arranging for the issue of a financial product under an intermediary authorisation and modifies section 941C(5A)(a) to make clear that AFS licensees and authorised representatives may make available website disclosure information for dealing in a financial product for the purpose of implementing financial product advice they provide to a client.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>

<title>Regulation S-P – Back To The Future, Keith Cassidy, Acting Director, SEC Division Of Examinations, Washington D.C., May 14, 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ol>
<li>Introduction</li>
</ol>
<p>Good afternoon, I&rsquo;m pleased to join you today to discuss, the importance of, and the financial sector&rsquo;s role in, information security and the protection of investors&rsquo; nonpublic personal information. Specifically, I am here to lay out the Division of Examinations approach to operationalizing the Commission&rsquo;s recently adopted enhancements to Regulation S-P.</p>
<p>But before I begin, I must share the official statement that:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/cassidy-remarks-finra-conference-051425#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">*</a><i>This speech is provided in my official capacity as the Commission&rsquo;s Acting Director of the Division of Examinations, but does not necessarily reflect the views of the Commission, the Commissioners, or other members of the staff.</i></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Background</li>
</ol>
<p>The Commission, and the Division of Examinations, has been focused on ensuring the security of customer information for over two decades. In 2000, acting under the authority of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Commission adopted Regulation S-P<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/cassidy-remarks-finra-conference-051425#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[i]</a>&nbsp;to help safeguard such information. The standards established by Regulation S-P require, among other things, covered institutions to (i) insure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information; (ii) protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of customer records and information; and (iii) protect against unauthorized access to or use of customer records or information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/cassidy-remarks-finra-conference-051425#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[ii]</a></p>
<p>Since its adoption in 2000, the Division of Examinations&mdash;and its predecessor, the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations (OCIE) has examined registrants for compliance with the requirements of Regulation S-P. We have also been incredibly active in our efforts to promote awareness and strengthen compliance across the broader field of information technology controls, especially through our industry outreach and engagement, including issuing over a dozen risk alerts on information security topics, stretching back over a decade.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/cassidy-remarks-finra-conference-051425#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[iii]</a></p>
<p>But the threat landscape has significantly changed in the last 25 years. In 2000, the vast majority of mobile phones were cellular phones, like the Nokia &ldquo;brick&rdquo; phone or flip phone. Today, about nine-in-ten U.S. adults own a smart phone. In 2000, you generally initiated a stock trade by either calling your broker or through the internet using a dial-up modem. Today, over 100 million people use investment apps. This includes 78% of investors aged 18-34.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/cassidy-remarks-finra-conference-051425#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[iv]</a>&nbsp;In 2000, cyberattacks were just starting to become a growing threat in the U.S. Today, Microsoft reports that its customers face 600 million cyberattacks on a daily basis.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/cassidy-remarks-finra-conference-051425#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[v]</a>&nbsp;The FBI reported in 2023 that its Internet Crime Complaint Center received over 880,000 complaints with potential losses exceeding $12.5 billion.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/cassidy-remarks-finra-conference-051425#_edn6" name="_ednref6">[vi]</a></p>
<p>The advancement in technology and the increased threat landscape faced by retail investors highlights the need for the regulatory community to adapt to the changing environment. Although the trend toward digitization has increasingly turned the problem of safeguarding customer records and information into one of cybersecurity, this is not to say that this is exclusively a problem of cybersecurity.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Amendments to Regulation S-P</li>
</ol>
<p>In response, last year the Commission completed a rulemaking process that revised and enhanced Regulation S-P. These amendments expanded the applicability of Regulation S-P to cover additional financial institutions, modernized the rules relating to safeguards and disposal of customer information, and helped ensure customers of covered institutions receive timely and consistent notifications in the event of unauthorized access to or use of their information.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/cassidy-remarks-finra-conference-051425#_edn7" name="_ednref7">[vii]</a></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Key Enhancements to Regulation S-P</li>
</ol>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t enough time today to cover all of the new enhancements and amendments, so I encourage everyone to review Regulation S-P in its entirety. You can access the amendments on the SEC&rsquo;s website, along with several helpful fact sheets and summaries you may find useful.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/cassidy-remarks-finra-conference-051425#_edn8" name="_ednref8">[viii]</a>&nbsp;I wanted to highlight three of the enhancements that firms will need to assess and adopt: an incident response program, a new customer notification requirement, and requirements relating to third-party service providers.</p>
<ol>
<li><ol>
<li>Incident Response Program</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>One of the key amendments to Reg SP concerns covered institutions&rsquo; incident response programs in their written policies and procedures under the Safeguards Rule.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/cassidy-remarks-finra-conference-051425#_edn9" name="_ednref9">[ix]</a>&nbsp;The program must be reasonably designed to detect, respond to, and recover from unauthorized access to, or use of, customer information.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/cassidy-remarks-finra-conference-051425#_edn10" name="_ednref10">[x]</a>&nbsp;It must include procedures to assess the nature and scope of any incident and require appropriate steps to contain and control incidents to prevent further unauthorized access or use.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/cassidy-remarks-finra-conference-051425#_edn11" name="_ednref11">[xi]</a></p>
<ol>
<li><ol start="2">
<li>Customer Notification Requirement</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>The enhancements also require covered institutions to notify affected individuals whose sensitive customer information was, or is reasonably likely to have been, accessed or used without authorization.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/cassidy-remarks-finra-conference-051425#_edn12" name="_ednref12">[xii]</a>&nbsp;The rules also require, with limited exception, that firms notify customers as soon as practicable (but no later than 30 days), after the covered institution becomes aware that unauthorized access to, or use of, customer information has occurred (or is reasonably likely to have occurred).<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/cassidy-remarks-finra-conference-051425#_edn13" name="_ednref13">[xiii]</a></p>
<ol>
<li><ol start="3">
<li>Third-Party Service Providers</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>The amendments to the Safeguards Rule also include new provisions that address the use of third-party service providers by covered institutions. Covered institutions will now be required to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to require oversight, including through due diligence and monitoring of service providers, to ensure that affected individuals receive any required notices. In essence, this means that while covered institutions may outsource their operations, they may not outsource their ultimate obligation to comply with Regulation S-P.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Examinations Engagement and Outreach</li>
</ol>
<p>So, what does all of this mean for the work of the Division of Examinations? As I mentioned, the SEC has focused on compliance risks relating to securing information technology for many years, with particular attention to market systems, customer data protection, disclosure of material cybersecurity risks and incidents, and compliance with legal and regulatory obligations under the federal securities laws.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/cassidy-remarks-finra-conference-051425#_edn14" name="_ednref14">[xiv]</a>&nbsp;We recognize that any regulatory adjustment can create a risk of implementation challenges and costs associated with compliance. Under the Division&rsquo;s Pillar of promoting compliance, we want to take this opportunity to clearly articulate our approach to achieving our shared goal of improved information security through the implementation of the updated Regulation S-P.</p>
<p>In the coming months, staff in the Division of Examinations, in coordination with staff from the Divisions of Investment Management and Trading and Markets, will host a series of three tailored outreach events to help promote readiness and assist firms in their preparedness to implement these new amendments to Regulation S-P. Among other topics, we will cover basics about what to expect when interacting with an exam team during an examination where Regulation S-P is in scope, as well as having a broader discussion about our approach. Led by our tremendously talented staff in the Technology Controls Program, including technologists, industry experts, former CISOs, intelligence analysts, specialized contractors, attorneys, and examiners, these outreach events are designed to assist registrants in preparing for their respective compliance dates. We will publish additional details about these events in the near future, but I look forward to having Division staff share their expertise and engage in rich discussions with our registrants.</p>
<p>As the two compliance dates contained in the amendments approach, registrants should not be surprised if examiners inquire about their preparations to ensure compliance following the compliance date. These inquiries are not directed at citing registrants for potential non-compliance with requirements that are not yet in effect but are intended to inform the Commission of where registrants are in the process of implementation. Similar to our approach before the transition to the T+1 settlement cycle, the Division will conduct examinations to assist the Commission in understanding the level of readiness across the sector before the compliance dates. To the extent the staff identifies trends or risks relevant across the sector or within a specific registrant population, the Division could communicate these anonymized observations through a Risk Alert or some other publication to assist registrants in coming into compliance by their respective compliance dates.</p>
<p>Obviously, once the compliance date passes, the updated Regulation S-P could potentially be included as part of an examination for any registrant subject to its provisions, so we all have an interest in giving registrants every opportunity to be prepared. I understand there have been requests made to the Commission to extend the relevant compliance dates for the rule amendments.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/cassidy-remarks-finra-conference-051425#_edn15" name="_ednref15">[xv]</a>&nbsp;Should the Commission choose to extend the compliance date, the Division will adjust our timeline, as necessary, but our approach to promoting compliance with the new requirements will remain the same. With the Commission&rsquo;s clear statement of the importance of this issue, registrants shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if Regulation S-P is the subject of a thematic initiative in the coming fiscal years. Certainly, throughout this process we will be working closely with our colleagues here at FINRA and with our registrants to encourage compliance.<i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>***</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Conclusion</li>
</ol>
<p>I want to thank our host FINRA and everyone here this afternoon for your time, attention, and interest in strengthening compliance and investor protection. I appreciate your commitment to safeguarding and protecting customers&rsquo; nonpublic personal information, as strong controls and safeguards benefit not only customers and investors, but also our financial institutions and markets generally.</p>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/nasdaq-applauds-signing-of-senate-bill-29-strengthening-texas-standing-as-a-na-2025515/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p align="left">Today, Nasdaq issued a statement in support of&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Texas</span>&nbsp;Senate Bill 29 after&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Governor Abbott</span>&nbsp;signed the bill into law. This legislation, which codifies the Business Judgment Rule and promotes predictability in corporate governance litigation, enhances Texas&rsquo; competitiveness as a jurisdiction for incorporation and business growth. Nasdaq's Executive Vice Chairman&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Ed Knight</span>&nbsp;joined&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Governor Abbott</span>, leadership from the&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Texas</span>&nbsp;legislature, and other&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Texas</span>&nbsp;business community leaders for the signing ceremony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senate Bill 29 is a milestone for corporate governance in&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Texas</span>. By embracing smart, innovation-focused regulation like SB 29,&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Texas</span>&nbsp;is showing the world what it means to lead on economic growth and modern, clear governance principles,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Ed Knight</span>, Executive Vice Chairman of Nasdaq. &ldquo;We commend Senator&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Bryan Hughes</span>, Representative&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Morgan Meyer</span>, and Governor&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Greg Abbott</span>&nbsp;for advancing legislation that strengthens Texas&rsquo; position as a global center for capital formation.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="xn-location">Texas</span>&nbsp;has become a national model for innovation-driven policy that balances economic growth with investor confidence. The passage of SB 29 aligns with Nasdaq&rsquo;s mission to promote fair, efficient, and accessible capital markets, and reinforces&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Texas</span>&nbsp;as a destination for corporate formation and public company investment. Nasdaq has a longstanding history of advocating for clients by minimizing the complexity associated with navigating the public markets. Its efforts for corporate issuers encompass addressing issues such as the SEC&rsquo;s proposed climate disclosure rules, cyber disclosure rules, proxy advisory reform, AI regulation, PCAOB reforms, and emerging growth company timelines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Nasdaq, we are honored to have been part of the&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Texas</span>&nbsp;community for nearly two decades&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Rachel Racz</span>, Senior Vice President, Head of Listings for&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Texas</span>,&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Southern U.S.</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Latin America</span>&nbsp;at Nasdaq. &ldquo;We remain committed to advocating for our clients on both a federal and local level and supporting the bold&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Texas</span>&nbsp;leadership that continues to power our state's dynamic economy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nasdaq&rsquo;s presence in&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Texas</span>&nbsp;continues to expand. The company recently announced the opening of a new regional headquarters in&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Dallas</span>, serving as a Southeast hub and convening space for its&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Texas</span>-based clients. Nasdaq currently is home to over 200 listed companies headquartered in the state and generates over&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$750 million</span>&nbsp;in revenues in&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Texas</span>&nbsp;and the Southeast region of the&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">U.S.</span>, partnering with over 2,000 clients, approximately 800 of which are based in&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Texas</span>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission has determined that certain masked data fields on the publicly available reports on Form N-PORT submitted between Feb. 3, 2025, and May 8, 2025, were inadvertently made public on the SEC&rsquo;s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (EDGAR) system. The unmasking occurred as a result of a software update effective Feb. 3, 2025. The masking error has been corrected and did not affect Form N-PORT filings made after May 8, 2025.</p>
<p>SEC staff has removed the affected data from the public EDGAR system as displayed on SEC.gov and all affected filers have been informed.</p>
<p>The Chairman has directed a comprehensive review of the EDGAR system.&nbsp;</p>

<title>CFTC Warns Public Of Imposter Scam Targeting Fraud Victims</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-warns-public-of-imposter-scam-targeting-fraud-victims-2025514/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is warning the public about a growing imposter scam involving individuals falsely claiming to represent the agency.</span></p>
<p><span>Scammers are contacting members of the public and claiming to represent the CFTC Office of Inspector General. These imposters promise to help financial fraud victims recover lost funds from foreign bank accounts, a ruse to further defraud those already harmed by previous scams.</span></p>
<p><span>The CFTC Office of Inspector General will never contact individuals with offers to recover money lost to investment scams.</span></p>
<p><span>If someone contacts you claiming to be from the CFTC, write down as much information as possible, but do not share or confirm any personal details, including account numbers, Social Security numbers, or digital wallet private keys. End the call immediately.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Email scams may also use fraudulent addresses or domains. All legitimate CFTC emails will come from @cftc.gov &mdash; no exceptions. Government employees will never contact you from personal or web-based email services such as Yahoo! or Gmail.</span></p>
<p><span>If you believe you have been the victim of fraud, you may&nbsp;</span><a href="https://forms.cftc.gov/Forms/TipsAndComplaints.aspx">file a complaint</a><span>&nbsp;with the CFTC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement or report the incident to the Office of Inspector General through the online portal at&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/OIG">www.cftc.gov/OIG</a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>For questions about emails, letters, or calls that appear to come from the CFTC, contact&nbsp;</span><a href="mailto:education@cftc.gov">education@cftc.gov</a><span>&nbsp;to verify the communication. To learn more about imposter scams, visit&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect">https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect</a><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) and the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong (SFC) announced that on May 13, 2025, they signed a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/about-us/domestic-and-international-engagement/international-mous/memorandum-understanding-mou-between-securities-and-futures-commission-hong-kong">Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)</a>&nbsp;to further cross-border supervision and market access. This MoU marks an important milestone in the Ontario and Hong Kong relationship to advance fair, efficient, and competitive capital markets.</p>
<p>Effective from May 13, 2025, the MoU will strengthen regulatory collaboration and facilitate the exchange of information between the SFC and the OSC. The SFC will now include Ontario on its list of&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/Regulatory-functions/Products/List-of-publicly-offered-investment-products/List-of-recognised-jurisdiction-schemes-and-inspection-regimes" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)">Acceptable Inspection Regimes</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will facilitate OSC-registered portfolio managers in providing investment management services in respect of SFC authorised funds, giving them greater access to Hong Kong&rsquo;s markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The signing of this MoU between the Hong Kong SFC and the OSC marks a significant moment for both markets,&rdquo; said Grant Vingoe, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the OSC. &ldquo;Through closer collaboration, we are opening up new markets to our regulated firms, while also facilitating cross-border information sharing to protect investors.&nbsp; The OSC and the SFC are close allies in our work to support our firms, protect our investors, and help our capital markets grow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This MoU represents a pivotal step towards enhancing the regulatory collaboration between the SFC and the OSC.

<p>The mandate of the OSC is to provide protection to investors from unfair, improper or fraudulent practices, to foster fair, efficient and competitive capital markets and confidence in the capital markets, to foster capital formation, and to contribute to the stability of the financial system and the reduction of systemic risk. Investors are urged to check the registration of any persons or company offering an investment opportunity and to review the OSC investor materials available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/">https://www.osc.ca</a>.</p>

<title>Canadian Securities Administrators Expands Capital-Raising Options For Listed Issuers</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/canadian-securities-administrators-expands-capital-raising-options-for-listed-is-2025514/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/canadian-securities-administrators-expands-capital-raising-options-for-listed-is-2025514/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) is increasing the limit on capital-raising under the listed issuer financing exemption to support the competitiveness of Canada&rsquo;s capital markets. This move is the latest in a series of recent CSA actions, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asc.ca/en/News-and-Publications/News-Releases/2025/04/April-17-CSA-announce-actions-to-support-competitiveness-of-Canadian-markets">other blanket orders</a>, to help companies grow.</p>
<p>The CSA is publishing substantively harmonized relief from certain conditions of the listed issuer financing exemption (the exemption) in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asc.ca/securities-law-and-policy/regulatory-instruments/45-106">National Instrument 45-106&nbsp;<em>Prospectus Exemptions</em></a>&nbsp;to allow listed issuers to raise more capital in a cost-effective way.</p>
<p>Listed issuers can now raise the greater of $25 million and 20 per cent of the aggregate market value of their listed securities to a maximum of $50 million in a 12-month period, subject to certain conditions, including that the distribution will not result in an increase of more than 50 per cent of the issuer&rsquo;s outstanding listed equity securities during the period. This is a significant increase from the previous $10 million limit under the exemption.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This change reflects our ongoing work to support the Canadian capital markets to make it more efficient and cost-effective for companies to raise capital and grow in Canada,&rdquo; said Stan Magidson, CSA Chair and Chair and CEO of the Alberta Securities Commission. &ldquo;We are committed to a Canadian regulatory environment that is responsive to the changing needs of market participants, while upholding strong investor protections.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The exemption was introduced in November 2022 to offer a more efficient capital-raising option for reporting issuers that are listed on recognized exchanges and have filed all timely and periodic disclosure documents required under Canadian securities legislation. Since its adoption, the exemption has been used by more than 270 issuers, collectively raising over $1 billion. Market participants have responded positively to the exemption but noted that the capital-raising limits have been restricting use of the exemption.</p>
<p>The relief is being implemented through coordinated blanket orders which come into effect on May 15, 2025. In certain jurisdictions, the blanket order includes an expiry date based on the term limits for blanket orders in the jurisdiction. Market participants should consult&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asc.ca/-/media/ASC-Documents-part-1/Regulatory-Instruments/2025/05/6225083-Coordinated-Blanket-Order-45-935-Exemptions-from-Certain-Conditions-of-Listed-Issuer.pdf">Coordinated Blanket Order 45-935&nbsp;<em>Exemptions from Certain Conditions of the Listed Issuer Financing Exemption</em></a>&nbsp;for details.</p>
<p>The CSA, the council of the securities regulators of Canada&rsquo;s provinces and territories, coordinates and harmonizes regulation for the Canadian capital markets.</p>

<title>Finansinspektionen: Swedbank Receives An Administrative Fine</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Swedbank AB (Swedbank or the bank) is a Swedish joint stock banking company authorised to conduct banking business in accordance with the Banking and Financing Business Act (2004:297). On 3 December 2021, Swedbank notified Finansinspektionen that the bank conducts security-sensitive activities.</span></p>
<div class="editor-content">
<p>Finansinspektionen has investigated Swedbank's compliance with the protective security regulatory framework. The investigation covered the bank's protective security analyses during the period 12 July 2022&ndash;31 January 2024. The bank adopted two protective security analyses during this period. The investigation shows that Swedbank's protective security analyses have been deficient and that the bank has been in violation of several provisions of the protective security regulatory framework. According to Finansinspektionen, there are grounds on which to intervene against Swedbank AB as a result of these violations.</p>
<p>When selecting the intervention, Finansinspektionen considered several circumstances. As an aggravating circumstance, the bank circumvented fundamental components of the protective security regulatory framework and as a result created vulnerabilities in Sweden's security. Along the same lines, the violations have been occurring for a long period of time. As a mitigating circumstance, there is no evidence of any actual damage to Sweden's security, the violations are the result of negligence and thus not of intent, and Finansinspektionen has not previously intervened against Swedbank for violations of the protective security regulatory framework.</p>
<p>Finansinspektionen makes the overall assessment that the violations should result in an administrative fine of SEK 12,500,000.</p>

We achieved record revenue and income of &euro;458.5 million, driven by initial successes of the strategic initiatives, growth of non-volume-related revenue and exceptional volatility across trading and clearing activities, especially in cash equity, fixed income, FX, power and commodities. Our diversified business model has allowed us to invest in growth and reach an adjusted EBITDA of &euro;294.1 million, marking a significant +17.0% increase compared to Q1 2024. In Q1 2025, we reached record adjusted EPS (basic) of &euro;1.80 per share. Our reported EPS (basic) grew by an impressive +20.0% compared to Q1 2024, to &euro;1.62 per share.</em></p>
<p><em>We have launched significant initiatives of our &lsquo;Innovate for Growth 2027&rsquo; strategic plan to reinforce Euronext as a leader in the European financial markets. The upcoming consolidation of settlement for Amsterdam, Brussels and Paris equity trades in Euronext Securities represents a significant optimisation of the European post-trade landscape. With this strategic move, we foster the integration and competitiveness of European capital markets at an unprecedented speed.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>The launch late April 2025 of a European Common Prospectus</em><a href="https://www.euronext.com/en/about/media/euronext-press-releases/euronext-publishes-q1-2025-results#_ftn6"><em><span>[6]</span></em></a><em>&nbsp;in English will pursue this ambition. This new initiative facilitates access to European capital markets and addresses the need for a competitive, integrated Savings and Investment Union. In addition, we are proud to launch a comprehensive set of measures to support the financing needs of companies that contribute to Europe&rsquo;s strategic autonomy</em><a href="https://www.euronext.com/en/about/media/euronext-press-releases/euronext-publishes-q1-2025-results#_ftn7"><em><span>[7]</span></em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p><em>The acquisition in May 2025 of Admincontrol</em><a href="https://www.euronext.com/en/about/media/euronext-press-releases/euronext-publishes-q1-2025-results#_ftn8"><em><span>[8]</span></em></a><em>, leader in the governance SaaS space, accelerates the development of Euronext Corporate Solutions in the Nordics, and reinforces Euronext&rsquo;s subscription-based revenue.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>With this strong first quarter of 2025, we demonstrate our capacity to innovate ahead of the curve, leading the way to a stronger, more innovative and more competitive European capital market.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Revenue from Custody and Settlement this quarter was at &euro;75.8 million, +11.6% compared to Q1 2024. This strong performance was driven by growing Assets under Custody, dynamic settlement instructions and continued double-digit growth in services, supported by the acquisition of Acupay. At the end of the quarter, Assets under Custody amounted to &euro;7.1 trillion, up +3.8% compared to end of Q1 2024. Over 39.3 million instructions were settled via Euronext Securities during the first quarter of 2025, up +9.3% compared to the first quarter of 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other Post Trade revenue, which includes membership fees and other non-volume-related clearing fees, was &euro;7.6&nbsp;million in Q1 2025. The -25.3% decrease compared to Q1 2024 stems from the internalisation of the net treasury income related to Euronext derivatives flows in September 2024, which are now integrated in the net treasury income line.</p>

<p>Primary Markets revenue was &euro;46.3 million in Q1 2025, an increase of +1.8% compared to Q1 2024. The first quarter recorded slower equity listing performance explained by a volatile environment. Euronext sustained its leading position for equity listing with 8 new listings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Advanced Data Solutions revenue was &euro;65.1 million in Q1 2025, up +8.1% compared to Q1 2024. This dynamic performance reflects the contribution of GRSS, strong appetite from retail and growing monetisation of diversified datasets.</p>
<p>Corporate and Investor Solutions and Technology Services revenue grew by +9.8% in Q1 2025 to &euro;45.9 million. This strong performance reflects the continued commercial expansion of the governance SaaS offering, the increased use of colocation and microwave connectivity, and double-digit growth of investor solutions, supported by the acquisition of Substantive Research.</p>
<p>Following the completion of the acquisition of Admincontrol on 13 May 2025, Admincontrol&rsquo;s revenue will be integrated with Corporate and Investor Solutions and Technology Services revenue from Q2 2025.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Net treasury income&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Net treasury income was at &euro;18.6 million (+58.8%). This reflect the benefit from the Euronext Clearing expansion and the internalisation of treasury income from LCH SA following the completion of the derivatives clearing migration, as well as higher cash collateral posted to the CCP due to the elevated market volatility.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cash equity trading and clearing revenue was &euro;94.0 million in Q1 2025, up +22.5% driven by exceptional market volatility. Euronext recorded average daily cash trading volumes of &euro;13.8 billion, up +31.8% compared to Q1 2024. Revenue capture on cash trading averaged 0.50 bps for the first quarter of 2025, impacted by higher volumes, stronger intraday volatility and larger average order size. Euronext market share on cash equity trading averaged 64.1% in Q1 2025.</p>
<p>Financial derivatives trading and clearing revenue was &euro;14.4 million in Q1 2025, -4.8% compared to Q1 2024. This decrease is mostly linked to the decrease of the average clearing fees, as following the clearing migration certain clearing fees are now reported in&nbsp; the line Other Post Trade revenues, and as such not fully comparable with Q1 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Statement By CFTC Commissioner Summer K. Mersinger On Her Departure From The Commodity Futures Trading Commission</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-by-cftc-commissioner-summer-k-mersinger-on-her-departure-from-the-com-2025514/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>After careful consideration, long discussions with my family, and lots of prayers, I have decided to step down from my position as Commissioner at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (&ldquo;CFTC&rdquo;) at the end of the month, to pursue new opportunities.&nbsp; This decision is not easy, and it breaks my heart to leave the agency that I have grown to love so much over the last five years.&nbsp; It has been a privilege to work and serve at the CFTC in both the first and the current Trump Administrations, doing my part to assist in pursuing the President&rsquo;s important policies.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While I have spoken often of my agricultural roots, I have not spent much time talking about my upbringing.&nbsp; My parents did not go to college. &nbsp;They went straight from high school to the workforce.&nbsp;My dad worked from the early morning hours until late at night, and my mom sometimes worked two jobs to make ends meet.&nbsp; We lived in a small trailer house, our family outings were church on Sunday, and the only time we ate out was when our church hosted a potluck lunch after Mass.&nbsp; Despite the lack of material comforts, we never lacked love, support, or encouragement.&nbsp; My parents sacrificed so that my siblings and I could live out our dreams.</span></p>
<p><span>My background really is not unique or noteworthy, and I suspect many Americans share a similar life story.&nbsp; I share this to explain just how grateful I am for the opportunities I have had throughout my life.&nbsp; When I started answering phones for Congressman John Thune in the summer of 1999, I could not possibly imagine the career opportunities before me, and I am still in awe today.&nbsp; I owe a huge debt of gratitude to my parents who worked to support my dreams, and to Majority Leader John Thune who took a chance on a small-town kid from Onida, South Dakota.</span></p>
<p><span>Over the last three years as a commissioner, I have been incredibly fortunate to be surrounded by a stellar team who made me look good every day.&nbsp; Thank you to Terry Arbit, Libby Mastrogiacomo, Josh Beale and Tim Achinger for sharing your brilliant legal minds and for all the hours and effort you selflessly contributed over the years.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks to Lauren Fulks, an absolute hidden gem in the agency, who took my vision for the Energy and Environmental Markets Advisory Committee (&ldquo;EEMAC&rdquo;) and made it a reality, and Lillian Cardona and JonMarc Buffa for diligently working with an extraordinary team of professionals to create masterful reports from our EEMAC subcommittees.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A special thanks to the members of the EEMAC for their intellectual curiosity and willingness to go &ldquo;off-road&rdquo; in the pursuit of understanding America&rsquo;s energy sector.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I also want to thank LaTasha Pate and Janet Schmautz for keeping the office, and the staff, running smoothly.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And finally, I need to say thank you to my chief of staff, Chris Lucas.&nbsp; The title of chief of staff does not come close to covering all of Chris&rsquo;s duties over the last few years.&nbsp; Chris was the optimism to my realism, the morning person to my hatred of anything happening before 10 am, my cheerleader, and the voice of reason when I needed someone to tell me the hard truth.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you to all my staff for working so hard on my behalf and on behalf of the CFTC and, most importantly, thank you for your willingness to tell me &ldquo;No&rdquo; when I needed to hear it.</span></p>
<p><span>I will miss the work and my fellow commissioners, who have become close friends.&nbsp; But most of all, I will miss the amazing team at the CFTC.&nbsp; The talented staff at this agency are true public servants committed to fulfilling the agency&rsquo;s mission.&nbsp; They are the heart of the agency and of great value to the United States government.&nbsp;It has been an honor to both work with you and learn from you.&nbsp; Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span>I have always loved the following quote from A.A. Milne, and I can think of no better words to express my sentiment as I prepare to step into the next adventure in my career:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><span>&ldquo;How lucky am I to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></em></p>

<title>Federal Reserve Bank Of New York And Bank For International Settlements (BIS): Joint Study Explores Feasibility Of Central Bank Operations Using Tokenisation And Smart Contracts</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div id="cmsContent">
<p>The Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) today published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/othp95.htm"><span class="firstword">joint</span>&nbsp;research study</a>&nbsp;that explored if and how central banks could continue to implement monetary policy operations in hypothetical tokenised wholesale financial markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Project Pine, from the New York Innovation Center at the New York Fed and the Swiss Centre of the BIS Innovation Hub found that central banks could customise and deploy policy implementation tools using programmable smart contracts in a potential future state where commercial banks and other private sector financial institutions have widely adopted tokenisation for wholesale payments and securities settlement.</p>
<p>The project generated the prototype of a generic monetary policy implementation tokenised toolkit for potential further research and development by central banks across jurisdictions and currencies. The prototype was designed to be technically modifiable for different central banks' monetary policy frameworks and calibrated to conduct standard or emergency market operations.</p>
<p>The toolkit prototype was created in consultation with central banks' financial markets advisors from multiple jurisdictions, who helped outline the project scope and specific design requirements. It is not particular to any currency or jurisdiction. It can fulfil a common set of central bank implementation requirements, including paying interest on reserves, open market operations, and collateral management.</p>
<p>The toolkit was tested against ten hypothetical scenarios simulating normal market dynamics and stress events. Each scenario was designed using historical data inputs on past market events, such as interest rate tightening and easing cycles, quantitative easing and tightening cycles, and periods of strained market liquidity or broader market disruptions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The prototype successfully responded and instantaneously carried out the intended operation under the varying market conditions, consistent with the central bank's desired liquidity environment. Project Pine's findings highlighted areas for further research and analysis related to interoperability and data standardisation. Project Pine aims to contribute to a broad and transparent public dialogue regarding potential applications of new technologies in the financial sector.</p>
<p>BIS Innovation Hub projects are experimental in nature and aim to explore and deliver public goods to the global central banking community. Project Pine was limited to research and experimentation and should not be interpreted to reflect any policies, directives, or views of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.</p>

<title>Economic Outlook, Federal Reserve Vice Chair Philip N. Jefferson, At The Annual Conference Of Second District Directors And Advisors, Federal Reserve Bank Of New York, New York, New York</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, President Williams. It is wonderful to be back in New York, and it is an honor to speak to you, the directors and advisers to the Second District. You all play an extremely important role for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and, indeed, for the entirety of the Federal Reserve System. You, and your peers around the country, inform President Williams and the other Bank presidents about how you see the economy unfolding in your communities and in your industries. The presidents, in turn, share that vital information with all the members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) so that we can make the best monetary policy decisions to benefit all Americans. Thank you for the important contributions.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250514a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>In the spirit of sharing information, I thought it would be helpful to share with you my economic outlook. First, I will discuss how I see recent economic activity. Next, I will talk about developments pertaining to both sides of our dual mandate, maximum employment and price stability. Finally, I will offer my current view of monetary policy.</p>
<p><span>Economic Activity</span><br />While the economy entered a period of heightened uncertainty this year, the underlying data through the first quarter showed resilience. As you can see in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-20250514-figure1.png" id="fig2">figure 1</a>, gross domestic product (GDP) contracted slightly by 0.3 percent in the first quarter, on an annualized basis, after expanding at a 2.4 percent rate in the fourth quarter of 2024. That change, however, overstates the deceleration in activity. A surge in imports apparently ahead of anticipated changes to trade policy did not seem to be reflected fully in inventory or spending data. That misalignment complicated the interpretation of measured GDP data. Private domestic final purchases, which exclude government spending, inventory investment, and net exports, usually gives a better read than GDP on the underlying momentum in the economy. That came in at a 3 percent rate in the first quarter, consistent with readings from last year.</p>
<p>Looking at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-20250514-figure2.png" id="fig3">figure 2</a>, you can see that inflation-adjusted consumer spending was strong much of last year. Spending eased at the start of 2025, which could in part reflect poor weather and seasonal adjustment challenges. Spending bounced back in March, perhaps reflecting some purchases ahead of expected trade policy changes.</p>
<p>Of course, those observations of first-quarter economic activity are now in the rearview mirror. Tariff announcements and heightened uncertainty about government policies in general are the dominant economic developments of more recent weeks and have caused me to look carefully at my forecasts. It is not my role to express views on policies coming from the Administration or Congress, but I do study the implications of those policies on economic activity and inflation.</p>
<p>Various surveys show a decline in business sentiment related to trade policy. The Beige Book reported that some retailers are expecting to raise prices in response to tariffs, which could then limit spending, especially by the most price-sensitive consumers. Manufacturers saw risks of supply chain disruptions related to trade policy changes. Moreover, uncertainty is quite high. As a result, I have adjusted down my expectations for economic growth this year, but I see the U.S. economy as continuing to expand. Of course, trade policy is still evolving, so its ultimate economic implications are not known, and I will be following developments carefully.</p>
<p><span>Labor Market</span><br />Turning to the labor market, conditions continue to be solid. As you can see in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-20250514-figure3.png" id="fig4">figure 3</a>, the unemployment rate was 4.2 percent in April. It has fluctuated within a narrow and historically low range between 4 and 4.2 percent since the middle of last year. U.S. employers added 177,000 jobs to payrolls last month, effectively matching the average growth over the past six months. Payrolls have been rising at a pace consistent with a stable unemployment rate and a flat labor force participation rate. Hiring has slowed from the rapid pace recorded earlier in the current expansion, but layoffs remain historically low. That can be seen in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-20250514-figure4.png" id="fig5">figure 4</a>. New applications for unemployment benefits this year remain in the same low range recorded over the previous three years.</p>
<p>Looking at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-20250514-figure5.png" id="fig6">figure 5</a>, you can see the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers was at 1 in March, well down from a peak of 2 in 2022. The measure is consistent with a labor market that looks to be in balance and is not a source of inflationary pressure. Looking ahead, I am watching for signs that the labor market could cool as tariff increases begin to weigh on economic activity.</p>
<p><span>Inflation</span><br />Regarding inflation, recent data are consistent with further progress toward our 2 percent inflation target; however, that goal has not yet been reached. Looking at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-20250514-figure6.png" id="fig7">figure 6</a>, the blue line shows inflation as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) has trended down from a peak above 7 percent in mid-2022. In March, PCE prices advanced 2.3 percent from a year earlier. Core PCE inflation, which excludes volatile consumer energy and food prices and is usually a better indicator of future inflation, the dashed red line, was at 2.6 percent.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-20250514-figure7.png" id="fig8">Figure 7</a>&nbsp;shows the components of core PCE inflation, which can provide insight into sources of inflationary pressures. Housing services inflation, the purple dotted line, has fallen notably since early 2023 and could continue to provide support to the disinflation process. Core services inflation, the dashed red line, has largely moved sideways since the early part of last year, contributing little to further disinflation, and I largely expect that pattern to continue as well. In contrast, goods inflation, outside of food and energy, the blue line, has picked up a bit this year.</p>
<p>There is much uncertainty, however, around the future path of inflation. If the increases in tariffs announced so far are sustained, they are likely to interrupt progress on disinflation and generate at least a temporary rise in inflation. Whether tariffs create persistent upward pressure on inflation will depend on how trade policy is implemented, the pass-through to consumer prices, the reaction of supply chains, and the performance of the economy. Short-term inflation expectations have increased in both survey- and market-based measures, but I think it is notable that most measures of longer-run inflation expectations have been largely stable, suggesting that the American people understand the Federal Reserve's commitment to return inflation to our 2 percent target.</p>
<p>While trade policy has received the bulk of recent attention, I remain focused on the aggregate effect from the totality of different government policy changes, including trade, immigration, regulatory, and fiscal policies, as well as their net effects on the economy. This net effect will likely remain uncertain for some time.</p>
<p><span>Monetary Policy</span><br />Last week I supported the FOMC's decision to hold the federal funds rate at current levels as the best policy to achieve our dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. As you can see in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-20250514-figure8.png" id="fig9">figure 8</a>, the FOMC acted last year to reduce the policy rate by a full percentage point. Over the past several meetings, the rate has been held at what I view as a moderately restrictive level. I view the current stance of policy as well positioned to respond to developments that may arise.</p>
<p>With respect to the path of the policy rate going forward, I will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. Various measures of consumer and business sentiment have declined sharply this year, and I will be watching very carefully for signs of weakening economic activity in hard data. At the same time, higher tariffs could lead to higher inflation this year. It is uncertain whether inflationary pressures would be temporary or persistent. Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. With the increased risks to both sides of our mandate, I believe that the current stance of monetary policy is well positioned to respond in a timely way to potential economic developments.</p>
<p><span>Conclusion</span><br />The uncertain economic outlook presents a challenge for monetary policymakers. It is critical that we have the best available information from a broad cross section of sources, which is again why your efforts to keep President Williams and other monetary policymakers informed are so critical. Effective policymaking starts with hearing from people in every corner of this country&mdash;including New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Directors and advisers like you make that possible. Thank you again.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Jim O&rsquo;Neil has been appointed as a new Second Permanent Secretary to the Treasury.</span></p>
<p>Jim brings a wealth of experience from investment banking and corporate finance to the Treasury, after a long career at Bank of America. He also has experience in the public sector, spending three years at UK Financial Investments. As Chief Executive of UKFI, he managed the government&rsquo;s holdings in Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds Banking Group, and UK Asset Resolution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>His appointment is part of the government&rsquo;s plan to deliver its number one mission to kickstart economic growth as part of the Plan for Change, and follows the Chancellor&rsquo;s commitment to lead the most pro-growth Treasury in the country&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s experience will help the government to secure private investment, boost the economy, and ultimately put more pounds in people&rsquo;s pockets. His deep knowledge of the private sector will help the government to rip out the barriers to growth, provide support for the key industries at home, and work to secure open and fair trade abroad.</p>
<h4 id="chancellor-of-the-exchequer-rachel-reeves-said">Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves said:</h4>
<blockquote>
<p class="last-child">I&rsquo;m very pleased to welcome Jim as our new Second Permanent Secretary, his extensive knowledge of the private sector will be vital in helping us deliver our number one mission to grow the economy. It&rsquo;s fantastic to have him join the Treasury&rsquo;s top team.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="jim-oneil-said">Jim O&rsquo;Neil said:</h4>
<blockquote>
<p class="last-child">I am delighted to have been appointed Second Permanent Secretary to the Treasury at this important time for our country and our economy. We are living through a time of great change globally, making the need for an economy of stability, resilience, and growth all the more important. I look forward to working with the Chancellor, her ministers, and officials across the department to deliver on these missions so the Treasury can bring positive change to the lives of people right across the country.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jim is expected to start in his new position in July and will work alongside the two other Second Permanent Secretaries in HM Treasury, Beth Russell who is based at the Darlington Economic Campus and Sam Beckett who is also Chief Economic Adviser. As well as overseeing tax and spending, Beth will continue to be responsible for devolution and regional growth including engagement with regional and local government and others in the north.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jim was appointed through a fair and open competition and has completed all of the necessary declarations of interest.</p>

<title>Decision By The Nasdaq Stockholm Disciplinary Committee Regarding Rolling Optics Holding AB</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/decision-by-the-nasdaq-stockholm-disciplinary-committee-regarding-rolling-optics-2025514/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/decision-by-the-nasdaq-stockholm-disciplinary-committee-regarding-rolling-optics-2025514/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Disciplinary Committee of Nasdaq Stockholm (the &ldquo;Exchange&rdquo;) has found that Rolling Optics Holding AB (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) has breached the rules of Nasdaq First North Growth Market (the &ldquo;Rulebook&rdquo;) and therefore ordered the Company to pay a fine of three annual fees, corresponding to an amount of SEK 375,000.</p>
<p>On May 20, 2024, the Company announced the outcome of an arbitration between the Company and a former business partner. The dispute concerned two agreements between the parties that the Company terminated in April 2023. The arbitration award was issued on May 16, 2024. The Company assessed that it needed time to fully understand the significance of the award for the Company and what information should be disclosed to the market. The Company decided to delay its disclosure of the inside information and called a board meeting to address the issue, which was held on the evening of May 19, 2024.</p>
<p>The Disciplinary Committee understands the Company's assessment, but argues that the analysis of the arbitration award could not have required a formal board meeting to be called and held. Even less so, there were no grounds to delay the disclosure of information until the morning after the board meeting. Against this background, the Disciplinary Committee's assessment is that the Company's decision to postpone the announcement of the relevant insider information was not in accordance with Article 17.4 of the EU Market Abuse Regulation, and the information was therefore not disclosed in a timely manner. The Company has thus violated point 4.1.1 of the Rulebook. The Disciplinary Committee considers the violation to be serious and therefore imposes a fine equivalent to three annual fees.</p>
<p>The Disciplinary Committee&rsquo;s decision is available at:</p>

<title>BlockFills And Definitive Finance Partner, Enhancing BlockFills Automated Trade Execution Capabilities For DeFi, On-Chain Transactions - Use Of Definitive’s Trade Execution Platform Brings BlockFills Additional Order Flow From Asset Managers, Hedge Funds, VCs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.blockfills.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">BlockFills</a>,&nbsp;a premier destination for digital asset trading and market technology leveraged by institutions and professional traders, and&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.definitive.fi/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Definitive Finance</a>, a leading institutional-grade on-chain trading platform, announced that BlockFills has deployed Definitive&rsquo;s advanced on-chain execution platform to enhance its automated trade execution capabilities on behalf of institutional and venture capital (VC) clients and expand the variety of tokens BlockFills can trade on behalf of its clients. The partnership brings new benefits to clients of both firms.</p>
<p>Patrick Zielbauer, Managing Director of Sales at BlockFills, said: &ldquo;Definitive&rsquo;s platform gives us an incredibly powerful tool to offer clients &ndash; including asset managers, hedge funds and VC firms &ndash; the ability to smoothly and efficiently enter or exit an altcoin position or token while protecting their anonymity and minimizing market impact. As a result of the partnership, we&rsquo;re finding that even in the weeks since we deployed the platform, clients have brought more order flow to us, enabling them to take or exit from a significant position in even the most illiquid tokens, memecoins or other assets generally considered difficult to trade in nontrivial sizes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jai Prasad, Co-Founder of Definitive, said: &ldquo;Our secure, robust infrastructure was developed by our highly experienced team members who have a deep understanding of not only the digital asset market and DeFi world, but traditional finance, technology and the needs of the institutional investors BlockFills serves. Similar to what BlockFills does for clients in centralized finance (CeFi), our platform uses sophisticated trade algorithms that aggregate liquidity across liquidity pools on&nbsp;multiple&nbsp;chains and optimize trades to leverage the deepest liquidity, minimize price impact and achieve superior execution for on-chain transactions. While our platform is enhancing BlockFills&rsquo; capabilities offered to its clients, our clients and prospects that require access to deep OTC liquidity in the spot, derivatives* and lending markets can turn to BlockFills to augment and enhance their on-chain trading activities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zielbauer said the Definitive interface is the best he&rsquo;s seen for on-chain trading and DeFi. He anticipates BlockFills will bring additional offerings to the market through the partnership, further enhancing its appeal to a customer base focused on on-chain trading and simultaneously providing Definitive clients access to BlockFills&rsquo; robust suite of risk management products including options*, forwards* and perpetual swaps* for the digital asset markets. Definitive offers decentralized finance (DeFi) liquidity aggregation of more than 100 decentralized exchanges (DEXs), liquidity pools and off-chain primary market makers (PMMs)/dark pools across Solana and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains. An EVM is a decentralized computation engine that executes smart contracts on the Ethereum network. Advanced order types on the low-latency platform that are rarely seen in DeFi include time-weighted average price (TWAP), limit and stop order algorithms.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has secured confiscation orders of &pound;305,284 against Raheel Mirza, Cameron Vickers and Opeyemi Solaja for their roles in an investment fraud. This amounts to all their remaining assets.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>The confiscation proceedings for Reuben Akpojaro have been adjourned to a later date.</p>
<p>The money will be returned to investors at the earliest opportunity. Failure to pay can lead to imprisonment. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Between June 2016 and January 2020, the defendants cold called people to convince them to invest in a shell company. They then claimed to trade their client's money in binary options (a type of fixed odds financial betting) when the money was actually used to bankroll their lifestyles. In 2023 they were convicted and sentenced to a combined 24 and a half years for investment fraud.</p>
<p>Steve Smart, executive director, enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said:</p>
<p>'We are committed to fighting financial crime, including denying criminals their ill-gotten gains. We&rsquo;ve already successfully prosecuted these individuals for their part in a scam that conned 120 people out of their money. We&rsquo;re now seeking to recover as much as we can for victims.'</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ol>
<li>The FCA previously published details of the defendants&rsquo;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/three-individuals-convicted-and-sentenced-combined-24-and-half-years-all-or-nothing-investment-fraud" title="Three individuals convicted and sentenced to a combined 24 and a half years for 'all-or-nothing&rsquo; investment fraud">convictions and sentencing</a>.</li>
<li>Defendents are required to pay back the amount they benefited but this is always limited to their means.</li>
<li>Payment of compensation monies to victims is a matter for the court. It can only be paid after a defendant has made payment towards their confiscation / compensation order.</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250514a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>I have spent most of my career conducting research and overseeing research by others, first as a professor and later as a research director in the Federal Reserve System. More recently, I have been more of a consumer than a producer of research as a member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Eight times a year, the FOMC meets to set the appropriate stance of monetary policy to achieve the economic goals assigned to us by the U.S. Congress. We discuss where the economy stands in relation to those goals, how it is likely to evolve, and the implications for monetary policy. We examine hard statistical data, "soft" data in the form of surveys and input from business contacts, and other domestic and global factors.</p>
<p>Another vital input for central bankers is economic research. Nearly all central banks have a research group to help policymakers think through the effects of monetary policy on the economy. In the Federal Reserve, the 12 regional Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors have staffs that perform a variety of research activities. First and foremost, they use research to advise the Governors and Bank presidents on the appropriate path of monetary policy given current events. Second, they provide analysis of the global, U.S., and regional economies. Third, economists at the Reserve Banks meet with businesses in their Districts to discuss economic issues and to collect information about the local economy. Finally, there are research groups around the Federal Reserve System that focus on banking, payments, financial markets, financial stability, and community development.</p>
<p>The word "research" is used very loosely in everyday life. When I was a professor, my undergraduates would do "research" to write a term paper. When I go on vacation, I often do "research" on what to do or see at my destination. Analysts at financial institutions do "research" on individual firms or sectors of the economy. For today's talk, I narrow in on the types of research done at central banks, with a focus on the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p><span>Research at the Federal Reserve</span><br />Research is a vital input for providing state-of-the-art advice to policymakers within the Federal Reserve System. Because the Fed is accountable to the public, policymakers must be able to explain why certain actions were taken and describe the intellectual foundations underlying those decisions. Decisions are analyzed, discussed, and criticized by many, in particular by highly skilled and knowledgeable academic researchers. Top academics are on the cutting edge of research, particularly on the subject of monetary policy. Milton Friedman, Allan Meltzer, Robert Lucas, John Taylor, and Michael Woodford are just a few examples of academic scholars who challenged central bankers over the past 70 years on how monetary policy should be conducted. Central banks must be up to the challenge and be able to debate and compete with these academics in the world of theory and ideas.</p>
<p>To do that requires hiring central bank economists who are trained in the academic research tradition and continue working at the research frontier. And that means pursing academic research at central banks. Our decisions will be better if we hire motivated and well-trained economists and let them work on the big questions that economics seeks to answer. The Federal Reserve tries to create a strong academic research environment to attract strong researchers to work at the Federal Reserve to give us a better foundation for the decisions we make.</p>
<p>When I was research director at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, I told our board of directors that my goal was to build a department that was renowned for producing high-quality academic research. They often responded by saying, "But the Federal Reserve is not a university. Rather than doing academic research, why isn't your staff doing research on issues that you direct them to work on that helps the president of the Bank?" This is a great question and one that should be asked at every central bank. To answer that question, I would start by explaining the difference between academic research and directed research, which I will now do today. Once I have, it will be clear that directed research relies on its grounding in academic research and is a complement to directed research in supporting policymaking.</p>
<p><span>Academic Research</span><br />Academic research considers a broad range of economic matters. It often focuses on issues that are currently off the radar screens of policymakers who are focused on the near-term economic outlook. But there is value in thinking broadly. Not too long ago, trade policy and tariffs were not a major concern of policymakers. A critical aspect of academic research is that it is often "proactive"&mdash;it focuses on intellectually interesting issues often before they become relevant for monetary policy.</p>
<p>Academic research conducted by Federal Reserve economists is often done with the goal of publishing it in academic journals. Papers submitted to these journals go through a rigorous vetting process by economists outside the central bank. This serves as an important check on central bank "group think." The ideas and conclusions of the paper must be based on sound economic theory and empirical evidence. They cannot reflect dogma or outdated beliefs about how the economy operates.</p>
<p>Academic research can take the form of an evaluation of major economic events, sometimes called an "economic autopsy." This type of analysis can take years, and it's not particularly time sensitive. To this day, economists are still researching the causes of the 2008 financial crisis and how policies undertaken at that time helped or hindered the subsequent economic recovery.</p>
<p><span>Directed Research</span><br />Then there is directed research. Directed research is just that&mdash;an issue or policy problem that staff economists are told to work on by their supervisors. It is not unrestricted thinking about an issue. Often, directed research addresses an emerging topic that demands attention from policymakers. As a result, directed research is usually reactive in nature. It often has the feel of firefighting&mdash;an issue flares up, and policymakers must respond. They need analysis of the problem to think about the issue and how to act. For example, the April 2 tariff announcement was larger and more extensive than nearly anyone expected. Immediately, questions were asked of staff around the Federal Reserve System such as, "What will this do to the U.S. economy? What will happen to inflation and unemployment?" The answers to these questions are obviously time sensitive.</p>
<p>Directed research often involves running shocks though existing economic models or quick data analysis and it relies on existing economic research. One could call the results "quick and dirty" answers. Because this work is time sensitive, central bank researchers do not have the luxury of getting their directed research vetted by the economics profession. They simply figure out how the current issue can be incorporated into the models or analyzed with econometrics, and whatever answer comes out is the best they can do in the time they have.</p>
<p>Because directed research is often reactive and time sensitive, researchers must rely on existing published research as a key input into their analysis. You cannot come up with original or innovative models on the spot to deal with an issue that suddenly appears. And, on the data front, you may not have the time to look deeply at the microdata. In these situations, existing academic research done by central bank economists and by academics outside the central bank provides the foundation for conducting the directed research. This is why I say that academic research is a complement to directed research. Good directed research requires academic research. Furthermore, postmortem analysis is not always done after directed research is completed. Once the issue goes off policymakers' radar screens, it might not be looked at again. If the issue resurfaces at a later date, then there may be some postmortem investigation into earlier analyses to see what went right and what went wrong.</p>
<p>Finally, directed research sometimes takes the form of analysis involving the gathering and organizing of facts and data to generate a simple narrative for less specialized audiences. The Beige Book&mdash;which is a survey of regional economic conditions done by the Reserve Banks&mdash;is a clear example. But it also takes other forms, such as talks by research economists to private-sector audiences, presentations to the Reserve Bank boards of directors, or writing about timely topics in short economic posts.</p>
<p><span>History of Research at the Federal Reserve</span><br />Economic research has shaped monetary policy at the Federal Reserve from its very beginnings, but the form and use of that research has varied considerably over time. I do not have the time today to give this topic the justice it deserves. But I will touch on a few historical highlights. During the early decades of the Federal Reserve System, "research" at the Fed was largely limited to the collection of statistics, only some of which were published by the Fed and other government agencies. At the Reserve Banks, the focus was often on measuring and reporting on regional economies or sectors.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250514a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;Monetary policy decisions were made using policy frameworks that were often not tested in the rigorous and scientific ways associated with economic research today. For example, in the 1920s, the Federal Reserve adhered to the "real bills" doctrine that called for providing liquidity to businesses when it was demanded during expansions and contracting credit when demand for it fell during times of slowing growth.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250514a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;This, of course, is often exactly the opposite of what monetary policy should do to either control inflation in an overheating economy or support economic activity in a slowdown.</p>
<p>Up until the 1950s, journal-oriented economic research in the Federal Reserve System was quite limited. But a big increase took place in the 1950s, when the Reserve Bank presidents became much more involved in monetary policy decisions.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250514a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;Before that, Bank presidents focused mainly on local operations and discount window policy. But once they became more involved in national-level policymaking decisions, their new responsibilities required them to have more specialized research staff who were trained in modern economic theory and data methods. The creation and development of professional research departments led to a greater debate within the Federal Reserve and among outside academics as to how monetary policy should be conducted.</p>
<p>In the 1960s, Keynesian macroeconomic theory was the dominant paradigm in policymaking, and large-scale econometric models were being developed to provide quantitative analysis of monetary policy. The Board of Governors led the way by hiring Ph.D. economists from academia to develop and use these Keynesian models and econometric techniques to aid policymakers. This was an important first step in raising the skill level of research staff to match that of top academics.</p>
<p>But the beauty of the Federal Reserve's structure is that alternative macroeconomic frameworks and theories could be developed in the rest of the System. And the first example of an alternative view of monetary policy was developed by research economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and became a force to be reckoned with.</p>
<p>In the early 1970s, after inflation failed to fall as much as expected in a slow economy, Fed Chairman Arthur Burns came to believe that inflation was very little affected by economic slack and was instead a structural problem that could only be dealt with through wage and price controls.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250514a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;Board models typically viewed the 1970s inflation as being driven by special factors that were outside the influence of monetary policy. In contrast, at the St. Louis Fed, monetarism was the dominant paradigm in thinking about monetary policy. The Bank's researchers believed the 1970s inflation was driven by excessive monetary growth.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250514a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;This led to a vigorous debate throughout the 1970s between Board staff and St. Louis Fed economists over the sources of inflation and how to bring it back down. At the end of the 1970s, Paul Volcker became Chair of the Federal Reserve and essentially adopted the St. Louis monetarist position of halting monetary growth to bring inflation under control. He announced a fundamental change in the Fed's policy approach, vowing to bring inflation down by adopting strict monetary growth targeting. Volcker succeeded, but at the cost of causing a severe recession.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis became a dominant force in monetary policy research by proposing new economic theories and policy frameworks. In association with economists at the University of Minnesota and the University of Chicago, researchers at the Minneapolis Fed explored how rational expectations would affect the transmission channel of monetary policy. Up until then, Fed forecasting models assumed that individuals had adaptive expectations, meaning they were purely backward looking. This meant that the Board's econometric models didn't account for policy actions that were announced in advance but hadn't taken effect yet. If households and firms did understand how current policy actions and announcements would affect future outcomes, they would react in ways that didn't match the predictions of the Board's forecasting models. This would lead to significant errors in the guidance that the staff provided to policymakers.</p>
<p>A critical finding of all this research was that private agents' inflation expectations were forward looking&mdash;they would adjust to promises, and failures, of central bankers to keep inflation low and stable. If people didn't believe a central bank's promise to keep inflation low, then the central bank lacked credibility. This would cause inflation expectations to increase, which would lead to demands for higher nominal wages, thereby feeding future inflation. It is now widely believed that this was a key problem that Volcker faced: His promises to bring inflation down were not fully credible, as they came after the Fed's uneven efforts at fighting inflation over the previous decade. Research on monetary policy, along with the experience of the Volcker years, led to the concepts of "credibility" and "stable inflation expectations" becoming central parts of how every central bank enacts policy.</p>
<p>A key innovation at the Minneapolis Fed that led to this explosion of fundamental macroeconomic research was creating strong research links between Fed researchers and academics at the University of Minnesota. Instead of being on opposite sides of the fence, the idea was to have Fed researchers and academics work together side by side. This frequent interaction led to the type of rigorous debate between academics and Fed researchers that I discussed earlier. As a result, more rigorous and sound monetary policy frameworks were developed over the next several decades. The success of this close interaction between academics and Fed researchers led most Federal Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors to adopt similar relationships that continue to this day.</p>
<p>Another example of the value of economic research came with the onset of the Global Financial Crisis in 2008, the worst since the Great Depression. As it happened, the Fed Chair at the time was one of the world's leading experts on that period, Ben Bernanke. He drew heavily on his and others' research on the 1930s, and related work on Japan's crisis and slow growth in the 1990s and 2000s, to help fashion new monetary policy tools to combat the downturn, including quantitative easing and extended forward guidance.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250514a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a></p>
<p>Does this suggest that central bank policymakers should all be Ph.D. economists and have a record of journal publications? Of course not&mdash;there are other skills and work experiences needed in the policy sphere, and the Fed has economists and non-economists among its policymakers. Before the 1990s, very few policymakers were Ph.D. economists, and those who were usually did not have academic records in research; instead, policymakers typically had backgrounds in financial markets or the law.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250514a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;In contrast, since the 1990s, key policymaking roles in central banks around the world have been filled by Ph.D. economists with an academic research background. Today, 10 of the 19 FOMC policymakers are Ph.D. economists. The experience of these economists further embeds economic research into monetary policymaking and strengthens the decisions that are made.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I expect research to remain an important part of policymaking at the Fed and other central banks. I believe that the insights provided by this research can further our understanding of the economy and improve monetary policymaking.</p>

<p><a name="fn2"></a>2. The Federal Reserve Board and the Reserve Banks did have several Ph.D. economists on staff who engaged in pathbreaking research. For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's John H. Williams and Randolph Burgess and the Board's E.A. Goldenweiser and Winfield Riefler produced numerous articles and treatises on financial markets, international monetary arrangements, and Federal Reserve policy.&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) today signed the International Organization of Securities Commissions&rsquo; (IOSCO) Enhanced Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Consultation and Cooperation and the Exchange of Information (EMMoU).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The signing ceremony was held in conjunction with IOSCO&rsquo;s Annual Meeting, where the SC, the Capital Markets Authority (CMA), Kenya and Comisi&oacute;n Nacional del Mercado de Valores (CNMV), Spain joined the 27 IOSCO members who are already signatories of the EMMoU. The EMMoU allows its signatories to avail themselves of the latest forms of crossborder assistance to increase effectiveness of investigation and enforcement.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>IOSCO&rsquo;s first Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MMoU) established a framework for international information-sharing among securities and derivatives regulators to facilitate cross-border enforcement.&nbsp; The SC became a signatory in May 2007 and has since actively and successfully collaborated with other signatories under the MMoU framework.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, SC signed the IOSCO Asia Pacific Regional Committee&rsquo;s (APRC) Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding for Supervisory Cooperation (Supervisory MMoU) in October 2022. The Supervisory MMoU establishes a formal framework for regional supervisory cooperation among capital market regulators.</p>
<p>The EMMoU has expanded powers abbreviated as &ldquo;ACFIT&rdquo; which includes the ability to obtain (A) audit papers, (C) compel attendance for testimony, (F) freeze assets, and obtain (I) internet service provider and (T) telephone records.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>SC Chairman Dato' Mohammad Faiz Azmi signed the EMMoU in the presence of IOSCO members during the last day of the IOSCO Annual Meeting, which ran from 12-14 May 2025 in Doha.<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;This EMMoU significantly underscores our commitment towards maintaining market integrity and safeguarding investor interests. It also demonstrates our unwavering support on international enforcement cooperation. This is very timely as the increasingly interconnected nature of global financial markets necessitates international cooperation to address issues such as securities fraud,&rdquo; said Dato&rsquo; Mohammad Faiz. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The IOSCO Annual Meeting is a key forum where members discuss important issues related to global securities and futures markets. It serves as a platform for sharing information, coordinating enforcement of securities regulation, and implementing common standards, ultimately aiming to strengthen the global regulatory framework for financial markets.</p>

<title>Traditional Carbon Models Overestimate Scope 3 Emissions By Up To 2,480%, Study Finds - AI-Powered Platform Delivers 30x More Accurate Measurements</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-US">Traditional  carbon estimation models are missing the mark on Scope 3 emissions by up to 2,480%, according to new analysis by climate intelligence firm Carbon Responsible. The study compared widely aused Environmentally Extended Input Output (EEIO) estimates to Ada, an  AI-powered emissions engine, benchmarking against verified 2023 emissions data across a sample of FTSE 100 companies.&nbsp;</span></span><span class="eop"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-US">While traditional EEIO methods showed divergences as high as 2,480% from verified data, Ada's technology reduced measurement inaccuracy to just 80% &ndash; making  it 30 times more accurate, or a 97% improvement in precision.</span></span><span class="eop"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-US">"This represents a step-change in emissions measurement capability," said Matthew Paver, COO of Carbon Responsible. "When you're 97% more accurate than the  industry standard, you're no longer in the realm of estimation &ndash; you're capturing investment-grade data."</span></span><span class="eop"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-US">The findings come as regulators worldwide tighten requirements for emissions reporting. Both the EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)  and the US SEC climate rule now mandate traceable, up-to-date, and auditable emissions data &ndash; placing firms using outdated measurement methods at growing financial, regulatory, and reputational risk.</span></span><span class="eop"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-US">Scope 3 emissions &ndash; which include supply chain, investment, and product-use emissions &ndash; can account for more than 80% of a firm's carbon footprint yet have  remained notoriously difficult to measure. EEIO, the globally accepted methodology for estimating carbon emissions using spend-based data, is endorsed by global frameworks including the GHG Protocol and the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF).</span></span><span class="eop"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun"><span>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re seeing emissions disclosures based on proxies from six years ago &ndash; and regulators are starting to notice,&rdquo; said Matthew Paver, COO of Carbon Responsible. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s  being accepted in ESG reports today would never pass audit in a financial statement. </span></span><span class="normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-US">Procurement, risk modelling, capital allocation </span></span><span class="normaltextrun"><span>&ndash;</span></span><span class="normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-US"> all now demand a firmer grasp of emissions  data. Even if it feels like attention is shifting away right now, the CFO&rsquo;s office can no longer afford to treat carbon as a compliance footnote.</span></span><span class="normaltextrun"><span>&rdquo;</span></span><span class="eop"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun"><span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a widespread misconception that Scope 3 data is just a best guess, but if you&rsquo;re setting net zero targets, allocating capital, or filing regulatory disclosures,  guesswork isn&rsquo;t good enough.&rdquo;</span></span><span class="eop"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-US">Carbon Responsible this month launched its AI-powered carbon emissions measurement platform, Ada, to address the crisis of credibility in Scope 3 reporting. </span></span><span class="normaltextrun"><span>Built for investment-grade analysis, Ada delivers 90% accuracy across portfolios and supply chains, drawing on a proprietary dataset of more than 14,000  verified company records. The platform leverages machine learning to produce real-time, auditable insights &ndash; with no emissions data older than two years.</span></span><span class="eop"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-US">Carbon Responsible is already working with asset managers, private equity firms, and global corporates that are preparing for their first CSRD-aligned reports  or submitting climate targets for SBTi validation. Many are seeking to replace &ldquo;black box&rdquo; ESG datasets with transparent and defensible carbon estimates.</span></span><span class="eop"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun"><b><span lang="EN-US">From volume to verifiability</span></b></span><span class="eop"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun"><span>Carbon Responsible is the latest voice calling for a shift in ESG data standards &ndash; from volume to verifiability. The firm argues that while some providers boast carbon  datasets covering hundreds of thousands of entities, those databases are often populated with coarse estimates that obscure rather than clarify climate risk.</span></span><span class="eop"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun"><span>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t invest based on a credit rating built from an industry average in 2017,&rdquo; said Matthew Paver. &ldquo;So why are firms making climate decisions based on the same  approach?&rdquo;</span></span><span class="eop"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun"><span>The Ada platform is built around the concept of <i>evidence-based emissions reporting</i> &ndash; using primary data where available and rigorous proxy logic where it&rsquo;s not. Every data point comes with audit trails, source tagging, and methodological transparency.</span></span><span class="eop"><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun"><span>In doing so, the platform aims to solve what Carbon Responsible calls the &ldquo;missing middle&rdquo; of carbon data: mid-tier suppliers, unlisted investments, and complex value  chains where emissions are material but poorly understood.</span></span><span class="eop"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-US">&ldquo;What we&rsquo;re witnessing is the end of ESG&rsquo;s &lsquo;honour system&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Paver. "When your AI solution is 30 times more accurate than traditional methods, it transforms  not just reporting, but the entire approach to climate risk management and decarbonization strategy."</span></span><span class="eop"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<title>Meritz Securities, Partnering With Solactive For The First Time, Launches A Series Of ETNs, Tracking Solactive WTI Leverage Indices</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/meritz-securities-partnering-with-solactive-for-the-first-time-launches-a-seri-2025514/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Solactive is pleased to announce its inaugural collaboration with Meritz Securities by supporting the launch of 3 ETNs, each tracking to the Solactive WTI Leverage Index family. &nbsp;Considering persistent global market fluctuations and heightened uncertainty surrounding energy supply chains, crude oil has reasserted its role as a key instrument for tactical asset allocation. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil continues to draw investor attention due to its sensitivity to geopolitical and macroeconomic developments. Leveraged strategies offer investors the ability to capitalize on directional views&mdash;either bullish or bearish &mdash; on short-term WTI price movements. Moreover, given WTI&rsquo;s differentiated correlation profile versus equities and fixed income, the indices may serve as effective diversifiers within broader multi-asset portfolios.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The product suite comprises three distinct leveraged index strategies:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.solactive.com/indices/?index=DE000SL0QEE4">Solactive WTI Total Return 2x Long Leverage Index</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.solactive.com/indices/?index=DE000SL0QEF1">Solactive WTI Total Return 2x Short Leverage Index</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.solactive.com/indices/?index=DE000SL0QEG9">Solactive WTI Total Return 1x Long Leverage Index</a>. These indices are designed to meet growing investor interest in dynamic crude oil investment tools amid ongoing commodity price volatility. Each index reflects the performance of a leveraged investment in a rolling WTI crude oil futures strategy. The underlying reference is the Solactive Future Series 5-Day Roll WTI Crude Oil Excess Return USD Index, to which leverage factors of 2x, 1x, and -2x are applied.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The following ETNs were listed on 7th May 2025 on the Korean Stock Exchange:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Meritz Securities Solactive WTI Futures ETN(H) 87, with ticker code, 610087.KS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Meritz Securities Solactive 2X WTI Futures ETN(H) 88, with ticker code, 610088.KS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Meritz Securities Solactive -2X WTI Futures ETN(H) 89, with ticker code, 610089.KS</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Timo Pfeiffer, Chief Markets Officer at Solactive, commented</span>:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;We are thrilled to welcome Meritz Securities as a new partner in launching this&nbsp;</em><em>commodity</em><em>&nbsp;index suite. With investor appetite for tactical commodity exposures on the rise, our Solactive WTI Leverage Index family offers a flexible and efficient solution. We are confident that this collaboration will provide a valuable toolkit to navigate the dynamic energy markets.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jiman Park, Head of Derivatives Division at Meritz Securities:</span>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;As inflationary pressures continue to mount, demand for commodity futures as inflation hedging instruments is increasing. In response to growing investor interest in crude oil futures, which offer the highest liquidity among commodities, we introduce WTI ETNs based on Solactive indices minimizing fee burden and currency exposure concerns. WTI 1x provides direct exposure to commodity futures for inflation hedging. WTI 2x offers leveraged returns for investors seeking to capitalize on upward commodity trends. WTI -2x presents inverse exposure for risk management and hedging against inflation concerns during periods of heightened global uncertainty and market volatility. The products utilize Solactive indices to deliver efficient and accessible commodity investment solutions.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Results for the first quarter ending 31 March 2025</p>
<p><b>Financial highlights</b></p>
<p>Strong underlying<sup>[1]</sup>&nbsp;business growth offsetting lower interest income</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Underlying business income for Q1 2025 reached a record &euro;466 million, representing a 10% increase compared to Q1 2024. This growth was supported by robust business drivers, including fixed income issuance, increased equity quotations, and increased settlement activity due to market volatility related to geopolitical uncertainty.</li>
<li>Underlying interest and banking income decreased by 10% compared to Q1 2024, to &euro;255 million as expected given the declining interest rate environment. The impact was partially mitigated by increased cash balances.</li>
<li>Underlying costs rose by 5%, broadly in line with expectations. This reflects investments in strategic development initiatives and inflation. Cost containment measures initiated last year continue to progress.</li>
<li>As result of the positive operating leverage, business income operating margin improved from 23.4% in Q1 2024 to 27.1% in Q1 2025.</li>
<li>Resulting adjusted net profit of &euro;283 million decreased slightly by 1%. Adjusted Earnings Per Share remain stable year-on-year at &euro;90.</li>
<li><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="http://email.prnewswire.com/ls/click?upn=u001.v-2BJ3gj6ki5QD5j-2Fn6dQLinsjaQUzbVSacKLCMhCICrOCV7-2BFx-2F5lxq7ZOPKlRXjqAXZB_pIbxPfpDI69aAybPrpOfg1n6CWmKMnb3conIyNKCYgr-2BTRqxLAwMRExIXLpGb5DJomL7dz5iRKddeJQxP42dKpRcSepY4gvUMrkV3NYqtsh9n9aJlrggOvzGk5jA2CQZX-2BqJXbEa30y5FMb5XKExNHkY35ps3vOW28dVncYaEjdNyh27jSrEVZ3fYc5uvAZyP1CWV8VThSZbqZ-2BnBIn5ITDPXNfTd57cXNips8xYV7C-2BBasZPbGsCcTfU-2FRJcltcJXrcZC0gRwSZApp-2FpfQRj2SIatbSN2-2FAkaw978I3BglTt73pi-2FOqMwEvS6MOp020GeID9Y-2FRQM8AKhzLYzQY4lwaWyblNvA-2BWAEEK3YWwmk-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Euroclear</a>&nbsp;Group retains a very strong capital position, comfortably above regulatory requirements with a Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of around 61%<sup>[2]</sup>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Following the acquisition of a 49% stake in Inversis (see below), Inversis' results are consolidated as from March 1<sup>st</sup>, contributing to the group profit for &euro;1.2 million through the share of results.</p>
<p>The impacts of the Russian sanctions are detailed in the last section of this press release.</p>

<p><b>Valerie&nbsp;Urbain, Chief Executive Officer of Euroclear, commented:</b></p>
<p><i>"We have made a strong start to 2025, reporting a 10% increase in business income driven by robust growth in safekeeping fees and settlement income, offsetting the anticipated decrease in interest income as rates have declined. Despite market volatility and uncertainty, our continued growth shows the strength of our diversified, resilient business model.</i></p>
<p><i>We continue to closely monitor the impact of tariffs imposed by the US administration announced in early April, but the immediate direct impact on our business so far remains limited. Resilience and reliability remain the top priorities for our business and the volatile backdrop has underscored the strength of Euroclear's systems, which continue to perform highly efficiently and securely during periods of elevated trading volumes.</i></p>
<p><i>As Europe's largest player in post-trade, continuing to drive market openness, innovation and efficiency is central to our approach and we have made strong progress against our strategic priorities during the start of 2025. Our partnership with Microsoft will further enhance client experience, support our strategic ambitions and drive new opportunities for business growth. We are increasingly leveraging technological evolutions such as AI throughout the business to transform markets and to build an open digital and data-enabled platform that promotes collaboration, drives efficiency and delivers value for all market participants."</i></p>
<p><b>Business performance</b></p>
<p>The key operating metrics (end of period unless stated otherwise) demonstrate an excellent business performance during the period.</p>

<p>Euroclear has reached record levels in settlement and safekeeping activities, with assets under custody growing for the tenth quarter in a row and closing the first quarter over the &euro;41 trillion mark. The turnover increased by 23% compared to Q1 2024 thanks to high equity quotations, robust results in fixed income and increased settlement activity due to market volatility in the context of geopolitical uncertainty. The outstanding of Euroclear's Collateral Highway now surpasses to &euro;2 trillion, while the funds depot is close to its peak of &euro;3.6 trillion.</p>
<p><b>Q1 2025 business milestones</b></p>
<p><i>Strategic stake in Inversis</i></p>
<p>Early March 2025, Euroclear successfully completed the acquisition of 49% of&nbsp;Inversis. This first transaction paves the way for the full acquisition of the Spanish company. This aligns with Euroclear's strategic vision to accelerate the growth of its one-stop-shop funds offering &ndash;&nbsp;Euroclear FundsPlace &ndash; and expand its presence in Southern Europe. Inversis' technology-led, diversified and resilient business model underpinned by continued growth perfectly complements Euroclear's existing funds business.</p>
<p><i>New Singapore branch</i></p>
<p>Further delivering on its Asia strategy, Euroclear Bank received approval for a branch licence in Singapore. Effective 1 February 2025, the new Singapore branch operates under a wholesale banking licence, enabling it to provide a broader range of activities. This change underscores Euroclear's long-standing commitment to the Asia Pacific market and its strategic focus on enhancing operational resilience while increasing proximity to clients in the region.</p>
<p><i>New, innovative service for US Treasury repo market</i></p>
<p>Euroclear launched a US Treasury Delivery-Versus-Payment (DVP) repo service. The service offers cash lenders similar operational efficiency for DVP repo transactions as triparty repo transactions. Repo collateral is held in a segregated account with the cash lender's custodian of choice. Electronic trading workflows on venues are integrated into the new service, making activities such as collateral allocation seamless for cash lenders and their counterparties.</p>
<p><i>Strategic partnership with Microsoft harnessing cloud, data and AI</i></p>
<p>Euroclear entered into a 7-year strategic partnership with Microsoft to transform Euroclear clients' experience and drive new opportunities for growth. The partnership further strengthens Euroclear's business ecosystem and technology infrastructure by leveraging Microsoft's leading technology, expertise and cloud services. This will enhance Euroclear's ability to create value for all market participants and unlock new opportunities at the core of the capital markets ecosystem. Microsoft will support Euroclear's strategic ambition in key growth areas like funds and client experience as well as its long-term vision to evolve into a Digital and Data-Enabled Financial Market Infrastructure.</p>
<p><b>Russian sanctions impacts</b>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Financial impacts of the Russian assets</b></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Interest&nbsp;earnings from Russian sanctioned assets were &euro;1,470 million, a 7.5% decrease from Q1 2024 due to gradual rate cuts. Future interest earnings will continue to evolve in line with future policy rates.</li>
<li>&nbsp;As required by the EU windfall contribution regulation implemented in May 2024, Euroclear provisioned &euro;944 million as windfall contribution for Q1 2025.</li>
<li>The Russian sanctions and countermeasures resulted in direct costs of &euro;22 million and a loss of business income of &euro;9 million.</li>
<li>Interest earnings related to Russian assets, which are subject to Belgian corporate tax, generated &euro;360 million in tax revenue for the Belgian State.</li>
</ul>
<div dir="ltr" id="dvprnejpg97beleft"><img align="middle" alt="Financial impacts of the Russian assets" id="prnejpg97beleft" src="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2686530/Financial_impacts_Russia.jpg" title="Financial impacts of the Russian assets" /></div>
<p><b>Update on Russian sanctions and countermeasures&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 resulted in market-wide application of international sanctions. Euroclear considers the application of international sanctions as a key obligation. Therefore, well established processes are in place which have allowed the group to implement the sanctions while maintaining our normal course of business.<br /><br />As a result of the sanctions, blocked coupon payments and redemptions owed to sanctioned entities continue to accumulate on Euroclear Bank's balance sheet. At the end of March 2025, Euroclear Bank's balance sheet totalled &euro;230 billion, of which &euro;195 billion relate to sanctioned Russian assets.<br /><br />In line with Euroclear's risk appetite and policies and as expected by the EU Capital Requirements Regulation, Euroclear's cash balances are re-invested to minimise risk and capital requirements. In the first quarter of 2025, interest arising on cash balances from Russian-sanctioned assets was approximately &euro;1.5 billion.</p>
<p>In May 2024, the European Commission has adopted a new regulation about a windfall contribution applicable to CSDs holding Russian Central Bank assets with a total value of more than &euro;1 million. The profits generated by the reinvestment of&nbsp;these&nbsp;sanctioned amounts dating from 15 February 2024 onwards&nbsp;are required to be contributed to the European Fund&nbsp;for Ukraine. After retention of a 10% share of the windfall contribution to comply with capital and risk management requirements,&nbsp;Euroclear paid approx. &euro;3.5 billion to the European Fund for Ukraine for the 2024 fiscal year. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Euroclear continues to act prudently and&nbsp;to strengthen its capital by retaining&nbsp;the remainder of the Russian sanction related profits&nbsp;as a buffer against current and future risks. Euroclear is focused on minimising potential legal, financial, and operational risks that may arise for itself and its clients, while complying with its obligations.</p>
<p>As a direct consequence of the sanctions and countermeasures, Euroclear faces multiple proceedings in Russian courts. Since Russia considers international sanctions against public order, Russian claimants initiated legal proceedings aiming mainly to access assets blocked in Euroclear Bank's books, by claiming an equivalent amount in Russian Ruble and enforcing their claim in Russia. Despite all legal actions taken by Euroclear and the considerable resources mobilised, the probability of unfavourable rulings in Russian courts is high since Russia does not recognise the international sanctions.</p>
<p><sup>[1]</sup>&nbsp;Excluding Russian sanctions impacts<br /><sup>[2]</sup>&nbsp;Based on estimated RWA of around &euro;14.4 billion (of which around &euro;6,3 billion of RWA are related to Russian assets) and CET1 capital of around &euro;8.8 billion</p>

<div class="hero-paragraph"><span class="hero">In this speech Sarah sets out the critical role of central counterparties and the importance of a system-wide approach to regulating them to ensure their actions, whilst prudent from a micro-prudential perspective, do not amplify shocks in times of stress.

<h2>Speech</h2>
<p>I wanted to start by saying what a pleasure it is to be here with you today. ISDA has been instrumental in setting global standards and promoting best practices in the derivatives industry. Your tireless efforts in advocating for robust risk management frameworks and transparent market practices have significantly contributed to the stability and resilience of the financial system.</p>
<p>In many markets, central clearing, including of derivatives, plays a hugely important role in managing risks and maintaining resilience. Day in, day out, CCPs (central counterparties) clear trillions of pounds worth of contracts, bringing profound benefits to the stability and efficiency of the financial system. One of their key benefits, both from a safety and an efficiency perspective, is their ability to simplify the web of connections between market participants through multilateral netting. Through their margining practices, CCPs also help to set a common baseline of risk management for all market participants. And CCPs enhance the transparency of default management. If a member defaults, the CCP is entrusted to manage the default and minimise costs for all: a cost it may then share among the members if not covered by the initial margin (IM). If this is all done predictably &ndash; in line with their rulebooks &ndash; then the CCP removes uncertainty from markets in times of stress. Let&rsquo;s not forget &ndash; Lehman&rsquo;s cleared exposures were managed without loss after its default.</p>
<p>Given the critical role they play, ensuring the resilience of CCPs is central to our work at the central bank.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/may/sarah-breeden-keynote-address-at-the-international-swaps-and-derivatives-association#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;But ensuring the stability of individual CCPs, while necessary, is not sufficient for financial stability. As central nodes in the financial system, CCPs&rsquo; actions can affect confidence and risk behaviour across the financial system, affecting the ability of others to provide vital services. It is important, therefore, that in our regulation of CCPs we take a macro-prudential approach, considering risks to financial stability in the UK and globally and this is what I want to focus on in my remarks today.</p>
<h3>The Margining Trilemma and the Role of Procyclicality</h3>
<p>Margining practices are a key example where actions of one firm, although prudent from an individual, micro-prudential, firm perspective, have the potential to contribute to macro-prudential financial stability risks.</p>
<p>Margins play a vital role in managing counterparty credit risk. They are likely to vary as the market environment changes to better reflect counterparty credit risk. However, whilst calling higher margin in stressed markets will increase protection for the CCP and its members if a counterparty defaults, it may also increase liquidity demand at a time when liquidity is likely to be scarce leading to a procyclical response. If market participants are not adequately prepared, this could lead to counterparty default or a liquidation of positions if firms cannot maintain their risk exposures. Such asset liquidations can then exacerbate price moves, potentially generating a self-reinforcing spiral.</p>
<p>These dynamics contributed to stress during the dash for cash episode in 2020.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/may/sarah-breeden-keynote-address-at-the-international-swaps-and-derivatives-association#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[2]</a></sup>&nbsp;They were also evident in the commodity crisis of early 2022 and were seen in bilateral markets in the gilt market dysfunction in autumn 2022<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/may/sarah-breeden-keynote-address-at-the-international-swaps-and-derivatives-association#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>We should expect CCPs to raise margins in these events. But we also expect CCPs to hold enough margin when markets are calm that the increases are not unmanageable for participants. (Of course, we should also expect participants to be prepared &ndash; as I&rsquo;ll come on to later).</p>
<p>Indeed, we can think of margin practices as a trade-off, or trilemma, between different risks. The models CCPs use to calculate their initial margin can be scored along three different dimensions: (i) coverage: how well does the margin cover the poster&rsquo;s risk; (ii) cost: how expensive is the margin requirement over time; and (iii) reactivity: how jumpy is it in times of market volatility/stress. And if the model doesn&rsquo;t score well in any of these dimensions, there may be an emerging risk to financial stability. We might imagine there is a &ldquo;family&rdquo; of risk models (and therefore margin levels) inside a &ldquo;safe zone&rdquo; where all three dimensions score well: enough coverage, not too reactive, and not too expensive.</p>
<p>Whilst current regulatory requirements do set some constraints &ndash; e.g. risk coverage must always be met, and models shouldn&rsquo;t be too reactive &ndash; there is a reasonable amount of discretion available to CCPs. Indeed, what could be deemed as &ldquo;too jumpy&rdquo; for one market with smaller end users might be &ldquo;just fine&rdquo; for another market with large banks.</p>
<p>It is something we expect the CCPs to think very carefully about when calibrating their models. Indeed, it is part of their duty to be aware of the impact of their margin calls on their membership, and to take seriously the feedback from their members, for example who sit on their risk committees. This is something we explore in our supervisory reviews, as well as when looking at models. Given inevitable pressures to lower margins in the good times, it is essential for us all to maintain a focus on what might happen in bad times.</p>
<h3>Transparency and Margin Preparedness</h3>
<p>Transparency and predictability in margin practices is also critical. In our System Wide Exploratory Scenario (SWES), we found there were material differences between clearing members&rsquo; and CCP&rsquo;s projections for initial margin calls. While in the SWES we found an overestimation by clearing members, in other contexts we could see an underestimation &ndash; if, for example, stress follows an extended period of low volatility, as seen in the dash for cash and commodity stresses.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk197604993"></a>So, what is being done? Since 2022, the Bank has been an active contributor to the international work streams that build on the BCBS-CPMI-IOSCO review of margining practices published in September 2022.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/may/sarah-breeden-keynote-address-at-the-international-swaps-and-derivatives-association#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[4]</a></sup>&nbsp;The key policy outcomes of these work streams have culminated in a set of proposals which aim to increase the resilience of the centrally and non-centrally cleared market ecosystem in times of stress. Among these you will find:</p>
<ol>
<li>Proposals to improve centrally cleared market participants&rsquo; understanding of potential future margin requirements, as a result of more transparent CCP margin models and governance arrangements that seek input from participants when designing or changing the frameworks used for assessing margin.</li>
<li>Recommendations to enhance the liquidity preparedness of non-bank market participants for margin and collateral calls, in centrally and non-centrally cleared derivatives and securities markets.</li>
</ol>
<p>And importantly the recommendations highlighted the need for all market participants to conduct liquidity stress tests for margin and collateral calls &ndash; including to ensure reliable sources of liquidity.</p>
<p>This year, we will start to implement the recommendations domestically and continue working with international standard setting bodies to embed the proposals into the existing frameworks of international standards for Financial Market Infrastructures<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/may/sarah-breeden-keynote-address-at-the-international-swaps-and-derivatives-association#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[5]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Part of the benefit of taking a macro-prudential approach is that we recognise that not all of the responsibility for addressing financial stability risks sits solely with CCPs. Indeed, the better prepared market participants are for bad times, the more resilient the system can be to shocks.</p>
<p>On that theme, I wanted to highlight the FSB work on NBFI leverage. We and the FSB are grateful for the feedback we have received on the consultation paper &ndash; including from ISDA &ndash; and we are taking this seriously as we look to finalise its recommendations. We remain committed to addressing financial stability risks arising from leverage in NBFIs through improved risk identification and monitoring, a combination of policy measures and enhanced cross-border collaboration.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, our experience in September 2022 and our SWES have underscored vulnerabilities in the gilt repo market and the potential for dysfunction to threaten financial stability and the real economy. In November 2024 the Financial Policy Committee (the UK&rsquo;s macroprudential authority) welcomed further work to consider how to improve resilience in gilt repo markets.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/may/sarah-breeden-keynote-address-at-the-international-swaps-and-derivatives-association#footnote-7" id="footnote-ref-7"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[6]</a></sup>&nbsp;And so, we will start a conversation with industry via a Discussion Paper (DP) later this year on possible reforms to market structure to enhance gilt repo market resilience. The DP will be exploratory and will aim to gather views from market participants on potential options to help mitigate vulnerabilities, including greater central clearing of gilt repo and&nbsp;minimum haircuts on non-centrally cleared repos. We will share more information on our planned engagement in due course and look forward to market participants&rsquo; input and views on these issues.</p>
<h3>Portfolio Margining</h3>
<p>Another area where participant behaviour might be sensible from an individual firm perspective but potentially create risks at a system-wide level is portfolio margining. For example, participants (including CCPs) liquidate a defaulting counterparty&rsquo;s position as a portfolio, not contract by contract, and so portfolio margining allows them to account for reductions in risk that come from hedged or diversified portfolios.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/may/sarah-breeden-keynote-address-at-the-international-swaps-and-derivatives-association#footnote-8" id="footnote-ref-8"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[7]</a></sup>&nbsp;Not accounting for this risk reduction would result in margin being set to cover more extreme market moves than margin is designed for.</p>
<p>Whilst this portfolio approach makes sense at a micro-prudential level for an individual firm, it may have the side effect of facilitating increased leverage in the system as a whole. Take for example the cash-futures basis trade,<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/may/sarah-breeden-keynote-address-at-the-international-swaps-and-derivatives-association#footnote-9" id="footnote-ref-9"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[8]</a></sup>&nbsp;where the amount of leverage a participant can take depends on both the repo haircut and the initial margin rate of the future. The repo leg is usually done at zero or near-zero haircuts, given competitive pressures and as dealers are able to net potential counterparty credit risk on repo with margins paid on the offsetting future.</p>
<p>How this works in practice for CCPs depends on the local market structure. The CCP that clears the repo is often different to the CCP that clears the future, so if the trader is clearing both legs of the basis trade, they could be paying two sets of initial margin. But in the case of cross-CCP margining, margin is based on the net risk position across multiple CCPs, on the assumption that the CCPs will cooperate to manage the position as a single portfolio in the event of default. Should that link between CCPs break down, for whatever reason, including for operational reasons, unexpected extra margin could be significant. Such arrangements put a premium on ensuring CCP resilience, including in stress.</p>
<p>Cross-margining arrangements like these which utilise off-setting positions rely in general on assumptions about correlation. Events from a few weeks ago demonstrated how correlations can break down in stress. We saw key breaks in US swap spreads and a de-correlation of US equity prices and interest rates. It is essential, therefore, that participants, including CCPs, apply conservative assumptions around correlation breaks and unexpected shocks to prepare for scenarios where relationships between correlated products become less predictable or unreliable &ndash; including where moves may be amplified by market concentration or illiquidity.</p>
<p>Of course, portfolio margining also occurs in non-centrally cleared markets, in which case it is the dealer offering portfolio margining rather than the CCP. According to a 2023 report from the Office of Financial Research, over 70% of bilateral US Treasury repo is conducted at zero haircut.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/may/sarah-breeden-keynote-address-at-the-international-swaps-and-derivatives-association#footnote-10" id="footnote-ref-10"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[9]</a></sup>&nbsp;Even where official netting agreements do not exist, balance sheet allocations may be set up in a way that assumes certain correlations will hold. For example, prime brokers may be incentivised to lend very cheaply to clients they conduct equity business with. Sudden changes in correlations or sharp movements in market prices may result in sharp corrections in balance sheet allocation. In turn this may lead to contraction in funding and liquidity in core markets. And that may quickly have real economy impacts.</p>
<h3>The Importance of Operational Resilience</h3>
<p>I wanted to finish by noting that robust margining practices, whilst providing numerous benefits as I set out up front, often rely on quite complex operational process. The ability for CCPs to fulfil their central role in the financial system hinges on them remaining operationally resilient. As we face a landscape characterised by rapid technological change and heightened geopolitical tensions, our expectations of their operational resilience, including to cyber risk, have to evolve. We know incidents happen, but identifying the greatest financial stability risks, transmission channels, and ensuring there are robust recovery capabilities is crucial to limiting wider disruption of financial markets. CCPs must navigate these dynamics to mitigate risks and avoid amplifying threats to the broader financial system.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/may/sarah-breeden-keynote-address-at-the-international-swaps-and-derivatives-association#footnote-11" id="footnote-ref-11"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[10]</a></sup></p>
<h3><span>Conclusion</span></h3>
<p>Let me conclude. A macro-prudential approach to the supervision of CCPs is essential given their central role in the financial system. Our supervisory approach needs to ensure their actions, whilst prudent from a micro-prudential perspective, do not amplify shocks in times of stress. In doing so, we should work with our international partners to ensure margining practices, in centrally and non-centrally cleared markets, are robust and do not lead to excessive pro-cyclicality or facilitate excessive leverage in the system. And we should minimise the chances of operational incidents leading to financial stability risks. But taking a macro-prudential approach also means considering how broader developments will impact the derivatives markets. Broader reforms to address the risks from NBFI leverage and&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk197970756"></a>improve resilience in core markets are a necessary part of ensuring financial stability too.</p>

<p>For example, if the member has offsetting positions in two highly correlated products then the cost of liquidating the positions together will be lower than the sum of the two individual exposures. Alternatively, if the member has a diversified portfolio then this could also carry lower risks, as the probability of all exposures within the portfolio simultaneously facing a very extreme shock is lower.</p>

<p>Government bonds often trade cheaper than their futures because your outlay is higher to buy a bond.

<title>SET Market Report For April 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/set-market-report-for-april-2025-2025514/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised its global growth forecast down to 2.8 percent for 2025 and 3.0 percent for 2026. Concurrently, the U.S. dollar weakened against major currencies while 10-year U.S. Treasury yields edged upward, trading in the range of 4.0-4.5 percent. Amid growing concerns about the repercussion of trade tensions on the U.S. economy, investors increasingly divested from U.S. bonds, which were traditionally considered safe-haven assets. The Federal Reserve (Fed) maintained the benchmark interest rate at 4.25 percent to 4.50 percent as expected, marking the third consecutive rate pause.</p>
<p><strong>SET Senior Executive Vice President Soraphol Tulayasathien revealed that, according to data from the Thai Bond Market Association (ThaiBMA), foreign fund flows showed net inflows of approximately THB 60 billion (USD 1.80 billion) in April 2025, the highest level since February 2022. Based on analyst assessments, this significant capital inflow was driven by eroding confidence in the U.S. dollar due to escalating trade tensions, stronger demand for alternative safe-haven assets, and expectations of monetary policy easing in Thailand following its weaker-than-expected economic performance. The Thai capital market stability markedly improved following the U.S. announcement of a 90-day reprieve for the reciprocal tariffs on April 10. Complementing this external development, the t</strong>emporary measures implemented by The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) from April 8-11 also helped curb market volatility, as evidenced by the SET Index demonstrating lower volatility than several regional peers<strong>. In addition, the SET Index </strong>increased in latter half of April, with daily gains continuously spreading to more stocks across various sectors.<strong> Thai equities continued to trade at attractive valuations.</strong></p>
<p><b>Key highlights for April</b><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<ul>
<li>At the end of April 2025, the SET Index rose 3.4 percent MoM to close at 1,197.26 points, outpacing most regional exchanges, with a YTD decrease of 14.5 percent.</li>
<li>Compared to the end of 2024, industry groups that outperformed the SET Index were Financials, Agro &amp; Food Industry, Resources, and Consumer Products.</li>
<li>SET&rsquo;s and Market for Alternative Investment (mai)&rsquo;s average daily trading value declined 11.3 percent YoY to THB 39.41 billion (approx. USD 1.18 billion). Foreign investors continued to dominate trading activity, accounting for 50.52 percent of total trading value which was the highest among all investor categories. However, they registered a net selling position of THB 14.59 billion.</li>
<li>In April 2025, there were two newly listed companies on mai: LTMH pcl (LTMH) and Bangkok Asset Intergroup pcl (BKA). </li>
<li>The Thai stock exchange&rsquo;s forward P/E ratio at the end of April 2025 was 13.0 times, above the Asian stock market&rsquo;s average of 11.5 times. The historical P/E ratio stood at 15.8 times, exceeding the Asian stock market&rsquo;s average of 11.4 times.</li>
<li>Dividend yield ratio at the end of April 2025 was 4.00 percent, higher than the Asian stock markets&rsquo; average of 3.40 percent.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Derivatives Market</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Thailand Futures Exchange (TFEX)&rsquo;s daily trading volume in April 2025 averaged 433,408 contracts, down 16.6 percent from the previous month largely due to the lower trading volume of Single Stock Futures and SET50 Index Futures. The YTD average daily trading volume in 2025 was 456,561 contracts, down 5.6 percent, mainly due to the decline in trading volume of Single Stock Futures and Gold Online Futures.</li>

<title>ASIC Sues Macquarie Securities For Repeated And Systemic Misleading Conduct</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC is suing Macquarie Securities (Australia) Limited (<strong>MSAL</strong>) alleging it engaged in misleading conduct by misreporting millions of short sales to the market operator for over 14 years.</p>
<p>In proceedings filed in the NSW Supreme Court, ASIC alleges that between 11 December 2009 and 14 February 2024, MSAL failed to correctly report the volume of short sales by at least 73 million. ASIC estimates that this could be between 298 million and 1.5 billion short sales.</p>
<p>ASIC, in its first short sale reporting case, alleges the misleading conduct was due to multiple systems-related issues, many of which remained undetected for over a decade.</p>
<p>Accurate short sale reporting matters. Obligations to report short sales were introduced in 2009, following the Global Financial Crisis. Short sale data is used to inform investors, governments, regulators and financial market participants about market sentiment and potential risks. It also assists in detecting market misconduct and supports market integrity.</p>
<p>ASIC Chair Joe Longo said, &lsquo;This action is timely given significant recent global market volatility. Accurate and reliable data underpins the integrity of, and confidence in, Australia&rsquo;s financial markets. Investors expect reliable information to analyse market movements and inform their investment decisions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We allege Macquarie&rsquo;s failures may have led to the financial services industry relying on misleading and false information for over 14 years.</p>
<p>&lsquo;MSAL&rsquo;s repeated systemic failure to detect and resolve these issues indicated serious neglect of its systems and disregard for operational controls and technological governance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s announcement marks the fourth regulatory action ASIC has taken against Macquarie Group in just over 12 months.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Our actions reflect the ongoing and deep concerns we have with Macquarie Group and its weak remediation of long-standing issues, which led us to impose additional conditions on Macquarie Bank&rsquo;s Australian Financial Services licence only last week,&rsquo; Mr Longo said.</p>
<p>Market Participants must ensure that their systems, controls and governance arrangements are robust and fit for purpose to comply with their regulatory obligations.</p>
<p>In 2020, MSAL undertook a review of its short sale reporting process following weaknesses identified in 2015 and 2019. It is clear this review failed to identify and resolve the issues in these proceedings.</p>
<p>ASIC also alleges MSAL failed to correctly report Regulatory Data for 633,680 orders submitted to the Market Operator between 16 November 2022 and 21 March 2023.</p>
<p>In addition to penalties, ASIC is seeking independent review and assurance of MSAL&rsquo;s regulatory reporting (including short sale reporting) systems, controls and supervisory procedures to ensure compliance with the law.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>MSAL is an Australian Financial Services Licensee and a significant market participant of both the ASX and Cboe (formerly Chi-X) markets. It is authorised under its licence to deal in securities on behalf of retail and wholesale clients. MSAL is a subsidiary of Macquarie Group Limited (ASX: MQG), which recorded a net profit of $3,715m in its FY25 annual report.</p>
<p>ASIC alleges that MSAL contravened:</p>

<li>s798H(1) of the&nbsp;<em>Corporations Act 2001</em>&nbsp;(<strong>Corporations Act</strong>), by virtue of alleged contraventions of rules 2.1.3 (Supervisory Procedures), 5.5.2 (Organisational and Technical Resources) and 7.4.2 (Regulatory Data) of the&nbsp;<em>ASIC Market Integrity Rules (Securities Markets) 2017</em></li>
<li>s912A(1)(h) of the Corporations Act: Failure to have adequate risk management systems</li>
<li>s1308(5) of the Corporations Act: Submission of materially false or misleading documents to the market operator, and</li>
<li>s12DF of the&nbsp;<em>ASIC Act 2001</em>: Engaging in conduct liable to mislead the public in relation to financial services.</li>
</ul>
<p>ASIC alleges that MSAL&rsquo;s misreporting impacted data relating to at least 321 unique securities. ASIC also alleges that for each impacted security, MSAL inflated or deflated the published volume of short sales by an average of approximately 12 per cent, with several instances of misreporting impacting the published short sale volume by 50 per cent or more.</p>
<p>AFS Licensees are required to report certain details about short sales to market operators. Market operators rely on licensees to provide them with accurate short sale information to publish daily aggregated short sale reports to the market, which record the volume of short sales executed per financial product each trading day.</p>
<p>Published short sale reports may be used for various purposes by investors and the financial services industry, including company analysis, informing investment decisions, identifying risks and explaining share price movements. The short sale reports published by ASX and Cboe are accessible through the following links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://asxonline.com/content/asxonline/public/search.html?notificationType=reports&amp;eventNotificationFilter=undefined&amp;leafNodesSelected=asx-online%3Areport%2Fshort-sales-report&amp;dateRangeFilterSelected=-18M&amp;orderFilter=datepublished&amp;requestedPage=1&amp;q">ASX Published Short Sale Reports</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.cboe.com/au/equities/market_statistics/short_sale/">Cboe Published Short Sale Reports</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The short sale reporting requirements were introduced with the objective of enhancing public transparency for short selling activity in Australia. These provisions followed unprecedented volatility in financial markets during the Global Financial Crisis. The duration of MSAL&rsquo;s reporting issues means that it may have failed to comply with these requirements for most if not all of the time that these requirements have been in force.</p>

<li>On 7 May 2025, ASIC imposed additional AFS licence conditions on Macquarie Bank Limited following more than 10 years of compliance failures (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-068mr-asic-acts-against-macquarie-bank-for-repeated-compliance-failures/" title="25-068MR ASIC acts against Macquarie Bank for repeated compliance failures">25-068MR</a>).</li>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Strips Back Insurance Rulebook</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-strips-back-insurance-rulebook-2025514/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p align="left">The UK&rsquo;s world leading insurance market could benefit from simpler, more straightforward rules, under proposals published by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) today. The regulator plans to strip outdated or duplicated requirements from its insurance rulebook, having asked what improvements it could make. The changes could support lower costs and wider access for the businesses and consumers who rely on insurance to manage risk, while maintaining appropriate levels of protection.</p>
<p align="left">The regulator is proposing to create a new definition to identify large commercial insurance customers who should not be captured by its conduct rules. This would ease the burden on firms insuring larger businesses that can manage risks independently, while protecting smaller commercial customers.</p>
<p align="left">The regulator is also proposing further measures that could benefit the insurance market more widely, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>No longer requiring firms to review the value of their product at least every 12 months. Instead, firms would use the risks and characteristics of each product to decide how often they review them.</li>
<li>Giving firms flexibility to appoint one lead insurer to comply with its rules in instances where more than one party is involved in designing the insurance product.</li>
<li>Broadening the scope of bespoke contract exclusions and making them easier for all insurers and brokers to use. Bespoke contracts are built to suit one customer upon that customer&rsquo;s request, which means they automatically have the protections product governance rules provide.</li>
<li>Getting rid of duplicative annual reporting and employer&rsquo;s liability notification requirements.</li>
<li>Removing the specified minimum hours of training and development required for insurance and funeral plan employees.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><strong>Matt Brewis, director of insurance at the FCA</strong>, said:&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&ldquo;We are stripping back our insurance rulebook by removing ineffective, outdated or duplicated regulation, as part of our drive to become a smarter regulator and support growth.</p>
<p align="left">&ldquo;We have listened to industry and we are taking action - in doing so we will reduce regulatory costs and increase the competitiveness of the already world-leading UK insurance sector, while maintaining vital protections for smaller customers.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="left">The regulator is also inviting views on whether it should limit the scope of some rules to UK customers.</p>
<p align="left">The consultation comes following its&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/news-stories/next-steps-consumer-duty-rule-review" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">commitment</a>&nbsp;to withdraw over 100 pages of outdated guidance in a bid to streamline its rules, reduce burdens on businesses, and improve outcomes for consumers after the introduction of the Consumer Duty.</p>
<p align="left">The FCA is asking for comments on these proposals by 2 July 2025.</p>

<p>Cboe operates 27 markets across five asset classes in the U.S., Europe and Asia Pacific, which includes leading equity trading venues in Australia and Japan. Its Data Vantage business leverages this extensive global network of exchanges to provide market participants with a comprehensive suite of high-quality and reliable market data, analytics and index products and solutions - delivered as seamlessly and efficiently as possible to investors worldwide.</p>

<title>Acting CFTC Chairman Pham Statement On Court Sanctions Against CFTC</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/acting-cftc-chairman-pham-statement-on-court-sanctions-against-cftc-2025514/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/acting-cftc-chairman-pham-statement-on-court-sanctions-against-cftc-2025514/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Commodity Futures Trading Commission Acting Chairman Caroline D. Pham made the following statement regarding the Federal District Court&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/12106/ogc_KazmiReportRecommendationSactions051325/download"><span>report and recommendations</span></a>&nbsp;for sanctions against the CFTC for misconduct in&nbsp;<em>CFTC v. Traders Global Group Inc</em>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Americans rightly demand the highest level of conduct, candor, professionalism, and ethics from the federal government&mdash;especially law enforcement agencies like the CFTC. As described in detail in the Court&rsquo;s report, the CFTC engaged in willful and bad faith conduct by making multiple false statements to the Court and other &lsquo;numerous instances of sanctionable behavior&rsquo; over the course of a year. This is inexcusable. The CFTC must now accept accountability so that appropriate corrective action can finally be taken to address the conduct issues, and the CFTC can put this behind us and move forward to restore the agency&rsquo;s credibility and reputation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This case is a wakeup call to those of us who hold and serve the public&rsquo;s trust. The conduct by CFTC staff and especially CFTC management in this case led to failures that were foreseeable, which means they were also avoidable. I first raised numerous concerns about CFTC conduct in this case nearly two years ago&mdash;even&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement070324b">before</a>&nbsp;the complaint was filed, and again&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement070324b">during</a>&nbsp;the litigation when I reviewed CFTC emails evidencing management efforts to conceal the false statements from the Court. The CFTC not only disregarded my serious concerns and an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.grassley.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/grassley_to_cftc_-_staff_accountability.pdf">oversight letter</a>&nbsp;from a member of Congress, but also engaged in a malicious campaign of retaliation and defamation designed to impugn my character and integrity. It is vindicating that the Court cites my prior statements that raised concerns in this case and my efforts to ensure accountability.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While the Court&rsquo;s findings have shined a bright light on the CFTC&rsquo;s widespread violations of both the duty of candor to the Court and applicable rules of attorney professional conduct, these types of failures are rarely an isolated incident and point to a broader breakdown in the culture of the Division of Enforcement. This case clearly shows that the Division has for far too long maintained a culture that the CFTC is above the law and that breaking the rules is justified because the CFTC is a government agency. This culture is a slippery slope that turns good intentions into bad actions and normalizes wrongdoing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worse, this culture has predictably led to the abuse of the government&rsquo;s prosecutorial power and the violation of a defendant&rsquo;s Constitutional right to due process. I have discovered that for years, many highly respected leaders of the legal profession and former government attorneys have repeatedly raised red flags about CFTC staff conduct in enforcement actions&mdash;even before I raised concerns as a Commissioner. It is therefore unsurprising that the Court finds that &lsquo;[w]ithout the imposition of sanctions, [the CFTC&rsquo;s] conduct appears likely to repeat itself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since I became Acting Chairman, I&rsquo;ve wasted no time in fixing these issues. We&rsquo;ve&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/9044-25">reorganized the CFTC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement</a>, ensuring cases are appropriately assigned based on staff experience and expertise. We&rsquo;ve&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/9054-25">established transparent, public guidelines</a>&nbsp;to encourage greater self-reporting and cooperation in enforcement actions and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opapham13">launched an initiative</a>&nbsp;to reduce a backlog of noncompliance matters, redirecting resources to more serious fraud and manipulation cases. We&rsquo;ve&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/9063-25">adopted a Justice Department policy</a>&nbsp;aimed at ending regulation by prosecution, and took steps to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/9067-25">improve communication and referral procedures</a>&nbsp;between the Division of Enforcement and the CFTC&rsquo;s other operating divisions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I also want to commend our new Director of Enforcement,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/9053-25">Brian Young</a>, for taking immediate and proactive steps to promote an ethical culture and enhance continuing education and training opportunities for our enforcement staff to make sure this conduct never happens again, and the CFTC adheres to the highest standards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are now closing this chapter so we can focus on the future. The CFTC is made up of hundreds of dedicated and talented public servants who routinely demonstrate our value to our markets and American taxpayers. This case does not reflect the CFTC&rsquo;s people, our values, or our critical mission. Trust is earned, and the CFTC remains committed to delivering for the American people.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As an agency, we will take the lessons learned from this case and be better for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Court&rsquo;s report finds that the CFTC&rsquo;s conduct and internal communications &ldquo;. . . implicate involvement of both the CFTC line attorneys and the highest levels of management in the CFTC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement.&rdquo; The Court&rsquo;s report also finds, &ldquo;The CFTC, as one of the primary prudential regulators in the United States, has an obligation to discharge all of its obligations&mdash;statutory, regulatory, and ethical&mdash;faithfully. It also unquestionably has a duty of candor to the Court. However, at almost every stage in this case, the CFTC failed in this regard.&rdquo; While some CFTC staff were removed from the case in 2024 following the filing of the sanctions motion, the CFTC has taken necessary measures to ensure accountability at all levels, including placing staff on administrative leave pending further investigation.</p>
<p><strong>Proactive CFTC Remediation and Reform Efforts</strong></p>
<p>Since being elevated to Acting Chairman in January, Pham has proactively led efforts to overhaul the CFTC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement and reform culture and conduct, develop staff, and leverage expertise and reduce siloing. The establishment of a new task force model allows CFTC attorneys to specialize in categories of cases, thereby enhancing relevant knowledge, practices and mentoring opportunities, and reducing the risk of legal or ethical lapses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Division of Enforcement has also launched a Basic Trial Advocacy Skills training series, with sessions ranging from opening, closing and direct examinations, interactions with jury and opposing counsel, and techniques to avoid creating misimpressions, with more sessions being planned. The sessions offer practical instruction on investigations and litigation as well as opportunities to discuss ethical and discovery dilemmas that can occur in real life litigation scenarios.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Division of Enforcement also delivered various ethics training, including ensuring candor and openness in engagement with defense counsel. It also hosted a training on the American Bar Association&rsquo;s Model Rules of Professional Conduct as applied to government attorneys, with additional trainings being planned.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Vienna Stock Exchange Award 2025: Erste Group Shines With Double Win In ATX And Media Relations Categories</title>

<ul class="list-normal">
<li>Flughafen Wien AG honoured in two categories</li>
<li>Mid Cap Award goes to PORR AG</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="has-image" href="https://www.wienerborse.at/en/vienna-stock-exchange-award-2025/"><img alt="Wiener B&ouml;rse Preis 2025" class="img-float-left" height="154" src="https://www.wienerborse.at/uploads/u/cms/images/teaser/wiener-boerse-preis-2025-s.jpg" title="Wiener B&ouml;rse Preis 2025" width="270" /></a></p>
<p>The Vienna Stock Exchange Award, the most important award in the Austrian capital market, was presented for the 18th time this evening. Eleven leading Austrian companies were honoured with a total of 13 awards at the event held in the elegant setting of Palais Nieder&ouml;sterreich. The selection was made by renowned juries consisting of experts from &Ouml;VFA (ATX, Mid Cap and Corporate Bond Awards), the V&Ouml;NIX Advisory Board (Sustainability Awards) and leading business journalists (Media Relations Awards). The event was once again certified as "&Ouml;koEvent" by the City of Vienna, underscoring its commitment to environmentally responsible event practices.</p>
<p>"Listed companies are constantly in the spotlight &ndash; the Vienna Stock Exchange Award recognises those that outshine even in this already bright arena. Austrian equities impress with reliable dividend yields and deep integration in one of Europe&rsquo;s most dynamic growth regions. This combination of resilience and potential makes them a stronghold in international portfolios," says Christoph Boschan, CEO of the Vienna Stock Exchange.</p>
<h2>Erste Group ahead of DO &amp; CO and BAWAG Group in ATX category</h2>
<p>Erste Group Bank AG received two awards this year. The heavyweight in the Austrian leading index repeated its success from the previous year and was once again crowned with the prestigious ATX Award. The &Ouml;FVA jury's decision was based on another record result in 2024, a balanced business portfolio, financial reporting, performance and liquidity. DO &amp; CO AG came in second place behind Erste Group Bank AG, followed by BAWAG Group AG. Furthermore, Erste Group remains the benchmark for excellence in media relations. Fast response times, professionally prepared materials and the regular publication of studies on current economic and financial topics were key factors in the jury&rsquo;s decision to award the top ranking in this category. Flughafen Wien AG took second place, while VERBUND AG, as in the previous year, ranked third.</p>
<p>"Erste Group's top rankings in the ATX and Media Relations Awards are a valuable confirmation of a successful year 2024. We were able to further expand our leading position in the CEE region, delivered a strong operational and strategic performance and further strengthened investor trust. Our success story is closely linked to our IPO over 25 years ago and the financing opportunities we have utilised via the capital market since then ", says Erste Group CFO Stefan D&ouml;rfler.</p>
<h2>Stock exchange veteran PORR wins for the first time, OMV takes Corporate Bond Award</h2>
<p>PORR AG took the top spot in the Mid Cap category. It was the first top ranking for the construction company, which has been listed in Vienna since 1869 &ndash; making it the oldest continuously listed company. In addition to qualitative criteria &ndash; such as financial reporting, investor relations and strategy &ndash; PORR AG also impressed the jury with its strong stock performance. In 2024, the price increased by almost 40%, placing it among the top 5 performers in the ATX Prime. Addiko Bank AG was the runner-up, followed by Flughafen Wien AG, which took two awards. In the corporate bond category, OMV AG won for the ninth time in the history of the Vienna Stock Exchange Award.</p>
<h2>BKS Bank, Telekom Austria and Lenzing honoured for sustainability</h2>
<p>As part of the Vienna Stock Exchange Awards, the V&Ouml;NIX Sustainability Awards were also presented. Named after the Austrian sustainability benchmark &ndash; the VBV Austrian Sustainability Index (V&Ouml;NIX) &ndash; these awards recognize excellence in sustainable corporate practices. Lenzing AG is an "evergreen" in the truest sense of the word when it comes to this award: The Upper Austrian fibre manufacturer was honoured in the "Industrials" category &ndash; and thus for the seventh time in a total of nine sustainability award ceremonies. As in the previous year, Telekom Austria AG came out on top in the "Consumer" sector, while BKS Bank AG impressed in the "Financials" sector. The V&Ouml;NIX itself has reason to celebrate: Austria&rsquo;s sustainability index marks its 20th anniversary this year. First launched in 2005, V&Ouml;NIX was among the world&rsquo;s pioneering national sustainability benchmarks.</p>

<title>ISDA Annual General Meeting, A Period Of Change: Derivatives In The Pensions Sector, May 13, 2025, Welcoming Remarks, Scott O’Malia, ISDA CEO</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good morning, and welcome to our pre-AGM event on derivatives in the pensions sector. A big thank you to all of today&rsquo;s speakers &ndash; and, of course, to all of you for taking the time to join us.</p>
<p>The title of this event is &lsquo;A Period of Change&rsquo;, which couldn&rsquo;t be more fitting given recent events. So far this year, we&rsquo;ve witnessed some major shifts in the global landscape. Around the world &ndash; and particularly in the US &ndash; we&rsquo;ve seen an acceleration in the shift to protectionism and economic self-sufficiency, with higher tariffs being introduced as a key tool of trade policy.</p>
<p>The impact of those decisions on financial markets has been dramatic. The S&amp;P 500, for instance, fell around 12% in April after sweeping tariffs were announced in the US, only to recover virtually all those losses by the end of the month, following a temporary pause in implementation. US Treasury yields and currency markets have been just as unsettled.</p>
<p>Episodes like this underscore the critical role of derivatives markets. For many pension schemes and other long-term investors, derivatives are crucial tools that allow firms to transfer risk, smooth out the impact of volatility and bring a greater degree of certainty to financial planning. They play a vital role in helping firms stay focused on long-term goals &ndash; even when the world around them is anything but predictable.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, ISDA published a new report that explores how and why different types of firms use derivatives and the value they bring to their business. The findings were clear &ndash; 87% of nearly 1,200 companies in seven major stock indices use derivatives, including pension funds around the world. These funds use derivatives to protect retirement assets from shifts in interest rates, inflation and equity markets and to boost returns, helping to deliver stable, reliable income for future retirees.</p>
<p>At ISDA, supporting the pension sector is an important part of our work to keep markets safe and efficient. Our membership includes some of the largest pension funds globally, and we&rsquo;re actively working to expand our membership within the pensions space even further.</p>
<p>This comes at a time when the pension industry faces some significant regulatory changes. Take the Netherlands, for example. The Dutch pension sector is adapting to new rules that will require them to switch from a defined benefit to defined contribution model by 2028. This could have an impact on how they use swaps in the short, medium and long term &ndash; for instance, as funds decide when and to what extent to hedge coverage ratios ahead of the transition.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Australian superannuation funds are adapting to greater regulatory scrutiny as their investment portfolios grow, along with requirements on operational risk management, governance, reporting and margining &ndash; issues we will explore in a forthcoming ISDA paper.</p>
<p>Regulators and market participants are also continuing to weigh the lessons from the liability-driven investment crisis in the UK in 2022. Back then, extreme volatility in the gilt market forced pension schemes to sell assets to meet margin calls &ndash; ultimately, causing the Bank of England to step in to restore stability.</p>
<p>That event, along with other recent episodes of market stress, has triggered a program of work to enhance resilience in the broader non-bank financial intermediation sector. This includes recommendations by the Financial Stability Board for better liquidity risk management, more effective stress testing and more robust operational processes.</p>
<p>ISDA has actively responded to regulatory consultations on margin practices, always representing the views and needs of our members. We&rsquo;ll continue to work closely with policymakers as they refine their approach in this area.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we&rsquo;ve taken practical steps to improve the margin process. That includes shifting the ISDA Standard Initial Margin Model to semiannual calibration to ensure it remains risk appropriate and any changes happen in a predictable and efficient way.</p>
<p>In addition, we&rsquo;re pushing to make collateral management more automated and less dependent on manual work. This will help firms meet large, sudden margin calls more smoothly during times of market stress. As part of this effort, we&rsquo;ve worked with the industry to develop suggested operational practices and used the Common Domain Model to digitize key documents, standardize collateral terms, and automate calculations and payments for cash collateral.</p>
<p>You can find more information about these initiatives at the ISDA exhibitor stand or on the ISDA website.</p>
<p>Our event today is intended to bring all these various threads together. We&rsquo;re very fortunate to have two speakers from the official sector, who will give perspectives on the current regulatory issues affecting the pensions sector.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll also have a panel featuring senior participants from across the pensions industry, who will discuss how they are looking at the investment environment, as well as the regulatory, geopolitical and market trends affecting their investment decisions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very much looking forward to hearing what they have to say, so let&rsquo;s get started.</p>

<p><strong>St&eacute;phane Boujnah, CEO of Euronext, said:</strong> &ldquo;The acquisition of  Admin control positions Euronext Corporate Solutionspas a leader in the  governance SaaS space and expands our access to new clients in the Nordics where  we have already expanded our presence over the years with promising growth  prospects.

<p>Data governance helps organisations protect and maximise the value of data. It helps solve collective problems, especially in complex institutions. James speaks about three areas: a data strategy to align around priorities; coherent management of data and information; and enabling innovation with AI.

<h2>Speech</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Good afternoon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pleasure to be here today to talk about data governance.</p>
<p>Governance helps tackle collective challenges - that no individual person or team can solve alone.</p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges is alignment. When teams are aligned around common priorities, progress is rapid. When they are not, progress stalls.</p>
<p>Consider investment decisions - data platforms, the care spent organising data, structured training. These are all public goods. And like any public good, they are vulnerable to underinvestment and the tragedy of the commons.</p>
<p>Governance is critical to managing change. Data come with legal and ethical obligations. But how do we meet those standards while remaining open to innovation?</p>
<p>Governance challenges go back centuries. But with vast data networks, distributed decisions, and powerful tools like AI, the stakes have never been higher.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/may/james-benford-speaking-at-the-gartner-data-and-analytics-conference#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Bank of England is no stranger to them. Like many organisations, we are still on a journey to make the best possible use of data.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/may/james-benford-speaking-at-the-gartner-data-and-analytics-conference#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[2]</a></sup>&nbsp;<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/may/james-benford-speaking-at-the-gartner-data-and-analytics-conference#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[3]</a></sup>&nbsp;Today, I would like to explore the contribution that data governance can make across three dimensions.</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Aligning around a cohesive strategy</span>.</li>
<li><span>Guiding consistency in how data are managed</span>.</li>
<li><span>Enabling innovation, in particular the expanding use of artificial intelligence (AI)</span>.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p>We have by no means cracked it at the Bank. But by being open about our challenges and evolving approach, I hope our experience can help others.</p>
<p>Together, they show what governance makes possible: alignment so that we can deliver; investment to build strong foundations; confidence to innovate and grow.</p>
<p>Data governance to set us free.</p>
<h3>The Bank's mission, its people, and the value of data</h3>
<p>Before I get into the challenges, I need to tell you a bit about the Bank.</p>
<p>We ensure monetary stability by setting interest rates to meet our inflation target of 2%. We ensure financial stability by regulating UK banks, building societies, insurers and large investment firms to make sure they are being run in a safe way. We manage risks to stability in the financial system and take action when necessary. We produce and circulate banknotes and oversee the smooth running of payment systems. When necessary, we support the financial system by lending to it. When firms face difficulties, we stand ready to resolve them whilst protecting depositors, taxpayers and the wider economy.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/may/james-benford-speaking-at-the-gartner-data-and-analytics-conference#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[4]</a></sup>&nbsp;<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/may/james-benford-speaking-at-the-gartner-data-and-analytics-conference#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>We rely on high-quality data to underpin the decisions we make.</p>
<p>The Bank is unusual due to the enormous breadth of data we need, to gain granular insights into what is happening in the economy, and wider financial system.</p>
<p>We generate some of this data through our own operations &ndash; running the country&rsquo;s payments system, managing the collateral of loan books that banks bring to us and distributing bank notes. Like all organisations, management information on our people and finances are critical for decision making.</p>
<p>But the majority of the data that we rely on comes from outside the Bank.</p>
<p>We collate and publish over 35,000 monetary and financial statistics, including critical benchmarks like SONIA<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/may/james-benford-speaking-at-the-gartner-data-and-analytics-conference#footnote-7" id="footnote-ref-7"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[6]</a></sup>&nbsp;&ndash; the average interest rate in sterling unsecured money markets. We do that through a system of around 30 data collections from over 2,000 reporters. The business of regulation is very data heavy, with the volume of regulatory data collections around an order of magnitude larger. Our largest dataset, from trade repositories, amounts to 100 million rows of new data every day. We also acquire large volumes of data commercially, or through agreements with the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and government departments.</p>
<p>Our work with data is distributed right across the organisation. We are a range of highly analytical, data-driven people at the Bank. Each of our teams rely on accurate, timely and trustworthy information to make critical decisions.&nbsp;<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/may/james-benford-speaking-at-the-gartner-data-and-analytics-conference#footnote-8" id="footnote-ref-8"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[7]</a></sup>&nbsp;Before ten years ago, we had no central data team. Teams across the Bank looked after their data using largely local systems. Our central data area was set up in 2015 to bring more order to things.</p>
<h3>A data &amp; analytics strategy that is built together, for everyone</h3>
<p>Our first big challenge is how to keep these disparate functions cohesive and coherent in their use of data.</p>
<h4>How do we align everyone around a shared goal &ndash; making the best use of data to fulfil the Bank&rsquo;s mission?</h4>
<p>An internal review in 2023, concluded that though we were making good progress in some areas, we needed a new approach. It set out three key areas for action:</p>
<ol>
<li>Agreeing a clear, shared strategy for data and analytics.</li>
<li>Breaking down institutional, cultural, and technological barriers to connect siloes across the organisation.</li>
<li>Broadening and deepening our investments in people.</li>
</ol>
<p>In response, we set up a Data and Analytics Board at Executive level, with a representative from each area of the Bank, including our enabling functions. It is chaired jointly between our data and technology areas. We worked together to publish a new strategy and 3-year roadmap in July last year.</p>
<ol>
<li>The strategic objectives we are working towards drive three key benefits for the organisation: efficiency, effectiveness and risk reduction. We measure things quantitatively &ndash; the value of time saved &ndash; and qualitatively &ndash; drawing on surveys of user experience and risk reporting.</li>
<li>We have three missions framing the capabilities that we needed to build to get there: making it easy to work with and analyse data; bridge data gaps to increase the value of data we collect and share; enable safe and effective innovation, including AI</li>
<li>And those missions are underpinned by two foundations: a new data platform on the cloud, and data fluency training for all.</li>
</ol>
<p>Our motto is change that is &ldquo;built together, for everyone&rdquo;.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/may/james-benford-speaking-at-the-gartner-data-and-analytics-conference#footnote-9" id="footnote-ref-9"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>We agreed principles<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/may/james-benford-speaking-at-the-gartner-data-and-analytics-conference#footnote-10" id="footnote-ref-10"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[9]</a></sup>&nbsp;to guide a common approach, with colleagues in technology drawing up a consistent target data and technology architecture. We set up a dedicated data portfolio bringing together our major programmes of change into a new Data Transformation Programmes division.</p>
<p>Business-facing programmes are led by local needs but build capabilities the whole organisation can use on a common foundation, our new enterprise data platform on the cloud.</p>
<p>A dedicated data design authority keeps us aligned. We have established a team of data business partners to work with business areas to understand their priorities, and identify challenges and opportunities.</p>
<h4>A little under a year on, what have we achieved?</h4>
<ul>
<li><span>Cloud for data:&nbsp;</span>We have set up a new, secure environment to safely work with data on the cloud. Development areas have been provisioned for our priority programmes and exemplar use cases.</li>
<li><span>Skills and culture:</span>&nbsp;We have designed and launched new data fluency foundation training, aimed at all roles, integrating within graduate and experienced hire inductions, and put in place more in-depth apprenticeship programmes from school leaver to Master&rsquo;s level.</li>
<li><a id="_Hlk197974840"></a><span>Making it easy to work with data:&nbsp;</span>We have taken steps to simplify our governance policies and mapped all our data. That mapping is being used to organise the Bank into domains, which will take ownership of the data they are expert in and make it available to meet the needs of the organisation as a whole. We have an agreed design now for one of our priority applications on our data platform &ndash; an environment for economists to work in, supporting monetary policy. The build of that environment is about to start. It will go live in the middle of next year, and we expect to have migrated key processes - including production of forecasts - by Spring 2027. Broader priorities are being met, with new products ranging from a people insights dashboard to a supervisory dashboard emerging.</li>
<li><span>Closing data gaps, including how we share data externally:&nbsp;</span>We have moved our statistical data onto the cloud and have built a new application to interrogate it. It is already improving the quality of our data. In time it will allow us to realise efficiencies and improve how we make the data available publicly. Our Transforming Data Collection team won an award for work last year to make life easier for reporters by improving the information we make available to them. We are now agreeing with industry how we can best streamline regulatory data collections from banks. More broadly, we have moved to an enterprise model for our commercial acquisitions, unlocking over &pound;1 million of value for us annually, and begun to broaden our connections to administrative data in government.</li>
<li><span>Enabling safe and effective innovation, including AI:</span>&nbsp;We have trialled the use of AI assistants, and had our first roll out with over 1,000 colleagues using general assistants and around 300 using coding assistants. We have also assembled a portfolio of bespoke AI applications, a number of which are now going into production. This work is helping to shape requirements for how we manage unstructured data.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have an agreed model to measure the efficiency benefits on our data programmes and will soon launch a new annual Data &amp; Analytics survey to assess whether the strategy is working for everyone.</p>
<h4>More importantly, what have we learned?</h4>
<p>For me, the single most important factor for success on any given dimension has been strong alignment around clear, resourced priorities. An inclusive and collaborative culture is completely critical for that. Bringing together our big pieces of change into a common portfolio, having the right multi-disciplinary teams and a strong partnership between technology and data have all been critical for cohesion. Building broader partnerships based on mutual trust is being greatly helped by our data business partners. The team has catalysed the setting out of local data strategies in a common language and run vital Data and AI &lsquo;Connect&rsquo; sessions to promote a shared understanding of how these fit with plans in the centre.</p>
<p>Inevitably, no plan survives the test of time. The landscape can change and priorities shift. This is normal and, when it happens, initiatives must stay aligned to strategic outcomes. Managing programmes as a portfolio and being clear on dependencies helps keep decisions coherent, particularly for foundational components. More broadly a clear focus on business outcomes is critical. Yes, there is a need to improve data fluency across organisations, but business fluency in the data teams is just as important.</p>
<h3>Governing data management: Maturing from giving instructions to defining a central service</h3>
<p>Our journey to the cloud is giving us the chance to revisit our approach to data management. It is complex to get right in a federated set up, but core to our first mission to make it easy for everyone to work with data.</p>
<p>Four central teams &ndash; an analytics enablement hub, a data management hub, a data collection hub, and a skills and culture hub &ndash; are critical to the cohesive system we are trying to build.</p>
<h4>Analytics Enablement</h4>
<p>Our Analytics Enablement Hub acts as a one-stop shop for consultancy and advice relating to analytics and visualisation tools in the Bank. It has now partnered on 40 projects with over 30 different teams. These range from automating manual Excel processes to developing new tools using Language Models. It also helps areas understand the analytical underpinning of their core business processes. The hub has also supported teams to set up big data projects on our on-premise data platform. That includes, for example, transaction level data on derivatives and securities financing, loan-level data on mortgage lending, and company-level data on balance sheets and profitability.</p>
<p>As well as maturing our analytical work, the hub itself has improved the quality of the documentation and meta-data around the datasets involved.</p>
<h4>Data Management</h4>
<p>Our Data Management Hub leads the Bank in making our data easy to find and use, by defining what needs to be done, who is responsible, and providing services to support them. The hub also engages with owners of datasets across the Bank, to ensure they are properly documented. Over 2,000 datasets are now registered. This has proved harder to get right, and I will come onto the lessons there in a moment.</p>
<p>It runs the Bank&rsquo;s Reference and Master Data Management (MDM) service, ensuring oversight of our most critical and widely used datasets. The initial customer was our markets and banking area, ensuring we had a single trusted source of the truth on our counterparties, and on data like exchange rates and bond prices - critical for valuing our positions. But since it was set up, we have broadened the service to capture needs across the organisation, further enriching counterparty information and geospatial data, such as enhancing analysis on the impact of flooding on UK firms.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/may/james-benford-speaking-at-the-gartner-data-and-analytics-conference#footnote-11" id="footnote-ref-11"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[10]</a></sup>&nbsp;The team has automated the daily process to measure the value of Sterling relative to our trading partners. We now cover 2.2 million parties with Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs)<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/may/james-benford-speaking-at-the-gartner-data-and-analytics-conference#footnote-12" id="footnote-ref-12"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[11]</a></sup>, including around 400 Firm Reference Numbers and 70,000 Company Registration Numbers. Next month, we will enhance our published authoritative list of the firms the Bank has authorised with LEIs.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk197974862"></a>Looking further ahead, we plan to include all 1,300 PRA-regulated firms and an additional 5 million parties from Companies House. We are also working closely with the ONS to improve access to their business register. Doing so would reduce our costs, improve the quality of - and enhance our understanding of - monetary and economic statistics, thus improving decisions supporting monetary and financial stability.</p>
<p>The hub also engages with owners of datasets across the Bank, to ensure they are properly documented. Over 2,000 datasets are now registered. This has proved harder to get right, and I will come onto the lessons there in a moment.</p>
<h4>Data collection</h4>
<p>Our Data Collection Hub<span>&nbsp;</span>helps teams follow the right processes for acquiring data from outside the Bank or generating it through a new collection. Its purpose is to make sure we bring in data once and well, then make it available strategically to maximise its value to the organisation. When we design a new data collection, we do so with reference to what we have already, seeking to make use of common standards and to avoid duplication across collections. We extended this service last year to the acquisition of commercial data sets. A stronger, enterprise-wide approach here has already generated over &pound;1 million of value annually and we expect that to increase further.</p>
<h4>Skill and culture</h4>
<p>Our<span>&nbsp;</span>Skills and Culture Hub&rsquo;s<span>&nbsp;</span>data fluency initiative empowers everyone to speak a common language when working with data, supporting colleagues to work confidently with data across its lifecycle. It curates a set of self-led online training courses available to all, including a data and AI fluency foundation that is recommended for all. It runs instructor-led sessions in more technical areas like coding. We delivered 1500 training places through our community of data scientists over the past year. Looking ahead, we are looking to build stronger career pathways for those in data roles and build a stronger profession.</p>
<h4>The challenge of managing data collectively</h4>
<p>Overall, the various central functions we have set up are working well. They are maturing in depth and breadth. In some areas - including how we bring data into the building; master and reference data; and curating learning resources - greater central control is demonstrably driving more value. Our central analytics hub has been great at driving value and building skills by spreading best practice.</p>
<p>But there are two areas where we have struggled and have further to go.</p>
<p><span>The first is</span>&nbsp;<span>achieving sufficient consistency in the management of datasets</span>&nbsp;across the Bank, including those that are not managed centrally. It is a classic collective action problem. It benefits everyone to have datasets that are easy to find, understand and relate to each other. But where responsibilities are distributed, that outcome can be harder to achieve.</p>
<p>A second area is managing our data collections across the financial sector. In some ways, that creates a similar collective problem at a different scale. High quality statistics and regulatory data rely on consistent flows of data from over 2,000 reporters in the financial system. Many hands and many machines are involved in that supply chain. The costs involved are substantial.</p>
<p>Across both the core challenge is:&nbsp;<span>How best to manage data collectively to maximise its value?</span></p>
<h4>Defining data management as a federated service</h4>
<p>Internally, an important lesson has been to view data management as a federated service.</p>
<p>This entails a shift from data management being a &lsquo;governance&rsquo; activity &ndash; something people did because we pushed them to do it &ndash; to a service-driven activity &ndash; something people do because they want to.</p>
<p>We worked with our User-Centred Service Design team to agree an underpinning set of principles to get buy-in across the organisation on the purpose of, and facets to, good data management.</p>
<p>The overarching principle is that data are valuable, shared assets. We can maximise value by making data widely available, easy to use and understand, whilst ensuring data are protected and not misused.</p>
<p>Bringing the service to life means getting four things right:</p>
<p><span>First</span>, a proportionate vision for service maturity. All data need to have basic information registered. But where data are widely used or feed into critical processes, it becomes instrumental to dedicate resources to supporting ease of access, use and quality for our users. We are increasingly tending toward managing these assets centrally.</p>
<p><span>Second</span>, the assignment of clear responsibilities across the federation. We are working through which datasets will be managed centrally and which will be managed by teams across the Bank that are expert in them. Importantly, even where data is managed locally, it still needs to take into account the broader needs for it across the Bank.</p>
<p><span>Third,</span>&nbsp;establish and mature support functions in the centre. Federated teams managing their own data draw on the data management hubs &lsquo;registration&rsquo; service to publish their data. Those looking for data draw on its &lsquo;find&rsquo; service.</p>
<p><span>Fourth</span>, establish priorities. We have already identified priorities through our cloud journey and so are focusing on re-defining how our federation works for those customers first. We are also looking at how we tag our documents as we move them to the cloud, with an eye to our AI use cases.</p>
<h4>Resetting our approach to data collections</h4>
<p>Externally, an important feature to our approach is to establish a strong collaboration with industry and partner regulators. We have a joint transformation programme with the Financial Conduct Authority, to exploit synergies and enable a consistent approach. We have an advisory board from industry to oversee what we do, and an Industry Data Standards Committee to make recommendations on reporting standards. Engagement with industry has been critical to our well-received work to improve instructions on statistical returns.</p>
<p>The overall scale of the task is substantial.</p>
<p>A survey we ran last year suggested reporting cost the UK banking system is &pound;1.5-2.0 billion per annum. Our work to reduce those costs is an important contribution to the PRA&rsquo;s secondary competitiveness and growth objective. We will secure quick wins this year by deleting a first swathe of redundant regulatory collections and introducing a new portal to facilitate firms&rsquo; interactions with the PRA, starting with the authorisations process. We will see if there are redundancies in our statistical collections too. At the same time, we will be building a joint vision with the firms that we collect from on how to take further costs out. Alongside dropping collections, this will likely entail work to make instructions clear through integrated data standards and steps to streamline the processes. We are consulting firms, starting with a meeting of Chief Financial Officers next week, on the interventions that will be most impactful for them.</p>
<h3>Governing Artificial Intelligence</h3>
<h4>The opportunities and challenges with the latest wave of AI advancements.</h4>
<p>My last area is Artificial Intelligence.</p>
<p>With the latest wave of advancements, particularly in Generative AI, we&rsquo;re seeing&nbsp;<span>four fundamental shifts&nbsp;</span>that signal not just progress, but a revolution in how we harness data and build solutions. This time it is different.</p>
<p><span>First, there&rsquo;s the enormous step change in the power and complexity.</span></p>
<p>The Bank&rsquo;s core central macroeconomic forecasting model contains 175 parameters. In contrast, the largest AI models count over 405 billion parameters.</p>
<p>These models can adapt to an incredibly broad range of new tasks and power complex applications.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/may/james-benford-speaking-at-the-gartner-data-and-analytics-conference#footnote-13" id="footnote-ref-13"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>But it can be very difficult to understand and explain their inner workings. They risk becoming the ultimate &lsquo;black boxes&rsquo;.</p>
<p><span>Second, all data are now in scope.</span></p>
<p>AI models can process numbers, text, video, sound, and images, often all at once.</p>
<p>Data from our interactions with AI systems can help to shape their future behaviours &ndash; creating an increasingly dynamic, but also increasingly complex, interaction between humans and machines.</p>
<p>This raises issues around acceptable use: whose data are we using and does the use meet legal requirements and ethical standards?</p>
<p><span>Third everyone can use them.</span></p>
<p>AI solutions now supply the capability of interacting in natural language. Everyone can use them. It&rsquo;s why our Governor, Andrew Bailey, described it as having the hallmarks of a general-purpose technology &ndash; the kind of technology that reshapes how we work.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/may/james-benford-speaking-at-the-gartner-data-and-analytics-conference#footnote-14" id="footnote-ref-14"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Wider access brings opportunity &ndash; but also risk. Without clear standards, guidance, or the right skills in place, we risk creating blind spots and unintended consequences.</p>
<p><span>Fourth, everyone can be a builder of AI solutions.</span></p>
<p>People are now also able to use AI to build their own solutions, or agents, tailored to suit their own workflows.</p>
<p>This could change the productivity of transformation work itself: accelerating change, quickly unlocking the automation of workflows. Where we allow agents to take actions on our behalf, we are at least changing the position of humans in the loop. Care is needed to understand the broad systems we are building and ensure we are able to manage them at both an individual and an organisational level.</p>
<h4>What AI is already enabling</h4>
<p>I will touch briefly on how our use of AI is changing. We have found from our roll out of AI assistants, that time savings for the general users are 5-10%. For those who do a lot of work in code, or manage a lot of correspondence, they can be substantially larger.</p>
<p>Writing code with the help of AI is&nbsp;<span>accelerating our transformation efforts</span>. The code that powers our 35,000 statistics has built up over two and a half decades. Each aggregate is a complex system of equations. Moving that onto our new cloud platform would have taken several months of work by hand. With AI generating modern code and testing it has been cut down to days.</p>
<p>We have built quite a few variants of&nbsp;<span>chatbots</span>. We&rsquo;ve fed query correspondence history into AI tools to curate FAQ documents that can then guide suggested answers. And we&rsquo;ve built a tool that will allow everyone in the Bank to query our many corporate policies, lifting the load on our compliance team.</p>
<p>Our most involved and complex applications are trying to put more shape around how we&nbsp;<span>capture, process and store information from unstructured sources</span>.</p>
<p>One application is the conversations we have with firms to monitor the economy, where we are building an application that allows a summary of key themes, and the drilling into what has been said about particular issues, whilst protecting sensitive information.</p>
<p>A second relates to the vast amounts of unstructured data on the firms that we supervise &ndash; their disclosures, analyst reports, their internal board and risk packs &ndash; with a structured workflow using AI to extract summary reports, highlighting areas for deeper investigation.</p>
<p>We are now looking at how we scale innovation with AI to take full advantages of the latest tools on offer.</p>
<p>Which leads us to our third and final challenge:</p>
<p><span>How do we adapt our governance approach to AI, to enable safe and effective innovation?</span></p>
<h4>Emphasising a TRUSTED approach to building AI solutions</h4>
<p>We started by describing seven the principles underpinning our use of AI, to support decision-making at scale &ndash; what it means for AI systems to be TRUSTED:&nbsp;<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/may/james-benford-speaking-at-the-gartner-data-and-analytics-conference#footnote-15" id="footnote-ref-15"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[14]</a></sup></p>
<p><span>T</span>argeted. We must focus tightly defined use cases, tied to our strategy and mission, and generating measurable value.</p>
<p><span>R</span>eliable. We aim for reliable AI systems that perform to a high standard and are grounded in high-quality data. For load bearing applications, we seek to constrain or at least reference model outputs to high quality data that we trust. In some cases, this means using smaller models to do the work.</p>
<p><span>U</span>nderstood. AI systems, and the data that underlie them, need to be transparent and comprehensible. Training is critical.</p>
<p><span>S</span>ecure. We proactively address potential threats, through clear terms of use, robust security measures, and privacy controls.</p>
<p><span>T</span>ested. We conducting robust testing, discuss and document risks, and put mitigants in place.</p>
<p><span>E</span>thical. Now that there are so many more possibilities for leveraging data, the question of what is the right and ethical thing to do is all the more important. Clear frameworks are required here.</p>
<p><span>D</span>urable. We focus on creating sustainable AI systems, where the benefits exceed the costs.</p>
<h4>We are now putting those TRUSTED principles into practice.</h4>
<p>First, we have put in place an&nbsp;<span>Artificial Intelligence Policy</span>&nbsp;to make clear how to use AI responsibly, what to do and who to reach out to for advice. It is there to enable teams to make their own decisions on the use of AI tools, rather than to draw all decisions to a bottleneck in the centre.</p>
<p>Second, we have also drawn up a&nbsp;<span>Data, Analytics and AI Ethics Framework</span>&nbsp;to outline the foundational principles, incorporating ethics, that we have regard to when we work and innovate with data and analytics, including AI. It includes a tool to allow a self-assessment of a use case and guide to escalation.</p>
<p>Third, we are developing an&nbsp;<span>Artificial Intelligence Strategy</span>&nbsp;to guide prioritisation of central support to scale. Our approach prioritises quick routes to efficiency gains and favours blended teams across data, technology and business areas.</p>
<p>Fourth, we have established an&nbsp;<span>Artificial Intelligence and Data Ethics Committee</span>, to govern once and well. This committee meets once a month so we can make progress rapidly. Again, it is jointly between data and technology.</p>
<p>Fifth, we recently launched a Bank-wide&nbsp;<span>Data Fluency Foundation</span>, which includes AI. We are building on this with a curated library of training on AI, a lot of which is freely available, and are setting up knowledge-sharing channels. As we further roll out AI assistants, we are looking at what of our AI training to make mandatory.</p>
<ol>
<li>Our AI policy comprises of five elements.&nbsp;<span>There is a list of approved tools&nbsp;</span>with prescribed uses</li>
<li><span>There are certain tools that are prohibited</span>&nbsp;and certain business activities where we do not use AI.</li>
<li><span>We do not use AI to make decisions</span>.</li>
<li><span>The use of AI in the Bank is guarded by our AI Policy</span>&nbsp;and other existing policies. We also have an&nbsp;<span>AI Ethics Framework</span>&nbsp;which staff can use to judge whether that they are seeking to do is safe. We use this Framework to test out riskier use cases of AI, e.g. when using AI on sensitive data. Innovation through AI needs to be:</li>
</ol> 
<ul>
<li><span>Beneficial and scientifically rigorous</span></li>
<li><span>Fair and inclusive</span></li>
<li><span>Transparent and secure</span></li>
<li><span>Compliant and accountable</span></li>
</ul>
<p>To help colleagues apply these principles, we are giving them a self-assessment tool, to review it from an ethics standpoint.</p>
<ol>
<li><span>We need to accommodate change</span>&hellip; because AI is moving quickly. Tools are coming online now to enable the whole organisation to get involved in the development of AI tools. We are looking at what is sensible here but are taking our time. Scaling citizen development safely and effectively requires clear guardrails, the right operating model between technology, data and the business, as well as a strong focus on training.</li>
</ol>
<p>That may sound like a lot of governance. But this is governance to enable and be deliberate about change. Our experience showed that, without clear direction and guardrails, uncertainty on what is allowed and how to get decisions can stifle innovation.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>To other organisations navigating their data governance journey, I offer three final thoughts:</p>
<p>First, success in any strategy rests as much in&nbsp;<span>culture</span>&nbsp;as it does in content.</p>
<p>Particularly for data, the best chance of success comes through collaboration and inclusion: a&nbsp;<span>data strategy that is built together for everyone</span>. Inclusive decision-making, business partner teams to connect, and an approach that empowers by equipping teams in the business with the access, tools and skills they need are critical ingredients.</p>
<p>I would also advocate for&nbsp;<span>humility</span>. Each of the challenges we've faced on our journey to make the best possible use of data has required us to pause, reframe, and design with the end-user in mind. And whilst we have made meaningful progress, we are still very much on that journey. We won't solve everything in one go. But by staying&nbsp;<span>transparent, engaged externally and open to learning</span>&nbsp;&ndash; we can better prepare for the future, not just react to it.</p>
<p>Finally, I&rsquo;d encourage you to see governance as the&nbsp;<span>lever through which we exercise agency over our collective future</span>. Done right, it holds us together so that we can deliver. It ensures we build systems that serve everyone. It gives us the confidence&mdash;and the courage&mdash;to innovate, to adapt, and to grow. It means the future is not something we await. It&rsquo;s not something that the models have predicted for us. It&rsquo;s something we shape.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why, done right, data governance doesn&rsquo;t hold us back.</p>
<p>It sets us free.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening.</p>

<title>ISDA Extends Digital Regulatory Reporting To Support Revised Canadian Reporting Rules</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-extends-digital-regulatory-reporting-to-support-revised-canadian-reporting-2025513/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-extends-digital-regulatory-reporting-to-support-revised-canadian-reporting-2025513/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ISDA has extended its Digital Regulatory Reporting (DRR) solution to cover new reporting rules in Canada and has made it compatible with a trade reporting messaging format used for North America reporting to maximize the benefit of adoption by those firms subject to the rules.</p>
<p>The revisions are being implemented by the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) and are scheduled for implementation on July 25, 2025. In advance of implementation, ISDA DRR code for the Canadian amendments is now freely available for market participants to review and test, enabling firms to implement changes to regulatory reporting requirements cost-effectively and accurately and reducing the risk of regulatory penalties for misreported data.</p>
<p>As part of the update, the ISDA DRR will enable firms to comply with the new Canadian reporting rules using Harmonized XML, a trade reporting message format developed by The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC). This adds to the message formats supported by the DRR, which currently includes ISO20022, to appeal to the broadest universe of reporting entities. Once the DRR for the CSA rules is fully rolled out, ISDA will extend the use of Harmonized XML for reporting under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission&rsquo;s (CFTC) swap data reporting rules.</p>
<p>The Canadian rules will be the seventh set of reporting requirements available on the ISDA DRR following earlier launches to cover amendments in the US by the CFTC, Japan by the Financial Services Agency, the EU under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), the UK under UK EMIR, Australia by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and Singapore by the Monetary Authority of Singapore. The ISDA DRR will also shortly be extended to cover rule changes in Hong Kong, due to come into effect in September. In total, ISDA has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/07/08/isdas-commitment-on-data-reporting/">pledged to support 11 reporting rule sets in nine major jurisdictions</a>&nbsp;and to maintain the DRR code as those rules evolve in future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The latest extension of the ISDA DRR to cover rule changes by the CSA establishes a best practice for derivatives trade reporting in Canada. This aligns with our work in six other reporting jurisdictions, creating a global digital reporting solution that significantly increases the accuracy of reporting and reduces the potential for regulatory penalties, estimated at over $285 million globally so far,&rdquo; said Scott O&rsquo;Malia, ISDA&rsquo;s Chief Executive.</p>
<p>The ISDA DRR takes as its foundation a common interpretation of each ruleset that has been reviewed and agreed by an industry working group. It uses the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/isda-solutions-infohub/cdm/">Common Domain Model</a>&nbsp;&ndash; an open-source data standard for financial products, trades and lifecycle events &ndash; to convert the industry interpretation into free, machine-executable code. That code can be used as the basis for implementing the rules or to validate that a firm&rsquo;s interpretation is aligned with the industry reading.</p>

<ul>
<li><span>Fincom and Nasdaq Verafin enter global partnership,&nbsp;</span><span>bringing clients holistic sanctions screening and anti-money laundering compliance solutions</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4425840-1&amp;h=1848364917&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Ffincom.co%2F&amp;a=Fincom" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Fincom</a>, a leader in anti-money laundering (AML) Sanction Screening and Entity Resolution technology, today announced the successful completion of its Series B funding round, securing a strategic investment led by&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4425840-1&amp;h=2474442678&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nasdaq.com%2Fnasdaq-ventures&amp;a=Nasdaq+Ventures" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nasdaq Ventures</a>, with participation from&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4425840-1&amp;h=187208238&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macquarie.com%2Fus%2Fen.html&amp;a=Macquarie+Group" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Macquarie Group</a>,&nbsp;<span class="xn-org">G1 Ventures</span>, and existing investors including&nbsp;<span class="xn-org">AnD Ventures</span>&nbsp;and ff Venture Capital. This investment marks a significant milestone in Fincom's growth journey and underscores confidence in its vision and market potential.</p>
<p>Global banks are facing increasing complexity in managing sanctions compliance, with resource constraints, evolving regulatory requirements, and limitations in legacy Sanctions and Watchlist screening solutions that result in high volumes of false positives.&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4425840-1&amp;h=2968376180&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.celent.com%2Finsights%2F445011014&amp;a=According+to+research+by+Celent" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">According to research by Celent</a>, sanctions screening alone makes up 20% of the&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$35 billion</span>&nbsp;spent on Financial Crime &amp; Compliance technology by financial institutions globally. The digitization of financial services has led to faster payments, requiring scalable solutions that handle an increased volume of transactions. Meanwhile today's geopolitical landscape underscores the need for additional data and multilanguage capabilities.</p>
<p>Fincom's unique approach to sanctions screening leverages proprietary computational linguistics, distance-based algorithms, and advanced phonetics that are structure-, language-, and data source-agnostic. This innovative approach enables Fincom to more seamlessly compare and match written text in multiple languages and sources, delivering greater accuracy and efficiency in alerts all while consistently driving over 80% operational cost savings for its clients. Today, dozens of&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">U.S.</span>&nbsp;banks leverage Fincom's AML compliance solutions to mitigate sanctions risk and ensure regulatory compliance.</p>
<p><span><span class="xn-person">Gideon Drori</span>, Founder and CEO of Fincom</span>, said "This investment is a testament to the hard work and achievements of our team, our customers' confidence in our solutions, and the trust our investors have in our vision. We are excited to take the next step in enhancing the AML compliance space, making a substantial positive impact and delivering significant value to our current and future customers."</p>
<p>In addition to joining the&nbsp;<span class="xn-org">Nasdaq Ventures</span>&nbsp;portfolio, Fincom will enter a global partnership with Nasdaq Verafin, Nasdaq's financial crime management technology business. A trusted partner to more than 2,600 financial institutions, Nasdaq Verafin has delivered industry-leading solutions and innovative data approaches to address the complex needs of banks' anti-financial crime programs for more than two decades. Through this partnership, financial institution clients of Nasdaq Verafin and Fincom will benefit from advanced Sanctions Screening capabilities, leading to increased efficiency, reduced costs, better compliance, and improved customer engagement through innovative technology.</p>
<p>"Fincom brings a wholly unique and innovative approach to sanctions screening that delivers faster, more accurate results when compared to legacy approaches, simplifying the increasingly complex world of AML compliance and enabling improved regulatory adherence," said&nbsp;<span><span class="xn-person">Gary Offner</span>, Senior Vice President, Head of&nbsp;<span class="xn-org">Nasdaq Ventures</span>&nbsp;at Nasdaq</span>. "We are pleased to welcome Fincom to the&nbsp;<span class="xn-org">Nasdaq Ventures</span>&nbsp;portfolio. With the launch of our new partnership between Nasdaq Verafin and Fincom, we have an opportunity to build upon the natural synergies between our two platforms, leveraging state-of-the-art technologies to help our clients better identify and address instances of potential financial crime."</p>
<p><span><span class="xn-person">Gary Munitz</span>,&nbsp;<span class="xn-org">Global Co-Head Macquarie Capital Venture Capital</span></span>, said "Fincom's AML solutions deliver exceptional value, as evidenced by the company's extraordinary growth and stellar client retention. We are excited to partner with Fincom's founders and employees to accelerate their strategy of replacing legacy providers and manual processes with cloud-based, market-proven AML solutions."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Fincom announced the expansion of its&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">U.S.</span>&nbsp;team to support the growing North American market. Proceeds from the Series B financing will support Fincom's efforts to accelerate its international growth and launch new offerings, including screening for Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) and adverse media, as well as Verification of Payee (VOP) services.</p>

<title>Tokenization Of Real-World Assets, SEC Commissioner Mark T. Uyeda, Washington D.C., May 12, 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/tokenization-of-real-world-assets-sec-commissioner-mark-t-uyeda-washington-d-2025513/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/tokenization-of-real-world-assets-sec-commissioner-mark-t-uyeda-washington-d-2025513/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good afternoon and thank you to the panelists and attendees participating in the Commission&rsquo;s roundtable on tokenization. &nbsp;I appreciate your willingness to engage and share your thoughts with us.</p>
<p><span>Innovative Technologies Benefit from Regulatory Transparency</span></p>
<p>Technology has played an important role in the history of financial regulation and tokenization is no different.&nbsp; These roundtables serve as an opportunity for financial regulators to seek public input on how to address new types of financial products and services.&nbsp; We should not shy away from policymaking about emerging technologies, simply because it does not fit into the existing regulatory framework.&nbsp; The first step in sound policymaking is seeking input from market participants.&nbsp; In recent history, we seem to have forgotten a very fundamental concept: that investors and issuers have valuable observations and experiences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given that we are in a &ldquo;full disclosure business,&rdquo; I am pleased with the Commission&rsquo;s new crypto approach under the leadership of Commissioner Hester Peirce and the Crypto Task Force.&nbsp; Whether the issues relate to bringing real-world assets onchain or considering custodial issues like we did at our last roundtable, we should promote a transparent regulatory environment.&nbsp; Market participants should not be left guessing as to how they can comply with the Commission rulebook.&nbsp; These roundtable conversations are a useful step in obtaining this information &ndash; with a view to constructing a regulatory framework that provides transparency and predictability for market participants that seek to bring assets onchain.</p>
<p><span>Potential Impacts to Key Market Processes</span></p>
<p>These conversations are particularly important given the development and deployment of new technologies, which have the potential to dramatically change how financial markets operate.&nbsp; In particular, the developments related to the tokenization of real-world assets using blockchain technology implicate major financial market functions and processes like issuance, trading, transfer, settlement, and record of ownership.&nbsp; In addition to these potential market improvements, tokenization presents opportunities to expand the landscape to demonstrate proof of ownership&ndash; making possible new types of uses, such as tokens that represent title to real estate or holdings of intellectual property rights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These implications can potentially benefit investors by enhancing liquidity for otherwise relatively illiquid assets, reducing delays associated with intermediation, and also decreasing transactional costs.&nbsp; Additionally, the technology has the potential to simplify &ndash; or at least streamline &ndash; certain compliance functions, such as through smart contracts for onchain assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These potential improvements in capital markets are tied to key characteristics of blockchain technology.&nbsp; Blockchain technology relies on a transparent ledger and does not require a central intermediary.&nbsp; Market transparency impacts transactional costs, but also implicates potential compliance costs &ndash; as more opaque and complex markets may increase compliance costs.&nbsp; For example, there are many challenging regulatory questions that the Commission and its staff may need to resolve under the regime established by Regulation NMS as securities move onchain. As such, we should evaluate whether these technologies can benefit all market participants.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Constructing a Crypto Rulebook</span></p>
<p>In the mid-1980s, then-Commissioner Joseph Grundfest described the rapid pace of technological innovation as &ldquo;[t]he New Technology of Finance and the Old Technology of Regulation.&rdquo; &nbsp;He identified a disconnect between regulatory tools developed in the 1930&rsquo;s with the technological developments of the 1980&rsquo;s &ndash; noting that &ldquo;just as the perfect technology has never been invented, the perfect regulation also has never been written.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-crypto-roundtable-tokenization-051225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp; As we consider the implications of new technologies, we should design a framework that focuses on critical safeguards rather than trying to address every conceivable investment permutation and scenario.&nbsp; This exercise is nothing new and the same principles that helped regulation move from paper certificates to electronic recordkeeping and from faxes to texts can similarly guide us to accommodate new technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thank you all for your participation and attendance and look forward to the Commission considering next steps.</p>

<div dir="ltr">
<p>The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Entrepreneurship Development in Communications, Innovation and Digital Economy, Ms. Chalya Shagaya, paid a courtesy visit to the headquarters of Legend Internet Plc to commend the company&rsquo;s recent milestone achievement.</p>
<p>During the visit, Ms. Shagaya congratulated Mr. Bruce Ayonote and the Legend team on the successful listing of two billion shares on the Nigerian Exchange, a bold step that has boosted the Exchange&rsquo;s market capitalisation by N12.4 billion. She noted that this historic listing, being the first by an indefinite telecom operator in Nigeria, reflects strong investor confidence in Nigeria&rsquo;s digital economy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The listing of Legend Internet Plc is not just a corporate achievement, it is a national win,&rdquo; Ms. Shagaya remarked. &ldquo;It sends a powerful message to indigenous digital and tech companies that the capital markets are within reach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ms. Shagaya further highlighted the alignment of this success with the Renewed Hope Agenda of His Excellency President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, emphasizing the administration&rsquo;s dedication to building a business-friendly environment driven by digital transformation and inclusive economic growth.</p>
<p>She also commended the company on its inclusivity efforts, noting that the majority of Legend&rsquo;s executive and senior staff are women. She described this as a progressive example of gender representation in leadership, which aligns with national goals for women&rsquo;s inclusion in economic development.</p>
<p>The Office of the Senior Special Assistant to the President expressed readiness to support Legend and its affiliate company Suburban in future initiatives. Areas of potential collaboration discussed include expansion of digital infrastructure, innovation policy development, and capacity building programs for entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Ms. Shagaya also stressed the ripple effect such achievements can have on the broader ecosystem, from enhancing local content development and broadband access to creating jobs and fostering innovation. She encouraged Legend to further engage in mentorship, tech training, and entrepreneurship support initiatives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Legend&rsquo;s story is one of vision, resilience, leadership, and inclusivity,&rdquo; she concluded. &ldquo;It is the kind of story this administration is proud to champion and we look forward to partnering with more companies that are pushing the boundaries of what is possible.&rdquo;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Trading Technologies International, Inc. (TT), a global capital markets technology platform services provider, today announced the broad introduction of its TT Strategy Studio multi-asset algorithmic trading offering for institutional trading firms, including the largest and most sophisticated professional trading organizations, quantitative firms, energy companies and hedge funds. The company made the announcement coinciding with TradeTech Europe 2025, the buy-side equity trading conference in&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Paris</span>.</p>
<p>A featured offering of TT Quantitative Trading Solutions (QTS), TT Strategy Studio provides a framework for developing, testing and deploying complex multi-asset automated trading strategies while keeping a firm's intellectual property within its own control.</p>
<p><span class="xn-person">Joe Signorelli</span>, TT's EVP Managing Director, QTS, said: "TT Strategy Studio is a powerful, commercial-grade offering that can save the largest, most sophisticated firms hundreds of developer hours. It enables them to build alpha with access to full tick-by-tick backtesting with complete depth of market, live simulation through a built-in simulator and production trading for the most complex automated trading strategies on the market. They can leverage our hosted ultra-low-latency infrastructure, easy-to-use interface and advanced tools to create, hone and execute their unique trading strategies at a substantial cost savings, while protecting their proprietary code &ndash; the intellectual property that is most treasured by trading firms."</p>
<p>TT Strategy Studio ingests market and execution venue data from leading providers in equities, options, futures and foreign exchange markets. The software allows firms to access market data from TT or third-party vendors, execution venues, banks and clearing firms and connect to 70 marketplaces across the globe. Because TT is already certified by all of these exchanges, TT ensures that trading strategies created using TT Strategy Studio follow applicable exchange rules and regulations in various jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Signorelli said the software offers a wide range of valuable tools firms need while keeping their proprietary code as a separate component that can leverage TT Strategy Studio from within their own server. Users can integrate historical data for running their strategies for historic full-depth backtesting and can compare backtesting to simulation to live trading. The customizable strategy parameters, commands and visualization tools give clients the ability to trade multiple asset classes through a single strategy and provide access to various parties within the organization who may use it to trade, monitor performance in real time or ensure the strategy is meeting any regulatory obligations. The software can run all risk/reward ratios and millions of iterations on a strategy through its high-performance calculations. The user can route to a third-party smart order router (SOR) or build an SOR inside of the software.</p>
<p>TT QTS staff also utilizes TT Strategy Studio to develop, test and deploy the business line's own award-winning execution algorithms and confirm to clients how well they work through its results tracking feature. The team is available to help clients build trading strategies, analytical tools and other utilities.</p>

<title>New WFE Research Discovers Climate Risk Premium In Commodity Options</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-wfe-research-discovers-climate-risk-premium-in-commodity-options-2025513/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-wfe-research-discovers-climate-risk-premium-in-commodity-options-2025513/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The World Federation of Exchanges&rsquo; (WFE) new research finds that climate risks are positively priced into commodity options - meaning investors are rewarded for the climate-related risk they bear in holding these assets.</span><br /><br /><span>The research also highlights a relationship between climate policy uncertainty and climate risk premiums: moderate levels of policy uncertainty increase climate risk premiums by unsettling market expectations, while extreme uncertainty, beyond a certain level, reduces climate risks premiums as traders and producers adopt a &ldquo;wait and see&rdquo; strategy.</span><br /><br /><span>The paper, &ldquo;Climate Risk Premium: Evidence from Commodity Options&rdquo;, authored by Kaitao Lin, Xin Gao, Bingxin Li, and Rui Liu, is the first to document and quantify the existence of a climate risk premium using commodity options.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>The WFE&rsquo;s research analysed a proprietary dataset featuring two iron ore option contracts: one classified as &ldquo;brown&rdquo; and the other as &ldquo;green&rdquo;, but both traded on the Singapore Exchange (SGX). Using an innovative two-stage differencing methodology to isolate the climate risk premium without relying on subjective ESG ratings or event studies, the research was able to compare risk premiums between two nearly identical option contracts which differed only in their environmental impact.</span><br /><br /><span>The paper&rsquo;s findings carry critical implications for investors, government, climate professionals and policymakers. By demonstrating climate-focused commodity option derivatives as a useful tool for managing exposure to climate risk, the research proves that transparent and predictable climate policies can stabilise markets and reduce uncertainty.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><strong>Nandini Sukumar, CEO of the WFE</strong><span>, said, &ldquo;Climate policy uncertainty affects risk premiums. Our findings show that clearer and more predictable policy guidelines can help stabilise markets. Such transparency and consistency in environmental regulations can reduce uncertainty, facilitate more efficient climate risk pricing, and encourage greater investment in sustainable assets, thereby contributing to broader climate-change mitigation objectives.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><strong>Dr Pedro Gurrola-Perez, Head of Research at the WFE</strong><span>, said, &ldquo;Looking at commodity derivatives is particularly interesting as some of these financial instruments are directly tied to products with diverse environmental impact. WFE Research looks forward to studying key areas in market design and infrastructure as the world seeks to limit, mitigate and reverse the impact of climate change.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>Read the full paper&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://world-exchanges.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=48ddcbc11eb58f141a51219ea&amp;id=9f093bd6e9&amp;e=979576350c" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a><span>.</span></p>

</ul>
<p>LSEG today announces that LCH SA has launched its new LCH DigitalAssetClear service. LCH DigitalAssetClear will provide market participants with access to the clearing of digital asset derivatives traded on GFO-X, the UK&rsquo;s first FCA-regulated, centrally-cleared multilateral trading facility (MTF) dedicated to digital asset futures and options. The launch of the service illustrates LCH SA&rsquo;s diversification into new asset classes and demonstrates the continued expansion of LSEG&rsquo;s post trade ecosystem.

<p>LCH DigitalAssetClear has been developed by LCH SA, in close consultation with GFO-X and market participants, to ensure their digital asset derivatives can be cleared through a service that is secure, segregated, highly regulated and focused solely on digital asset derivatives. All cash-settled Bitcoin index futures and options contracts traded on GFO-X will be cleared through LCH DigitalAssetClear using the GFO-X/Coin Metrics Single Asset Real-Time Bitcoin Index (GFOXBR), which is an EU Benchmark Regulation compliant reference rate for the U.S. dollar price of Bitcoin.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) and Nasdaq (Nasdaq: NDAQ) today announced an expanded strategic technology partnership aimed at modernizing Thailand&rsquo;s capital markets. The collaboration focuses on strengthening market resilience and integrity while aligning with global standards and leveraging Nasdaq&rsquo;s AI capabilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img alt="SET_Nasdaq" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/SET_Nasdaq.jpg" title="SET_Nasdaq" /></p>
<p>SET will promote the adoption of Nasdaq&rsquo;s risk and surveillance platforms within its member community to help drive consistent infrastructure across its market ecosystem. The initiative builds on SET&rsquo;s own deployment of Nasdaq&rsquo;s advanced surveillance and risk technology with the goal of enhancing systemwide efficiency, transparency, and risk management. SET seeks to benefit from the community-wide benefits of common market infrastructure as well as Nasdaq&rsquo;s ongoing investment to modernize, standardize, and strengthen its platform capabilities, application architecture, APIs, AI integration, and product development.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Stock Exchange of Thailand plays a vital role supporting sustainable growth and attracting capital investment in Thailand and the broader Southeast Asia region,&rdquo; said <b>Tal Cohen, President of Nasdaq.</b> &ldquo;Our expanded technology partnership with SET supports their continued modernization journey to enhance the liquidity, transparency and integrity of their market, thereby fostering trust and investor confidence in the financial ecosystem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Resilience and integrity are essential to vibrant capital markets, attracting international investment,&rdquo; said <b>Asadej Kongsiri, President of the Stock Exchange of Thailand</b>. &ldquo;By adopting Nasdaq&rsquo;s advanced risk and surveillance solutions and promoting them across our member community, we&rsquo;re strengthening the foundation for prudent risk management, capital efficiency, and investor trust. This integrated approach enhances our ability to detect market abuse, monitor high-frequency trading and short-selling activities, and reinforce Thailand&rsquo;s leadership position in ASEAN&rsquo;s capital markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Around the world, Nasdaq&rsquo;s technology is used by 97% of global systematically important banks, half of the world&rsquo;s top 25 stock exchanges, 35 central banks and regulatory authorities, and 3,800+ clients across the financial services industry. As a scaled platform partner, Nasdaq draws on deep industry experience, technology expertise, and cloud managed service experience to help financial services companies solve their toughest operational challenges while advancing industrywide modernization.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our relentless focus on R&amp;D reinforces our ability to elevate tech modernization across global capital markets,&rdquo; said <b>Magnus Haglind, Head of Marketplace Technology at Nasdaq</b>. &ldquo;This expanded partnership reflects our ability to establish deep strategic relationships across an extensive suite of mission-critical solutions and we&rsquo;re excited to work with SET to strengthen the resilience and integrity of Thailand&rsquo;s capital market ecosystem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>SET and Nasdaq will also work together to innovate and unlock new opportunities to serve clients across the region, drawing on SET&rsquo;s deep market expertise, proven client-centric solutions, and strong technical capabilities&mdash;further reinforcing the companies&rsquo; deep technology partnership.</p>
<p>Together, SET and Nasdaq are laying the foundation for a robust, future-ready capital market ecosystem to further enhance Thailand&rsquo;s position as a regional innovation leader and financial hub.</p>

<title>Tokenization: Our Field Of Dreams? Remarks At The Crypto Task Force Roundtable On Tokenization, CFTC Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw, Washington D.C., May 12, 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/tokenization-our-field-of-dreams-remarks-at-the-crypto-task-force-roundtable-o-2025512/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/tokenization-our-field-of-dreams-remarks-at-the-crypto-task-force-roundtable-o-2025512/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today&rsquo;s topic is very broad, perhaps the broadest tackled so far in these Crypto Task Force roundtables: tokenization. I understand that much of the discussion will focus on potential regulatory efforts to&nbsp;<i>facilitate</i>&nbsp;tokenization.</p>
<p>This idea brings to mind a famous line from the movie&nbsp;<i>Field of Dreams</i>&nbsp;&ndash; &ldquo;if you build it, they will come.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-crypto-roundtable-tokenization-051225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;As you may remember, this is a movie starring Kevin Costner as Ray Kinsella, a farmer who is inspired by a mysterious voice to plow under his corn field and build a baseball diamond, taking it on faith that great things will follow.</p>
<p>I see a parallel to the current enthusiasm around tokenization. Blockchain technology has been around for a long time.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-crypto-roundtable-tokenization-051225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;And, although a number of limited use cases have recently been introduced,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-crypto-roundtable-tokenization-051225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;it has not been widely adopted for issuance and trading of registered securities. There is an argument that if we &ldquo;build&rdquo; &ndash; or more accurately, &ldquo;rebuild&rdquo; &ndash; the financial system to accommodate blockchain, &ldquo;they&rdquo; &ndash; all manner of market participants &ndash; &ldquo;will come&rdquo; to embrace tokenized securities. Investors will benefit from increased participation and choice, and markets will flourish from blockchain-derived improvements.</p>
<p>To this, I would first ask, what exactly are we trying to build? What is tokenization? It is a term that, even limited to the SEC space, eludes a straightforward definition. Does tokenization mean issuing a security directly on a blockchain? Or does it refer to creating a&nbsp;<i>digital representation</i>&nbsp;of a security on a blockchain? This may seem a subtle distinction, but it likely carries significant consequences from a regulatory perspective. Beyond issuance, does or should tokenization encompass downstream distribution, trading, clearing and settlement? In other words, would the entire securities lifecycle move &ldquo;on-chain,&rdquo; or only a part of it?</p>
<p>However we might try to answer these definitional questions, it&rsquo;s clear that a tokenized financial system is unlike anything we&rsquo;ve seen before. It&rsquo;s not something known and understood like the baseball field Ray Kinsella built. The vision many espouse seems to be a fully tokenized system, where any security, including high-volume liquid products like Fortune 500 stocks, can be issued, traded, cleared and settled on the blockchain.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is that even technologically possible? If we are talking about public permissionless blockchains, the answer at least as we sit here today seems to be no. The transaction volume limitations and other scalability problems are well understood.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-crypto-roundtable-tokenization-051225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;The whole concept of public permissionless blockchains &ndash; which were designed to provide trust&nbsp;<i>without</i>&nbsp;the need for government oversight<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-crypto-roundtable-tokenization-051225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;&ndash; seems an awkward vehicle for something as complex and statutorily regulated as the securities markets.</li>
<li>If we are talking about private or permissioned blockchains, does that improve the potential for scalability? Even if it does, is this qualitatively different from other types of database technologies already in widespread use?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-crypto-roundtable-tokenization-051225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;Does it warrant any regulatory adjustments at all?</li>
<li>No one seems to disagree that the SEC should remain a &ldquo;tech neutral&rdquo; regulator. So why is it our place to assess particular forms of blockchain as candidates for industry adoption? Why would we focus on blockchain in particular over other types of distributed ledger technologies? Regulatory efforts to facilitate adoption of blockchain, let alone specific forms of it, seem like the government picking winners and losers. And we seem to be doing so before the technology has even been demonstrated as fit for purpose.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moving on from the questions around&nbsp;<i>what</i>&nbsp;we are trying to build,&nbsp;<i>why</i>&nbsp;are we trying to build it? Proponents argue tokenization can speed up the settlement of trades and make markets more efficient. Instead of our current settlement cycle of T+1, tokenization could potentially move us to instant settlement or &ldquo;T+0.&rdquo; There is also an argument that instant settlement could reduce counterparty risks because trades would be pre-funded. But the settlement cycle, while shorter than it used to be, is a design feature, not a bug. The intentional delay built in between trade execution and settlement provides for core market functionalities and protection mechanisms.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, the settlement cycle facilitates netting. Roughly speaking, netting allows counterparties to settle a day&rsquo;s worth of trades on a net basis rather than trade-by-trade. The sophisticated, multilateral netting that occurs in our national clearance and settlement system drastically reduces the volume of trades requiring final settlement. On average, 98% of trade obligations are eliminated through netting.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-crypto-roundtable-tokenization-051225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;This allows the current system to handle tremendous volume. It&rsquo;s a key reason why our markets withstood sustained, record-breaking trade volume in recent weeks without major failures.</li>
<li>Netting also facilitates liquidity. Because the vast majority of trades are &ldquo;netted&rdquo; and don&rsquo;t require settlement, they don&rsquo;t require an exchange of money.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-crypto-roundtable-tokenization-051225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;If A sells to B, B sells to C, and C sells to A, these trades are paired off and eliminated. A, B, and C can each retain their capital, as compared to a bilateral instant settlement over a blockchain, where each would have given up its cash for at least some period of time.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-crypto-roundtable-tokenization-051225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></li>
<li>Another important consideration is that instant settlement would generally disfavor retail investors, many of whom currently rely on the ability to submit payment after placing orders.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-crypto-roundtable-tokenization-051225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></li>
<li>We must also remember that critical compliance activities take place during the settlement cycle. These include checks designed to identify and prevent fraud and cybercrime.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-crypto-roundtable-tokenization-051225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;When red flags go up, the ability to pause a transaction and investigate is essential for investor protection and broader concerns like national security and counterterrorism.</li>
</ul>
<p>For these and other reasons, it is not at all clear that shortening the existing settlement cycle is desirable or feasible.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-crypto-roundtable-tokenization-051225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;Regulators and major market participants, here and abroad, have persuasively argued otherwise.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-crypto-roundtable-tokenization-051225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p>I think it is our statutory obligation as a regulator to exercise extreme caution with potential changes of this scale, which historically have been undertaken only to address true market crises. While there are certainly areas to improve in our markets, I am interested in whether the changes discussed today would fix any specific existing dysfunction. In Field of Dreams, putting faith in &ldquo;if you build it, they will come&rdquo; worked out pretty well in the end for Ray Kinsella. But Ray was making a choice, and taking a risk, limited to his family and his farm. The SEC is the steward of the U.S. capital markets, and the kinds of systemic changes we are talking about have the potential to affect every market participant from Wall Street to Main Street.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s ensure that what we&rsquo;re contemplating is appropriately scoped to the portion of the market that participates in crypto &ndash; recently estimated to be less than 5% of U.S. households<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-crypto-roundtable-tokenization-051225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;&ndash; and not detrimental to the &ldquo;TradFi&rdquo; markets on which most Americans depend for their financial well-being.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-crypto-roundtable-tokenization-051225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></p>
<p>Thank you all for your ongoing engagement with the Commission on these important issues. I look forward to today&rsquo;s discussions.</p>

<title>Getting Smart – Tokenization And The Creation Of Networks For Smart Assets: Opening Remarks For Tokenization Roundtable, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, Washington D.C., May 12, 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Chairman Atkins, Commissioner Uyeda, and Commissioner Crenshaw, and thank you all for joining us in person or online for the Crypto Task Force&rsquo;s fourth roundtable. Thank you especially to our moderators, Jeff Dinwoodie and Tiffany Smith, and today&rsquo;s panelists for helping us to get smart on tokenization.</p>
<p>Tokenization is rooted in the internet, which revolutionized our lives by enabling the creation of a range of networks. At the base of these networks are software protocols&mdash;a set of rules defining how computers and other devices communicate with each other. Protocols built on top of TCP/IP<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-crypto-roundtable-tokenization-051225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&mdash;the protocol that governs the internet&mdash;enable applications that facilitate communication and easy access to information.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-crypto-roundtable-tokenization-051225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Blockchain and other distributed ledger technology protocols are new internet-based protocols enabling the creation of new global networks, this time to facilitate the seamless transfer of assets and related data. These protocols commonly rely on cryptography for their operation and security. Novel crypto assets that would not exist but for the underlying protocols live on these networks. So do traditional assets when they get tokenized. Tokenization fits squarely within the Commission&rsquo;s jurisdiction because it involves formatting traditional financial assets, like stocks and bonds, as crypto assets (or &ldquo;tokens&rdquo;) on a crypto network. Much as earlier internet-based protocols dramatically enhanced our lives by making it easier to communicate and access information, these cryptographic protocols have the potential to improve our lives through enhanced accessibility and efficiency of the markets for traditional financial assets.</p>
<p>Your &ldquo;smartphone&rdquo; makes you smarter and more efficient by serving as a portal to the internet and its networks of applications. Similarly, tokenizing traditional assets and putting them on crypto networks makes them smarter. Crypto networks are not only a new type of database or ledger for recording ownership of assets, but also a new type of computing platform that can support applications that allow you to do more with your assets. Smart contracts are self-executing software programs that define important properties of assets and applications running on crypto networks and serve as a portal to the networks of applications supported by these new internet-based protocols. A smart contract can define how and when securities may be purchased, sold, and transferred, as well as automate dividend and interest payments or other distributions. Further, because of the common protocols used to program these smart contracts and the related assets and applications, investors can use tokenized securities seamlessly on or within other smart contract-based applications, including DeFi applications.</p>
<p>Removing securities from siloed databases and tokenizing them on open, composable crypto networks mobilizes them and makes them usable in new and enhanced ways. Stablecoins, the first application of tokenization to achieve scale, demonstrate the efficiency and accessibility improvements that may arise from the use of crypto networks. Tokenization may provide similar benefits to the securities markets, such as increased operational efficiency, transactional transparency, liquidity, and accessibility; faster settlement; and greater investor opportunity. Several tokenized money market products are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, and tokenized private funds similarly issue securities designed to maintain a stable value and provide yield. Using crypto networks to maintain the record of ownership enables the securities to be used as collateral in derivatives transactions, rather than requiring investors to redeem the securities and then post cash as collateral. Tokenized securities also may serve as a means of settlement in the purchase and sale of other crypto assets, including other tokenized securities, in peer-to-peer or other types of onchain transactions. If these assets live on the same network, near-instant and simultaneous settlement is possible.</p>
<p>Tokenization cannot reach its full potential without legal clarity. Issuers and transfer agents continue to be unsure about whether a crypto network can be the master securityholder file or a component thereof for purposes of the Exchange Act&rsquo;s transfer agent rules, even where the relevant state law expressly contemplates the use of a crypto network in connection with the maintenance of the securities ownership record. Further, the Commission&rsquo;s Special Purpose Broker-Dealer statement, which defines &ldquo;crypto asset security&rdquo; to encompass any security that relies on cryptographic protocols, has created confusion regarding a broker-dealer&rsquo;s ability to custody tokenized traditional securities, even when issuers and transfer agents retain control and can address erroneous or impermissible transactions. The Commission proposed to amend the Advisers Act custody rule to preclude traditional securities that are issued on a public, permissionless crypto network from eligibility for an exception from the qualified custodian requirement.</p>
<p>We are working on providing legal clarity to these and other questions in a sensible manner. Absent a compelling reason grounded in fact and law, the Commission should treat tokenized securities the same as traditionally issued securities. Under this approach, for example, the type of database used to record ownership of securities does not affect the substance of the securities issued, nor does the use of a crypto network give rise to a new or different type of security. A crypto network can constitute all or part of the issuer&rsquo;s books maintained by its transfer agent. Tokenized mutual fund shares and tokenized privately issued securities should be eligible for the exceptions for such securities from the Advisers Act qualified custodian requirement. Tokenization may raise some legal challenges related, for example, to the integration with DeFi, application of the transfer agent rules and National Market System requirements, use of permissionless networks, and appropriate classification as certificated versus uncertificated securities. We can work through these and other issues with the expert help of today&rsquo;s panelists and other interested members of the public. I look forward to the upcoming panels.</p>

<title>Keynote Address At The Crypto Task Force Roundtable On Tokenization, Paul S. Atkins, SEC Chairman, Washington D.C., May 12, 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you and good afternoon. I am delighted to speak to this distinguished group at today&rsquo;s roundtable on tokenization.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-remarks-crypto-roundtable-tokenization-051225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Thank you to the panelists for participating today.</p>
<p>The topic of this afternoon&rsquo;s discussion is timely as securities are increasingly migrating from traditional (or &ldquo;off-chain&rdquo;) databases to blockchain-based (or &ldquo;on-chain&rdquo;) ledger systems.</p>
<p>This movement of securities from off-chain to on-chain systems is akin to the transition of audio recordings from analog vinyl records to cassette tapes to digital software decades ago. The ability to easily encode audio in a digital file format, which could readily be transferred, modified, and stored, unlocked tremendous innovation within the music industry.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-remarks-crypto-roundtable-tokenization-051225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Audio was freed from its boundaries as a static, fixed-format creation. It suddenly was compatible and interoperable across a wide range of devices and applications. It could be combined, broken apart, and programmed to form entirely new products. This also led to the development of novel hardware devices and streaming content business models, greatly benefiting consumers and the American economy.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-remarks-crypto-roundtable-tokenization-051225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Just as the shift to digital audio revolutionized the music industry, the migration to on-chain securities has the potential to remodel aspects of the securities market by enabling entirely new methods of issuing, trading, owning, and using securities. For example, on-chain securities can utilize smart contracts to transparently distribute dividends to shareholders on a regular cadence. Tokenization can also enhance capital formation by transforming relatively illiquid assets into liquid investment opportunities. Blockchain technology holds the promise to allow for a broad swath of novel use cases for securities, fostering new kinds of market activities that many of the Commission&rsquo;s legacy rules and regulations do not contemplate today.</p>
<p>In order for the United States to be the &ldquo;crypto capital of the planet&rdquo; as envisioned by President Trump,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-remarks-crypto-roundtable-tokenization-051225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;the Commission must keep pace with innovation and consider whether regulatory changes are needed to accommodate on-chain securities and other crypto assets. Rules and regulations designed for off-chain securities may be incompatible with or unnecessary for on-chain assets and stifle the growth of blockchain technology.</p>
<p>A key priority of my Chairmanship will be to develop a rational regulatory framework for crypto asset markets that establishes clear rules of the road for the issuance, custody, and trading of crypto assets while continuing to discourage bad actors from violating the law. Clear rules of the road are necessary for investor protection against fraud &ndash; not the least to help them identify scams that do not comport with the law.</p>
<p>It is a new day at the SEC. Policymaking will no longer result from&nbsp;<i>ad hoc</i>&nbsp;enforcement actions. Instead, the Commission will utilize its existing rulemaking, interpretive, and exemptive authorities to set fit-for-purpose standards for market participants. The Commission&rsquo;s enforcement approach will return to Congress&rsquo; original intent, which is to police violations of these established obligations, particularly as they relate to fraud and manipulation.</p>
<p>This undertaking requires coordination across multiple offices and divisions within the Commission, which is why I am pleased that Commissioner Uyeda and Commissioner Peirce have worked together to establish the Crypto Task Force. For too long, the Commission has been plagued by policymaking siloes. The Crypto Task Force exemplifies how our policy divisions can come together to expeditiously provide long-needed clarity and certainty to the American public.</p>
<p>Now, I mentioned three areas of focus for crypto asset policy &ndash; issuance, custody, and trading.</p>
<p><span>Issuance</span></p>
<p>First, I intend for the Commission to establish clear and sensible guidelines for distributions of crypto assets that are securities or subject to an investment contract. Only four crypto asset issuers have conducted registered offerings and offerings pursuant to Regulation A.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-remarks-crypto-roundtable-tokenization-051225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;Issuers have largely avoided these types of offerings, in part, due to challenges in satisfying the associated disclosure requirements. In cases where the issuer does not intend to distribute ordinary securities, such as stock, bonds, or notes, issuers also struggle to determine whether a crypto asset constitutes a &ldquo;security&rdquo; or is subject to an investment contract.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-remarks-crypto-roundtable-tokenization-051225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>In the past few years, the SEC first pursued what I call the &ldquo;head-in-the-sand&rdquo; approach &ndash; perhaps hoping that crypto would go away. Then, it pivoted and pursued a shoot-first-and-ask-questions-later approach of regulation through enforcement. It claimed that it was willing to talk to prospective registrants, &ldquo;Just come in to visit,&rdquo; but this proved ephemeral at best and more often misleading because the SEC made no necessary adaptations to registration forms for this new technology. For example, Form S-1 continues to require detailed information regarding executive compensation and use of proceeds, which may not be relevant or material for investment decisions in crypto assets. While the SEC has previously adapted its forms for offerings of asset-backed securities and by real estate investment trusts, it has not done so for crypto assets despite increased investor interest in this space over the past few years. We cannot encourage innovation by trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.</p>
<p>I am committed to the Commission charting a new course. The Commission staff recently issued a staff statement on disclosure obligations for certain registrations and offerings.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-remarks-crypto-roundtable-tokenization-051225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;The staff also clarified the view that certain distributions and crypto assets do not implicate the federal securities laws, and I expect the staff to continue to provide clarifications at my direction with regard to other types of distributions and assets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-remarks-crypto-roundtable-tokenization-051225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;However, existing registration exemptions and safe harbors may not be entirely fit-for-purpose for certain types of crypto asset offerings. I view this construct of staff pronouncements as extremely temporary &ndash; Commission action is both vital and necessary.&nbsp; In the meantime, I have asked the Commission staff to consider whether additional guidance, registration exemptions, and safe harbors are needed to create pathways for crypto asset issuances within the United States. I believe that the Commission has broad discretion under the securities acts to accommodate the crypto industry, and I intend to get it done.</p>
<p><span>Custody</span></p>
<p>Second, I support providing registrants with greater optionality in determining how to custody crypto assets. Commission staff recently removed a significant impediment for companies seeking to provide crypto asset custodial services by rescinding Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-remarks-crypto-roundtable-tokenization-051225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;That pronouncement was a grave error. The staff had no place to act so broadly in place of Commission action and without notice-and-comment rulemaking. The action created needless confusion and went far beyond the jurisdiction of the SEC in its effects. However, the SEC can do much more to enhance competition in the market for legally compliant custodial services than merely getting rid of SAB 121.</p>
<p>It is important to provide clarity on the types of custodians that qualify as a &ldquo;qualified custodian&rdquo; under the Advisers Act and Investment Company Act, as well as reasonable exceptions from the qualified custody requirements to accommodate certain common practices within crypto asset markets. Many advisers and funds have access to self-custodial solutions that incorporate more advanced technology to safeguard crypto assets as compared to some of the custodians in the market. Consequently, the custody rules may need to be updated to allow advisers and funds to engage in self-custody under certain circumstances.</p>
<p>Additionally, it may be necessary to repeal and replace the &ldquo;special purpose broker-dealer&rdquo; framework<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-remarks-crypto-roundtable-tokenization-051225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;with a more rational regime. Only two special purpose broker-dealer are in operation today due clearly to the significant limitations imposed on these entities. Broker-dealers are not and never were restricted from acting as a custodian for non-security crypto assets or crypto asset securities, but Commission action may be needed to clarify the application of the customer protection and net capital rules to this activity.</p>
<p><span>Trading</span></p>
<p>Third, I am in favor of allowing registrants to trade a broader variety of products on their platforms and in response to market demand, activities which previous Commissions had prevented. For example, some broker-dealers seek to go to market with a &ldquo;super app&rdquo; that offers trading in securities and non-securities and other financial services all under a single roof. Nothing in the federal securities laws prohibits registered broker-dealers with an alternative trading system from facilitating trading in non-securities, including via &ldquo;pairs trading&rdquo; between securities and non-securities. I have asked the staff to help us devise ways to modernize the ATS regulatory regime to better accommodate crypto assets. Additionally, I have asked the staff to explore whether further guidance or rulemaking may be helpful for enabling the listing and trading of crypto assets on national securities exchanges.</p>
<p>While the Commission and its staff work to develop a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto assets, securities market participants should not be compelled to go offshore to innovate with blockchain technology. I would like to explore whether conditional exemptive relief would be appropriate for registrants and non-registrants that seek to bring new products and services to market that may otherwise not be compatible with current Commission rules and regulations.</p>
<p>I am eager to coordinate with colleagues in President Trump&rsquo;s Administration and Congress to make the United States the best place in the world to participate in crypto asset markets.</p>
<p>Thank you for your attention. I look forward to the discussions to follow.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This movement of securities from off-chain to on-chain systems is akin to the transition of audio recordings from analog vinyl records to cassette tapes to digital software decades ago. The ability to easily encode audio in a digital file format, which could readily be transferred, modified, and stored, unlocked tremendous innovation within the music industry.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-remarks-crypto-roundtable-tokenization-051225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Audio was freed from its boundaries as a static, fixed-format creation. It suddenly was compatible and interoperable across a wide range of devices and applications. It could be combined, broken apart, and programmed to form entirely new products. This also led to the development of novel hardware devices and streaming content business models, greatly benefiting consumers and the American economy.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-remarks-crypto-roundtable-tokenization-051225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Survey of up to eighty large domestic banks and twenty-four U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks. The Federal Reserve generally conducts the survey quarterly, timing it so that results are available for the January/February, April/May, August, and October/November meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee. The Federal Reserve occasionally conducts one or two additional surveys during the year. Questions cover changes in the standards and terms of the banks' lending and the state of business and household demand for loans. The survey often includes questions on one or two other topics of current interest.</p>

<title>SIFMA And SIFMA AMG Respond To SEC’s Crypto RFI</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sifma-and-sifma-amg-respond-to-secs-crypto-rfi-2025512/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sifma-and-sifma-amg-respond-to-secs-crypto-rfi-2025512/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>SIFMA and SIFMA Asset Management Group (SIFMA AMG) have responded to the recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Crypto Task Force&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-rfi-022125">request for information</a>&nbsp;from stakeholders on activity involving digital assets</p>
<p>In the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sifma.org/resources/submissions/letters/request-for-comment-on-statement-by-commissioner-hester-m-peirce/">comment letter</a>, SIFMA and SIFMA AMG welcome the SEC&rsquo;s efforts to engage with all market participants interested in the ongoing development of these technologies, as well as its creation of the Crypto Task Force, and expressed their agreement with the SEC&rsquo;s and the Task Force&rsquo;s goal of providing greater clarity to market participants engaged in digital assets activities through frameworks that balance responsible innovation and protecting investors.</p>
<p>SIFMA and SIFMA AMG emphasize the importance of four general principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>Extending existing robust investor protections to digital assets market participants,</li>
<li>The need for the SEC to apply existing and well-understood securities regulatory principles to digital assets rather than creating a distinct architecture for this class of assets and transactions,</li>
<li>The value of a technology-neutral approach, and</li>
<li>The need to ensure that digital assets and market participants are subject to regulatory outcomes that are risk appropriate and broadly equivalent to those applied to traditional assets and market participants.</li>
</ol>
<p>More specifically, the comment letter focuses on three areas:</p>
<p><span>Securities Status</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><em>Adopt Clear and Consistent Taxonomies</em></span>: The SEC should adopt clear, consistent and consensus-driven taxonomies and classification approaches, such as those described in this letter, as a crucial first step in the development of effective digital assets regulation.</li>
<li><span><em>Securities Status Should be Based on Economic Characteristics:</em></span>&nbsp;The determination of whether a digital asset is a security should be based upon the intrinsic economic characteristics of an asset or transaction rather than through a technology-driven approach that depends on mutable factors extrinsic to the asset or transaction.</li>
<li><span><em>Supplement Existing Case Law:</em></span>&nbsp;The SEC should build on the existing corpus of case law in determining securities status, supplementing as appropriate through the issuance of flexible, principles-based guidance that considers industry input, and FAQs specific to digital assets.</li>
<li><span><em>Scoping-Out:</em></span>&nbsp;SIFMA supports the SEC&rsquo;s efforts to provide guidance scoping-out non-securities digital assets and digital asset activities. However, guidance should be based on a technology-neutral approach and avoid adopting classifications that may create conflicts with terminology in potential future legislation on payment stablecoins and digital assets market structure.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Custody</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><em>Apply Traditional Custody Principles:</em></span>&nbsp;Traditional regulatory principles around custody and the role of the custodian, including the separation of financial activities, segregation of client assets, and ensuring proper control of assets, should be applied to the custody of digital assets, whether in the broker-dealer, registered investment adviser (&ldquo;RIA&rdquo;), or investment company context.</li>
<li><span><em>Rely on Existing Custody Frameworks and Do Not Adopt Safeguarding Proposal:</em></span>&nbsp;The SEC should neither develop a new custody framework solely for digital assets nor proceed with its unworkable 2023 Safeguarding proposal. Instead, the SEC should ensure that existing regulatory perimeters with respect the regulation of custodial activity do not expand to include asset types beyond securities and funds, and that where clarification regarding how these regulations will apply to new technology, the SEC should engage in an iterative dialogue with industry participants to develop updated guidance on specific topics&nbsp;<em>g.,</em>&nbsp;on the subject of &ldquo;private keys.&rdquo;</li>
<li><span><em>Custody Requirements Should be Technology Neutral:</em></span>&nbsp;Custody rules and guidance should adopt flexible frameworks that accommodate evolving technologies and avoid favoring specific technological characteristics, including the network type (<em>g.,</em>&nbsp;public versus private) and its configuration (<em>e.g.,</em>&nbsp;permissioned versus permissionless).</li>
<li><span><em>Replace the Special Purpose Broker-Dealer Framework:</em></span>&nbsp;The SEC should formally withdraw the Special Purpose Broker-Dealer (&ldquo;SPBD&rdquo;) Statement and replace it with a framework that would enable broker-dealers to custody digital asset securities in compliance with applicable regulations alongside traditional assets within their established entities.</li>
<li><span><em>Custody of Non-Security Digital Assets:</em></span>&nbsp;For digital assets that are not securities, the SEC should carefully assess its existing authorities in consultation with other regulators and avoid prescriptive mandates that may be difficult or impossible for custodians to implement. Any rules or guidance should also be technology neutral and treat the non-security digital asset in the same manner as a traditional asset with the same economic function.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Tokenization</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><em>Targeted Clarifications Are Needed to Help Tokenized Asset Markets Develop:&nbsp;</em></span>The SEC should make targeted policy changes to promote the development and expansion of tokenized securities markets. This includes clarifying how existing requirements apply to tokenized securities in areas such as recordkeeping, possession and control, and clearing and settlement.</li>
<li><span><em>Modernize Transfer Agent Regulations for Tokenized Assets:</em></span>&nbsp;The SEC should modernize its transfer agent regulations as they apply to tokenized asset transactions, recognizing that key features of blockchains and smart contracts can allow the transfer agent to fulfil many, if not all, of its core functions, including recordkeeping, settlement facilitation, and compliance enforcement.</li>
<li><span><em>Do Not Move to T+0 or &ldquo;Atomic&rdquo; Settlement:</em></span>&nbsp;Regulatory modernization to promote tokenized asset markets should not include any attempt to move the industry to a T+0 settlement cycle, given the significant risks, costs, and additional complexity it would create after the recent successful transition in the United States to T+1 settlement and the fact that other major jurisdictions have not yet completed their process of transitioning from a T+2 to a T+1 settlement cycle.</li>
</ul>
<p>The full letter is available&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sifma.org/resources/submissions/letters/request-for-comment-on-statement-by-commissioner-hester-m-peirce/">here</a>. SIFMA and SIFMA AMG plan to submit additional comments on other issues raised in the request for information in the coming weeks.</p>

<title>US Federal Agencies Issue Host State Loan-To-Deposit Ratios</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-federal-agencies-issue-host-state-loan-to-deposit-ratios-2025512/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Federal bank regulatory agencies today jointly issued updated host state loan-to-deposit ratios,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.congress.gov/103/statute/STATUTE-108/STATUTE-108-Pg2338.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">as required by law</a>. Each respective host state loan-to-deposit ratio shows the ratio of total loans in a state to total deposits in the state for all banks that have that state as their home state. These ratios replace those issued in May 2024.</p>
<p>By law, a bank is generally prohibited from establishing or acquiring branches outside of its home state primarily for the purpose of acquiring additional deposits. This prohibition seeks to ensure that interstate bank branches will not take deposits from a community without the bank also reasonably helping to meet the credit needs of that community.</p>
<p>The updated ratios, including additional information on how they are used to evaluate compliance with the requirements, are available&nbsp;<a href="https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2025/nr-ia-2025-45a.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Agencies Issue Host State Loan-to-Deposit Ratios">here</a>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Reamonn. It is an honor and a privilege to be asked to speak in the beautiful country of Ireland and here at the Central Bank of Ireland. The histories of the U.S. and Ireland are intertwined. Our friendship is enduring, and our economies are closely tied. The Irish economy and the Bank stand as examples of the benefits of being open to international connections and the sharing of the best ideas and practices. I am delighted to have the opportunity to meet with my counterparts here and continue this great friendship. It is also wonderful to see many members of the National Association for Business Economics (NABE). NABE and its members have made many important contributions to the field of economics; as such, I always enjoy speaking to this esteemed group.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250512a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>I am particularly delighted to contribute to this conference on trade, technology, and policy. As an academic, part of my research has investigated the link between trade and productivity. And in my current role, I have highlighted these themes in several of my recent speeches, including the role of recent advancements in technology, such as artificial intelligence, as well as the role of business formation in terms of boosting U.S. productivity over the past few years.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250512a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;Today, I would like to focus my attention on the current outlook for the U.S. economy and how I am thinking about the path of monetary policy. Of course, given current developments, I will focus on the role played by trade policy and how it may affect the economy and productivity going forward.</p>
<p>While the latest data show a resilient economy, I expect growth this year to be slower than last. Labor market conditions have been mostly stable. Inflation remains above the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) 2 percent target, and further progress on disinflation has been slow. Looking ahead, I am monitoring the effects of changing trade policies, as I see them as likely having a significant effect on the U.S. and global economies in the near future.</p>
<p>Trade policies are evolving and are likely to continue shifting, even as recently as this morning. Still, they appear likely to generate significant economic effects even if tariffs stay close to the currently announced levels, and the uncertainty associated with these tariffs has already generated effects on the economy through front-loading, sentiment, and expectations. Let me start by describing how I see current economic conditions.</p>
<p><span>Economic Activity</span><br />Regarding overall economic activity, it is currently hard to judge the underlying pace of growth of the U.S. economy, as the gross domestic product (GDP) release for the first quarter showed strong evidence of front-loading of imports ahead of tariffs. GDP contracted at a 0.3 percent annual rate in the first quarter after expanding 2.5 percent during 2024. However, the latest GDP figure likely overstates the deceleration in activity, as a 41.3 percent surge in imports apparently did not get fully picked up in the inventory data or other components of spending. The size of the swings in imports may make the measurement of activity more difficult.</p>
<p>It is helpful to look at private domestic final purchases (PDFP), a measure of demand in the private sector: It rose at a rate of 3 percent in the first quarter&mdash;similar to the pace recorded last year. Still, the strength in PDFP also likely reflects some pull-forward of purchases by businesses and consumers to get ahead of tariffs.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve's April Beige Book and conversations with contacts also point toward front-loading in auto sales or other high-end goods. However, the Beige Book and various indicators of consumer and business confidence also point to a downbeat tone about underlying economic activity down the road. For instance, the Beige Book notes that several Districts see a deterioration in demand for travel and other nonfinancial services and indicates that businesses may put investments on hold moving forward. Several other economic indicators that I track suggest some signs of declining economic activity in the future. For instance, the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing purchasing managers index for April shows that new orders have been declining since February.</p>
<p><span>Labor Market</span><br />On the employment side of our mandate, conditions seem to be mostly stable. The most recent employment report showed that employers created 177,000 new jobs in April, in line with the average of the previous six months. The unemployment rate was 4.2 percent&mdash;still within the narrow and historically low range of 4 to 4.2 percent&mdash;where it has remained since May of 2024. In addition, the pace of layoffs remains modest. New applications for unemployment benefits have remained relatively stable at historically low levels. However, I am carefully watching other sources of data for any signs that the labor market could be shifting, given the broader uncertainty. Some forward-looking measures of layoffs have increased, such as the number of mentions of the word "layoff" in the Beige Book.</p>
<p>In terms of the demand for workers, the U.S. Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) showed that the vacancy rate&mdash;the number of vacant jobs as a percentage of total employment and vacant jobs&mdash;declined to 4.3 percent in March, the lowest in six months. The government data showed that the ratio of vacancies to the number of unemployed Americans was 1.0 in March, below its 2019 average of 1.2&mdash;also indicating the continuing easing of U.S. labor markets. Overall, job growth remains positive, and unemployment is still low, but I am watching a broad range of incoming readings carefully.</p>
<p><span>Inflation</span><br />On the other side of our dual mandate is inflation. After two years of notable progress following U.S. inflation reaching its pandemic-era peak, progress on disinflation has slowed since last summer. Inflation remains somewhat above the FOMC's 2 percent goal. At the Fed, the inflation reading we track most closely is the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index. The March report, released on April 30, showed that the 12-month change in the PCE price index was 2.3 percent; the core PCE price index&mdash;which excludes food and energy prices&mdash;rose 2.6 percent over the same period.</p>
<p>To help me judge the path of future inflation, I pay careful attention to two subcategories of the index. One is core goods prices, which exclude volatile food and energy prices. The second is nonhousing market-based services, which are based on transactions such as car maintenance and haircuts, not imputed prices. Goods inflation was negative for most of 2024&mdash;as was the norm for several years before the pandemic&mdash;but it was positive early this year. In contrast, nonhousing market services inflation stayed elevated through March, coming in at 3.4 percent. That category often provides a good signal of inflationary pressures across all nonhousing services. Looking ahead, I find it critical to monitor not only the most up-to-date data but also the changing economic policies around the world.</p>
<p><span>Economic Effects of Global Policy Changes</span><br />To pause briefly, I would like to take a moment to discuss the Fed's structure. The Fed operates independently from the elected government in Washington. We make our policies to best achieve the goals given to us by Congress of maximum employment and price stability. As such, it is not my role to comment on the policies offered by the U.S. government or any government around the world. Rather, I make assessments of the likely effects of these policies, observe the behavior of the U.S. and world economies, and develop views about the best U.S. monetary policy to achieve our dual-mandate goals.</p>
<p>The U.S. is implementing policy changes in trade, immigration, fiscal policy, and regulation, and other economies are also changing their policies in the areas of trade and fiscal spending, particularly in defense, which could stimulate aggregate demand. But given that the most important changes have occurred so far in the area of trade policy, today I would like to discuss some important economic channels through which changes in tariffs may affect the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>Although higher tariffs on U.S. imported goods may affect our macroeconomy through many channels, some of which I will describe next, I think they will primarily act as a negative supply shock, raising prices and decreasing economic activity. While uncertainty remains about the ultimate level of the average tariff rate, currently announced average tariffs in the U.S. are still much higher than they were in the past many decades. If tariffs remain significantly larger relative to earlier in the year, the same is likely to be true for the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth.</p>
<p>How do I expect this to play out? In the near term, higher import costs will raise prices for both consumer goods and inputs to production. On their own, imported goods represent about 11 percent of U.S. GDP. However, given that several intermediate goods, such as aluminum and steel have been tariffed, and they affect costs in many sectors of the economy, prices of many goods and services are also likely to be affected. In addition, in conversations with business contacts, I have heard that firms are paying attention to the price sensitivity of consumers across the entire catalog of items sold and may spread price increases to less price-sensitive items to avoid reducing their profit margins. A Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas survey of Texas business executives found that 55 percent of respondents expect to pass through most or all of the costs from higher tariffs to customers.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250512a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a><span>&nbsp;</span>Of those expecting to pass on costs, 26 percent expect to pass through the higher tariff cost upon the announcement of tariffs, and 64 percent expect this pass-through to occur within the first three months after the tariffs take effect. That would suggest that price increases may be observed soon.</p>
<p>Given these expected price increases, real incomes will fall, and operating costs will rise, which will lead consumers to demand fewer final goods and services and firms to demand fewer inputs. Ultimately, I see the U.S. as likely to experience lower growth and higher inflation. Over time, there could also be significant effects on productivity. As firms adjust to the higher input costs and lower demand, they may cut back on capital investment and shift to a less-efficient combination of inputs. Additionally, less-efficient domestic firms may increase their market share.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250512a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;All of this may result in a decrease in potential output growth, lowering the underlying pace of economic activity in the U.S.</p>
<p>In addition to any direct effect from actual global policy changes, consumers, businesses, and market participants have reported high levels of uncertainty about which policies may be ultimately chosen and how long they will remain in place. In fact, in recent months, several measures of economic uncertainty have risen sharply.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>There are several types of measures that quantify economic uncertainty, with two types having gained prominence among economists closely monitoring the U.S. economic outlook.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250512a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;Some are based on financial market transactions, such as the Chicago Board Options Exchange's Volatility Index, popularly called the VIX. Others are based on the occurrence of certain keywords associated with the concept of uncertainty in newspapers of wide circulation, such as the economic policy uncertainty and trade policy uncertainty readings.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250512a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;These measures of uncertainty have reached historical highs in recent months. Similarly, I also saw the word "uncertainty" being highly cited in the Beige Book I reviewed before the FOMC's policy meeting last week.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250512a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a></p>
<p>In times of heightened uncertainty, businesses may delay investment decisions, and consumers may increase precautionary savings and postpone discretionary purchases. Moreover, the economic research literature has documented that these decisions from businesses and consumers reverberate through the economy, pushing down aggregate demand. Firms, anticipating lower demand for their services and products, may post fewer job openings and cut back on investments to expand capacity. While the labor market has remained broadly resilient, the JOLTS data for March showed that job openings fell. Workers, therefore, may have a more difficult time finding employment, decreasing economy-wide income and aggregate demand.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250512a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;This lower aggregate demand may then exert downward pressure on inflation, though probably not by enough to offset the effect from the adverse supply shock that I previously mentioned. For example, recent data show that prices for accommodations and airfares have fallen, consistent with an increasing number of anecdotal reports of weaker consumer demand for discretionary travel services.</p>
<p>I am also monitoring the effect of policy changes on another important channel: inflation expectations. For instance, consumers and businesses have reported tariffs as an important reason for having increased their near-term inflation expectations. Several surveys, including those from the Conference Board and the Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta and New York, have found that consumers and businesses expect higher inflation one year from now. Another closely watched survey from the University of Michigan showed that one-year-ahead inflation expectations in April were higher than in the pandemic period. This increase in short-run expectations may give businesses more leeway to raise prices.</p>
<p>Most longer-run measures, including those from the Philadelphia Fed's Survey of Professional Forecasters and the New York Fed's Survey of Consumer Expectations, show either stability or much smaller increases in inflation expectations, which does provide some comfort to me. Additionally, inflation compensation, which is based on yields from Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, has increased only for short-term maturities, such as one year ahead, and has shown stability in maturities over the five years starting five years from now. Still, I have taken note of the increase in longer-term inflation expectations from the Michigan survey, which reached the highest level since June 1991. Given these developments, I am keeping a close watch on inflation, because as I have indicated in the past, I believe it is critical to keep long-term inflation expectations very well anchored at 2 percent.</p>
<p>Looking globally, international developments do not seem to be adding inflationary pressures to the U.S. Economic growth in most developed economies remains moderate, and domestic inflation in those countries has declined from elevated levels. In Europe, activity data point to modest growth as the region deals with headwinds stemming from past energy shocks and competitive pressures from elsewhere in the world. The New York Fed's Global Supply Chain Pressure Index has been relatively stable since the beginning of the year. Oil prices have declined significantly since January.</p>
<p><span>Monetary Policy</span><br />I have discussed a lot of data and developments with you today. To summarize, the U.S. economy has remained resilient up until now, with a still-stable labor market. Meanwhile, the disinflationary process has slowed. This comes against a backdrop of heightened uncertainty as households, businesses, and, indeed, monetary policymakers process the changes to economic policies that are happening around the world. Going forward, I will continue to closely monitor the direct effects of global economic policies on prices and employment, as well as the indirect economic effects from uncertainty, inflation expectations, and productivity.</p>
<p>U.S. monetary policymakers on the FOMC met last week in Washington. At that meeting, the Committee voted to maintain its policy rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. Given the upside risks to inflation and given that I still view our policy stance as somewhat restrictive, I supported the decision to keep rates at that level. With inflation and employment potentially moving in opposite directions down the road, I will closely monitor developments as I consider the future path of policy.</p>
<p>I view our current stance of monetary policy as well positioned for any changes in the macroeconomic environment. I remain committed to achieving both of our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices.</p>
<p>Thank you for your attention today&mdash;and thank you very much for inviting me to speak to you here in Dublin. It has been an honor and a privilege. I look forward to your questions.</p>

<title>STOXX Europe TM Defense Futures: The Strategic Instrument For The Defense sSector</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Over the past three years, defense has returned to the forefront of political and public discussion in Europe. Geopolitical events continue to drive an increase in defense spending. Emerging challenges and the need for modernization contribute to a strong demand for defense products and services. Defense spending is expected to remain significant, with European countries investing in national security and military capabilities to meet the challenges. &nbsp;Also, the European Commission has taken steps to promote Europe&rsquo;s defense industrial capacity and resilience through initiatives such as the European Defense Fund.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This renewed focus on defense by policymakers drives significant increases in planned spending. As a result, defense stocks have outperformed broader industrial benchmarks in recent years, and sector ETFs, along with thematic funds, have experienced steady inflows. However, many investors targeting the sector find themselves constrained by legacy indexes that offer broader coverage, often including civil aerospace, dual-use manufacturers, and conglomerates with limited exposure to defense.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new STOXX<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;Europe TM Defense Futures are designed to fill this gap.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eurex will launch the STOXX<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;Europe TM Defense Futures on 12 May 2025, offering targeted access to companies that derive a material share of their revenues from defense-related activities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Focused exposures</strong></p>
<p>The new futures contract is based on the STOXX<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;Europe Total Market Defense Capped Index, developed to offer focused exposure to European defense stocks. The index comprises European companies that have demonstrated a proven revenue exposure to defense activities based on verified industry classifications and public disclosures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The index comprises 21 aerospace and defense firms, including Rheinmetall, Leonardo, Thales, BAE Systems, and Rolls-Royce Holdings. The index applies a 10 percent cap on individual constituents at each quarterly review to prevent overconcentration in a handful of large-cap names. This makes the index more balanced while still retaining high fidelity in the defense sector. The methodology focuses on revenue-derived classification using Revere (RBICS) data rather than just sector labels, ensuring a genuine representation of defense activity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The STOXX<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;Europe TM Defense Capped Index, which underlies the futures, differs from the more general STOXX<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;Europe Total Market Aerospace &amp; Defense Index. While the broader index includes aerospace and dual-use manufacturers, including those whose primary revenues may come from civilian aircraft, space systems, or industrial technologies, the capped index narrows its focus to firms with a more concentrated defense business model. This distinction is important to asset managers and sector allocators aiming to isolate thematic exposure without excess tracking error or overlap with non-defense industrials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>STOXX<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;reports that the index has delivered a return of 239 percent over the past three years and 52 percent in 2025. In comparison, the STOXX<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;Europe Total Market Aerospace &amp; Defense index, which includes the sectors of design, development, production, and commercial aircraft maintenance, has returned 165 percent and 35 percent, respectively.</p>

</ul>
<hr />
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default" id="section-introduction" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Just a few people know that I used to be a fairly serious mountaineer. During my years living in Hong Kong, I would often escape the city to hike across the hills in the remoter parts of the New Territories.&nbsp;And more challenging climbs in the European Alps usually involved long days navigating glaciers, cliffs of ice and knife-edge ridges to get to the summit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These days you&rsquo;re more likely to find me grappling with a mountain of paperwork than Mont Blanc. But much like mountain climbing, I&rsquo;ve found that the path of economic and regulatory partnership isn&rsquo;t always a straight line.</p>
<p>We routinely encounter false summits and switchbacks. Or as Vice Minister Liao put it recently, some &lsquo;ups and downs.&rsquo; But the view from the top &ndash; shared growth, greater financial resilience, global influence &ndash; is worth the effort.</p>
<p>With the success of January&rsquo;s UK-China Economic and Financial Dialogue, I am optimistic that&nbsp;financial cooperation is on the rise. The Chancellor&rsquo;s visit to China, accompanied by Nikhil Rathi, our Chief Executive, showed that this partnership matters at the highest political and regulatory levels.</p>
<p>But as every climber knows, intent alone doesn&rsquo;t get you to the top. And today I want to outline a route that I believe leads to deeper, more durable UK-China financial cooperation.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default" id="section-landscape" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Landscape</h2>
<p>When I speak with regulatory counterparts around the globe, it is clear that we are grappling with many of the same challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tackling cross-border fraud. Harnessing technological change. How to support economic growth.&nbsp;And one of the basic issues which affects both the UK and China concerns demographic change.&nbsp;Ageing populations are increasing the pressure on all our public pension systems, and helping people to build lifelong financial resilience is an urgent imperative.</p>
<p>Through our new strategy, the FCA is putting long-term savings and investment at the heart of our agenda to meet this demographic challenge.&nbsp;Focusing on how we can deepen trust in the financial system and re-balance our collective risk attitude, supporting economic growth and improving lives.</p>
<p>On the supply side, we are reforming capital markets and opening up new channels for investment, so that more firms can get into the shop window and raise the capital required for growth.</p>
<p>Last year, we made the biggest reforms to the UK&rsquo;s listing regime for decades. This year we are implementing a new prospectus regime, and developing a new market for trading private shares (PISCES).</p>
<p>On the demand side, we are focused on unlocking domestic savings &ndash; supporting households to become more confident long-term investors and to secure better retirement outcomes.</p>
<p>This includes a new Value for Money Framework for workplace pension schemes which emphasises long-term investment returns over short-term costs. We have also proposed a new model for targeted support in pensions, enabling far more people to have access to the type of guidance needed when making the critical decisions on which their financial futures depend.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know China is also exploring how to mobilise retail investment to strengthen its pension system and meet the changing needs of the population.&nbsp;And in this shared challenge lies shared opportunity.</p>
<p>For us to work together &ndash; across areas as diverse as green finance, wealth management, and supervision &ndash; we need to build systems that are not only resilient in the face of today&rsquo;s risks, but are also able to engage with tomorrow&rsquo;s realities.</p>
<p>Of course, we face these generational challenges at a time when the terrain of regulatory cooperation has undeniably become more rugged.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Geopolitical uncertainty, economic and regulatory fragmentation, and emerging risks in tech and data governance are all shaping the global conditions in which we operate.</p>
<p>In this context, there is a risk of an &lsquo;each-to-their own&rsquo; mindset taking hold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s partnership, not isolation, that has always been the way to achieve lasting progress &ndash; that&rsquo;s just as true when regulating complex financial markets as it is when climbing mountains.&nbsp;And it is against this uncertain backdrop, that successful partnerships matter more than ever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The UK-China financial relationship can be a stabilising force &ndash; a practical example of how two major but very different world economies can build trust, deliver mutual benefit, and support global market integrity.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default" id="section-making-the-most-of-existing-opportunities" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Making the most of existing opportunities</h2>
<p>Like any serious ascent, there are several stages for us to consider.&nbsp;The first is about making the most of the ground we have already gained &ndash; making sure existing opportunities are fully functioning and utilised.</p>
<p>Stock Connect was a watershed moment when it launched in 2019. In the first 2 years, it led to listings worth almost 6 billion dollars on the London Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>It was also the first time that any foreign company was able to list in mainland China. A sign of our ambitions for deeper UK-China market integration, opening the door to greater capital flows in both directions.</p>
<p>But technical obstacles have so far prevented us from realising Stock Connect&rsquo;s full potential.</p>
<p>Now is the time to unblock those issues. The FCA is ready to play our part &ndash; working closely with UK colleagues, including the Treasury and the London Stock Exchange, as well as with our Chinese counterparts.</p>
<p>It speaks volumes that, after we overhauled UK listing rules last year, a Chinese company was the first to take up the opportunity to complete a secondary listing in London.&nbsp;We have also seen a growing number of Chinese asset managers listing ETF products in London, including renminbi-denominated ones.&nbsp;We want to see this kind of activity developing further, expanding market access channels on both sides.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same collaborative spirit is powering our progress on green finance, which is not just a regulatory priority, but a major growth driver for the financial sector.&nbsp;The UK is a global leader in green finance innovation, with around half of the world&rsquo;s traded green bonds listed here.&nbsp;And China has made the transition to a greener economy a central pillar of its long-term growth strategy, rapidly scaling its green finance ecosystem.&nbsp;So there is undoubtedly plenty of room for us to do more together.</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s decision to list its first foreign-issued Sovereign Green Bond in London a few weeks ago was an important next step, and we are encouraging UK firms to seize opportunities in China&rsquo;s growing green finance market too &ndash; from transition finance to biodiversity-linked investment.</p>
<p>The UK-China Green Finance taskforce will help to build further momentum, but sustainability disclosures are an essential part of the effort.&nbsp;Shared disclosures create shared understanding. They help capital flow with transparency, accountability and purpose. And they&rsquo;re key to market integrity.&nbsp;So we welcome the International Sustainability Standards Board&rsquo;s (ISSB) efforts to create, for the first time, a joint language for these disclosures.</p>
<p>We are in the process of aligning our standards with the ISSB and have been pleased to see our Chinese colleagues reaffirm their commitment to international alignment. The Bank of China&rsquo;s decision to join the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures is another promising signal.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default" id="section-forging-new-paths" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Forging new paths</h2>
<p>These examples are important footholds.&nbsp;But we also need to continue forging new paths &ndash; being open to opportunity, ambitious, and smart about what comes next.&nbsp;With China&rsquo;s pool of private wealth growing, Chinese consumers are looking to diversify their investments abroad to boost returns and secure retirement funds.&nbsp;UK markets are perfectly placed to support that demand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are second only to the US in asset management. And around half of UK assets under management are held on behalf of overseas clients &ndash; a reflection of the strong trust our system enjoys.</p>
<p>Firms like Schroders have already deepened their presence in the Chinese market, establishing a joint venture with Bank of Communications, as well as a wholly owned fund management company.</p>
<p>These aren&rsquo;t short-term tactics; they reflect a long-term alignment with China&rsquo;s evolving financial landscape.&nbsp;And taken alongside the growing role of UK institutions in China&rsquo;s reinsurance market, it shows that firms can see the potential for far greater collaboration between our markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proposed China-UK Wealth Connect scheme could be a transformational next step.&nbsp;A seamless platform for cross-border wealth management. Enabling Chinese savers to access UK-managed funds through reliable regulatory frameworks. Giving UK firms a gateway to one of the fastest-growing pools of global private capital.</p>
<p>To ensure success, it must be designed with openness, strong governance, and mutual benefit at its core, and the FCA is working with our UK and Chinese counterparts to help shape this opportunity.&nbsp;Because if we can build the right structures now, the benefits for both our economies will be lasting and significant.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default" id="section-improving-tools" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Improving tools</h2>
<p>But as we climb higher together, the landscape&nbsp;becomes far more challenging.&nbsp;Innovation accelerates. Markets become more complex. Risks shift in shape and speed.&nbsp;We need stronger tools to help us navigate this more difficult terrain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the most promising new tools will be the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) now being developed between the FCA and China&rsquo;s National Financial Regulatory Administration.</p>
<p>This will be critical to provide the mechanisms needed to share information swiftly, supervise firms effectively across borders, and promote market openness &ndash; all while maintaining standards of financial integrity and consumer protection.</p>
<p>For regulators and firms alike, fast and efficient exchange of data is vital to manage the risks that inevitably accompany increased cross-border activity.&nbsp;Good data underpins good judgement. It enables resilient markets, helps supervisors identify misconduct early, and empowers firms and consumers to make sound decisions.</p>
<p>Of course, we recognise the sensitivities involved in allowing certain types of data to leave China.&nbsp;So, we want to work collaboratively on arrangements that allow this to happen in a way that is secure, respectful of domestic laws, and beneficial to both sides.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased with the progress made under January&rsquo;s EFD, where both sides underlined the importance of data-sharing, and we will now work together with Chinese regulators to put this high-level commitment into practice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time as strengthening our bilateral cooperation, it is important that we play an active role in shaping debates and standards that affect us all as a global community.&nbsp;The FCA has been clear that we will continue to advocate for the global cooperation and openness which benefits us all, and we hope China will join us in supporting this approach.</p>
<p>Our preference is to do so via established multilateral bodies such as the Financial Stability Board or the International Organisation of Securities Commissions.&nbsp;These are the fora where the rules of modern finance are shaped, so it is really important that China&rsquo;s participation remains active and collaborative.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default" id="section-conclusion" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As any mountaineer will tell you, the best routes are rarely the easiest. But they are the ones worth taking.</p>
<p>The UK and China, although very different economic systems, share similar challenges, including the longer-term demographic challenge I mentioned at the beginning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EFD has set out a work programme that&nbsp;is already re-energising our relationship.</p>
<p>The progress we&rsquo;ve made so far, through dialogue and agreement, gives me confidence that we have the skill and the will to reach those new heights.</p>
<p>But we need to keep climbing, together.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

LDA's new multicast distribution system synchronizes exchange-provided customer ports to within 50 picoseconds (ps), a 98% improvement over existing Layer 1 switches, even more when using conventional Layer 3 switches, ensuring that an exchange can provide users with fair and equal access to market data.</span></p>
<p><span>Exchanges strive to deliver market data to all customers simultaneously, but some of the switches in their infrastructure often have three to five nanoseconds (ns) of jitter between switch ports. Furthermore, cabling between switches and customers adds an additional five nanoseconds per meter.&nbsp;In an exchange's effort towards improved fairness, they often adjust cabling lengths, but with LDA's multicast distribution system, the root issue is now resolved and it makes all transitional remedies unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span>Vahan Sardaryan, co-founder and CEO, said: "The LDA team has achieved something thought to be impossible in the past: we can now deliver a solution that brings fair and equal access to exchange market data. Our fair multicast distribution system handles synchronization at the network endpoints. This results in jitter as low as 50 ps between customer ports, being able to&nbsp;</span><span>even compensate for cable length differences between them</span><span>. As we all know, exchanges are increasingly looking for ways to provide a uniform level of service to clients, and now they can deliver on that promise."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally, unlike conventional Layer 1 switches, which deliver the entire data stream to every client, LDA's revolutionary multicast distribution system further reduces unnecessary system latency by providing only specific market data matching a client's subscription. This function is typically handled by Layer 3 switches, which contribute substantial additional latency, often measured in microseconds, within the exchange's infrastructure. LDA&rsquo;s multicast distribution system delivers revolutionary low jitter while supporting traditional multicast packet handling.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>LDA's fair exchange product will enable exchanges to ensure that access to market data is fair for all participants and the integrity of the market is preserved. Furthermore, it will allow them to offer an enhanced service to clients while going above and beyond regulatory compliance guidelines.&nbsp;</span></p>

<title>Crédit Agricole Corporate And Investment Bank And Solactive AG Are Collaborating On Launching A Solactive Constant Maturity Government Bond Index Family</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Solactive is delighted to announce the collaboration with Cr&eacute;dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank by launching a series of government bond yield indices. These indices belong to the Solactive Constant Maturity Government Bond Index Family, which offers transparent and precise benchmarks essential for supporting the design and innovation of structured products in the fixed income sector. Currently, this sector is under-represented relative to the market&rsquo;s substantial size. Additionally, these indices will also be used for swaps or notes with special features, such as optional redemption features and/or path dependent higher coupons. They will also enable portfolios to be managed and respond effectively to market changes. These government bond yield indices are essential for capturing risks, ensuring transparency, and supporting informed investment decisions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The&nbsp;<a href="https://solactive.com/downloads/Guideline-Solactive-Government-Bond-Benchmark-Index-Family.pdf">Solactive Constant Maturity Government Bond Index Family</a>&nbsp;currently covers France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, and Spain through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.solactive.com/indices/?index=DE000SL0FHL5">Solactive OAT 10</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.solactive.com/indices/?index=DE000SL0FHN1">BUND 10</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.solactive.com/indices/?index=DE000SL0FHQ4">BTP 10</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.solactive.com/indices/?index=DE000SL0FHS0">OLO 10</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.solactive.com/indices/?index=DE000SL0FHU6">SPGB 10</a>&nbsp;bond yield indices. &nbsp;In addition to these indices, customized indices can be created for any developed or emerging market and for the desired bond maturity. With monthly rebalancing, the indices maintain a nearly constant maturity exposure, and can be seen as benchmark for the respective maturity (yield or performance respectively).</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Timo Pfeiffer, Chief Markets Officer at Solactive, commented</span>:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;With persistent inflation, fluctuating debt levels, and ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties, the demand for innovative fixed income products using robust fixed-income benchmarks has never been greater. We are excited to embark with Cr&eacute;dit Agricole CIB, providing transparent and precise indices to navigate the complexities of today&rsquo;s bond market.&rdquo; &nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nicolas Randazzo, European Head of Fixed Income FI Structuring at Cr&eacute;dit Agricole CIB, comment:</span>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;</em><em>The sovereign bond market is the world&rsquo;s largest debt market, it was therefore absolutely essential to give investors a simple and direct access to market benchmarks on sovereign yields. It is now easy to diversify interest-rate exposure in structured products and to build country-specific exposure. We are very proud of this collaboration with Solactive, with whom we share the same ambition: to make the government bond market easily accessible to as many investors in as many investment formats as possible.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Solactive is pleased to announce its first partnership with Samsung Asset Management by supporting the launch of SAMSUNG KODEX China Humanoid Robot ETF, which tracks the Solactive China Humanoid Robotics Index. The product aims at providing investors with focused access to China&rsquo;s rapidly growing humanoid robotics sector.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The global robotics industry is undergoing a transformative shift, evolving from conceptual design to commercial deployment, with humanoid robotics emerging as a frontier technology. Advances in AI and engineering are enabling robots with human-like intelligence and mobility, while demographic trends such as labor shortages and aging populations are accelerating demand for automation solutions. In China, the sector is seeing substantial policy and investment momentum, in line with the country&rsquo;s ambitions to lead in automation, AI, and intelligent manufacturing. According to market analysts, China&rsquo;s industrial robot market alone is expected to surpass USD 15 billion by 2026<span><a href="https://www.solactive.com/in-a-first-collaboration-samsung-asset-management-launches-new-samsung-kodex-china-humanoid-robot-etf-under-its-passive-kodex-etf-brand-tracking-the-solactive-china-humanoid-robotics-index/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></span>, with humanoid robotics projected to play an increasingly critical role in service, healthcare, and manufacturing sectors.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.solactive.com/indices/?index=DE000SL0PWT6">Solactive China Humanoid Robotics Index</a>&nbsp;selects companies that are headquartered in China and listed either in Hong Kong and/or via Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Connect programs. Eligible companies must be constituents of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.solactive.com/indices/?index=DE000SLA4X77">Solactive GBS China All Cap USD Index</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.solactive.com/indices/?index=DE000SLA4JX8">Solactive GBS Hong Kong All Cap Index</a>&nbsp;and be engaged in activities such as AI-driven robotics development, motion control system manufacturing, and automation technologies. Constituents are selected using ARTIS&reg;, Solactive&rsquo;s proprietary natural language processing algorithm, which identifies companies with strong thematic relevance based on publicly available information. The index is composed of 20 companies, ranked and weighted based on a composite of their thematic relevance and free-float market capitalization. ARTIS&reg; scores determine thematic alignment, while index weights apply a blended approach &mdash; 30% relevance-based and 70% market capitalization-based&mdash;with weight caps to ensure diversification. Additionally, companies with negative earnings are subject to a weight cap of 7% to reflect financial prudence.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The ETF will be listed on 13<span>rd</span>&nbsp;May on the Korean Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol &ldquo;0048K0.KS&rdquo;.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Timo Pfeiffer, Chief Markets Officer at Solactive, commented</span>:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;We are very pleased to announce our first collaboration with Samsung Asset Management&rsquo;s KODEX ETF team. The launch of this ETF marks an important milestone and reflects our shared vision of delivering innovative, forward-looking investment solutions. As humanoid robotics progress from concept to commercial reality, China is uniquely positioned at the convergence of innovation and industrial application. The Solactive China Humanoid Robotics Index offers a rule-based, forward-looking exposure to this transformation.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jinwhoan Yu, Head of Product development &amp; Global Business Division at Samsung Asset Managment, commented</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">:</span>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;</em><em>We are excited about our product line expansion and thrilled to launch</em><em>&nbsp;SAMSUNG</em><em>&nbsp;KODEX China Humanoid Robot ETF with Solactive. We expect to be able to offer more innovative products in Korea through this close collaboration.&nbsp;</em><em>SAMSUNG&nbsp;</em><em>KODEX China Humanoid Robot ETF is the first product in Korea focusing on China Robot Industry, so it will provide investors with new investment opportunity.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>April 2025 marked a month of volatility and recovery, with the FTSE Mondo Visione Index achieving an all-time closing high.</p>
<p>Global financial markets began April 2025 on shaky ground, grappling with heightened trade and tariff uncertainties. Despite the rocky start, the month showcased a remarkable turnaround, with markets bouncing back to erase early losses by the end of April.</p>
<p>The FTSE Mondo Visione Index closed the month at a record-breaking 95,691.18 points, a 3.5% rise from its March close of 92,420.71 points. This milestone, achieved on 30 April, represents the highest closing level in the index&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>Among the top exchanges by market capitalisation at the end of April were:</p>
<ul>
<li>CME Group: $99.76 billion</li>
<li>Intercontinental Exchange: $96.32 billion</li>
<li>London Stock Exchange Group: $83.17 billion</li>
<li>Deutsche Boerse: $59.66 billion</li>
<li>Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing: $55.72 billion</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of capital returns, standout performers included Bolsa Mexicana de Valores SAB de CV, which surged 26.6% in U.S. dollar terms, securing the top spot. India&rsquo;s BSE followed with a 17.4% gain, while the Multi Commodity Exchange of India achieved a 16.7% increase.</p>
<p>On the flip side, the Saudi Tadawul Group faced the steepest decline, with a 10.2% drop in share price over the month. Boursa Kuwait Securities and Intercontinental Exchange also saw losses, with decreases of 4.7% and 2.6%, respectively.</p>
<p>Herbie Skeete, Managing Director of Mondo Visione and Co-founder of the Index, reflected on the month&rsquo;s market activity:</p>
<p>"April was a month of intense volatility, driven by trade, tariff, and economic uncertainty. But unlike March, April delivered an extraordinary and dramatic recovery, showcasing the resilience of global financial markets."</p>

<title>ASIC Reminds Small Business Directors Of Their Obligations To Manage Company Money And Assets Appropriately</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-reminds-small-business-directors-of-their-obligations-to-manage-company-mon-2025512/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-reminds-small-business-directors-of-their-obligations-to-manage-company-mon-2025512/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC is reminding small business company directors that they must manage company money and assets in the best interests of their company.</p>
<p>Misuse of company money and assets for personal gain can lead to companies being unable to pay their debts, which can harm other small businesses who are creditors.</p>
<p>The reminder follows recent action that has been taken against company directors following ASIC investigations.</p>
<h2>Legal obligations and why they matter</h2>
<p>Company directors have legal obligations to ensure they act in good faith in the best interests of the company and to not improperly use their position to gain an advantage. They must consider the interests of the company as a whole which may involve considering the interests of shareholders, customers, suppliers, employees and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>Misuse of a company&rsquo;s money and assets can lead to a company not being able to pay its debts. This can cause significant harm to the community (through unpaid tax debts), employees, customers and suppliers. The impacts can be particularly devastating for small businesses creditors as the disruption to cash flow can impact their own ability to cover expenses and pay suppliers.</p>
<p>In 2023-24, poor financial control, which can include misuse of company assets for personal purposes, was a cause of failure for 36 per cent of companies, according to reports lodged by registered liquidators.</p>
<h2>How company directors can make sure they get it right</h2>
<p>Actions that company directors should take to make sure they meet their obligations when dealing with company assets and money include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Remembering that it is company money, not their personal money</strong>: company directors cannot treat company property, assets or funds as if they are their own. For example, company funds can&rsquo;t be used to pay for school fees or holidays.</li>
<li><strong>Considering the interests of their company as a whole when making decisions about company assets and money</strong>: company directors have a legal obligation to act in the best interests of their company. This includes paying small business creditors, employees and tax debts when due.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Consequences of getting it wrong</h2>
<p>ASIC does not hesitate to investigate and take action where company directors breach their obligations by misusing company assets, especially when those breaches cause harm to other small businesses. We are focussed on protecting small businesses and ensuring that there is a level playing field.</p>
<p>In the first three months of 2025, as a result of ASIC investigations:</p>
<ul>
<li>a director of two construction-related companies appeared in court charged with dishonestly using her position as a director to gain an advantage for herself. It is alleged that she transferred company funds to a credit card and other accounts and used the funds for her personal use. The two companies subsequently went into liquidation, with one of these owing money to small businesses which has not been repaid (refer&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-011mr-nsw-director-charged-with-dishonestly-using-her-position/" title="25-011MR NSW director charged with dishonestly using her position">25-011MR</a>).</li>
<li>a director of a beverage distribution company was found guilty by a court of dishonestly using his position to gain an advantage by using company funds to pay legal fees and other costs to annul his personal bankruptcy (refer&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-038mr-disqualified-company-director-convicted-of-dishonestly-using-his-position/" title="25-038MR Disqualified company director convicted of dishonestly using his position">25-038MR)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Company directors may face civil and criminal penalties if they breach their legal obligations. They may also be disqualified from acting as a director of a company.</p>
<p>In addition to ASIC investigations and enforcement action, there may be other consequences. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Australian Taxation Office takes action against directors personally in some cases for unpaid company tax debts.</li>
<li>If a company goes into liquidation, the liquidator will investigate the reasons for the collapse of the company. If the liquidator believes that a director has breached their obligations, they may sue the director seeking compensation. ASIC supports liquidators by prosecuting directors who fail to assist liquidators, including by providing books and records. For the period of 1 January 2025 - 31 March 2025, ASIC prosecuted a total of 34 individuals for 67 offences in failing to assist registered liquidators, with a total of $244,500 in fines and $4,360 in costs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Further information</h2>
<p>ASIC encourages company directors to seek&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/for-business/small-business/starting-a-small-business-company/legal-requirements-for-companies/#advice" title="Legal requirements for companies">professional advice</a>&nbsp;if they are uncertain about their legal obligations or have concerns about the company&rsquo;s finances. It is important to seek this advice early to avoid trouble.</p>
<p>In addition, ASIC&rsquo;s website has a&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/for-business/small-business/" title="Small business">small business section</a>, which contains information to assist small business company directors in understanding their obligations as company directors.</p>

<p><span>The agreements signed during the visit included a</span><span>&nbsp;strategic partnership for smart mobility solutions between Emirates Driving Company and Zenmov, a leading company in smart mobility solutions, and</span>&nbsp;<span>Abu Dhabi Chamber and&nbsp;</span><span>the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO) agreement to deepen business relations and create new opportunities for collaboration.</span></p>
<p>In addition, the Emirates Foundation's Nema initiative and Japan International Cooperation Center (JICE) inked an agreement to bolster cooperation to support achieving Nema's goal of reducing food loss and waste by 50 percent by 2030, in line with the UAE's National Food Security Strategy 2051 and U.N. Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
<p><b>His Excellency Shihab Ahmed Alfaheem, Ambassador of the UAE to Japan</b>, said: "The visit of the Abu Dhabi economic delegation to Japan underscores the strength and strategic depth of the UAE&ndash;Japan relationship &mdash; one that is rooted in decades of trust and collaboration, and now firmly focused on the future. Japan's global leadership in digital innovation, smart infrastructure, sustainable mobility, and advanced manufacturing aligns closely with Abu Dhabi's economic diversification goals and its ambition to build a resilient, knowledge-based, and climate-conscious economy."</p>
<p><b>H.E. Alfaheem added:</b>&nbsp;"This mission represents a pivotal moment in our bilateral ties, as we prepare to activate transformative frameworks such as the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA). CEPA will provide unprecedented access to markets, streamline cross-border investment, and facilitate greater technological exchange between our nations. It is through such frameworks that we will unlock the full potential of UAE&ndash;Japan collaboration across sectors &mdash; from clean energy and AI to startups and industrial R&amp;D. The UAE Embassy in Tokyo is proud to support this high-level engagement. We remain committed to fostering meaningful partnerships between Emirati and Japanese institutions, and to advancing shared priorities that will shape the next era of sustainable, innovation-led growth."</p>
<p>Bilateral trade between the UAE and Japan rose 4.8 percent&nbsp;to AED 182.4 billion (USD 49.7 billion) in 2024, compared to AED 174 billion (USD 47.4 billion) in 2023, while non-oil trade grew 2.2 percent over the same period, reflecting growing ties between the two economies. UAE investment in Japan has increased 100% over the past five years, while the country accounts for 80 percent of Japanese investments in the Middle East.</p>
<p>The Abu Dhabi economic delegation included senior officials and executives from government entities, private sector's companies, and startups, including the Department of Culture and Tourism &ndash; Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (ADX), ADGM, Abu Dhabi Investment Office (ADIO), Abu Dhabi Customs, Khalifa Fund for Enterprise Development,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abu Dhabi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ADCCI), ADNOC, KEZAD, Hub71, Abu Dhabi Airports, and major companies from different sectors.</p>

<title>Opening Remarks On Productivity Dynamics, Federal Reserve Governor Lisa D. Cook, At "Finishing The Job And New Challenges," A Monetary Policy Conference Hosted By The Hoover Institution, Stanford University, Stanford, California</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good afternoon. Thank you for moderating, Peter. It is an honor to be with you today, and it is always great to be back at Stanford and at the Hoover Institution. I spent several formative years of my career here, including as a National Fellow, and always enjoy returning. And it is a privilege to share the panel with Dr. Schnabel, and Presidents Musalem and Hammack. I look forward to our discussion.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20250509a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>Before that, I would like to briefly discuss a topic I see as critical to the future path of the economy: productivity growth. Productivity growth has been surprisingly strong in recent years, and this has influenced my view of the appropriate stance of monetary policy. I will also explore two ongoing developments that are likely to influence productivity growth moving forward: changes to trade policy and the wider adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). Productivity dynamics are something I have long studied closely and will continue to pay careful attention to as I consider the appropriate stance of monetary policy.</p>
<p>It is helpful to start by looking back about three years to the middle of 2022. At that point, the global economy had largely reopened after pandemic closures, a historic amount of federal support had been deployed, and unemployment was falling toward a half-century low. But supply disruptions persisted, and the 12-month inflation rate reached its peak at over 7 percent. The challenge for Federal Reserve policymakers was clear: Move inflation back toward its 2 percent target while maintaining the health of the labor market. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which I joined that year, began to raise the federal funds rate from near zero, ultimately reaching just above 5 percent by mid-2023. Many forecasters predicted that a recession in 2023 was more likely than not. And yet, one did not materialize. Instead, inflation came down considerably, while unemployment remained low. How did this unusual and welcome outcome happen?</p>
<p>Two notable factors were the unwinding of pandemic-era conditions that previously constrained the supply of both goods and labor in conjunction with restrictive monetary policy that contributed to a moderation in aggregate demand. Today, I would like to call attention to a third factor: a greater-than-usual increase in productivity during the pandemic recovery.</p>
<p>Prior to the pandemic, from 2007 to 2019, productivity growth in the business sector averaged 1.5 percent annually. In the past five years productivity growth accelerated to 2 percent. While some of the productivity gains may reflect situations unique to the reopening of the economy, it is notable that the level of productivity, as measured by output per hour, remained above trend throughout 2023 and 2024.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20250509a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;This increase in productivity was partially driven by pandemic labor shortages themselves. When it was difficult to find employees, as many Americans retired or stepped out of the labor force, many businesses innovated. For example, restaurants adopted online ordering apps and retailers accelerated the implementation of self-checkout systems.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20250509a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;These changes improved efficiency and contributed to an expansion in potential gross domestic product (GDP). As a result, price pressures eased from their peak while demand remained strong.</p>
<p>Improved productivity is widely beneficial to the economy. It allows workers to receive pay raises without companies needing to further increase prices and helps ensure consumers have access to the products and services they demand. Furthermore, and particularly relevant to me as a monetary policymaker, a rise in potential output lessens the need to use monetary policy to slow demand. This effect is good for the obvious reason that it allows for increasing economic growth without higher inflation. But importantly, it also lowers the risk of a policy overshoot that could cause the unemployment rate to rise.</p>
<p>Now that I have reviewed the role that productivity growth played in the post-pandemic recovery, I would like to focus on two countervailing forces on productivity that I am currently studying. These are changes to trade policy and the growth of AI.</p>
<p>I expect to see a drag on productivity in the near term stemming from the recent changes to trade policy and the related uncertainty, for several reasons. First, uncertainty around trade policy is likely to reduce business investment going forward. At this time, firms do not know the ultimate level and incidence of tariffs or their duration. Firms contemplating large investments might observe conditions that could hold under the paradox of thrift, wondering whether they could get a better deal if they just wait. Higher costs of imported materials and components could also cause firms to delay or scale back their investment plans. This reduction in capital formation can lead to slower technological innovation and adoption and decreased overall efficiency in production processes. Second, protectionist trade policies, while intended to support domestic industries, may inadvertently lead to a less competitive environment, if they prop up less efficient firms. And third, any supply-chain disruptions resulting from the policy changes would make production slower and less efficient. These disruptions can lead to inventory mismatches, production delays, and increased costs as firms scramble to find alternative suppliers or redesign their products to accommodate new input constraints. This set of disruptions could pose a particular challenge for monetary policymakers. A reduction in potential GDP means less slack in the economy, which, in turn, means greater inflationary pressure. According to the Taylor Principle, for which no explanation is needed at this conference, taming higher inflation requires a higher policy rate. I believe that keeping inflation expectations credibly anchored is essential. Therefore, all else equal, lower productivity could cause me to support keeping rates at a higher level for longer.</p>
<p>The second ongoing economic development I see altering productivity is the rapidly expanding use of AI. I view this emerging technology as likely to have a significant positive effect on productivity growth. In fact, I see AI as poised to be at least as transformative as other general purpose technologies, such as the printing press, the steam engine, and the internet. With wider adoption of AI, we could have a surge in potential output.</p>
<p>As I have discussed in several recent speeches, AI has the potential to revolutionize numerous sectors of our economy.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20250509a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;We already see AI assistants boosting productivity in customer service, software development, and medical diagnosis. AI's ability to process and analyze vast amounts of data could lead to breakthroughs in scientific research and innovation, resulting in an increased arrival rate of new ideas, further amplifying its effect on productivity.</p>
<p>Of course, an AI productivity boom would come with its own set of challenges. If potential output expands too rapidly, it could leave slack in the economy and the labor market. Moreover, the productivity gains from AI may not be uniform across all sectors, job types, or tasks, leading to a transitional period as the labor market adjusts. Despite these challenges, I am optimistic about AI and its potential to drive significant productivity growth in the coming years.</p>
<p>To summarize, I see an important role for productivity growth to play in assisting FOMC policymakers to achieve our dual-mandate goals. This dynamic played out, alongside other factors, in recent years when inflation eased from historic highs while the labor market remained solid. Two currently unfolding economic events are likely to influence productivity growth in the coming years&mdash;specifically, changes to trade policy and the expansion of AI. Those two developments may prove to run counter to each other, but it is too soon to predict precisely. I will be closely monitoring developments in this space. I look forward to engaging with those studying this topic including, I am sure, many in this room.</p>
<p>Thank you. I look forward to the discussion.</p>

<title>CFTC Charges Syracuse, N.Y., Man, His Firm With Fraud, Misappropriation</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-charges-syracuse-ny-man-his-firm-with-fraud-misappropriation-202559/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-charges-syracuse-ny-man-his-firm-with-fraud-misappropriation-202559/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced it filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York against&nbsp;<strong>Dean S. Dellas&nbsp;</strong>of Syracuse, New York,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>and his investment advisory company,&nbsp;<strong>DSD Capital Management, LLC</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>for fraud and misappropriation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In its complaint, the CFTC seeks restitution, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil monetary penalties, permanent trading and registration bans, and a permanent injunction against further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act, as charged.</p>
<p><strong>Case Background</strong></p>
<p>The complaint alleges Dellas and DSD Capital acted as commodity trading advisors who, from at least February 2021 through November 2023, committed fraud through material misrepresentations and omissions and misappropriation of more than $690,000 from at least two clients &mdash; a 61-year-old man (Client A) and his 91-year-old mother (Client B) &mdash; who had entrusted the defendants to manage their entire lifesavings.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The complaint alleges the defendants, who had complete authority over Client A&rsquo;s accounts, entered into tens of thousands of futures transactions without warning him of the inherent risks. These trades incurred more than $169,000 in trading losses and commissions. The defendants concealed these losses and commissions from Client A, assuring him his accounts were doing well. Although the defendants agreed and represented they would only charge fees equating to 10% of profits, they took considerably more than they were entitled. Indeed, despite the significant losses Client A had suffered, the defendants misappropriated more than $235,000 from Client A by secretly transferring to themselves large sums of Client A&rsquo;s money and fraudulently charging excessive, unjustified fees.</p>
<p>The complaint also alleges after succeeding in defrauding Client A, the defendants expanded their fraud to Client A&rsquo;s elderly mother, Client B. Without her knowledge, the defendants bought or sold futures contracts through Client B&rsquo;s account tens of thousands of times, causing her to incur more than $196,000 in trading losses and commissions. The defendants actively concealed these losses from Client B and misappropriated more than $459,000 from her by transferring to themselves large sums of her money and fraudulently charging fees that were excessive and unjustified given the defendants&rsquo; promise to only charge fees equating to 10% of profits.</p>
<p>According to the complaint, to keep their fraud ongoing, the defendants took various steps to conceal and obfuscate their conduct. Among other things, Dellas concealed the substance of documents he directed Clients A and B to sign and impersonated them in dealings with futures commission merchants.<span>&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Parallel Criminal Action</strong></p>
<p>On May 6, the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Northern District of New York unsealed an indictment charging Dean Dellas with wire fraud and aggravated identity theft in connection with the same scheme alleged in the CFTC&rsquo;s complaint.&nbsp;<em>United States v. Dellas</em>,&nbsp;<span>No. 5:25-cr-184 (N.D.N.Y.)</span>, ECF No.&nbsp;<span>1</span>&nbsp;(indictment).</p>
<p>The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the FBI and the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Northern District of New York.</p>
<p>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this case are Chrystal Gonnella, Dmitriy Vilenskiy, Derek S. Hammond, Jonah E. McCarthy, A. Daniell Ullman II, and Paul G. Hayeck.</p>
<p><span><strong>CFTC Fraud Advisories</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The CFTC has issued several customer protection&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/index.htm">Fraud Advisories and Articles&nbsp;</a><span>about how customers can detect, avoid, and report scams.</span></p>
<p>The CFTC also strongly urges the public to verify a company&rsquo;s registration with the CFTC at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nfa.futures.org/basicnet">NFA BASIC</a>&nbsp;before committing funds. If unregistered, a customer should be wary of providing funds to that entity.</p>
<p>Suspicious activities or information, such as possible violations of commodity trading laws, can be reported to the Division of Enforcement via a toll-free hotline 866-FON-CFTC (866-366-2382) or<a href="http://www.cftc.gov/ConsumerProtection/FileaTiporComplaint/index.htm">&nbsp;file a tip or complaint online</a>&nbsp;or contact the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whistleblower.gov/">Whistleblower Office</a>. Whistleblowers are eligible to receive between 10 and 30 percent of the monetary sanctions collected, paid from the Customer Protection Fund financed through monetary sanctions paid to the CFTC by violators of the CEA.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Volker, and thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250509a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>John Taylor is deservedly well known for his work on monetary policy rules, the best known of which bear his name. But in the early 1980s, John was part of a broader discussion about rules versus discretion in the setting of monetary policy.</p>
<p>The traditional argument for discretionary monetary policy was that any policy choice that a rule would recommend could be replicated by discretion, especially when policymakers are aware of the rule, but not vice versa. Discretion allowed more flexibility than a rule and thus was the dominant strategy for setting monetary policy.</p>
<p>Then, in 1977, Finn Kydland and Ed Prescott published their paper "Rules Rather than Discretion: The Inconsistency of Optimal Plans," which argued that policy promises made today may not be carried out in the future if there are advantages to reneging on those promises.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250509a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;Reneging on promises made by discretionary policymakers, they argued, is much easier than reneging on a policy rule, which is a way to commit to future actions.</p>
<p>Kydland and Prescott provided a simple and appealing model at the end of their paper. The model had an incentive for the central bank to renege on its promise to keep inflation low, since doing so would expand the economy and lower unemployment. If rational agents knew of this incentive, they would not find the promise of low inflation credible and would therefore raise their expectations for future inflation. The central bank would then have to validate those expectations with higher inflation to avoid a recession. In the end, the economy ends up in a high-inflation equilibrium with no gains from higher output or lower unemployment.</p>
<p>Kydland and Prescott then showed that if, on the other hand, the central bank could commit to following a rule to set policy, then it could not renege on its promises. As a result, inflation would stay low while yielding the same outcomes for output and employment. In this case, rules beat discretion. This was pathbreaking research, and it came to influence both the theory and practice of central banking. It was also part of the basis for Kydland and Prescott's Nobel Prize in Economics in 2004.</p>
<p>But commitment to most things in life is easier said than done. Even rules can be abandoned if it is optimal to do so. In the absence of commitment, can the central bank do anything to enhance the credibility of its promise to keep inflation low?</p>
<p>In 1983, Robert Barro and David Gordon used the Kydland&ndash;Prescott example to study reputation building by the central bank.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250509a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;The basic idea is to establish a reputation for fulfilling promises. But what promises can be made in a discretionary world that the public would find credible? They showed that promising the low-inflation outcome wasn't credible. However, the central bank could promise an inflation rate that was between the low-inflation equilibrium and the high-inflation equilibrium. If private individuals expected this intermediate inflation rate, then the gains from reneging would be reduced just enough to dissuade the central bank from breaking its promise. Consequently, promises to deliver this intermediate inflation rate were credible, and society was better off than it would be in the high-inflation world, showing that credibility really mattered in a world in which commitment was not feasible.</p>
<p>I now introduce John Taylor and his work into the story, which coincided with the beginning of my own research career.</p>
<p>In 1983, having read the Barro and Gordon paper, I started working on reputation-building strategies as part of my Ph.D. dissertation research. In the process, I was struck by the thought that the building of credibility and reputation hinges on the person setting monetary policy at the time: If that person leaves, does the central bank have to start over to rebuild its credibility? At the time, I had in mind Paul Volcker, whose personal credibility seemed so crucial in the Federal Reserve's campaign to vanquish high inflation. Relying on the credibility of individual policymakers seemed like a weak foundation for sustaining the credibility of policy promises.</p>
<p>That is when I went back and read John Taylor's discussion of the Barro and Gordon paper in the&nbsp;<em>Journal of Monetary Economics</em>.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250509a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;John applauded the analytical contribution that Barro and Gordon&mdash;as well as Kydland and Prescott&mdash;had made, but he was skeptical about the practical applicability of their story. In his critique, John said, "In other well-recognized time inconsistency situations, society seems to have found ways to institute the optimal (cooperative) policy."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250509a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a></p>
<p>As I read that sentence, I thought, "How does society build credibility into the institution instead of relying on the credibility of an individual?" That one sentence that John wrote in 1983 set me off on a 20-year journey studying central bank design.</p>
<p>So where did it lead me?</p>
<p>Around that time, Ken Rogoff published his paper on what he referred to as "conservative" central bankers.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250509a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;In his terminology, a conservative central banker was someone who disliked inflation more than the rest of society did. Rogoff showed that a conservative central banker would choose a lower rate of inflation than the average citizen but at the cost of greater instability of output and employment. This tradeoff improved social well-being, but there was one catch to this solution&mdash;there had to be safeguards to guarantee that the conservative central banker could not be fired for this policy decision, ensuring that these promises to control inflation were credible. In short, the central bank had to be independent and protected from the threats to its independence.</p>
<p>This type of institutional design issue was one that I was interested in researching.</p>
<p>Up until Rogoff's work, the underlying assumption had been that the central bank was trying to maximize social welfare and that its preferences were aligned with those of society. Think of it as a "representative agent" economy. But as I read Rogoff's work, it suggested that society consisted of people who had a variety of views about inflation, meaning that they would also have different views on the tradeoff between inflation and output stability. Consequently, members of society may have different views on how conservative the central banker should be. But where are these views coming from?</p>
<p>So I tried to endogenize the heterogeneity in preferences. I had the idea that individuals all had the same fundamental preferences for inflation and output stability but that they varied if they worked in different sectors of the economy. In one sector, wages and employment were determined in a standard competitive fashion. In the other sector, wages were determined by wage contracts, and employment was determined by demand. Thus, when a negative shock hit the economy, the wage contract workers suffered a bigger reduction in employment because wages couldn't adjust, whereas in the competitive sector, wages would adjust to soften the blow to employment&mdash;implying that if the wage contract sector got to choose a conservative central banker, they would want a more dovish central banker who would accept higher inflation in return for greater employment stability. The flexible wage workers wanted the opposite: They were more hawkish on inflation because they didn't bear the same employment volatility. The punchline was that if political parties formed around workers from different sectors, then they would install central bankers with different policy preferences if they won the election.</p>
<p>It was around that time that I read Alberto Alesina's paper on "partisan business cycles."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250509a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;In that paper, he assumed there were different political parties, each having different preferences about inflation and unemployment. One party was more concerned with price stability and less concerned about output stability than the other. Monetary policy and inflation outcomes were determined by the party that won a national election. As power changed hands after an election, monetary policy would differ from expected policy depending on who won the election. These election surprises would create volatility in monetary policy and thus inflation and output. In other words, elections would lead to partisan business cycles. In Alesina's model, monetary policy was fully accountable to the electorate, which is desirable, but it came at the cost of causing greater economic instability.</p>
<p>This was a brilliant paper, but, again, it raised a serious question for me: Why would society choose full electoral accountability and maximum volatility in monetary policy? Economists usually think there are tradeoffs on the margin such that "corner solutions" like these aren't optimal. It seemed to me that there could be a welfare-improving institutional design for the central bank. I looked at the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors structure, and I felt that electoral accountability could be achieved through the appointment process, but economic instability would be reduced by having a monetary policy board composed of current and past appointees who set policy according to majority rule. This thinking led me to taking a variant of Alesina's model and studying how a policy board would change his results.</p>
<p>I assumed that board members were appointed by the winning party of an election to serve for multiple periods. This appointment process provided accountability to the electorate via the nomination and confirmation process. To ensure that economic stability would be improved, I assumed these members served staggered and long (relative to the election cycle) terms in office.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250509a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;Furthermore, as in Rogoff's model, board members could not be removed from office. This feature of the model captured the idea that the central bank board would be independent.</p>
<p>My research showed that by having an independent policy board set monetary policy, social well-being was improved relative to Alesina's results. Accountability to the electorate could be achieved through the nomination and confirmation process, and economic stability was enhanced by having a group of individuals set policy who could not be removed from office. This structure is the one that we have in place today at the Federal Reserve. I would argue that it has stood the test of time, and I hope that it continues to be in place for years to come.</p>
<p>To conclude, I have come full circle in my professional life&mdash;from first reading that sentence that John wrote in 1983 to researching central bank independence and central bank boards for 20 years to then becoming a central bank board member, which led me here today. So, I can finally thank John for sending me on a wonderful journey that he had no idea he launched me on.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Meta, the social media giant, is reportedly exploring the integration of stablecoins across its platforms. While the exact purpose remains unclear, one potential application could be lowering transaction fees. Sources indicate that Meta may pursue a multi-token strategy, possibly supporting popular stablecoins such as Tether&rsquo;s USDt, Circle&rsquo;s USD Coin, and others.</p>
<p>Arnoud Star Busmann, CEO of European stablecoin provider Quantoz Payments, weighed in on the development:<br />&ldquo;This development makes perfect sense - it is already common practice in the metaverse and video-gaming industries to use stablecoins to enter the in-game economy. So in that regards, there's nothing new here - just the sheer scale potential of the Meta ecosystem underlines the acceleration of adoption of stablecoins as superior payment rails.&rdquo;</p>

<title>ICE Launches EU Carbon Allowance 2 Futures - Expanding the Most Liquid Environmental Derivatives Markets in the World</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ice-launches-eu-carbon-allowance-2-futures-expanding-the-most-liquid-environme-202559/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, announced the launch this week of EU Carbon Allowance (EUA) 2 futures, with the contract now available to trade alongside ICE&rsquo;s benchmark EUA futures and options, the most liquid carbon derivatives market in the world.</p>
<p>The EUA 2 futures contract launched on May 6, 2025, with the first trades taking place on the same day, totaling the equivalent of 5,000 EUA 2 allowances.</p>
<p>Reflecting how many carbon markets are expanding their scope and coverage, the European Union has created a new emissions trading system called the Emissions Trading System 2 (ETS2) which is designed to cover carbon dioxide emissions from fuel combustion in buildings and road transport. The ETS2 is expected to become operational in 2027 and double the scope of the existing EU ETS to 80% of the EU economy, expanding the number of covered entities to approximately 20,000.</p>
<p>&ldquo;2025 marks twenty-five years since ICE began investing in and building global energy and environmental markets, and today ICE&rsquo;s markets provide the price signals and liquidity that allow companies to manage the uncertainties of decarbonization,&rdquo; said Gordon Bennett, Global Head of Environmental Markets at ICE. &ldquo;The carbon price set by the EU ETS2 can provide a market incentive for investments in building renovations and low-emissions mobility and by offering futures covering this new system, ICE is delivering price signals to customers who are mandated to account for the cost of pollution in these new sectors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Macquarie is pleased to participate in the launch of the ICE EUA 2 futures contract,&rdquo; said German Tyeles, a Senior Vice President within Macquarie&rsquo;s Commodities and Global Markets business. &ldquo;We have supported clients across environmental markets worldwide for almost two decades and look forward to putting our commodities expertise to work in this emerging space.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are excited to see ICE yet again playing a pioneering role in providing market participants such as Mercuria with the necessary instruments to enable price discovery in these new sectors covered in the EU's approach to carbon pricing,&rdquo; said James Cooper, Head of Origination EMEA, Environmental Products at Mercuria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;ICE&rsquo;s launch of an EUA 2 contract marks a significant milestone in the evolution of Europe&rsquo;s carbon markets, enhancing price transparency and strengthening Trafigura&rsquo;s ability to manage risk on behalf of their customers in newly affected sectors,&rdquo; said Hannah Hauman, Global Head of Carbon Trading at Trafigura.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Statkraft strongly believes in carbon markets as a market-based tool to fight climate change and renew the way the world is powered,&rdquo; said Misja Nuyens, Head of Global Environmental Markets at Statkraft. &ldquo;We have been supportive of the EU ETS as a core in the EU energy transition from the very start in 2005 and contributed to the liquidity of the market through our trading activities. Statkraft is therefore pleased to witness the launch of the EUA 2 contract on ICE.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We fully support transparent, market-based platforms that enable fair carbon dioxide pricing,&rdquo; said Dr. Arne Weber, Head of Power, Gas &amp; Emissions at Mabanaft. &ldquo;These new instruments offer a valuable opportunity to manage long-term carbon dioxide risks and provide the essential price signals needed to drive investment and decision-making in the energy transition. A well-functioning market is fundamental to achieving carbon dioxide management in an economically viable way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The launch of the EUA 2 futures contract is a critical step in helping market participants prepare for the expansion of the EU carbon market. We at Vertis see a growing interest from companies, particularly in sectors not currently covered by ETS1, as they assess the financial implications of future compliance,&rdquo; said Bartosz Wilamowski, Head of Sales - EU ETS at Vertis. &ldquo;Unlike the early days of ETS1, we expect ETS2 to drive more immediate and material cost exposure. This new contract brings much-needed price transparency, enabling businesses to better plan and manage their carbon-related financial risks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Global Factor welcomes the launch of ICE&rsquo;s EUA 2 futures contract. This new instrument will play a crucial role in sending clear price signals to support the decarbonization of road transport and residential energy use at the lowest cost,&rdquo; said Kepa Solaun, CEO of Global Factor. &ldquo;It also offers an essential tool for managing the risks faced by the companies we work with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The EUA 2 futures contract is the latest addition to ICE&rsquo;s global environmental markets which offer the most liquid venues to trade European, North American, and U.K. environmental programs. The equivalent to over $1 trillion worth of environmental contracts trade on ICE each year and since launch over 173 billion carbon allowances, 655 million renewable energy certificates and over 6 billion tons of carbon credits have traded across ICE&rsquo;s global markets.</p>

<title>Assessing Maximum Employment, Federal Reserve Governor Adriana D. Kugler, At the Reykjavík Economic Conference 2025, Central Bank of Iceland, Reykjavík, Iceland</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-8">
<p>Thank you, Francine, and thank you to the Central Bank of Iceland for the invitation to speak to you today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250509a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>My subject is the Federal Reserve's mandate of maximum employment. In the Fed's monetary policymaking, maximum employment and stable prices are linked in the mandate assigned to the Federal Reserve by U.S. law, which we refer to as the dual mandate. Icelanders, I know, are a seafaring people, and those here will understand what I mean when I say that the dual mandate is our "lodestar," a word our two languages share. It is our goal and our guide in setting monetary policy.</p>
<p>There is an important distinction between our dual-mandate goals. For reasons that I will explain, while the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has defined "stable prices" as 2 percent annual inflation, such numerical precision is not possible in defining maximum employment.</p>
<p>To achieve price stability, the Fed adopted a numerical target for inflation in 2012 that hasn't changed. It has remained unchanged because the Committee has repeatedly reaffirmed the judgment that it made in 2012 that 2 percent inflation is the rate most consistent with its statutory mandate. In contrast, the Federal Reserve has not spelled out a numerical goal for the unemployment rate or some other measure of employment because maximum employment can move up and down over time and is not directly measurable, and also because the different factors that determine it are either difficult or impossible to measure in real time.</p>
<p><span>Plan of the Talk</span><br />The unemployment rate is the statistic that the public most often uses to form views about labor market conditions, and it is also the statistic that economists most often use to try to infer maximum employment. And economists frequently refer to u* as the unemployment rate that corresponds to maximum employment. That said, in my speech today, I would like to offer historical examples of why u* varies over time and why it would be a mistake to assume that it is a fixed number.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250509a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;Then, I will review the evolution of the unemployment rate over the past two decades and show that this rate has varied over time, moved by the interplay of myriad factors such as demographics, labor market regulations, changes in business or consumer confidence, or cyclical changes in aggregate demand and monetary policy shocks. In contrast, u* is moved mostly by either structural changes, such as skill deterioration or capital depreciation, or by long-run factors in the labor market, such as the demographic and skill composition of the population. As a result, u* does not move as much as the unemployment rate over time.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250509a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;This is significant because monetary policy is aimed at managing the business cycle to minimize deviations from maximum employment.</p>
<p>In reviewing the unemployment rate, I will also note that it certainly bears valuable information, but, in many cases, this needs to be complemented with other labor market indicators to have a fuller picture of the state of the economy.</p>
<p>As I have noted, maximum employment is not directly measurable. Likewise, we cannot observe u* directly, and it has to be inferred by statistical techniques, which I'll review.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250509a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;One element common to all the approaches that I review is that they use a number of labor market indicators in addition to the unemployment rate in forming their estimates of maximum employment. Another element in common to some of the approaches is that they try to separate transient factors, or higher-frequency variation, from a more permanent, long-run feature of the economy that can be interpreted as u*.</p>
<p><span>Case Study: The Assumption of a Fixed Maximum Employment in the 1970s</span><br />A common assumption in the economics profession during the 1960s was that u* was 4 percent.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250509a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a></p>
<p>While this number might have been a decent approximation of u* during that period, it did not consider the possibility of meaningful changes in that value and, specifically, changes due to the rapid growth in labor supply from the post&ndash;World War II baby boomers entering the workforce. Especially because younger workers have higher levels of unemployment, the advent of the baby boomers meant that u* in the 1970s was surely higher than 4 percent. The Federal Reserve was slow in revising its estimate of u*. The high unemployment rate and too low fixed estimate of u* minimum unemployment, in conjunction with the failure to recognize the slowdown in trend productivity, led the Federal Reserve to exaggerate the estimate of slack in the economy and maintain monetary policy that was too loose, adding to other factors driving persistently high inflation over that decade.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250509a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;This experience led the Federal Reserve to recognize that a fixed 4 percent value for u* was a poor basis for understanding the cyclical position of the economy.</p>
<p>The experience of the 1960s and 1970s made it clear that demographic changes need to be considered in estimating u*&mdash;a topic I will explore further in my speech.</p>
<p><span>The U.S. Labor Market over the Past Two Decades</span><br />The U.S. labor market over the past two decades provides some valuable circumstantial evidence for how maximum employment can change over time. Let me start by discussing the Great Recession, which began in late 2007 and was driven by a severe financial crisis. In the months before the recession began, the unemployment rate reached a low of 4.4 percent and then peaked at 10 percent in October 2009. Although the unemployment rate is a useful metric of the severity of that event, an additional variable that reflects the depth and persistence of the downturn in the labor market after the Great Recession was the share of long-term unemployed&mdash;the percentage of unemployed people out of work for 27 weeks or more&mdash;which was nearly twice as high as during the deep recession of the 1980s. Longer spells of unemployment can generate persistence because the longer the duration of unemployment for workers, the more their skills erode and the harder it is to become reemployed, leading, in turn, to higher unemployment, a phenomenon known as hysteresis. While some have argued that only workers unemployed for shorter durations should be counted in estimating the slack in the economy, hysteresis is an important part of slack during periods with high unemployment.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250509a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;Instead, the experience of the Great Recession reinforced the value of consulting other useful measures of slack.</p>
<p>After the Great Recession, it took eight years for the unemployment rate to reach the pre-recession low, but when it did, in 2016, it continued to fall, reaching 3.5 percent in 2019 and remaining close to this level until the beginning of the COVID-19 recession in 2020. One thing that was remarkable about this period was that this low level of unemployment occurred without any escalation of inflation. Personal consumption expenditures inflation ran well below an annual rate of 2 percent for almost all of the decade after the Great Recession, when monetary policy was highly accommodative. One could infer that u* had moved down over this period.</p>
<p>Turning to the pandemic recession, the unemployment rate rose to nearly 15 percent in two months, but a distinguishing feature of this increase was that a large fraction of the unemployed were temporarily laid off.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250509a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;Economic research suggests that those who lose their jobs via temporary layoffs have a high likelihood of being recalled, with the latest estimates suggesting a 60 percent probability.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250509a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;Considering this, it was not surprising that the post-pandemic recovery was characterized by a fast decline in the unemployment rate.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250509a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;In this sense, the unemployment rate alone was not a sufficient indicator of the true state of the labor market. In the post-pandemic recovery, the unemployment rate fell to 3.4 percent by April 2023. Again, for a second time we saw the unemployment rate falling to levels that were in the past associated with price pressures, whereas in this case inflation was also falling.</p>
<p>In summary, the past two recessions underscored that there are useful statistics beyond the unemployment rate that help inform a reading of maximum employment, and the past two recoveries suggest that the U.S. economy may sustain unemployment as low as 3.5 percent.</p>
<p>Turning to the current state of the labor market, the unemployment rate has risen only very slowly, and it has moved within a tight range of around 4.2 percent, which is its current reading. In addition, temporary layoffs are back at their pre-pandemic level, and vacancies and quits have leveled off. As a consequence, I judge the labor market to be stable. Most likely, the labor market is also close to maximum employment given that the estimates of u* from some of the models that I will consider in the rest of this speech are in the vicinity of 4.2 percent.</p>
<p>I have used some historical examples to illustrate how the unemployment rate has changed over time, and I have made some informal inference on the movements of u* in certain periods. Now let me explore different ways of estimating maximum employment. I will cover three separate methods: a method that uses the demographic composition of the population; a definition that considers the unemployment rate in conjunction with inflation in order to get closer to a definition of u* consistent with stable prices; and, lastly, a definition that focuses on maximum employment that one can obtain by taking into account that workers take time to find jobs and firms take time to fill job openings. Some of the models that I review also consider the labor force participation rate, as structural variation in this rate also affects maximum employment. Historical experience with the different forces that can move around maximum employment indicates that all three of these approaches could be helpful in the future when trying to estimate maximum employment.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250509a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a></p>
<p><span>Estimation of Maximum Employment Using Demographics</span><br />In describing the impact of the baby boomers on the labor market, I have already provided an example of how the demographic composition of the workforce may affect maximum employment. More generally, the age distribution in the population or educational attainment or skill distribution are always important factors in evaluating the potential workforce. Beyond the composition of the workforce, developments within specific demographic subgroups also may be relevant for maximum employment. For instance, the increase in labor force participation of women over the past 50 years has been an important factor that has augmented the available workforce. Granular data from the Labor Department's monthly survey of household employment known as the Current Population Survey, sometimes in conjunction with data on job openings and flows in and out of employment, can add demographic details to the estimation of maximum employment.</p>
<p>The models that exploit demographic data separate the trend or structural factors in both the unemployment rate and labor force participation rate from transient factors in individual demographic groups, allowing an estimate of maximum employment.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250509a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a>&nbsp;I think of this as a "bottom up" approach.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250509a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a></p>
<p>One can add an additional layer of complexity in working with demographic groups. One important aspect of the unemployment rate is its characteristic countercyclical dynamics&mdash;that is, the way this rate increases at the onset of recessions due to an increase in the flow out of employment or layoffs, and its decline in expansions as more unemployed workers find jobs and flow into employment. In recognition of the importance of these flows, one alternative to extracting trends by demographic group is to extract trends in the flows by demographic groups and reconstruct u* dynamics from those flows. The implicit assumption is that the trend components of flows into and out of unemployment capture structural characteristics of the labor market, including market imperfections and the cost of job searches for both workers and employers.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250509a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;The models in this class estimate a trend unemployment rate in the range between 4.1 and 4.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250509a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a></p>
<p><span>Estimation of Maximum Employment Consistent with Stable Prices</span><br />As I mentioned, the dual mandate includes stable prices. The models that I have just described do not contain information on prices. However, one may include price information by adding inflation as a measure of aggregate price pressures in order to come up with an estimate of maximum employment consistent with stable prices.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250509a.htm#fn16" title="footnote 16"><span>16</span></a><a name="f16"></a>&nbsp;A higher unemployment rate signals more workers are available to work, indicating more slack. As more workers are employed, the economy is moving to a situation of fewer resources being available for additional output and most likely to more price pressures. Maximum employment consistent with stable prices ideally strikes a balance between additional workers being hired and additional increases in prices. I have alluded to this concept in an informal way when arguing that in the period after the Great Recession, u* may have moved down through 2019.</p>
<p>In practice, inflation information is folded into the model by adding a relationship between prices and the unemployment rate known as the Philips curve. There is a long tradition in extracting trend employment consistent with stable prices using a various labor market and output measures. I will draw upon that heritage and briefly describe a model that like the statistical methods that I have already reviewed also aims at estimating maximum employment by separating the unemployment rate from cyclical factors, but it does so by using numerous output and labor market indicators in conjunction with price information.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250509a.htm#fn17" title="footnote 17"><span>17</span></a><a name="f17"></a>&nbsp;Output indicators include both gross domestic product and gross domestic income. Among labor market indicators, in addition to the unemployment rate, there are payrolls, the workweek, and labor force participation, which means that the model is not limited to just the unemployment rate in inferring trend unemployment. The purpose of using many indicators is the belief that all of them follow the same cycle, and that it is easier to identify and separate the cycle from trend using a large set of indicators. Coming back to the Phillips curve, I would note that models that estimate u* are somewhat sensitive to the specification of the Phillips curve. For instance, the model that I have just described has a u* estimate of about 5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024, but alternative Phillips curve specifications may lower it below 5 percent.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250509a.htm#fn18" title="footnote 18"><span>18</span></a><a name="f18"></a></p>
<p><span>Estimation of the Efficient Level of Employment</span><br />A third, often less mentioned concept of full employment is the "efficient" level of unemployment. This concept starts with the idea that it is inefficient for society to have unemployed workers and job openings. Society as a whole would gain by matching those workers with those job openings in a productive way. Of course, it is impossible to instantaneously reduce unemployed workers and job openings to zero. Newly unemployed workers take time to find a job, and vacancies take time to fill as firms find and screen applicants with the right skills. The empirical relationship between the unemployment rate and the job openings rate is summarized by the Beveridge curve, a downward-sloping curve along which more unemployed workers are associated with fewer job openings. The Beveridge curve is a structural aspect of the labor market, and it is effectively a constraint on the relationship between the unemployment rate and the job openings rate. However, given the Beveridge curve, monetary policymakers can try to move the economy along the curve closer to a point at which the total number of vacancies plus unemployed is minimized. One can show that this happens somewhere in between the two, precisely around a value of the unemployment rate equal to the geometric average of the unemployment and vacancy rate.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250509a.htm#fn19" title="footnote 19"><span>19</span></a><a name="f19"></a>&nbsp;The current estimate of this full employment concept places the unemployment rate at 4.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024.</p>
<p><span>Conclusion and Policy Message</span><br />I want to draw some conclusions from the points I have made today.</p>
<p>My discussion has touched upon many different statistics of the labor market, including the possibility of using data that exploits the heterogeneity of different demographic groups, which I judge to be very informative about u*. The reason is that different business cycles are generated by different shocks that affect the economy in different ways, so that useful indicators of slack in past cycles may not be as insightful in the future. For instance, when there is slack in the labor market, measures taking into account unemployment duration can be more informative about the persistence of unemployment and future slack. By contrast, when labor markets are tight, measures of flows into, out of, and across jobs will give a better measure of the job opportunities for workers and potential upward pressures on wages. Similarly, the vacancy and unemployment ratio combination used in the definition of efficient u* can provide an alternative measure of maximum employment.</p>
<p>Of course, any one of the estimation techniques that I have reviewed has limitations. For instance, there are constraints on the number of indicators that each model can process. This implies that some models will be better at capturing some drivers of maximum employment than others. That is why I cannot point to the best statistic or best model of maximum employment. I can only acknowledge that a rich set of models and indicators only benefits the policymaker. Given the uncertainty in estimating maximum employment in real time and the many options available, I consider it undesirable to adopt one particular measure to guide monetary policy. This is something to bear in mind as I approach the current review of the FOMC's Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which we call our framework.</p>

<p><a name="fn2"></a>2. In fact, early on, economists have embarked to estimate the time-varying maximum employment in the economy. At least since Perry (1970), it was noted that u* can vary over time; see George L. Perry (1970),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/1970/12/1970c_bpea_perry_schultze_solow_gordon.pdf">"Changing Labor Markets and Inflation," (PDF)</a>&nbsp;<em>Brookings Papers on Economic Activity,</em>&nbsp;no. 3, pp. 411&ndash;48.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn3"></a>3. Consistent with the view that u* moves less than the unemployment rate over time, in this speech, most of the models that I review assume that u* is the trend component of the unemployment rate. For an alternative view that challenges the weaker cyclicality of u* relative to the unemployment rate, see Robert E. Hall and Marianna Kudlyak (2023),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w31848">"The Active Role of the Natural Rate of Unemployment,"</a>&nbsp;NBER Working Paper Series 31848 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, November; revised December 2024).&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="fn8"></a>8. In addition, the rise in temporary layoffs was considered by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to be understated, because many respondents to the Current Population Survey misreported their status as employed but not at work&mdash;that is, the properly measured unemployment rate would have risen by much more than was actually reported; see, for example, page 6 of the May 2020 Employment Situation report, which is available on the Bureau of Labor Statistics' website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/empsit_06052020.pdf">https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/empsit_06052020.pdf</a>.&nbsp;</p>

Lilien (1980), "The Cyclical Pattern of Temporary Layoffs in United States Manufacturing,"&nbsp;<em>Review of Economics and Statistics</em>, vol. 62 (February), pp. 24&ndash;31.

<p><a name="fn10"></a>10. Moreover, academic research also suggests that the extent of firms' recourse to temporary layoffs is correlated with firms' expectations of near-term economic activity. This would have suggested in real time that a sharp rise in temporary layoffs was not as worrisome as a similar increase in permanent job losses. See Arash Nekoei and Andrea Weber (2020),&nbsp;<a href="https://cepr.org/publications/dp14845">"Seven Facts about Temporary Layoffs,"</a>&nbsp;CEPR Discussion Paper 14845 (London: Centre for Economic Policy Research, June 3).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn11"></a>11. Some studies distinguish long-run unemployment, which would fall in the first category of models that use demographic information, from stable price unemployment, which also adds a Phillips curve to the model. For a recent review, see Richard K. Crump, Christopher J. Nekarda, and Nicolas Petrosky-Nadeau (2020),&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2020.072">"Unemployment Rate Benchmarks,"</a>&nbsp;Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2020-072 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, August).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn12"></a>12. The resulting unemployment rate trend can be thought of as a "natural rate." The first reference to a "natural rate" of unemployment is from Milton Friedman in 1968. Friedman made it clear that he used the term to try and separate real forces from monetary forces, which are assumed to be more transient; therefore, it seems appropriate to use the term "natural rate" for estimates from demographic trends. See Milton Friedman (1968), "The Role of Monetary Policy,"&nbsp;<em>American Economic Review</em><em>,</em>&nbsp;vol. 58 (March), pp. 1&ndash;17. That said, such a concept is controversial; see Richard Rogerson (1997), "Theory Ahead of Language in the Economics of Unemployment,"&nbsp;<em>Journal of Economic Perspectives</em>, vol. 11 (Winter), pp. 73&ndash;92.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="fn16"></a>16. Estimates that use prices are sometimes referred to as the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment, or NAIRU, although NAIRU is somewhat of a misnomer. In fact, the inflation process in the Great Moderation is not described well by an accelerationist Phillips curve but rather by a mean reverting process around a stable trend, conveniently proxied by long-run inflation expectations. In that case, it would be more accurate to talk about "NIRU," or non-inflationary rate of unemployment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>Today at Southwark Crown Court, Matthew and Nikolas West pleaded guilty to insider dealing, following a prosecution brought by the FCA.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>Between November 2016 and January 2020, Matthew West used confidential, inside, information to deal in shares in four companies: Proactis Holdings Plc, Palace Capital Plc, Concha Plc, and Bushveld Minerals Limited.</p>
<p>Matthew West also disclosed inside information to his brother Nikolas West in relation to a fifth company, Asimilar Group Plc. Nikolas West used this inside information to deal.</p>
<p>The total profits from the dealing were &pound;42,948.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Matthew West obtained the inside information from brokers that contacted him legitimately. He then disclosed and traded using this information, which is against the law.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pair pleaded guilty to 6 instances of insider dealing. They will be sentenced on 3 July 2025 at Southwark Crown Court. The FCA will also apply for confiscation orders in relation to proceeds of crime.</p>
<p>Steve Smart, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said:</p>
<p>'Matthew West repeatedly tried to make a quick profit at the expense of the rest of the market. As professional investors, the West brothers clearly knew what they were doing was wrong.</p>
<p>'Fighting financial crime is a priority for the FCA. We will clamp down hard on those like the Wests who undermine the integrity of UK markets.'</p>
<h2>Background:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Matthew West was born 14 March 1981.</li>
<li>Nikolas West was born 14 December 1978.</li>
<li>Matthew and Nikolas West worked as professional day traders using their own accounts and through companies controlled by them, which is why they received inside information from brokers.</li>
<li>Brokers provide legitimate information via &lsquo;wall crossing&rsquo;. Wall crossing means providing non-public and price-sensitive information to a third party, and it is a legitimate practice in financial markets. When investors are &lsquo;wall crossed&rsquo; there is a non-trading and confidentiality agreement in place.</li>
<li>As these offences predate 1 November 2021, when the maximum sentence available increased to 10 years, the insider dealing here is punishable by a fine and/or up to 7 years&rsquo; imprisonment.</li>

<p>Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250509a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;In my remarks, I would like to address a key question facing economists, policymakers, and people all over the world: How will artificial intelligence, particularly generative artificial intelligence, or GenAI, affect workers and the labor market in the years ahead?</p>
<p>Before I turn to that issue, I'd like to touch on a topic that I expect is also of interest: the outlook for the U.S. economy and the implications for monetary policy.</p>
<p>The U.S. economy entered this quarter in a relatively strong position: The unemployment rate has been low and stable, and the disinflationary process has continued on a gradual, albeit uneven, path towards our 2 percent objective. Private domestic final purchases have been solid. Overall, the economy has been resilient.</p>
<p>Against that backdrop, the outlook has been clouded by trade policies that have led to an increase in uncertainty, contributing to declines in measures of consumer and business sentiment. I expect tariffs to lead to higher inflation in the United States and lower growth both in the United States and abroad starting later this year.</p>
<p>In my view, higher tariffs could lead to disruption to global supply chains and create persistent upward pressure on inflation. Faced with substantial tariffs, businesses will likely change how they source intermediate inputs, and it will take time and investment for them to reroute their distribution networks. Conversely, global trade networks may change rapidly, and some suppliers may not be able to adapt quickly enough to survive these changes. This concern is particularly acute for small businesses, which are less diversified, less able to access credit, and hence more vulnerable to adverse shocks. Small businesses play a vital role in production networks, often providing specialized inputs that can't easily be sourced elsewhere, and business failures could further disrupt supply chains. As we saw during the pandemic, such disruptions can have large and lasting effects on prices, as well as output.</p>
<p>I am equally concerned that tariffs will lead to higher unemployment as the economy slows. Thus, the FOMC may be in a difficult position if we were to see both rising inflation and rising unemployment.</p>
<p>The size and scope of the recent tariff increases are without modern precedent, we don't know their final form, and it is too soon to know how they will affect the economy. Yet given the economy's strong starting point and the progress we have made in bringing inflation back toward our 2 percent objective, monetary policy is in a good position to adjust as conditions unfold. Meanwhile, we will also be closely monitoring how technologies like artificial intelligence are being integrated into economic activity and analyzing the implications for how the economy will evolve.</p>
<p>Let me now return to the longer-term question of how AI will affect the labor market. Debate about machines replacing workers is nothing new, and even artificial intelligence is not particularly new either. AI has, in some form, arguably been around for decades. Computer scientists have been developing machine learning algorithms for many years, and these algorithms have been widely used in commercial applications, such as fraud detection and advertising. Speech and facial recognition are already ubiquitous. These more long-standing forms of AI are continuing to improve, driving progress in domains ranging from finance to medical diagnosis, and becoming so deeply embedded in our daily lives that we scarcely notice them anymore.</p>
<p>But GenAI promises to go much further. Unlike traditional machine learning techniques, which often focus on relatively simple prediction and classification tasks, the large language models that have emerged in recent years can generate new content&mdash;anything from news articles to computer code to images and video to customer service dialogue. Emerging forms of "agentic" AI can undertake complex, multistep tasks&mdash;for example, taking a customer through a transaction and then placing an automated order. As AI continues to develop, it will increasingly be combined with physical technologies like autonomous vehicles and advanced robotics, further extending its ability to interact with the real world. And AI may be shaping up to become what the esteemed economist Zvi Griliches called an "invention of a method of inventing" that speeds up the research and development process itself.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250509a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a></p>
<p>Growing evidence indicates that AI will be a "general purpose technology"&mdash;such as railroads, electricity, or computers&mdash;which is characterized by widespread adoption, complementary progress in many downstream applications, and ongoing improvement in the core technology.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250509a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;Past general purpose technologies have dramatically improved productivity. So, against this background, the natural question is, what about AI?</p>
<p>In trying to understand how AI might transform work, it's useful to consider how it could be applied in individual occupations, each of which comprises a range of tasks that vary in their susceptibility to automation. Like past waves of information technology, AI will substitute for human labor in some tasks, complement human labor in other tasks, and spur the creation of new tasks that humans will perform, at least initially.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250509a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;The net effects of AI on employment, both in the aggregate and across demographic and education groups, will depend on the relative size of these offsetting effects.</p>
<p>A pessimistic view is that AI and robotics could become so capable and cost effective as to render most human labor obsolete, culminating in mass unemployment. Such concerns about technological advances are hardly a novel development. At least since the Luddites of the early 19th century tried to disable textile looms, people have feared that machines would bring about steep declines in employment, wages, and human welfare.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250509a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a></p>
<p>Economists have long been skeptical of that view, which suffers from the "lump of labor fallacy"&mdash;the presumption that there's a fixed amount of work to be done, so if machines do it, humans will not.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250509a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;New technologies do eliminate some existing occupations, and not all workers benefit from technological change. But technology also creates new occupations, and the many waves of technological advances over the centuries haven't rendered humans obsolete. For example, many of the tasks that were performed by humans in the 1950s are now performed by computers and robots, and yet the unemployment rate is similar to what it was back then, while the labor force participation rate is higher overall.</p>
<p>However, the amazing potential capabilities and breadth of applications associated with AI&mdash;many of which are already apparent&mdash;make it worth asking whether this time may be different. AI holds enormous promise of faster economic growth, advances in human health, and a higher standard of living. But alongside the kinds of labor market disruptions seen in past episodes of revolutionary technological change, we will need to consider the possibility of more sweeping changes in the way we work.</p>
<p><span>A Scenario Approach</span><br />In a previous speech, I outlined two hypothetical scenarios describing how AI could evolve.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250509a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;In the first scenario, we see only incremental adoption that primarily augments what humans do today but still leads to significant and widespread productivity gains. In the second scenario, we see profound change, in which we extend human capabilities with far-reaching consequences.</p>
<p>Today, I will apply the same approach to analyze the potential effects of AI on the labor market. Of course, there is tremendous uncertainty about how AI will evolve and how it will affect the economy, as well as society more broadly. Amid this uncertainty, a scenario-based approach can give us a framework for thinking about the potential effects of AI on employment, real wages, and productivity, as well as for considering the possible role that government could play in influencing this transition.</p>
<p><em>Scenario 1: Incremental Progress</em><br />Let's start with the "gradual" scenario, in which new AI technologies are adopted at a brisk, but not a breathless, pace or advance quickly at first and then plateau&mdash;perhaps because of constraints imposed by computing resources, the exhaustion of novel training data, and rising energy consumption.</p>
<p>Under this scenario, AI primarily operates by automating some&mdash;but not all&mdash;tasks within many occupations. We've seen some of this task substitution happen already: Computer programmers rely on AI copilots to write code, allowing them to focus on higher-level tasks, while customer support agents can use chatbots to improve and expedite their responses.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250509a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;Lawyers draw on GenAI to conduct legal research, while AI-powered safety features improve the performance of human automobile drivers.</p>
<p>Under this scenario, as foundational models improve, novel use cases are discovered, and businesses continue to integrate AI into their operations, more and more occupations will be affected, and many jobs will use AI tools more intensively. As these technologies improve, even incremental change may allow AI to become accurate and cheap enough to replace some occupations altogether. It's hard to make predictions at this stage. But a plausible conjecture is that we could see, for example, fewer human programmers, lawyers, or commercial drivers. At the same time, most current occupations would persist in this scenario&mdash;albeit in modified and more productive forms.</p>
<p>Beyond existing occupations, general purpose technologies also encourage the creation of new occupations, fueled by new products and novel ways of doing business. It's difficult to envision the novel jobs that will replace the ones we might lose to an incremental AI scenario. But one possibility is that the future could bring us managers of AI agents, specialists in human&ndash;AI collaboration, ethicists, safety experts, and large numbers of people involved in adopting, maintaining, and educating about AI tools. Technology, and how we use a particular innovation, evolves in unpredictable ways, and we should expect to be surprised.</p>
<p>Under this scenario, jobs remain plentiful, real wages are buoyed by productivity gains, and employment and labor force participation remain high and could even rise, if strong wage growth entices new labor market entrants and if improvements in health care increase work capacity among older or disabled individuals. If the widespread adoption of AI proceeds gradually, then workers will have time to adjust, reducing the disruption to the labor market&mdash;though, as with previous general purpose technologies, AI would likely imply that some groups of workers experience a painful process of dislocation and transition.</p>
<p>Retraining could help here. A recent survey carried out by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that many businesses plan to retrain their workers to use AI rather than laying them off.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250509a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;In some cases, AI may disrupt career ladders by automating many entry-level tasks&mdash;such as reviewing legal documents or drafting code&mdash;that were historically performed by early-career workers. But if labor demand changes slowly enough, students and workers are more likely to have time to predict which skills will be marketable and to make and recoup human capital investments before their skills become obsolete.</p>
<p>What about the effect of AI on inequality? Some research suggests that GenAI may help less-productive workers catch up to their more-productive peers.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250509a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;That said, the AI economy will likely put a premium on digital skills, facility with new technologies, and adaptability. The precedent of the computer revolution suggests that highly educated workers may benefit most, boosting wage inequality&mdash;a phenomenon called "skill-biased technological change."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250509a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;Another possibility is that the labor share of income could decline, if capital owners benefit more than wage earners&mdash;for example, because the gains accruing from AI adoption go to large, highly capitalized firms whose technical capabilities, consumer networks, and training data allow them to develop state-of-the-art AI techniques.</p>
<p><em>Scenario 2: Transformation</em><br />Now let's consider an alternative scenario in which AI completely transforms the economy. As I described in my earlier speech, in this transformative scenario, humans employ AI to unleash their imagination and creativity&mdash;combined with robust investment in research and development&mdash;to make rapid breakthroughs that have the potential to improve our lives. With growth propelled by swift technological progress, society's resources would be vastly expanded, AI would spur revolutionary advances in health, and many individuals would enjoy more time for leisure activities.</p>
<p>Indeed, transformative AI could bring about a state of affairs that John Maynard Keynes famously envisioned almost a hundred years ago, one in which there are "ever larger and larger classes and groups of people from whom problems of economic necessity have been practically removed."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250509a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a>&nbsp;At the same time, transformative AI could imply a much smaller role for human labor&mdash;a development that would entail sweeping social changes and profound challenges for government.</p>
<p>Under this scenario, AI would take over a broad range of existing jobs. As economist Anton Korinek writes, "AI systems advance toward mastering all forms of cognitive work that can be performed by humans, including new tasks that don't even exist yet."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250509a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a>&nbsp;Building on developments we are already starting to see, improved chatbots and AI agents would outperform their human counterparts in activities ranging from customer support to medical diagnosis. Along similar lines, advanced robotics could increasingly substitute for human workers in manual and production jobs. Widespread automation would bring many benefits. The availability and quality of many services could increase markedly, and many less-desirable jobs&mdash;such as those involving tedious tasks or dangerous working conditions&mdash;could be transferred to machines.</p>
<p>What jobs&nbsp;<em>would</em>&nbsp;exist in this more transformative scenario? As in the more gradual scenario&mdash;and just as has happened in the past, when earlier general purpose technologies were adopted&mdash;we would see the emergence of new occupations. These would notably include jobs that involve managing the new AI-dominated economy. In addition, some existing occupations would likely persist, at least for some time. This would be the case for three key reasons. First, some jobs may prove especially hard to automate. For example, plumbers and mechanics rely on physical dexterity and adaptability to situations&mdash;attributes that machines may find difficult to replicate, or to replicate cheaply. Second, in some contexts, consumers may insist on a human touch. Patients may still want human doctors and therapists, while parents may want human teachers and caregivers to look after their children. Third, even when AI has the technical capability to carry out tasks, some jobs are likely to be protected by laws and regulations. For example, legal and political systems would likely continue to insist on human judges and elected officials. Eventually, however, an increasing share of current jobs may be automated. The technological frontier is moving quickly, consumers' preferences may change as they become more comfortable interacting with AI, and the regulatory landscape could evolve to provide broader roles for AI.</p>
<p>It's difficult to say how many jobs will exist under transformative AI. On the one hand, it's possible that&mdash;as has happened so often in the past&mdash;the economy will find inventive new ways to keep most people employed. On the other hand, there are concerns that some workers could experience a large enough decline in their earnings potential that paid work may no longer be an available option. Employment and labor force participation could fall; displaced workers may grapple with a loss of daily routines, social connectedness, and the meaning they derived from employment. The risk of a significant decline in employment looms large in many people's concerns about AI, and it's important for policymakers to be attentive to that risk.</p>
<p>Even if AI ultimately creates as many jobs as it eliminates, we should expect that the transition will be difficult. Existing firms would likely reorganize their production, laying off workers in the process. They could also lose market share to technologically sophisticated start-ups, which could scale up with a minimal number of human workers managing AI subordinates.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250509a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;Many displaced workers would have obsolete skills, and skill mismatch could lead to a structural increase in unemployment as these workers retool for new occupations. It is possible that unemployment might rise only temporarily. It is also possible, however, that more sustained increases could be observed. That would be the case if technology continued to evolve too quickly for many workers to keep up, leading to continual churn and ongoing dislocation.</p>
<p>How might transformative AI affect income inequality? Both traditionally high-wage occupations, such as lawyers and financial professionals, and lower-wage occupations, such as factory and retail workers, could be automated, and it is difficult to predict how AI would affect wage structures. But the largest wage gains would likely go to the highest-skilled workers, as they would be best positioned to implement frontier technologies and help oversee the AI economy. In addition, if capital owners are the main beneficiaries, the labor share of income could decline precipitously.</p>
<p>Transformative AI could bring about profound improvements in living standards, leisure opportunities, and human health. At the same time, society would confront profound distributional changes and potential challenges. Much would depend on how broadly the economic benefits are shared, how policymakers respond, and how society adapts to the rapid pace of change.</p>
<p><span>How Will We Know Which Future We Are Living in?</span><br />The world looks very different across these two scenarios. As AI spreads throughout the economy, how will we know which world we're living in, particularly in view of the likelihood that AI adoption will proceed at different rates in different occupations and industries?</p>
<p>First, we will need to track how many businesses are using AI and how it is affecting their operations. Recent surveys give different impressions about AI adoption thus far, but they consistently show rapid increases in usage over time.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250509a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a></p>
<p>Second, we will need to monitor AI's evolving technological capabilities. AI developers test their models against human performance in benchmark activities like standardized tests and visual tasks. Results of these tests will continue to provide important clues about which activities, and thus which occupations, are at risk of being automated. Along these lines, economists have already developed measures of occupations' exposure to automation. They have based these measures on the characteristics of the tasks involved in different occupations.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250509a.htm#fn16" title="footnote 16"><span>16</span></a><a name="f16"></a>&nbsp;Of course, as the set of tasks that AI can perform expands, these measures can be updated accordingly.</p>
<p>A third way to judge how AI is changing the economy is that data on job openings will likely be a leading indicator of changes in labor demand. What kinds of jobs are employers creating? What skills do they cite in job ads?<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250509a.htm#fn17" title="footnote 17"><span>17</span></a><a name="f17"></a></p>
<p>And, lastly, job growth by occupation and industry is likely to reflect the emerging effects of AI. So far, the imprint of AI is difficult to discern in the employment statistics, but that is likely to change. It may be difficult to disentangle the effects of AI from the other determinants of employment growth, especially in real time. But in the event of truly sweeping changes in the occupational structure, the effects of AI should show up in the data.</p>
<p><span>Looking Ahead</span><br />What do these two scenarios imply for society? In scenario 1, the issues that society has to address will be more straightforward. Policymakers will have to decide how to regulate emergent technologies, education and training programs will have to be tailored to shifts in labor demand, and some labor market regulations may need to be updated. In scenario 2, the issues that society will need to address will be more profound. Questions will include how to ensure that the economic gains associated with AI are broadly shared across individuals and households, and how to adapt social institutions to a world in which many more individuals in their prime working years may be working less. Fortunately, although this second scenario would entail many difficult challenges, it also implies a world in which society has many more resources to deploy against those challenges.</p>
<p>Those are some of the big questions that society may need to grapple with in the future, and most of these questions are not those that will be primarily addressed by monetary policymakers. As a central banker, I can speak more specifically about how structural changes in the economy related to AI could affect monetary policy considerations&mdash;in particular, the Federal Reserve's dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices. Monetary policy considerations could be affected in many ways; I will limit myself to two prominent possibilities.</p>
<p>First, AI may require monetary policymakers to reassess our estimates of the natural rate of unemployment, which informs our assessment of the cyclical state of the economy and thus the appropriate stance of monetary policy. The natural rate, which we call u*, is the unemployment rate that corresponds to the maximum level of employment that can be maintained without producing undesirably high inflation. Among other things, u* depends on the efficiency with which matches are formed between workers and firms, and it could rise if shifts in labor demand across industries and occupations lead to skill mismatch and lengthy unemployment spells as workers retrain and switch careers. The natural rate also depends on the demographic composition of the labor force, which AI could affect. If AI shifts the workforce toward groups that have higher labor force attachment but lower unemployment rates (such as college graduates), the result could be downward pressure on u*. It should be stressed that u* is never directly observed and is difficult to discern in real time. But economists use a wide range of models to estimate the natural rate, and we can use those models to see how u* is changing as AI is adopted more widely.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250509a.htm#fn18" title="footnote 18"><span>18</span></a><a name="f18"></a></p>
<p>Another related consideration relevant for monetary policy is how economic changes due to AI will affect the neutral interest rate, or r*, which is the level of the real interest rate consistent with the economy being at its potential and inflation being at our 2 percent objective. Economic theory suggests that a permanently higher growth rate of productivity, of the kind that might arise under either AI scenario, tends to raise r*. When that happens, a higher real interest rate would be required to deliver any desired monetary policy stance. A challenge that we face is that it is difficult to work out in real time how r* is evolving. But we can make judgments about developments in the behavior of r* by monitoring the relationship between economic activity and interest rates and by using financial market information to estimate longer-run real interest rates.</p>
<p><span>Conclusion</span><br />I'll return to the broader point and conclude. AI is poised to transform our economy, likely in profound ways. But the speed and extent of that transformation are not yet clear. AI is likely to boost productivity, increase scientific discovery, and transform the nature of work. How these developments unfold will have important implications for society and for central bankers.</p>

<h2>Speech</h2>
<p>I suspect it will be little news to the inhabitants of an island in the middle of the North Atlantic that we live in a world where big shocks can challenge the way we go about our lives and force us to adapt, build resilience and be ready to act. On some days, an icy wind blows from the North under a clear blue sky. On others, Autumn&rsquo;s dismal rain moves in from the South under a sky packed tight with clouds. Occasionally, tectonic plates shift, and volcanos erupt. I am not going to belabour the metaphor. Suffice to say that we live in a world where big economic shocks can test the strength and resilience of the framework for monetary policy.</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom, where the weather can be to say the least variable &ndash; as here in Iceland &ndash; that monetary policy framework is inflation targeting. It is well-established and has proved its worth. The numerical inflation target and an independent Monetary Policy Committee with a diversity of views, expertise and experience, supported by expert analysis from staff, has been fundamental in anchoring inflation expectations and delivering price stability.</p>
<p>In the early days after inflation targeting was first established in the 1990s, however, the world was a different place. It was the &lsquo;NICE&rsquo; (or &lsquo;Non-Inflationary and Consistently Expansionary&rsquo;) period, according to one of my predecessors &ndash; a time when, on the whole, fluctuations in economic activity were driven by small shocks to aggregate demand against a backdrop of a steadily expanding supply side.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/may/andrew-bailey-keynote-address-at-the-reykjavik-economic-conference-2025#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;These were mild days of warm breezes and springlike rain.</p>
<p>In this world, monetary policy could no doubt be challenging, but the setting was reasonably predictable. Central to MPC deliberations at the time was to form a clear view of the outlook for aggregate demand in the 1-2 years ahead and set interest rates in a forward-looking manner such that it aligned with aggregate supply. In this way, inflationary pressures would be kept in check, and the economy could grow along a sustainable path with consumer prices rising at the target rate. This was a world that lent itself to one central projection as the basis for policy deliberations and to communicate the inflation and policy outlook to the outside word &ndash; with the central paths positioned within fan charts thereby rightly avoiding any suggestions of a spurious degree of precision.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/may/andrew-bailey-keynote-address-at-the-reykjavik-economic-conference-2025#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The global financial crisis was the first major test of this approach. Demand was certainly affected in this episode, by uncertainty and the loss of wealth and income, but it was not the only part of the economy to suffer. The supply side of the economy was affected too, and sharp exchange rate moves affected imported inflation directly. Inflation targeting had to adapt to recognise and manage evident trade-offs between the speed with which inflation was brought back to target and the balance between aggregate demand and supply in the transition.</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom, this was expanded in the annual remit letter from the Government to the Bank of England in 2013. The remit recognises that there are circumstances in which returning inflation to target as quickly as the lags in the monetary policy transmission mechanism allow could cause undesirable volatility in economic activity and employment. Expanding this to large and persistent shocks was a sensible change, and &lsquo;trade-off management&rsquo; was subsequently deployed in the response to the United Kingdom&rsquo;s decision to leave the European Union.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/may/andrew-bailey-keynote-address-at-the-reykjavik-economic-conference-2025#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[3]</a></sup>&nbsp;But it did not fundamentally change the way the MPC went about its business, with a central projection and a fan chart around it derived from past forecast errors at the centre of its policy deliberations and communication.</p>
<p>Over the last five years, the world has been very different, certainly compared to the tranquil years before the global financial crisis. As my former colleague Ben Broadbent put it, we went from NICE to NaSTY (&lsquo;Not-AS-Tranquil Years&rsquo;).<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/may/andrew-bailey-keynote-address-at-the-reykjavik-economic-conference-2025#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[4]</a></sup>&nbsp;Whatever we call this period, a sequence of unprecedented global shocks has created a very challenging environment for monetary policy. The largest pandemic in a century, the largest war in Europe since 1945, and now a trade war between the world&rsquo;s two largest economies &ndash; these are not small and simple disturbances to aggregate demand, and they come against a backdrop of low productivity growth and ageing populations. While it remains to be seen how recent changes to global trade policies will play out and what the effects on our economies will be, the effects of the pandemic and Russia&rsquo;s brutal war on the Ukrainian people are fresh in our minds. Our economies have suffered, inflation has surged. These have been hard times for businesses and households, not least those on lower incomes.</p>
<p>As the economic effects of these shocks have faded and inflation has come down, we do also have a positive story to tell. The nominal anchor has remained intact. Inflation targeting &ndash; through forceful action to lean against second-round effects from the global shocks on domestic price and wage setting with a restrictive monetary policy stance &ndash; is working to return inflation sustainably to target. It is testament to the strength and resilience of this framework that we can say we are on course to put the inflation surge firmly behind us.</p>
<p>This is not to sound complacent. We must learn the lessons from the difficulties we have faced as policymakers and forecasters over this period. Our models, infrastructure and analytical frameworks were challenged by the sheer scale and unpredictability of the shocks that hit us. Underlying issues were revealed under the stress of these big unforeseeable events. Forecasting became much more difficult, irrespective of the specific models and approaches used. We need no reminder that the global economic environment is likely to continue to be challenging &ndash; and less predictable &ndash; than it was in the past. So we need to adapt and develop to ensure that our processes are nimble and robust, and that our monetary policy decisions are communicated effectively, while ensuring that we continue to act methodically in response to inflationary pressures.</p>
<p>That is why, in the Summer of 2023, we asked Ben Bernanke to lead an independent review into the Bank of England&rsquo;s forecasting and related processes during times of significant uncertainty. We are very grateful to him for having taken on this work and for the dedication he put into it. As you would expect, the review Dr Bernanke published in April last year was a thorough and carefully conducted assessment of the relationship between our projections, monetary policy decisions, and their communication. It has been an excellent catalyst for a comprehensive programme of change.</p>
<p>There are many practical elements to this work. In the year since the report, we have made substantial investments to continue to develop key parts of the Bank&rsquo;s model and data infrastructure. A significant programme is in train to deliver a state-of-the-art environment for working with data on the cloud, and to update our systems for accessing, analysing and visualising data accordingly. We have updated our core structural macro model to better capture the transmission of energy price shocks and to tackle the extreme data outturns of the pandemic period. And we are widening our suite of models including heterogenous agents, machine learning and threshold vector-autoregressive models as well as a new semi-structural model. Work is underway to bring this together in a modelling and data environment with enhanced capabilities for forecasting and policy analysis.</p>
<p>But more broadly, the challenge we face is to adapt our processes so that they assign more prominence to risks and welcome challenge to underlying assumptions, drawing on a wider range of analysis and exploring different economic shocks and mechanisms through which they affect the economy, while ensuring that it continues to serve to maintain the nominal anchor that is the Alpha and the Omega of inflation targeting.</p>
<p>The UK setup with an MPC with nine individually accountable members, each with an equal vote in monetary policy decisions, was never a good match for a single core model and a single central projection summarising one view of the outlook. Policy discussions on the MPC are open, frank and lively &ndash; as they should be. Expert views are exchanged, assumptions investigated, and questions posed. Three-way splits are not unheard of. I can honestly say that there is no groupthink on the MPC.</p>
<p>This is a system with great strengths. Diversity of expertise and experience, combined with expert knowledge, makes for better decisions given the complexity of monetary policy. Differences of views are inevitable consequences of the uncertainty we face. But equally, behind a split vote is often a high degree of communality on the qualitative factors shaping the outlook and the broad implications for the policy stance.</p>
<p>In agreeing on a central projection, the MPC has historically come together by forming what has long been described as its &lsquo;best collective judgement&rsquo;. This is a view of the outlook that all members can sign up to as reflecting the balance of views on the Committee. But exactly what the &lsquo;best collective judgement&rsquo; is meant to represent has been left undefined and ambiguous, open for discussion and negotiation. Embracing this ambiguity has been the way the MPC has reconciled individual accountability with the approach of formulating monetary policy through a central projection for the economy and inflation.</p>
<p>Dr Bernanke challenged us to reconsider this approach, and instead of only deliberating our way towards a &lsquo;best collective judgement&rsquo; of a central case to add alternative scenarios to our policy making process and communication. That, he said, would &ldquo;help the public better understand the reasons for the policy choice, including risk management considerations&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In response, as my colleague Clare Lombardelli set out in a speech last Autumn, we have been building scenarios into our processes, framed within a broader discussion of risks to the outlook.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/may/andrew-bailey-keynote-address-at-the-reykjavik-economic-conference-2025#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[5]</a></sup>&nbsp;And we have started to see the benefits.</p>
<p>Scenarios have helped us not only to explore what would happen in case a particular shock, or constellation of shocks, should hit the economy, but also how any given set of shocks could affect the economy and inflation depending on the strengths of different economic mechanisms. And it has helped us consider how monetary policy should respond in different states of the world &ndash; or with a different balance of risks &ndash; as well as the implications of setting policy as if we are in one state of the world when in fact we are in another. These are considerations that enrich monetary policy deliberations.</p>
<p>In the Monetary Policy Report published yesterday, we presented two alternative scenarios along with a baseline projection. In the first scenario, global and domestic uncertainty could weigh on UK demand to a greater extent than in the baseline, in turn easing inflationary pressures. In the second scenario, recent energy price rises could lead to new second-round effects on domestic prices and supply could be more constrained, in turn increasing inflationary pressures.</p>
<p>These scenarios are meant to convey more than mere upside and downside risks to inflation. By setting out the mechanisms behind them, they explore why inflation may take a different path. And from a policy perspective, it matters whether inflation differs from the baseline because of demand or supply. Even if the difference in inflation is of a similar magnitude on the downside and on the upside, the size of the required monetary policy response might not be. A demand-driven downside scenario is likely to require a larger monetary policy response than a supply-driven upside scenario, simply because there is more of a trade-off to balance when inflation and activity move in different directions. These are nuances that an articulation of the mechanisms behind the scenarios can help us bring out and clarify in our communication.</p>
<p>But the choice of these two scenarios &ndash; proposed by Bank staff &ndash; should not be taken to mean that MPC members, individually or collectively, put a larger weight on a downside risk to inflation from demand and an upside risk in inflation from supply than the opposite constellation with an upside risk from demand and a downside risk from supply. Nor should it be taken to mean that inflation risk is skewed in one direction or the other, or that we see the risks to the path for Bank Rate to be skewed. The scenarios are only two examples from many possible paths the economy could take. That is important to emphasise.</p>
<p>What the scenarios also do, by exploring important judgements underlying the projection, is to serve as articulations of elements of the outlook that individual MPC members can use to position themselves within our material. This is an additional benefit in the UK context where MPC members are individually accountable for their votes and are expected to explain their positions to the wider public. Scenarios, combined with a broader set of analysis, can help support the explanation of alternative views without the need to sign up to a &lsquo;best collective judgement&rsquo;.</p>
<p>This is the direction of travel for our monetary policy communication. We are moving away from one central projection reflecting the &lsquo;best collective judgement&rsquo; of the MPC, set within fan charts to illustrate risks around it. This was a good approach in a world where fluctuations in activity and inflation were largely driven by relatively small disturbances to demand.</p>
<p>But it does not work as well in the world we now live in where we are exposed to big shocks to supply as well as demand &ndash; and in particular in a context where individual members of a policy committee are individually accountable for their decisions. So instead, we are putting greater weight on the key judgements behind our view of the outlook, emphasising the underlying economics as much as precise numbers, and framing our discussions within a broader discussion of risks and drawing on a wider range of analysis.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk197612842"></a>We will maintain a baseline projection, based on a staff proposal, one that a majority of the MPC agrees is a reasonable baseline, rather than one that meets an elusive notion of the MPC&rsquo;s &lsquo;best collective judgement&rsquo;. And we will use scenarios as vehicles for exploring risks around the baseline and accommodating differences of views on the Committee.</p>
<p>Over time the scenarios we look at will evolve as our capabilities advance. And as we build out the scenarios, we will be able to develop the explanation about how we have factored them into monetary policy decisions. So our public communications will evolve along with this process.</p>
<p>These changes that will help us build resilience into our inflation targeting framework and secure the nominal anchor for the future, whatever it may bring, come wind or rain. Our commitment to the 2% inflation target is unwavering.</p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Market Authority: Update On The Pushpay Insider Trading Appeal</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Financial Market Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; has welcomed the Court of Appeal&rsquo;s decision on the Pushpay insider trading appeal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In August 2023 the defendant was found guilty of an insider trading offence following a four-week trial in the Auckland High Court. They were sentenced to six months community detention and a fine of $100,000. In April 2024 they appealed the conviction and the High Court&rsquo;s decision to refuse name suppression. The Crown also appealed the sentence, saying it was manifestly inadequate. &nbsp;</p>
<p>FMA Head of Enforcement Margot Gatland says, &ldquo;We were pleased with the Court&rsquo;s decision to uphold this conviction. Insider trading is a serious offence that undermines investor confidence in New Zealand markets. The FMA will continue to take action when we see this type of misconduct as it damages the trust and confidence in New Zealand&rsquo;s financial markets and businesses.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In its judgment the Court of Appeal: &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>dismissed the appeal against conviction, &nbsp;</li>
<li>dismissed the appeal against the refusal to grant name suppression, pending final decision of the conviction appeal, with the existing interim name suppression to continue for seven days post judgment, and</li>
<li>granted the Crown&rsquo;s appeal against the sentence in part, increasing the fine aspect of the sentence to $200,000. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Name suppression continues for seven days to allow the defendant to notify family members and/or business interests in advance of name suppression lapsing.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Background</span></p>
<p>The case, brought by the FMA, centered around the resignation and sell-down of shares of former Pushpay co-founder and Director Eliot Crowther in June 2018. The FMA considered Mr Crowther&rsquo;s intention in this regard to be material information, which, if generally available, would be likely to have a material effect on the price of Pushpay&rsquo;s shares at the time. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA alleged that the defendant knew of, and used, that information to advise or encourage others to trade in the lead up to Mr Crowther&rsquo;s announcement. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr Crowther&rsquo;s trading was legitimate, and he was not party to the proceedings.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Statement On The Agency’s Settlement With Ripple Labs, Inc., SEC Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw, May 8, 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-on-the-agencys-settlement-with-ripple-labs-inc-sec-commissioner-ca-202559/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-on-the-agencys-settlement-with-ripple-labs-inc-sec-commissioner-ca-202559/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In December of 2020, under then-Chairman Jay Clayton, the SEC sued Ripple Labs, Inc. for failing to register its crypto tokens as required under the U.S. securities laws.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-ripple-050825#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;We alleged that Ripple and its leaders raised capital to finance their business through the sales of XRP in unregistered securities offerings, depriving investors of information material to their investments. On the parties&rsquo; cross-motions for summary judgment, the court found that Ripple&rsquo;s institutional sales of XRP constituted an unregistered offer and sale of investment contracts in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, but that other secondary offers and sales did not. The court ordered that Ripple be permanently restrained and enjoined from future violations of Section 5 and ordered it to pay a civil penalty of over $125 million.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-ripple-050825#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Both parties appealed the ruling.</p>
<p>Today, the Commission announced a settlement, which calls for the return to Ripple of over $75 million currently being held in escrow, and to vacate the court-issued injunction requiring Ripple to obey the law.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-ripple-050825#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>This settlement, alongside the programmatic disassembly of the SEC&rsquo;s crypto enforcement program, does a tremendous disservice to the investing public and undermines the court&rsquo;s role in interpreting our securities laws.</p>
<p>This is not a settlement I can support.<i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><i>First</i>, the settlement undermines the court&rsquo;s order. It razes the civil penalty ruling as well as the court-imposed injunction. The agreement states that neither the SEC nor Ripple will seek to vacate or amend any part of the district court&rsquo;s summary judgement ruling. If, however, Ripple decides&nbsp;<i>tomorrow</i>&nbsp;to sell unregistered XRP tokens to institutional investors&mdash;in plain defiance of the court&rsquo;s order<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-ripple-050825#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&mdash;this Commission will do absolutely nothing about it. There will be no enforcement of the law. The hundreds of hours spent by the court in this matter will be rendered meaningless. And the court&rsquo;s decision will be effectively vacated.</p>
<p><i>Second</i>, the settlement undermines the SEC and its enforcement program. It subverts the clear and honest application of the facts to the law, a cornerstone of any effective law enforcement program. This settlement is part of a broader, programmatic shift to dismiss our registration cases in the crypto context.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-ripple-050825#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;In remodeling our legal stance in this area, we have pointed to a new &ldquo;regulatory path,&rdquo; that the agency will purportedly pursue based on the work of the SEC&rsquo;s Crypto Task Force.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-ripple-050825#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;But, even if the Crypto Task Force re-writes registration rules for crypto securities in the future, that does not somehow alter the rules that were in place at the time that Ripple violated them. Further, we have no hint of what those future rules might look like or how long it will take to put them in place&mdash;if ever. So, we are today accepting a diluted settlement, that erases the investor protections we already won, based on a non-existent framework that may or may not come to fruition potentially years from now, on the basis that the current framework in place&mdash;of applying the facts to the law&mdash;was not industry or innovation-friendly. This creates a regulatory vacuum with no end in sight. That does not an Enforcement program make.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the settlement joins a line of dismissals that collectively erode the credibility of our lawyers in court who are being asked to take legal positions today contrary to the ones taken just months ago. And it stands in defiant contravention of the doctrine of regularity of government affairs.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-ripple-050825#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p><i>Third</i>, the settlement is not in the best interests of the investors and markets that our agency is tasked with serving and protecting. It creates more questions than answers. Does the resolution suggest to the market that we agree with the court&rsquo;s ruling? What is the legal effect of the ruling in place? How can we ensure that investors get the information that they need and to which they are entitled under the law?<i></i></p>
<p>At bottom, I have full confidence in the arguments our agency made to the Second Circuit on appeal, and equal confidence in the talent of SEC attorneys who advanced those arguments. That motivates my dissent today. Our agency is, I fear, worried that the appellate court would issue a sound ruling that agreed with the legal arguments already laid out by the Commission. That would undermine the agency&rsquo;s new apparent mission of dismantling our crypto enforcement program and eroding investor protections. For these reasons, I cannot support our settlement. I urge the courts to take a long hard look at the Commission&rsquo;s attempt to claw back the meritorious claims it previously made, and gut its own enforcement program from the inside out.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today adopted an interim final rule amending its 2024 final rule related to its regulations for business combinations involving national banks and federal savings associations. The OCC also rescinded its 2024 policy statement on its review of applications under the Bank Merger Act.</p>
<p>The interim final rule restores the streamlined application and expedited review to the OCC&rsquo;s procedures for evaluating applications under the Bank Merger Act.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The OCC&rsquo;s actions today reduce burden and uncertainty for banks and supports a regulatory framework for bank mergers that is effective and not excessive,&rdquo; said Acting Comptroller of the Currency Rodney E. Hood. &ldquo;Making it easier for well-managed and well-capitalized banks to merge promotes competition and facilitates economic growth and innovation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The OCC welcomes comment on all aspects of the interim final rule, including information to include in any future policy statement.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ISDA has announced that TD Securities has completed its integration of ISDA Create across its global suite of client trading and regulatory agreements.</p>
<p>Powered by CreateiQ and S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, ISDA Create allows users to digitally transform the trading and regulatory agreement negotiation process and deliver faster and more seamless outcomes across global markets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At TD Securities, delivering an exceptional client experience is our top priority,&rdquo; said Debbie Ramkerrysingh, Managing Director and Head of Global Markets Documentation, TD Securities. &ldquo;By digitizing and structuring the negotiation of agreements through ISDA Create, we help clients accelerate speed to market, reduce complexity and enhance transparency while offering a high degree of customization, allowing firms to tailor agreements while maintaining compliance with global regulatory standards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ISDA Create, which is available through S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence&rsquo;s Counterparty Manager platform, enables firms to digitally generate and execute documentation and then seamlessly capture, process and store the data from those negotiations.

<p>&ldquo;We are equally excited about the new ISDA Create AI technology to create, access and leverage data both on and off the platform, driving improved risk management, operational efficiency and smarter decision-making across our portfolio. Embracing a digital-first approach also drives scalability, consistency and accuracy for our clients, enabling them to expand their business across global markets with speed and confidence. Our collaboration with ISDA Create is a significant step in our commitment to redefine the future of the client experience in global markets,&rdquo; said Ramkerrysingh.</p>

<title>A Creative And Cooperative Balancing Act, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, SEC 31st International Institute For Securities Market Growth And Development, Washington D.C., May 8, 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Welcome to the penultimate day of the SEC&rsquo;s 31<span>st</span>&nbsp;International Institute for Securities Market Growth and Development. Before I begin, as I am sure you anticipate based on what you have heard from many SEC speakers this week, my views are my own as a Commissioner and not necessarily those of the SEC or my fellow Commissioners.</p>
<p>The Institute&rsquo;s longevity signals the importance of capital formation and the development of capital markets. These topics can get lost in regulatory conversations, which tend to focus on what&nbsp;<i>government</i>&nbsp;can do to protect investors, rather than what&nbsp;<i>markets</i>&nbsp;can do to protect investors. Efficient, flourishing capital markets do more than serve investors; their function is much grander&mdash;to serve humanity. As the lifeblood of businesses and innovation, capital markets help a nation&rsquo;s economy to meet its people&rsquo;s needs and generate the societal prosperity that enriches the lives of individuals and their communities. Affording investors an opportunity to share in the fruits of the economy&rsquo;s growth is a welcome byproduct of well-functioning capital markets and a central element of investor protection.</p>
<p>The capital markets themselves are the means by which investors prosper, but carefully crafted, well-balanced regulation of markets gives investors the confidence to participate in those markets. If a nation regulates its capital markets with too heavy a hand, businesses will wither, innovators will migrate elsewhere, consumers will pay more for inferior products and services, and investors will suffer economically. If a nation establishes a clear regulatory perimeter that provides broad latitude to people to transact as they like, people will have the confidence to make choices that benefit them and their families. An important regulatory objective is ensuring that investors have sufficient, reliable information to be willing to take the risk to invest their money in innovative and growing businesses. This balancing act is not easy, and every country has its own idiosyncrasies that factor into determining the right mix. Moreover, determining the proper regulatory balance is an ongoing exercise in which all countries&mdash;no matter the stage of development of their capital markets&mdash;must engage.</p>
<p>The U.S. capital markets are well-developed and well-functioning, but keeping them preeminent requires continued care and creativity. Here in the United States, we are constantly asking ourselves how we can do better and watching for signs that something may be amiss in the markets or the way we regulate them. For example, we are reflecting on why the number of public companies listed on exchanges in the U.S. fell from 5,243 in 2004 to 4,862 in 2024.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-iismgd-050825?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;This decline reflects positively on the robustness of our private markets, but the regulatory requirements the Commission has imposed on public companies also are partly responsible for dissuading companies from going public. We need to take a look at these requirements and ask whether some of them are extraneous, or even harmful. Much public company regulation takes the form of disclosure requirements but even disclosure requirements can be costly and distracting to management and may change the company&rsquo;s practices in ways that are not good for investors. Requiring a company to disclose in detail executive compensation, including how it relates to other employees&rsquo; pay, for example, can limit the company&rsquo;s ability to hire the best people to run the company. Keeping disclosure requirements principles-based and rooted in materiality of the information to investors seeking to maximize the long-term value of the company helps them stand the test of time.</p>
<p>Good regulatory balance also requires ensuring that new competitors can come into the marketplace to serve investors and provide market infrastructure. Sensible regulation protects investors and markets from dishonest and careless intermediaries, whether those intermediaries are established or new. But heavy-handed regulation can protect incumbents by making it too costly for would-be competitors who want to challenge existing firms with better, cheaper products and services. Scaled regulation&mdash;imposing fewer requirements on smaller firms&mdash;is one way to foster competition. Without dynamic competition, capital markets cannot effectively serve people. Moreover, a concentrated set of incumbents, comfortably hiding behind regulatory barriers, may contribute to market fragility.</p>
<p>Poor regulation may not only keep new competitors out, but may prevent incumbents from using new technologies. Here too regulators can take measures to ensure that regulation does not become a barrier to technology. Rules that mandate objectives to be achieved without prescribing how to achieve them can create a welcoming environment for new technologies. When rules stand in the way of market experimentation with new technologies and fast-to-market innovation, regulators should think creatively. Let me give you a concrete example that I am pondering right now.</p>
<p>As you may be aware, the Commission is revising its approach to crypto regulation. This endeavor is multi-faceted, but one focus is tokenization of traditional securities. Tokenization refers to the use of distributed ledger technology to maintain the record of ownership of traditional assets, including securities, such as stocks and bonds. It entails formatting these assets as crypto assets (or &ldquo;tokens&rdquo;) on a blockchain or other distributed ledger technology (&ldquo;DLT&rdquo;).</p>
<p>In thinking about how to facilitate private sector tokenization initiatives, I have been inspired by the &ldquo;regulatory sandbox&rdquo; structures implemented in other jurisdictions, including some represented in this audience. Those structures have allowed firms to innovate in a live, but controlled, environment. Innovating firms are able to get to market quickly under appropriate, reasonably calibrated conditions. They do not have to comply with inapt regulations, which, in many cases, were developed well before the technologies being tested existed and may be obviated by attributes of that technology. In addition to offering individual firms the opportunity to try something out in the marketplace, these sandboxes can help regulators think about how existing rules could be adapted to accommodate trading tokenized securities at scale.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s Crypto Task Force, informed by a February request for comment,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-iismgd-050825?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;is considering a potential exemptive order that would allow firms to use DLT to issue, trade, and settle securities. This potential conditional exemption from certain SEC registration requirements and associated rules would allow firms to use innovative trading systems for eligible tokenized securities. Firms seeking to operate an automated market making system for tokenized securities, for example, may face challenges in complying with the SEC&rsquo;s Regulation National Market System. Such systems, their operators, or persons interacting with them also may have to register as a broker-dealer, clearing agency, or an exchange. Because only a small number of securities have been tokenized to date, firms may not be willing to devote resources to identify and address the regulatory barriers to trade and settle them. Companies may be hesitant to issue tokenized securities because only a limited number of venues can trade such securities. Exemptive relief could help resolve this chicken-and-egg problem. It also would afford the SEC time to develop and adopt durable adaptations to its existing rules to accommodate DLT.</p>
<p>The contemplated exemption would be conditional. Exempted entities would comply with market integrity conditions for the prevention of fraud and manipulation. Additional conditions might include requirements to provide material and relevant disclosures to users about a platform&rsquo;s products, services, operations, conflicts of interest, and risks, including smart contract risks; comply with recordkeeping and reporting requirements; be subject to monitoring and examination by SEC staff; and have adequate financial resources for operations. Supplemental requirements for participants offering crypto custodial services might include customer disclosures about custody arrangements and risks and a requirement to implement policies and procedures or substantive requirements related to blockchain and wallet security. Restrictions such as limiting the number and types of tokenized securities listed or traded or trading volume could mitigate risks to investors and markets. The SEC could raise these ceilings for a firm that has performed successfully at its initial limits.</p>
<p>This sketch of a potential exemption is a work-in-progress. The goal is to formulate a commercially feasible approach that protects investors, including by ensuring that they have the benefit of cutting-edge technologies for trading, clearing, and settling securities. I welcome feedback from market participants and other interested parties, including participants in this Institute who have designed and implemented regulatory sandbox frameworks in your jurisdictions. Enabling firms to deploy new products and services in a streamlined fashion contributes to balanced regulation.</p>
<p>Each of us has responsibilities to foster innovation in our own jurisdiction, but cross-border collaboration can help in this regard. Many firms want to serve customers in more than one jurisdiction, particularly because financial markets are international. Regulators would benefit from seeing how products or services work in different environments. Accordingly, I have advocated bilateral collaboration to allow participants in foreign sandboxes simultaneously to run their market experiments in the United States. Such an arrangement would require regulatory information sharing agreements and other cooperation. The challenges that U.S. and non-U.S. firms face in innovating in one nation pale in comparison to the difficulties that await them when they try to offer products and services in more than one jurisdiction. We owe it to our respective citizenry to tackle these frictions through cooperative approaches. The regulatory balancing act is not a solo exercise.</p>
<p>This Institute provides a forum for a discussion of how we can help grow our respective capital markets by implementing a sensible regulatory regime. While each country&rsquo;s capital market has its own characteristics, this Institute enables regulators to discuss what has worked in developing their markets and, just as importantly, what has not. Getting the balance right in each of our countries is essential, and it is not a zero-sum game. To the contrary, good regulation benefits everyone. Having strong capital markets globally will in turn help foster economic growth at home in all our countries. Balanced regulation in capital markets across the world helps to ensure that resources and, importantly, human talent are deployed in ways that benefit all of us.</p>
<p>Thank you and enjoy the rest of the Institute.</p>

<title>ISDA Publishes Governance Committee Proposal For CDS Determinations Committees</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-publishes-governance-committee-proposal-for-cds-determinations-committees-202558/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-publishes-governance-committee-proposal-for-cds-determinations-committees-202558/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ISDA has published a proposal for a new governance committee for the CDS Determinations Committees (DCs), the first in a series of amendments to improve the structure of the DCs and maintain their integrity in changing economic and market conditions.</p>
<p>The governance committee would be responsible for taking market feedback and adopting rule changes affecting the structure and operations of the DCs to ensure their long-term viability and meet market expectations for efficiency and transparency in credit event determinations. The governance committee would be prohibited from involvement in DC decisions, ensuring separation between the determinations process and the procedure for setting the structure and framework of the DCs.</p>
<p>Under the proposal, the governance committee would comprise a minimum of 15 and a maximum of 20 senior, business-focused market participants with significant experience in the credit default swap (CDS) market &ndash; 10 from the sell side, five from the buy side, three central counterparty or index provider members and two additional infrastructure providers. The governance committee would be prevented from making rule changes that could impact live credit events to avoid the perception of conflicts of interest and any proposed rule change would be open to market consultation before a vote by the governance committee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the first step in a series of proposals that ISDA will be making to improve the structure and governance of the DCs. Having a single, industry-wide determination on whether a credit event has occurred is critical to enable the clearing of CDS transactions, so having a DC process that is strong, robust and transparent is essential to the safe and efficient functioning of this market,&rdquo; said Scott O&rsquo;Malia, ISDA&rsquo;s Chief Executive.</p>
<p>The proposal follows publication by ISDA of the results of a consultation on proposed changes to the DCs last year. The&nbsp;<a href="https://assets.isda.org/media/30e17e83/9d6c7ae2.pdf">consultation</a>, conducted by Boston Consulting Group, was based on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/a/lS1gE/DC-Review-Report-042924.pdf">recommendations proposed by Linklaters</a>&nbsp;as part of an independent review on the composition, functioning, governance and membership of the DCs. ISDA will publish additional proposals in the coming months, based on the findings of the consultation.</p>
<p>The DCs were introduced in 2009 as a centralized decision-making body to enable a standardized auction settlement process and ensure central clearing could be implemented for CDS. Although ISDA does not control the DC rules and is not involved in the decision-making process or administration of the committees, ISDA has an interest as a global trade association for over-the-counter derivatives in ensuring the DCs continue to function robustly.</p>
<p>The governance committee proposal is available&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2025/05/08/cds-governance-committee-public-consultation/">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Monetary Policy Summary, May 2025</h2>
<p>The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. The MPC adopts a medium-term and forward-looking approach to determine the monetary stance required to achieve the inflation target sustainably.</p>
<p>At its meeting ending on 7 May 2025, the MPC voted by a majority of 5&ndash;4 to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25%. Two members preferred to reduce Bank Rate by 0.5 percentage points, to 4%. Two members preferred to maintain Bank Rate at 4.5%.</p>
<p>There has been substantial progress on disinflation over the past two years, as previous external shocks have receded, and as the restrictive stance of monetary policy has curbed second-round effects and stabilised longer-term inflation expectations. That progress has allowed the MPC to withdraw gradually some degree of policy restraint, while maintaining Bank Rate in restrictive territory so as to continue to squeeze out persistent inflationary pressures.</p>
<p>Underlying UK GDP growth is judged to have slowed since the middle of 2024, and the labour market has continued to loosen.</p>
<p>Progress on disinflation in domestic price and wage pressures is generally continuing. Twelve-month CPI inflation fell to 2.6% in March from 2.8% in February, close to expectations in the February Monetary Policy Report. Although indicators of pay growth remain elevated, a significant slowing is still expected over the rest of the year. Wholesale energy prices have fallen back since the February Report. Previous increases in energy prices are still likely to drive up CPI inflation from April onwards, to 3.5% for 2025 Q3. Inflation is expected to fall back thereafter. Measures of household inflation expectations have risen recently.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk197503863"></a>Uncertainty surrounding global trade policies has intensified since the imposition of tariffs by the United States and the measures taken in response by some of its trading partners. There has subsequently been volatility in financial markets, and market-implied policy rates have moved lower. Prospects for global growth have weakened as a result of this uncertainty and new tariff announcements,<a id="_Hlk197452426"></a>&nbsp;although the negative impacts on UK growth and inflation are likely to be smaller.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk197425866"></a>The Committee remains focused on returning CPI inflation sustainably to target in the medium term. In deciding the appropriate degree and pace of monetary policy adjustments required to achieve this, the Committee has considered a range of possibilities for how domestic inflationary pressures could evolve, as well as the broader circumstances that could necessitate varying the course of policy.</p>
<p>The May Report sets out two illustrative scenarios. In one scenario, there could be weaker supply and more persistence in domestic wages and prices, including from second-round effects related to the near-term increase in CPI inflation. In another scenario, inflationary pressures could ease more quickly owing to greater or longer-lasting weakness in demand relative to supply, in part reflecting uncertainties globally and domestically.</p>
<p>Monetary policy is not on a pre-set path. The Committee will remain sensitive to heightened unpredictability in the economic environment and will continue to update its assessment of risks.</p>
<p>At this meeting, the Committee voted to reduce Bank Rate to 4.25%, reflecting continued progress in disinflation though with risks to inflation remaining in both directions.</p>
<p>Based on the Committee&rsquo;s evolving view of the medium-term outlook for inflation, a gradual and careful approach to the further withdrawal of monetary policy restraint remains appropriate. The Committee will continue to monitor closely the risks of inflation persistence and what the evidence may reveal about the balance between aggregate supply and demand in the economy. Monetary policy will need to continue to remain restrictive for sufficiently long until the risks to inflation returning sustainably to the 2% target in the medium term have dissipated further. The Committee will decide the appropriate degree of monetary policy restrictiveness at each meeting.</p>
</section><section class="page-section">
<h2>Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 7 May 2025</h2>
<p>1: Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. The latest data on these topics were set out in the accompanying&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy-report/2025/may-2025">May 2025 Monetary Policy Report</a>.</p>
<p>2: The Committee discussed recent global economic developments, and in particular the likely impact on the outlook for UK inflation of the various changes to trade tariffs that had recently been announced by the United States and some of its trading partners. These potential impacts were discussed in more detail in Box C of the May Report.</p>
<p>3: These trade policy developments were likely to reduce UK activity, and to create further risks to the downside.&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk197443758"></a>The impact on UK inflation was more ambiguous at this stage. The baseline expectation was that these developments would push down slightly on inflation over the forecast period. There were material risks on both sides around this judgement, however, including from: weaker global demand; the degree of diversion of exports to non-US markets; how closely the pass-through from global export prices to domestic consumer prices matched previous experience; the level of disruption to supply chains; the extent of further tariff policy announcements; and the risk of broader fragmentation of the global economy and financial system. The Committee would monitor the relevant indicators closely, and would continue to use multiple analytical approaches to evaluate the impact of these developments.</p>
<p>4: Financial markets had been volatile globally following the trade policy announcements in early April, as set out in the May Report. Almost all respondents to the Bank&rsquo;s latest Market Participants Survey (MaPS) were expecting a 25 basis point reduction in Bank Rate at this MPC meeting, in line with market pricing.&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk197541247"></a>Since the MPC's previous meeting the median MaPS respondent expected 75 basis points of further Bank Rate cuts this year, although the overall distribution was now skewed towards more cuts. This was consistent with the market-implied path declining by just under 100 basis points over the rest of the year.</p>
<p>5: The Committee discussed the extent to which movements in UK markets had reflected international factors. International considerations had clearly been the most prominent influence during this period, although, given the US-specific nature of the tariff policy announcements, it was not surprising that the previously close relation between US and UK markets had weakened appreciably in recent weeks. MaPS respondents reported that international factors had generally pushed down on the prospects for activity and inflation, and therefore on near-term UK policy rate expectations, partly offset by the upward impact of domestic factors on inflation.</p>
<p>6: Monthly GDP growth in February had been much stronger than expected, at 0.5%, and Bank staff now estimated that headline GDP growth in 2025 Q1 had been 0.6%. But this news had been accounted for largely by erratic factors, for instance those that had affected output in the manufacturing sector. Bank staff estimated that underlying growth in Q1 had been around zero. Headline GDP growth was projected to slow sharply in Q2, to 0.1%, with risks to the downside, given the signal from high-frequency data. The S&amp;P Global UK composite output PMI had fallen sharply in April, although it remained unclear how much of this decline stemmed from a potentially reversible deterioration in business sentiment.</p>
<p>7: The Committee discussed the extent to which developments in activity had reflected underlying demand and supply drivers, acknowledging that both were likely to have played a role. In the baseline forecast, a margin of slack was expected to continue to open up over the coming years, sufficient to remove remaining excess inflation persistence. Conditioned on the market-implied path for Bank Rate, monetary policy was expected to continue to restrain aggregate demand, while fiscal consolidation was expected to play a greater role in the latter part of the forecast. Potential productivity growth was also expected to pick up. The balance of risks around the baseline forecast for GDP growth was judged to be somewhat to the downside.</p>
<p>8: Twelve-month CPI inflation had fallen to 2.6% in March. The latest evidence from key indicators suggested that progress on underlying disinflation in domestic prices and wages had generally continued, supported by the restrictiveness of monetary policy.</p>
<p>9: The Committee discussed the outlook for a range of nominal indicators. Private sector regular pay growth was expected to slow significantly further by the end of 2025, to around 3&frac34;%, consistent with the latest indications from the Bank&rsquo;s Agents&rsquo; contacts, and from the DMP Survey. That said, survey measures of household inflation expectations had risen further in recent months, perhaps suggesting that households had become more sensitive to inflationary pressures, having recently experienced very high rates of inflation in 2022.&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk197428957"></a>Businesses&rsquo; medium-term CPI inflation expectations had increased slightly recently, although indicators of medium-term inflation expectations derived from financial markets had generally continued to trend downwards.</p>
<p>10: CPI inflation was expected to rise to a peak of 3.5% on average in 2025 Q3, in large part reflecting developments in household energy bills and, to a lesser degree, regulated prices. This projected increase in headline inflation was still expected to be temporary. The Committee recognised the risk that this projected increase in headline inflation, along with the current trajectory of household inflation expectations, might pose additional risks to persistence if non-linearities were to emerge beyond specific inflation thresholds.</p>
<h3>The immediate policy decision</h3>
<p>11: The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. The MPC adopts a medium-term and forward-looking approach to determine the monetary stance required to achieve the inflation target sustainably.</p>
<p>12: Underlying UK GDP growth was judged to have slowed since the middle of 2024, and the labour market had continued to loosen.</p>
<p>13: Progress on disinflation in domestic price and wage pressures had generally continued. Twelve-month CPI inflation was 2.6% in March, close to expectations in the February Monetary Policy Report. Although indicators of pay growth had remained elevated, a significant slowing was still expected over the rest of the year. Wholesale energy prices had fallen back since the February Report. Previous increases in energy prices were still likely to drive up CPI inflation from April onwards, to 3.5% on average in 2025 Q3. Inflation was expected to fall back thereafter.</p>
<p>14: Uncertainty surrounding global trade policies had intensified since the imposition of tariffs by the United States and the measures taken in response by some of its trading partners. There had subsequently been volatility in financial markets, and market-implied policy rates had moved lower. Prospects for global growth had weakened as a result of this uncertainty and new tariff announcements, although the negative impacts on UK growth and inflation were likely to be smaller.</p>
<p>15: The Committee remained focused on returning inflation sustainably to the target. In the baseline forecast set out in the May Monetary Policy Report, inflation was expected to return to around the 2% target in the medium term. Overall, the Committee judged that the risks around GDP growth in the baseline forecast were somewhat to the downside, while the risks around the CPI projection were two-sided.</p>
<p>16: In reaching its judgement, and against a backdrop of increased uncertainty, the Committee had been assessing a wide range of risks around the baseline forecast, from both domestic and global factors. The May Monetary Policy Report set out two illustrative scenarios from a much broader set of plausible paths the economy could take. These were intended to explore different economic mechanisms, to which members attached different weights.</p>
<p>17: In the first scenario, greater or longer-lasting weakness in demand relative to supply, in part reflecting uncertainties globally and domestically, might further mitigate inflationary pressures over the medium term. Underlying GDP growth had been weak, and global trade policy uncertainty had risen sharply, which was likely to weigh on household consumption and business investment. It was possible in this environment of uncertainty that precautionary saving could rise and consumption could weaken.</p>
<p>18: In the second scenario, greater persistence in domestic wage- and price-setting, both from additional second-round effects related to the near-term increase in headline CPI inflation and from weaker aggregate supply, might exacerbate the persistence of inflation. Underlying services consumer price inflation and indicators of wage growth had been moderating, but remained at elevated levels. There was evidence that the near-term inflation expectations of firms and households had recently become more reactive to changes in current CPI inflation than they had been pre-Covid. In addition, there were upside risks to inflation stemming from softer growth in potential productivity.</p>
<p>19: More broadly, there were growing risks from potential global trade arrangements. Depending on how trade policies unfolded, UK inflation could be affected by a wide range of factors such as shifts in trade patterns, supply chain disruptions in the UK and abroad, and movements in global exchange rates. It was possible that the ultimate net effect of these developments could be materially more disinflationary for the UK than in the baseline forecast, but it was also possible that the effect could be slightly inflationary in the longer term. Overall, it was too early to conclude over what period and to what degree different economic effects could materialise.</p>
<p>20: All members stressed that monetary policy was not on a pre-set path. The Committee would remain sensitive to heightened unpredictability in the economic environment and would continue to update its assessment of risks.</p>
<p>21: At this meeting, five members voted to reduce Bank Rate to 4.25%. Prior to the latest global developments, most members in this group had judged that this policy decision would be finely balanced between no change in Bank Rate and a further reduction. Although the current impact of the global trade news should not be overstated, the news was sufficient for those members to judge that a reduction in Bank Rate was warranted. This level of Bank Rate would still leave the stance of monetary policy sufficiently restrictive to bear down on inflationary pressures, were they to re-intensify. For the other members in this group, even in the absence of the latest global news, the case for a reduction in Bank Rate at this meeting had been fairly clear. Underlying domestic disinflation was progressing as expected and monetary policy restrictiveness was bearing down on activity.</p>
<p>22: Two members preferred a 0.5 percentage point reduction in Bank Rate at this meeting based on the outlook. The most significant contributions to the expected pickup in inflation would come from one-off tax and administered prices and past energy shocks. Incoming wage settlements had so far been close to the Agents&rsquo; annual pay survey figure for the end of 2025, and were approaching sustainable rates, while consumer spending remained weak and investment subdued. Along with domestic demand shifts and emerging slack, recent global developments in energy and trade policy pointed to potential downward risks to global growth and world export prices. In the medium term, a continued monetary policy stance that was too restrictive risked inflation deviating from the 2% target on a sustained basis and the opening up of an unduly large output gap. Given this balance of risks, a less restrictive policy path was warranted.</p>
<p>23: Two members preferred to hold Bank Rate at 4.5%, recognising that short-end market interest rates had already eased by around 40 basis points since the MPC&rsquo;s previous meeting. For these members, the labour market was proving more resilient than expected, business surveys signalled continued inflationary pressures, and household expectations of inflation had firmed. All these indicators pointed to continued inflation persistence owing in part to structural rigidities on the supply side of the economy.&nbsp;Holding Bank Rate unchanged at this meeting would ensure that monetary policy remained sufficiently restrictive to weigh against stubborn inflationary pressures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>24: Based on the Committee&rsquo;s evolving view of the medium-term outlook for inflation, a gradual and careful approach to the further withdrawal of monetary policy restraint remained appropriate. The Committee would continue to monitor closely the risks of inflation persistence and what the evidence may reveal about the balance between aggregate supply and demand in the economy. Monetary policy would need to continue to remain restrictive for sufficiently long until the risks to inflation returning sustainably to the 2% target in the medium term had dissipated further. The Committee would decide the appropriate degree of monetary policy restrictiveness at each meeting.</p>
<p>25: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bank Rate should be reduced by 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25%.</li>
</ul>
<p>26: Five members (Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Megan Greene, Clare Lombardelli and Dave Ramsden) voted in favour of the proposition. Four members voted against the proposition. Two members (Swati Dhingra and Alan Taylor) preferred to reduce Bank Rate by 0.5 percentage points, to 4%. Two members (Catherine L Mann and Huw Pill) preferred to leave Bank Rate unchanged, at 4.5%.</p>
<h3>Operational considerations</h3>
<p>27: On 7 May, the stock of UK government bonds held for monetary policy purposes was &pound;620 billion. The MPC had been briefed on the amended operational arrangements for gilt sales in 2025 Q2, ahead of their publication in a Market Notice on 10 April.</p>
<p>28: The following members of the Committee were present:</p>

<p>Aidene Walsh, chair of the PSR said: 'David has played a key role in fostering greater alignment and strengthening the relationship between the FCA and the PSR.&nbsp;This will be increasingly important as we move towards consolidation while at the same time continuing to deliver the important work that the PSR does, including on APP fraud and card processing fees.'</p>

<title>ACER Releases First Reports On The Detection, Reporting And Response To Suspicious Energy Market Behaviours Under REMIT</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The EU-wide framework that protects consumers and businesses from energy market manipulation and insider trading is commonly known as REMIT. This highly sophisticated framework involves many parties collecting and monitoring data, all working together to ensure the integrity of Europe&rsquo;s wholesale energy markets. Ultimately, national regulators are enforcing REMIT.</p>
<p>For the first time, ACER publishes two reports on energy market surveillance, concerning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Persons professionally arranging transactions (PPATs): Analysing their preparedness to detect and report suspicious energy market activities.</li>
<li>National energy regulatory authorities (NRAs): Focusing on their analysis of suspicious transaction and order reports (STORs) submitted by PPATs, their enforcement actions and penalties.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both reports are mandated by the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsFUlMIVFEHAkwNUAFRHVZdDQUdC1pXAxpUUVIPVgJXDw4BAwEdBVQAUFoBAVsdUVgGAx0GAVBQGldUBgcZBVZSBgkFVVJZUgBWRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">revised REMIT Regulation</a>&nbsp;(2024) which introduces new obligations for these trading intermediaries (called PPATs under the REMIT framework) and for ACER to report on the follow-ups by the national energy regulators.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are ACER&rsquo;s key findings and recommendations?</span></p>
<p>For&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsOUFQCUlBSUExYVAcFHVYKVwUdU1oFAxoDVVdUAwoCAwUJD1AdBVQAUFoBAVsdUVgGAx0GAVBQGldUBgcZBVZSBgkFVVJZUgBWRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">persons professionally arranging transactions</a>,&nbsp;ACER found areas for improvement in their surveillance practices, and suggests to:</p>
<ul>
<li>properly separate REMIT surveillance functions and require declaration of potential conflict of interest by employees;</li>
<li>define and formalise the 'detect - analyse - notify - deter' REMIT procedures;</li>
<li>adopt an adequate surveillance system;</li>
<li>conduct regular audits.</li>

<ul>
<li>an active engagement with PPATs;</li>
<li>a reduction of cases at the review stage by the quicker dismissal of de-prioritised STORs;</li>
<li>the allocation of adequate dedicated resources (e.g. case handlers) to manage the growing number of REMIT cases;</li>

<title>Post Trade Solutions Executes First GBP/USD Compression Run At SwapAgent</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/post-trade-solutions-executes-first-gbpusd-compression-run-at-swapagent-202558/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/post-trade-solutions-executes-first-gbpusd-compression-run-at-swapagent-202558/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>LSEG today announced that Post Trade Solutions has successfully completed its first GBP/USD multilateral compression run at SwapAgent, the service for the non-cleared derivatives market. Post Trade Solutions brings together Quantile, Acadia and SwapAgent to minimise risk, reduce cost, and improve capital efficiency.</p>
<p>Initially launched in 2024 with EUR/USD currency pairs, the service has now been expanded to include GBP/USD, accounting for approximately 75% of SwapAgent trading activity in total. This development enables participants to target the majority of cross currency swaps and directly responds to the needs of market participants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The service reduces both operational costs and risk by enabling participants to draw directly from a single, authoritative data store - eliminating reliance on third parties and streamlining the entire compression process. By targeting a segment of the inter-dealer cross currency market serviced by SwapAgent, the service enables compression across a broad portion of participants&rsquo; portfolios.</p>
<p>Participant firms also benefit from quarterly compression runs with existing currency pairs, such as EUR/USD, supporting firms to regularly reduce risk and optimise their portfolio.</p>
<p>This collaboration builds on the substantial partnership between the two services as part of LSEG&rsquo;s Post Trade Solutions division. Together they have delivered a series of market firsts, including sweeping risk into SwapAgent via regular and on-demand Counterparty Risk Optimisation runs. By sweeping bilateral risk into SwapAgent, participants benefit from standardised infrastructure and can reduce capital requirements by 30-60%.</p>
<p><span>Andrew Williams, CEO of Post Trade Solutions, LSEG, said</span>: &lsquo;At&nbsp;Post Trade Solutions,&nbsp;we are continually looking for ways to improve the post trade landscape and&nbsp;enhance our services as the market evolves. Adding multilateral compression runs&nbsp;to&nbsp;currency pairs&nbsp;at SwapAgent that are&nbsp;most demanded&nbsp;by our network&nbsp;provides customers with material&nbsp;gross notional reduction&nbsp;while&nbsp;increasing efficiency.&nbsp;We have already seen good adoption of the service, and we look forward to delivering more compression at SwapAgent as the network grows.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>Originally launched on Broadridge's JASDECPS in 2016, Monex, Inc. will enhance its system capabilities by transitioning to a SaaS model, eliminating the burdens and costs associated with hardware procurement and system maintenance. This transition will empower Monex, Inc. to focus resources on business growth rather than IT management, aligning perfectly with the increasing market demands and competitive pressures within Japan's financial landscape.</p>
<p><i>"Monex, Inc.&rsquo;s decision to transition to our cloud-based SaaS platform marks a significant step in optimizing their core operations and increase operational resiliency while remaining compliant with evolving market standards,"</i>&nbsp;<b>said David Runacres, President of APAC and Senior Country Officer of Japan at Broadridge.&nbsp;</b><i>"This move underscores Broadridge&rsquo;s ability to deliver transformative technology and trusted expertise to Japan's financial and regulatory environment.

<p>By integrating into Broadridge&rsquo;s SaaS data center, Monex, Inc. will benefit from streamlined IT processes, including release management of regular upgrades, thus ensuring seamless access to the latest functionalities of the JASDECPS solution. This also translates to resource efficiencies for system administration tasks, facilitating greater agility in responding to business and market dynamics.</p>
<p>The move to Broadridge&rsquo;s SaaS platform reflects an industry shift towards cloud-based solutions, allowing brokerage firms to address cost pressures while focusing on new revenue streams. Broadridge remains at the forefront, supporting financial institutions through technological migrations and regulatory shifts without interrupting their business continuity, enabling clients to better innovate, operate and grow.</p>
<p>As part of its commitment to local markets, Broadridge Japan integrates global standards with deep local insights, uniquely positioning itself to meet the exacting standards of Japan&rsquo;s financial industry. The synergy between Broadridge and Monex, Inc., underscored by a decade-long strategic partnership, exemplifies a collaborative approach to navigating the future of financial services.</p>

JASDEC Processing Solutions (JASDECPS) allows firms to achieve straight-through processing (STP) covering the entire transaction lifecycle and ensuring compliance with JASDEC2025.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Vienna Stock Exchange is expanding its global market segment: all stocks in the Swiss blue chip index SMI (Swiss Market Index) can now be traded in Vienna. These include leading Swiss companies such as Nestl&eacute;, Novartis, Roche and UBS. The introduction of the twenty most important Swiss stocks to trading on the Vienna Stock Exchange was made possible by a regulatory change: the Swiss Federal Council has ended the stock exchange protection measures for the EU. The restrictions on trading venues from the EU, which have not allowed trading in Swiss equities since July 2019, will no longer apply.</p>
<p>Investors can now trade Switzerland&rsquo;s top stocks in euros, at domestic fees and during Vienna trading hours. With the inclusion of the SMI stocks, the offering in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wienerborse.at/en/stocks-global-market/">global market</a>&nbsp;grows to almost 900 securities from 28 countries &ndash; on a standardised and transparent trading venue. As a market maker, Lang &amp; Schwarz ensures price quality and provides sufficient liquidity for active stock exchange trading.</p>

<title>Securities Commission Malaysia Alerts Public On Impersonation Scam Involving Fake Guarantee Deposits</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/securities-commission-malaysia-alerts-public-on-impersonation-scam-involving-fak-202558/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/securities-commission-malaysia-alerts-public-on-impersonation-scam-involving-fak-202558/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) today cautioned the public on an impersonation scam demanding payment under the guise of the SC.</p>
<p>The scam involves the perpetrators falsely claiming that individuals are &ldquo;under investigation&rdquo; by the SC for market offences such as insider trading and market manipulation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Victims will then be pressured to pay a &ldquo;guarantee deposit&rdquo; &mdash; purportedly up to RM500,000 &mdash; to avoid alleged legal action, including arrest or prosecution.</p>
<p>The modus operandi of this scam has the characteristics of a Macau Scam, where the SC&rsquo;s name has been misused to deceive victims into making payments.</p>
<p>As a regulatory body, the SC does not endorse any investment schemes, solicit monies from the public or demand deposits in any form for regulatory investigations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SC would like to urge the public to be cautious and verify any investment offers through the SC&rsquo;s Investment Checker at<a href="https://www.sc.com.my/investment-checker"> </a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/investment-checker">www.sc.com.my/investment</a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/investment-checker">-</a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/investment-checker">checker</a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/investment-checker">.</a></p>
<p>If you receive any requests for payment claiming to be from the SC or its staff, please contact the SC&rsquo;s Consumer and Investor Office at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">aduan@seccom.com.my</span> or call 03 - 6204 8999 to verify or to report it.&nbsp;</p>

<title>ASIC Releases New Regulatory Guidance To Support Buy Now Pay Later Industry Reforms</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-releases-new-regulatory-guidance-to-support-buy-now-pay-later-industry-refo-202558/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-releases-new-regulatory-guidance-to-support-buy-now-pay-later-industry-refo-202558/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC has published a new regulatory guide to help buy now pay later providers understand their obligations, ahead of new laws coming into effect on 10 June 2025.</p>
<p>Regulatory Guide 281&nbsp;<em>Low cost credit contracts&nbsp;</em>(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/regulatory-guides/rg-281-low-cost-credit-contracts/" title="RG 281 Low cost credit contracts">RG 281</a>) provides information to assist low cost credit contract providers to comply with their key obligations, including modified responsible lending obligations.</p>
<p>ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland said: &lsquo;These reforms are an important step to improve protection for Australian consumers who use buy now pay later products.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Following the release of ASIC&rsquo;s draft regulatory guide and Consultation Paper 382&nbsp;<em>Low cost credit contracts&nbsp;</em>(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/consultations/cp-382-low-cost-credit-contracts/" title="CP 382 Low cost credit contracts">CP 382</a>) in February, ASIC received 16 submissions from stakeholders, including buy now pay later providers, industry associations and consumer advocates. ASIC clarified parts of the guide and added examples in response to feedback.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We strongly encourage buy now pay later providers who do not already have the appropriate credit licence to apply for one as soon as possible,&rsquo; Kirkland said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Providers who do not have their credit licence application accepted for lodgement by ASIC by 10 June 2025 may be engaging in unlicensed conduct if they continue to operate.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>Treasury Laws Amendment (Responsible Buy Now Pay Later and Other Measures) Act 2024</em>&nbsp;amends the&nbsp;<em>National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009</em>&nbsp;(National Credit Act) to extend the National Credit Code (which is Schedule 1 to the National Credit Act) to buy now pay later contracts.</p>
<p>Under the new regime, some obligations will differ for buy now pay later contracts that meet the definition of a low cost credit contract. For example, providers of low cost credit contracts will be able to elect to comply with modified responsible lending obligations.</p>
<p>In January 2025, ASIC released Information Sheet 285&nbsp;<em>Buy now pay later credit contracts: Credit licensing</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/credit/buy-now-pay-later-credit-contracts-credit-licensing/" title="Buy now pay later credit contracts: Credit licensing">INFO 285</a>), which explains the licensing requirements that apply to anyone engaging in credit activities involving buy now pay later contracts.</p>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/federal-reserve-issues-fomc-statement-202557/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Although swings in net exports have affected the data, recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. The unemployment rate has stabilized at a low level in recent months, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated.</p>
<p>The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased further. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen.</p>
<p>In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.</p>
<p>In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.</p>
<p>Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Michael S. Barr; Michelle W. Bowman; Susan M. Collins; Lisa D. Cook; Austan D. Goolsbee; Philip N. Jefferson; Neel Kashkari; Adriana D. Kugler; Alberto G. Musalem; and Christopher J. Waller. Neel Kashkari voted as an alternate member at this meeting.</p>

<title>ISDA To Extend DRR To Cover MIFID/MIFIR Reporting And Works With DTCC To Further Adoption</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-to-extend-drr-to-cover-mifidmifir-reporting-and-works-with-dtcc-to-further-202557/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-to-extend-drr-to-cover-mifidmifir-reporting-and-works-with-dtcc-to-further-202557/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ISDA has announced it will extend the ISDA Digital Regulatory Reporting (ISDA DRR) solution to cover reporting requirements under the EU and UK Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MIFID) and Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (MIFIR), and is working with The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC) to integrate the ISDA DRR into DTCC&rsquo;s Global Trade Repository (GTR) MIFID/MIFIR Approved Reporting Mechanism (ARM).</p>
<p>DTCC recently announced it would launch an ARM within its GTR service to support transaction reporting requirements under MIFID/MIFIR in the EU and UK, subject to regulatory approval. The collaboration between ISDA and DTCC aims to streamline transaction reporting processes, with a focus on improving accuracy and acceptance rates. Revised transaction reporting requirements under the MIFID/MIFIR Review are anticipated to be implemented in the EU and the UK over the course of 2027. DTCC plans to allow firms to submit transaction reports under current UK MIFID/MIFIR rules from the first quarter of 2026, subject to regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>The ISDA DRR uses the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/isda-solutions-infohub/cdm/">Common Domain Model (CDM)</a>&nbsp;&ndash; an open-source data standard for financial products, trades and lifecycle events &ndash; to transform an industry-agreed interpretation of new or amended transaction reporting rules into unambiguous, machine-executable code, making implementation more efficient and cost-effective. Using the ISDA DRR enables firms to implement changes to regulatory reporting requirements cost-effectively and accurately and reduces the risk of regulatory penalties for misreported data.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Extension of the ISDA DRR to cover revised transaction reporting requirements under MIFID/MIFIR will establish a golden source for firms to use for their implementation. The integration of the ISDA DRR into DTCC&rsquo;s GTR MIFID/MIFIR ARM will further ease the burden of implementation, improving the accuracy and consistency of transaction reports,&rdquo; said Scott O&rsquo;Malia, ISDA&rsquo;s Chief Executive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;DTCC is pleased to continue its support of ISDA&rsquo;s DRR to better streamline trade reporting processes for market participants in the UK and EU. Through this collaboration, firms can anticipate an increase in acceptance rates for submitted trade data, as well as a reduction in the complexities and costs they face in adapting to evolving regulatory requirements. We remain committed to providing the most comprehensive and innovative trade reporting solutions to our clients globally at the best value,&rdquo; said Michele Hillery, Managing Director and Head of DTCC Repository and Derivatives Services.</p>
<p>As the trade reporting regulatory landscape continues to evolve, ISDA and DTCC are both committed to continuing to assist global market participants by driving efficiencies in their trade reporting obligations.</p>

<ul>
<li>New Securities Lending and Borrowing (SLB) Model offers a transparent, centrally cleared </li>
<li>Operated by Dubai Clear as central counterparty (CCP), the model ensures robust risk management and is fully aligned with international best practices and governance standards.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dubai Financial Market (DFM) today announced the official launch of its Centralized Securities Lending and Borrowing (SLB) Program, a strategic market infrastructure initiative aimed at enhancing market liquidity, supporting price discovery, and broadening investor participation in Dubai&rsquo;s capital market.</p>
<p>The SLB Program is operated by Dubai Clear, DFM&rsquo;s wholly owned subsidiary, which serves as the central counterparty (CCP) for all such SLB transactions. The program introduces a centralized, transparent and fully regulated framework for the loan and borrowing of eligible securities, in line with Dubai Clear&rsquo;s SLB rules and aligned with international best practices for risk management and governance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;By introducing a robust and transparent SLB framework, DFM is addressing a critical component of market development, enabling institutional and soon, retail investors to engage in securities lending and borrowing within a secure and regulated environment,&rdquo; said <b>Hamed Ali, CEO of DFM and Nasdaq Dubai, adding, &lsquo;&rsquo;</b>This initiative is part of our broader strategy to &nbsp;deepen market liquidity, strengthen market infrastructure, and support the growth of a sustainable and diversified investor base in line with global best practices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The program allows long term investors to make eligible securities available for borrowing while Borrowers, including hedge funds and market makers, can access these securities to implement trading and liquidity enhancement strategies. Loan transactions are executed through a centralized matching mechanism and settled with the CCP, ensuring full anonymity between counterparties.</p>
<p>The SLB Program features comprehensive risk management protocols, including margining requirements, collateral management, all underpinned by Dubai Clear&rsquo;s capabilities as a CCP. These safeguards significantly reduce counterparty and operational risks for all participants.</p>
<p>This initiative was unveiled during the 2025 Capital Market Summit, DFM&rsquo;s flagship event bringing together global and regional leaders to shape the future of financial markets. The introduction of the Centralized SLB Program underscores DFM&rsquo;s commitment to innovation, investor protection, and long-term market growth.</p>

<title>The EBA Updates Technical Standards On Resolution Planning Reporting</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published its updated final draft implementing technical standards (ITS) on resolution planning reporting.</span>&nbsp;<span>This comprehensive review of the ITS on the provision of information for the purposes of resolution plans seeks to achieve full harmonisation of reporting requirements in the EU and avoid duplication of data requests, thus reducing the cost of compliance with resolution planning reporting obligations by institutions. Proportionality has been a key driver of this regulatory product.</span></p>
<p>These ITS improve the usability of the data collected by resolution authorities reflecting the latest developments in resolution planning, crisis preparedness and policies, and delivering efficient practices. These ITS promote harmonisation, proportionality and simplification in resolution planning reporting by avoiding parallel data collections, and eliminating data points that are either redundant or of limited value.<span>&nbsp;</span>Proportionality has been enhanced with the streamlining of datapoints to avoid overlaps and the reporting requirements are based on the size and complexity of institutions. More specifically, measures to support simplification and proportionality include:</p>
<ul>
<li>relieving entities from parallel data collections based on legal obligations coming from different authorities;</li>
<li>Implementing a modular core-plus-supplement approach that reduces the scope of reporting obligations for certain categories of reporting entities based on their size and complexity.;</li>
<li>removing duplications and overlapping data points with MREL/TLAC, CoRep and FinRep, where the reporting entity has already submitted this data.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Next steps</h3>
<p>Following the mandate for the EBA to develop IT solutions, these ITS will repeal the Commission&rsquo;s Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/1624, with a view to making the technical standards more user-friendly for institutions. The IT solutions according to which supervisory reporting data has to be provided, including templates and instructions, can be found on the<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/activities/single-rulebook/regulatory-activities/resolution/implementing-technical-standards-overhauling-eba-resolution-planning-reporting-framework" title="Implementing Technical Standards overhauling the EBA resolution planning reporting framework">&nbsp;EBA website</a>.</p>
<p>During Q4 2025 the EBA will publish a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/risk-and-data-analysis/reporting-frameworks/reporting-framework-42">technical package</a>&nbsp;including the DPM, validation rules and taxonomy, that shall be used by institutions to submit this resolution planning reporting information to resolution authorities.</p>
<h3>Legal basis and background</h3>
<p>The Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) requires resolution authorities to draw up resolution plans that outline the actions to be taken in case an institution meets the conditions for resolution. The ITS on procedures, standard forms and templates for the provision of information for the purpose of resolution plans sets out a procedure that should be followed when resolution authorities require information about an institution for the purpose of drawing up a resolution plan.&nbsp;</p>

<title>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott K.H. Bessent's Statement Before The United States House Of Representatives Committee On Financial Services</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Chairman Hill, Ranking Member Waters, and Members of the Committee&mdash;I&rsquo;m grateful to join you today.</p>
<p>At the IMF and World Bank Group Spring Meetings last month, I relayed an important message: America First does not mean America Alone. To the contrary, America First seeks to expand U.S. leadership in international institutions like the IMF and World Bank. By embracing a stronger leadership role, the United States will restore fairness to the international economic system.</p>
<p>I look forward to answering your questions on this topic today. And I look forward to providing you with a broad overview of Treasury&rsquo;s achievements and future plans. Specifically, I would like to highlight the Department&rsquo;s efforts to boost U.S. economic growth, improve government efficiency, and target illicit actors that threaten our national security.</p>
<p>The core components of the Trump economic agenda are trade, tax cuts, and deregulation. These are not standalone policies. They are interlocking parts of an engine designed to drive economic growth and domestic manufacturing: Tax cuts and cost savings from deregulation raise real incomes for families and businesses; tariffs create an incentive for reshoring jobs and fair trade; and deregulation complements tariffs by making it easier to invest in energy and manufacturing projects.</p>
<p>Already, this agenda is bearing fruit.</p>
<p>In the first 100 days of the new administration, 464,000 new jobs were added to the economy. In April alone, over 177,000 American jobs were added&mdash;over 40,000 more than economists predicted. All the while, unemployment remains low while real hourly wages continue to grow.</p>
<p>As important as spurring job growth is wrangling inflation. And in this endeavor, the administration continues to make tangible progress. The CPI for energy goods declined in March as did the price index for core goods. And the CPI for all items declined for the first time since the COVID pandemic. While the cost of goods is decreasing, so are energy prices.</p>
<p>Complementary to our efforts to grow American prosperity, we are focused on improving efficiency across all levels of government&mdash;but especially the IRS. We just concluded a successful tax filing season. But the IRS still needs significant reforms to deliver efficient and cost-friendly results for the American people. In this endeavor, we have successfully cut $2 billion from the IRS IT budget without any operational disruptions. We achieved these cost savings by eliminating, renegotiating, and descoping wasteful IT and professional services contracts and addressing longstanding inefficiencies, such as auto-renewed licenses unused for years. This intervention alone will save taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars each year.</p>
<p>We are also taking steps at the IRS to reduce administrative costs, with a particular focus on paper processing which has been a longstanding bipartisan goal. Last year, the IRS spent approximately $450 million on paper processing with nearly 6,500 full-time staff dedicated to the task. Through policy changes and automation, Treasury aims to reduce this expense to under $20 million by the end of President Trump&rsquo;s second term.</p>
<p>In addition to making government more efficient, Treasury is committed to working alongside the White House to make America safe again. To that end, we have launched a maximum pressure campaign against violent cartels and terrorist networks. We have assessed tens of millions of dollars in civil penalties against organizations facilitating money laundering along the Southern Border. And by leveraging sanctions, we are choking off the financial lifelines of terrorists, criminals, and hackers from Mexico and Guatemala to China and Iran.</p>
<p>In the first 100 days of the new administration, we have set the table for a robust economy that allows Main Street to grow. With Congress and the White House working hand in hand, we expect to see even more positive results over the next few months. Key to expanding economic opportunity for all Americans is making the Trump tax cuts permanent. We are eager to work closely with the Members of this Committee to pass this bill into law. Together, we can build a stronger, safer, and more prosperous America.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<title>EEX’s HYDRIX Selected By BMWK For Carbon Contracts For Difference</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/eexs-hydrix-selected-by-bmwk-for-carbon-contracts-for-difference-202557/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/eexs-hydrix-selected-by-bmwk-for-carbon-contracts-for-difference-202557/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The European Energy Exchange (EEX) announces that the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK) has selected HYDRIX as reference for its Carbon Contracts for Difference (CCfD).&nbsp;</p>
<p>CCfD are designed to promote the adoption of green technologies by bridging the economic gap between conventional and sustainable production methods in energy-intensive industries. These contracts incentivise industries to transition towards climate-friendly solutions by offering companies financial planning security with regard to certain price developments as, for example, for energy carriers such as green hydrogen.</p>
<p>Peter Reitz, EEX CEO, comments:&nbsp;<em>&bdquo;The BMWK&rsquo;s adoption of HYDRIX for Carbon Contracts for Difference not only highlights our index&rsquo;s credibility as a trusted benchmark for the green hydrogen market, but also signifies a milestone in the integration of market-based instruments into national climate policy. This move is anticipated to enhance investment security and accelerate the deployment of green hydrogen solutions across Germany.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>HYDRIX is the world&rsquo;s first market-based price index for green hydrogen. It is calculated on a weekly basis based on real supply and demand data provided by industry-leading market participants. The index brings transparent and reliable pricing information, facilitating informed decision-making and bolstering confidence in the hydrogen economy.</p>
<p>For more information on HYDRIX and its role in the green hydrogen market, please visit our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eex-transparency.com/hydrogen" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">HYDRIX page</a>.</p>

<p>The Securities Information Processors (SIP) Operating Committees have announced plans to submit an amendment to the SEC to extend their operating hours. Under the proposal, the SIPs would operate from 8:00 PM ET on Sundays through 8:00 PM ET on Fridays, excluding holidays, with one technical pause occurring each day.</p>
<p>Val Wotton, Managing Director and General Manager of NSCC, DTC, and DTCC Institutional Trade Processing, praised the initiative, stating:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We commend the SIP on their efforts to align around standard trading day hours. We will continue to work with SIFMA, regulators and the industry to support the alignment of extended trading hours and any required changes to post-trade processes. Extending clearing hours will deliver increased client value by maximizing liquidity and reducing counterparty risk as our equities clearing corporation, NSCC, will be able to apply its central counterparty guarantee to overnight activity across different time zones for global participants, further strengthening the safety and soundness of the markets.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Our 5-year strategy aims at deepening trust and rebalancing risk to support growth and improve lives.</li>
<li>We are taking swift action to make sure regulation supports sustainable home ownership, while maintaining strong consumer protection.</li>
<li>Achieving home ownership is increasingly challenging for many people, risking long term financial resilience. Increasing numbers of consumers will also be borrowing into later life. We want to ensure the sector is ready to support them with the options they need.</li>
<li>The mortgage market is resilient. Over recent years we have seen improvements in mortgage lenders&rsquo; conduct standards and default rates stay historically low.</li>
<li>With the introduction of the Consumer Duty, we want to enable consumers and firms to take informed risks &ndash; and in doing so support a dynamic and competitive market.</li>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>As we celebrate the rich history of building societies in this country, it is only right that we take this opportunity to take stock of our collective achievements to date, and to look ahead.</p>
<p>In this industry there is now a strong culture of responsibility and prudence and customer support, which has paid enormous dividends.&nbsp;Despite the cost-of-living crisis and a sharp interest rate correction, mortgaged household finances have remained remarkably resilient.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default" id="section-a-safer-and-more-resilient-mortgage-market-" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>A safer and more resilient mortgage market</h2>
<p>Loan performance is markedly strong when compared to similar periods of economic stress &ndash; over 99% of mortgages originated since 2014 are not in arrears. Repossessions are below pre-pandemic levels &ndash; there were 1,000 repossessions in Q4 2024, fewer than in any quarter before Q2 2020.</p>
<p>Together we have built a safer and more resilient mortgage market.</p>
<p>But we also know it&rsquo;s a market that some creditworthy people can struggle to access, with home ownership an increasingly challenging aspiration for many.</p>
<p>I was fortunate that when I came to buy my first home, a one-bedroom flat, it was over 20 years ago when the conditions, in particular home prices, were very different to today.</p>
<p>But I know from more recent experiences of family members, what it means to buy that first home in today&rsquo;s market, how difficult it can be and the need for family support. And I am aware that kind of support does not exist for everyone.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default" id="section-the-first-rung-on-the-ladder-" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>The first rung on the ladder&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Today, successful first-time buyers tend to have higher than average household income and large deposits. Our data shows that across the market first-time buyers present no additional risk or underperformance to any other type of borrower. Safety may have come at the expense of accessibility &ndash; and in doing so, what other risks are we potentially creating for the future?</p>
<p>And that is not to recognise the efforts of building societies and credit unions in recent years to support first-time buyers across their communities across the country.</p>
<p>You lead the way in shared ownership lending, accounting for over 50% of all shared ownership mortgages, as well as exploring solutions for those with smaller deposits or using rental payments to assess creditworthiness.</p>
<p>But if you are single; have no familial support; paying rent that is as much, or more, than a mortgage payment; have irregular income; self-employed; or faced any previous financial difficulty &ndash; you are much less likely to secure a mortgage.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>And for those who can, affordability has been stretched, with the increasing numbers of consumers borrowing into later life.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default" id="section-why-access-to-mortgages-matters-" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Why access to mortgages matters</h2>
<p>For 250 years, building societies have led the way in the mortgage market, providing community-driven and innovative financing to fulfil the ambitions of aspiring homeowners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These new homeowners benefit from security of tenure, and greater financial resilience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Average mortgage payments are currently 20% lower than rental costs, and 9% of private renters who move each year do so because their landlord has asked them to leave. Meanwhile renting in retirement could require around &pound;400,000 more in savings than owning a home.</p>
<p>Our research finds that renters are more likely to struggle financially.&nbsp;So, if we can increase the numbers of first-time buyers, we can expect tangible benefits for individuals, firms, and our public finances.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default" id="section-a-market-that-can-serve-everyone" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>A market that can serve everyone</h2>
<p>But this isn&rsquo;t just about the first rung on the ladder, we need a market that can serve everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As my colleague Emily Shepperd&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/building-our-societies-through-lending-and-savings" title="Building our societies through lending and savings ">noted last year</a>, as term lengths extend and the average borrower gets older, later life lending is no longer a niche, but increasingly the norm.&nbsp;We all need to face up to the complexities &ndash; and opportunities &ndash; of increased consumer need to continue borrowing into later life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those borrowers who, today, need to maximise their mortgage term to secure a home &ndash; what steps do you need to take to support those customers manage risks arising from holding that debt for longer?&nbsp;</p>
<p>More broadly, we also know that retirement income alone will not be insufficient for many people, and the rising costs of old age &ndash; whether for care, private medical bills, or the bare necessities &ndash; mean that asset-rich does not equate to comfortable. There is around &pound;9.10tn stored in this country&rsquo;s housing stock &ndash; and outright ownership is the fastest growing tenure.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default" id="section-a-need-for-innovative-solutions" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>A need for innovative solutions</h2>
<p>As consumers may increasingly need their home to finance retirement welfare and lifestyle needs, should it become easier for customers to access their wealth? How could this option be made more attractive, and offer greater value? Regulators alone cannot solve this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But fortunately, I am speaking to the experts on later life lending &ndash; building societies account for 57% of retirement Interest-only mortgages. And better still, innovation is woven into the history of this sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first fixed-rate mortgage, now so ubiquitous it is hard to imagine the market without them, was offered by a Building Society.&nbsp;I&rsquo;m here to ask you &ndash; what comes next?</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default" id="section-supporting-growth" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Supporting growth</h2>
<p>Our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/consultation-papers/cp25-11-mortgage-rule-review-first-steps-simplify-rules-increase-flexibility" title="CP25/11:  Mortgage Rule Review: First steps to simplify our rules and increase flexibility">Mortgage Rule Review</a>&nbsp;stems from our new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/corporate-documents/our-strategy-2025-2030" title="Our strategy 2025 to 2030">five-year strategy</a>.&nbsp;In our strategy we set out our objectives to support growth and help consumers navigate their financial lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have shown that, by rebalancing risks, we can lead efforts to unlock investment and growth.&nbsp;We want to enable consumers and firms to take informed risks &ndash; and in doing so support a dynamic and competitive market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our recent statement on the interest rate stress test has already prompted several firms to embrace the flexibility in our rules, ensuring more borrowers can access affordable mortgages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And we have today launched a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/consultation-papers/cp25-11-mortgage-rule-review-first-steps-simplify-rules-increase-flexibility" title="CP25/11:  Mortgage Rule Review: First steps to simplify our rules and increase flexibility">consultation paper</a>&nbsp;on proposals to create more flexibility with our rules.&nbsp;We want to make it easier, faster and cheaper for borrowers to make changes to their mortgage.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default" id="section-improving-access-to-mortgages-" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Improving access to mortgages</h2>
<p>Today, we lay out proposals to make it easier to:</p>
<ul>
<li>remortgage with a new lender</li>
<li>reduce the length of a mortgage term</li>
<li>engage with customers outside the regulated advice process</li>
</ul>
<p>We are also proposing to retire guidance that has served its purpose to reduce the regulatory burden on the industry, while maintaining clear expectations on outcomes for consumers through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/consumer-duty" title="Consumer Duty">Consumer Duty</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These proposals can allow lenders greater scope to innovate and develop their own approaches to deliver good outcomes, and in doing so empower borrowers to make the right choices for their mortgage. So, I challenge you all to engage with this consultation fully.&nbsp;This is only a first step.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default" id="section-meaningful-change" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Meaningful change</h2>
<p>In June, we will open a discussion on the future of the mortgage market and conduct regulation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will address several themes, including those we could begin to explore today:</p>
<ul>
<li>the market&rsquo;s collective appetite for risk, and how we might approach managing changes to risk appetite</li>
<li>how we can create space for innovation, for example, through changes to affordability assessments</li>
<li>how customers are supported to access the market and make the right choices, for example, through changes to our disclosure requirements, and</li>
<li>how we ensure we are all prepared for an increase in demand for later life lending.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default" id="section-delivering-a-more-accessible-market" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Delivering a more accessible market</h2>
<p>The mortgage market has managed significant economic challenge and regulatory change over the past decade.</p>
<p>We will use this discussion to help inform where we can make meaningful change to support this industry and consumers.</p>
<p>We are listening and considering carefully about where to target our efforts to deliver a more innovative and accessible market.</p>
<p>Our aim is a mortgage market that works better for all potential borrowers who can afford to repay. Including those who currently find it less accessible than they should, saddling them with higher rents and less security.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default" id="section-a-collective-effort" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>A collective effort</h2>
<p>I hope you engage with this discussion enthusiastically and openly. We will be providing a range of opportunities to input. Because just as the members of Ketley&rsquo;s Building Society had to come together to build their homes, we cannot do this alone.</p>
<p>It will take a truly collective effort on the part of lenders, our fellow regulators, Government, developers and others to tackle the structural challenges facing the UK&rsquo;s current housing market. Reforms to conduct regulation will only ever be one part of the solution to home ownership. More homes so house prices don&rsquo;t move further out of reach. Improvements to productivity to boost incomes.</p>
<p>And to make the changes meaningful, we need you &ndash; the industry to take up the gauntlet of innovation, to use the flexibility we aim to create, to make meaningful progress for our communities.</p>
<p>So I ask you to consider where you can do more today. Where you can innovate, explore new ventures, and review your practices to meet the long-term needs of your customers. And generate sustainable growth.</p>
<p>We stand ready to support you in this.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default" id="section-conclusion" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The mortgage market is in a good place, a place that delivers value to its customers. These are the foundations we build upon.</p>
<p>We can now ask ourselves how can we create more opportunity, and where this involves additional, responsible risk-taking &ndash; what is holding us back?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need me to tell you the value of a mutual endeavour, or what can be achieved when we look with hope to the future, as Richard Ketley did 250 years ago.</p>
<p>So I ask you again to work with us as we look ahead, and to continue to do what you&rsquo;ve been doing since 1775.</p>
<p>Help our communities, building a better future, and helping ordinary people benefit from home ownership.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Growing concerns over operational and cyber resilience were the major theme of the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://events.sifma.org/ops" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SIFMA Ops 2025 conference</a>, a gathering of top operations and technology leaders from across the capital markets ecosystem.</p>
<p>The threat landscape is only becoming increasingly more sophisticated with artificial intelligence and other new tools to automate attacks.&nbsp; With high-profile data breaches, ransomware attacks, and system failures happening more frequently the importance of being prepared and protected against these growing risks has never been more important.</p>
<p>Broadridge&rsquo;s recently released&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.broadridge.com/campaign/2025-digital-transformation-study?utm_medium=PaidSearch&amp;utm_source=Google&amp;utm_campaign=L2_ET_ENTP_GLBL_XX_LP_BeReadyPhase2_SEM_FY25_Q3&amp;utm_content=ad2&amp;content_id=1883214144911275035&amp;campaign_id=701RN00000NfeKRYAZ&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADPVyHYItiCTksrPAxvn9sZMF-NgV&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIzdi987vfjAMVUVz_AR0lfDm1EAAYASAAEgKW0_D_BwE" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Digital Transformation &amp; Next-Gen Technology Study</a>&nbsp;found that 83% of firms have made cybersecurity a strategic imperative, and nearly 90% are making moderate to large investments in cybersecurity this year.

<p><i>&ldquo;The combination of higher volatility, shorter settlement cycles, and the growing risk from cyber bad actors, have made operational and cyber resilience a critical priority for our financial services clients,&rdquo;</i>&nbsp;<b>said Neha Singh, Broadridge&rsquo;s Head of Post-Trade Transformation at Broadridge Financial Solutions.</b>&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no longer a conversation about if a cyber event will happen, but how prepared they will be for recovery when it does, which is why nearly 50% of our post-trade clients have adopted our enhanced cyber recovery solution&rdquo;</i></p>

<p>Under the EU&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtSCFQJBVJdB0wMU1JVHVYKA1IdCggGVxoBBgZTUgIFBVMGAFMdBFRUBF0GDVQdU1gHUx0GDABeGg1dUgcZVVYOUlBUVVFWU1IERQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Regulation on forward capacity allocation (FCA)</a>, the Baltic national regulatory authorities were required to decide on the capacity calculation methodology for long-term timeframes by 22 March 2025. This followed a proposal&nbsp;from electricity transmission system operators, submitted on 22 January 2025.</p>
<p>On 20 March 2025, the Baltic regulators (Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Sweden) requested from ACER a three-month extension to decide on the matter.</p>
<p>In their request, the regulators explained more time is needed to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>assess the methodology&rsquo;s compatibility with existing day-ahead and intraday capacity calculation methods;</li>
<li>evaluate the technical constraints of the proposed allocation; and</li>
<li>consider potential updates from Poland&rsquo;s electricity balancing market reform.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is long-term capacity calculation?</span></p>
<p>Capacity calculation determines how much electricity can be safely and efficiently exchanged across borders in a given capacity calculation region. It ensures that available transmission capacity is calculated in a consistent and transparent way, supporting reliable cross-border electricity trading in both short- and long-term markets.</p>
<p>Long-term capacity calculation focuses on ensuring that there is enough capacity in the power grid to meet future demand over extended periods (months or even years). This supports the EU&rsquo;s internal energy market by enabling forward electricity trading and allowing market participants to plan ahead and manage price risks.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the next steps?</span></p>
<p>ACER plans to act promptly on this request, aiming to reach a decision in May 2025.</p>

Open Trading activity reached record levels in 1Q25, and we continue to see higher levels of velocity. We believe that MarketAxess&rsquo; platform is well-positioned in this environment. Looking ahead, we expect the new capabilities launched with our targeted block solution and enhancements to portfolio trading should help drive higher levels of market share in U.S. credit in the coming quarters.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>Non-GAAP financial measures and other items</b></p>
<p>To supplement the Company&rsquo;s unaudited financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;), the Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (&ldquo;EBITDA&rdquo;), EBITDA margin and free cash flow. From time to time, we present selected GAAP-basis financial results, excluding notable items. Notable items are revenues, expenses, other income (expense) and tax related items that are non-recurring and outside of the Company&rsquo;s normal course of business or other notables, such as acquisition and restructuring charges or gains/losses on sales (collectively, &ldquo;notable items&rdquo;). We define EBITDA margin as EBITDA divided by revenues. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities excluding the net change in trading investments and net change in securities failed-to-deliver and securities failed-to-receive from broker-dealers, clearing organizations and customers, less expenditures for furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements and capitalized software development costs. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in conformity with GAAP. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken into consideration with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide additional information regarding the Company&rsquo;s operating results because they assist both investors and management in analyzing and evaluating the performance of our business. Please refer to Tables 6, 7 &amp; 8<b>&nbsp;</b>for a reconciliation of: (i) GAAP net income, EPS and the effective tax rate to net income, EPS and the effective tax rate, each excluding notable items; (ii) GAAP net income to EBITDA and GAAP net income margin to EBITDA margin; and (iii) GAAP net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities to free cash flow, in each case, the most directly comparable GAAP measure.</p>

<ul>
<li><i>New CSD link to enable seamless settlement and broaden investment access between UAE and Kazakhstan</i></li>
<li><i>Partnership enhances regional market connectivity and seamless post-trade settlement for issuers and investors</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Nasdaq Dubai, the region&rsquo;s international financial exchange, and AIX CSD, the central securities depository of Astana International Exchange, today announced the launch of a direct CSD link between the two markets. The launch was announced during the Capital Market Summit 2025, hosted by Dubai Financial Market (DFM), marking a significant step in enhancing regional financial connectivity and enabling more efficient post-trade settlement for cross-listed securities.</p>
<p>Under the MoU, Nasdaq Dubai and AIX CSD will work together to facilitate the trading and settlement of securities that are dual listed on both exchanges. The operational link will allow market participants to hold shares in dual-listed securities within either CSD and trade them seamlessly on both platforms. This cross-border infrastructure will support fungibility and efficient transfer of securities between UAE and Kazakhstan, creating a more accessible investment environment for issuers and investors alike.</p>
<p>The partnership aims to provide additional investment opportunities, enhance liquidity, and deepen capital market integration between the UAE and Central Asia. By supporting dual listings and streamlining securities settlement, both exchanges are paving the way for broader participation, improved operational efficiency, and access to capital flows across the two markets.</p>
<p><b>Hamed Ali, CEO of Nasdaq Dubai and DFM</b>, said: &ldquo;This collaboration with AIX CSD marks a significant advancement in our efforts to enhance cross-border capital markets infrastructure. By establishing a direct link between our central securities depositories, we are unlocking new opportunities for issuers and investors, facilitating dual listings, improving market accessibility, and enhancing market liquidity and accessibility. It reflects Nasdaq Dubai&rsquo;s commitment to building globally connected markets that deliver operational efficiency, seamless settlement, and expanded capital-raising potential and strengthens Dubai&rsquo;s growing stature as a trusted gateway for international investment.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p><b>Assel Mukazhanova, CEO of Astana International Exchange (AIX)</b>, said: &ldquo;This is another positive development for the advancement of investment opportunities across the GCC and Central Asian regions. More importantly, the direct two-way link with Nasdaq Dubai CSD is issuer and investor driven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The link represents a key milestone in advancing cross-border market collaboration and further strengthens the economic and financial ties between the UAE and Kazakhstan. By enhancing operational infrastructure and enabling seamless movement of capital, the partnership supports broader market participation and positions both Dubai and Astana as forward-thinking hubs in the global financial landscape.</p>

<title>Franklin Templeton Launches US Mega Cap 100 ETF Tracking The Solactive US Mega Cap 100 Select Index</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/franklin-templeton-launches-us-mega-cap-100-etf-tracking-the-solactive-us-mega-c-202557/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Solactive is pleased to announce its collaboration with Franklin Templeton to launch the US Mega Cap 100 ETF, which tracks the Solactive US Mega Cap 100 Select Index. This ETF offers investors exposure to the top 100 companies in the US equity market, providing access to large cap equities.</strong></p>
<p>The US equity market continues to be a dominant force in global investing, driven by continued innovation and strong earnings growth in large-cap stocks. While the well-known &ldquo;Magnificent Seven&rdquo; stocks have led market performance, the ongoing development of artificial intelligence and technological advances are expanding the range of opportunities beyond these leading names.&nbsp;<span>[1]</span>&nbsp;This ETF is designed for investors seeking diversified exposure to the most influential US companies.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.solactive.com/indices/?index=DE000SL0PWV2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Solactive US Mega Cap 100 Select Index</a></strong>&nbsp;tracks the performance of the 100 largest companies within the Solactive GBS United States 500 Index, selected based on total market capitalization. Companies involved in controversial weapons are excluded. By weighting components according to their free-float market capitalization, the index ensures broad market representation while maintaining diversification.</p>
<p><strong>The ETF will list on the Deutsche B&ouml;rse Xetra (XETRA) on 8 May 2025 with ticker &ldquo;USMC&rdquo;, London Stock Exchange (LSE), Euronext Paris and the Borsa Italiana on 9 May 2025 with the ticker code &ldquo;US100&rdquo;.</strong></p>
<p><span>Timo Pfeiffer, Chief Markets Officer at Solactive, commented:</span><em>&nbsp;&ldquo;We are delighted to partner with Franklin Templeton. The Solactive US Mega Cap 100 Select Index provides investors a structured approach to gaining exposure to the largest US companies. As AI and technological innovation continue to drive market growth, we at Solactive remain committed to providing innovative index solutions that help investors navigate the evolving US equity landscape with confidence.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><span>Caroline Baron, Head of ETF Distribution, EMEA, Franklin Templeton, commented:</span>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Looking back 30 years, the largest 100 securities in US equities have captured greater market upside than a broader index such as the S&amp;P 500. This ETF can be utilised by investors as a nimble tool to dial up US equity market exposure or quickly implement a risk-on trade, offering a distinct risk-return profile.&rdquo;</em></p>

<title>Securities Commission Malaysia Charges Businessman With Securities Fraud Involving RM3.159 Million And Unlicensed Capital Market Activities</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) today charged Razrul Anwar bin Rusli (Razrul) at the Kuala Lumpur Sessions Court for defrauding five investors of RM3.159 million for fictitious investments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Razrul, 44, was charged with eight charges under section 179(b) of the Capital Markets and Services Act 2007 (CMSA) for falsely representing to investors that he would invest their monies in a fictitious investment scheme known as &ldquo;Amal Trust&rdquo; which purportedly offered Shariah-compliant bonds with high returns.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The victims had transferred their monies to several bank accounts for the alleged investment following Razrul&rsquo;s representation. If convicted, Razrul faces a jail term not exceeding 10 years and to a fine not less than RM1 million.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Razrul also additionally faced two other charges relating to unlicensed capital market activities. The first charge, under section 58(1) of the CMSA relates to Razrul&rsquo;s conduct of holding himself out as carrying on a business in the regulated activity of dealing in securities.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Razrul does not hold a Capital Markets Services Licence (CMSL) nor is he a registered person for dealing in securities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This offence carries a maximum fine of RM10 million or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years, or both.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second charge, under Section 362(3) of the CMSA relates to the usage of descriptions on the Amal Trust website that the investment schemes offered complied with securities laws.&nbsp; This created the belief that Razrul was licensed to carry on a business in relation to the regulated activity of dealing in securities when he was in fact not licensed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The offence carries a maximum fine not exceeding RM1 million or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or both.</p>
<p>The alleged offences took place between April 2019 and April 2021 in various places in Kuala Lumpur, Selangor and Penang. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Razrul claimed trial to all 10 charges before Sessions Court judge Tuan Zulqarnain bin Hassan and was granted bail at RM500,000 with two local sureties. He was also ordered to surrender his passport to the court and report to the SC&rsquo;s Investigating Officer on a monthly basis as additional bail conditions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SC urges the public to be cautious and to verify any investment offers through the SC&rsquo;s Investment Checker at<a href="https://www.sc.com.my/investment-checker"> </a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/investment-checker">www.sc.com.my/investment</a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/investment-checker">-</a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/investment-checker">checker</a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/investment-checker">.</a></p>

<p>Michelle brings significant expertise and a wealth of experience in compliance, having held several regulatory compliance roles over the past 30 years at the Bank of America, ABN AMRO, National Bank of Greece, Alpari UK Limited, Electronic Voice &amp; Foreign Exchange Limited and Plus500UK Limited.</p>
<p>Prior to joining Saxo, Michelle served as the Head of Compliance &amp; Money Laundering Reporting Officer at Plus500UK Limited, where she co-spearheaded the development of effective compliance and anti-money laundering policies and procedures, systems and controls at the firm. Before this, Michelle was a regulatory consultant, working with some of the UK&rsquo;s top retail banks, foreign banks, hedge funds, corporate financiers, equity and forex brokers.</p>
<p>Commenting on her new role,&nbsp;<b>Michelle West&nbsp;</b>said:</p>
<p><i>"I'm excited to be joining Saxo at such a pivotal time for the business. In an evolving regulatory landscape, I look forward to working with the team to ensure that Saxo remains at the forefront of risk management and regulatory compliance."</i></p>
<p><b>Andrew Bresler</b>, CEO of Saxo UK, commented on her appointment:</p>
<p><i>"</i><i>We are delighted to welcome Michelle to the team, as we continue to deliver on our ambitious growth strategy in the UK, supporting UK investors to make the most of their money and savings.

Michelle&rsquo;s extensive experience and breadth of knowledge will be invaluable as we continue to develop and expand our UK operations.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Michelle&rsquo;s appointment follows that of Neil Wilson as UK Investor Strategist in April 2025.

<p>Last month, Saxo unveiled a new Flexible ISA, following a 591% surge in demand for its Stocks and Shares ISA during January and February 2025 compared to the same period last year.

<p>Initially, 3DX supports bilateral settlement, while remaining adaptable to various post-trade models to meet diverse client needs for enhanced risk management in the future. Moreover, 3DX will continuously align its trading offerings with client demand, ensuring a responsive and adaptive trading environment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not only does the launch of 3DX demonstrate Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group&rsquo;s broader commitment to be a leader in the digital assets space,&rdquo; said Carlo K&ouml;lzer, &ldquo;it represents a significant milestone in 360T&rsquo;s history as a global marketplace that aims to grow as a trusted partner in the evolving crypto landscape and in line with the increasing interests from our clients.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">3iQ&rsquo;s leadership echoed this sentiment:&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;The United Arab Emirates is at the forefront of financial innovation and robust digital assets regulation.

<title>"Staying The Course For Asia's Transition To A Climate-Resilient Future" - Opening Address By Mr Chia Der Jiun, Managing Director, Monetary Authority Of Singapore, At The FAST Conference 2025 On 7 May 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>
<p>1.<span> </span>A very good morning. It is my pleasure to welcome you today to the FAST Conference 2025.First, please let me acknowledge our partners for the FAST conference, Mr Cheng Wai Keung, Deputy Chairman of Temasek and Ms Susan Chan, Head of Asia Pacific of BlackRock.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;<span> </span>We are facing a more uncertain path ahead for climate action than at any time in the last five years:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is greater uncertainty in global commitments to timely transition.</li>
<li>Global private sector coalitions for climate action are also seeing a pullback. Many financial institutions have withdrawn from net zero alliances, and these alliances themselves have revised their objectives.</li>
<li>Global corporate investment more generally may also turn more cautious amid heightened trade and economic uncertainty.</li>
</ul>
<p>3.<span> </span>On the positive side:</p>
<ul>
<li>COP29 saw broad agreement to enhance cooperation in such areas as carbon markets and climate adaptation, as well as new goals to channel financing to developing countries;</li>
<li>Many countries have submitted their 2035 NDCs, reaffirming a steady pathway towards their net zero goals; and</li>
<li>Many major financial institutions have affirmed continued commitment to their net zero targets.</li>
</ul>
<p>4.<span> </span>We are meeting at a critical time. It is now even more important to bring together leaders across policy, finance and the real economy, to advance concrete approaches and solutions that will maintain the course for climate action and the region&rsquo;s transition to a climate-resilient and nature-positive future.</p>
<p><span><span>Enabling the Energy Transition in Asia</span></span></p>
<p>5.<span> </span>In Asia, enabling energy transition will be key to transitioning our economies.</p>
<ul>
<li>Asia&rsquo;s demand for electricity is projected to rise at an annual rate of 4% until 2035<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2025/staying-the-course-for-asias-transition-to-a-climate-resilient-future#1">[1]</a></span>, driven by end-use sectors such as transport, industry and buildings.</li>
</ul>
<p>6.<span> </span>While energy demand is still growing, the good news is that in parts of Asia, renewable energy already makes up a significant share of the energy mix, supported by falling costs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wind and solar generation capacity in China has already exceeded fossil fuel-based thermal power capacity for the first time in March this year.</li>
<li>Countries such as the Philippines, Thailand and Cambodia are also seeing lower renewable energy costs than that of coal-generated energy.<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2025/staying-the-course-for-asias-transition-to-a-climate-resilient-future#2">[2]</a></span></li>
</ul>
<p>7.<span> </span>There is an opportunity to drive the deployment of renewable energy and develop the infrastructure and solutions to support growth in Asian economies in a sustainable and resilient manner.</p>
<ul>
<li>The IEA expects renewable energy to supply more than half of Asia&rsquo;s increased electricity demand.<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2025/staying-the-course-for-asias-transition-to-a-climate-resilient-future#3">[3]</a></span></li>
<li>The increase in demand for electricity will catalyse a corresponding demand for supporting infrastructure and solutions. Earlier this year, ASEAN foreign ministers reaffirmed the commitment to operationalise the ASEAN Power Grid (APG) by 2045.</li>
<li>Almost S$1.1 trillion in financing is estimated to be needed over the next decade to ramp up renewable energy capacity, upgrade existing power grid infrastructure, and invest in battery storage systems.<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2025/staying-the-course-for-asias-transition-to-a-climate-resilient-future#4">[4]</a></span></li>
</ul>
<div>
<p>8.<span> </span>Singapore hopes to do more to catalyse the scaling up of renewables power generation and their enabling infrastructure in Asia.</p>
<ul>
<li>Over the years, Singapore has supported partners across the entire infrastructure value chain, serving as the regional base to many international infrastructure development companies, project finance teams of global financial institutions, as well as multilateral development banks such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank.</li>
</ul>
<p>9.<span> </span>We have also put in place key initiatives to enable the financing of Asia&rsquo;s energy transition.</p>
<p>10.<span> </span>First, we have provided clear and credible definitions through the&nbsp;<em>Singapore-Asia Taxonomy (SAT)</em>&nbsp;on what are green and transition activities, including activities within the Energy Sector.</p>
<ul>
<li>Specifically, for electricity generation using renewables such as solar PV and wind, the SAT sets out thresholds and criteria for classifying such activities as &ldquo;green&rdquo; or &ldquo;transition&rdquo;.</li>
<li>There has been good adoption amongst financial institutions and corporates of the SAT since its launch.&nbsp;<span>Financial products have been developed based on the SAT&rsquo;s classifications, portfolios have been aligned with the SAT&rsquo;s criteria and corporate sustainability strategies have been formulated with reference to the SAT.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>11.<span> </span></span>We are also bringing partners together through blended finance platforms to co-create solutions for the region, de-risk investments, and catalyse the flow of private capital, for energy transition projects.</p>
<ul>
<li>We launched the&nbsp;<em>Financing Asia&rsquo;s Transition Partnership (FAST-P)</em>&nbsp;in end-2023 to raise up to US$5 billion to support Asia&rsquo;s decarbonisation and climate resilience.</li>
<li>Within the FAST-P platform, the Green Investment Partnership (GIP), managed by Pentagreen Capital, will be ready to commence deployment in the coming months. They will mobilise capital for marginally bankable clean energy infrastructure in Asia.</li>
<li><span>I am also glad to share that a FAST-P office, with a dedicated management team, will soon be set up</span>&nbsp;to facilitate the deployment of up to US$500 million of concessional capital from the Singapore Government into the three FAST-P partnerships, alongside capital from other partners. The office will continue to work closely with asset managers, banks, and commercial and concessional investors, to promote innovative blended finance solutions for sustainable infrastructure in the region.</li>
</ul>
<p>12.<span> </span>These are important milestones, but we recognise that an ecosystem approach &ndash; regulators, businesses, and financial institutions coming together &ndash; will continue to be needed to overcome these challenges. MAS will continue to work closely with the industry to develop solutions to support the region&rsquo;s energy transition.</p>
<p><span><span>Developing High Integrity Carbon Markets</span></span></p>
<p><span>13.<span> </span>A second area of focus for Singapore is the development of high integrity carbon markets.There are situations where the economic case for climate projects may not be well-established, making it difficult to crowd in investors and capital. High-integrity and well-functioning carbon markets can play an important role, to strengthen the economic case for decarbonisation and channel much needed capital towards worthwhile projects.</span></p>
<p>14.<span> </span>There have been headwinds in the last few years, but recent developments such as the finalisation of Article 6 rules at COP29, and the growing industry acceptance of meta-standards such as the ICVCM&rsquo;s<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2025/staying-the-course-for-asias-transition-to-a-climate-resilient-future#5">[5]</a></span>&nbsp;Core Carbon Principles, are helping to build confidence in carbon markets.</p>
<p>15.<span> </span>Shaping a well-functioning global carbon market will require progress in the areas of (i) supply of high-integrity credits; (ii) strong demand for credits; and (iii) robust market infrastructure and capabilities. At the GenZero Climate Summit Insights earlier this week, 2nd Minister for Trade and Industry Dr Tan See Leng spoke about the work the Singapore Government is undertaking to address these gaps, including through developing common standards, crowding in financing, and building capabilities.</p>
<div>
<p>16.<span> </span>The&nbsp;<em>Transition Credits Coalition</em>&nbsp;convened by the MAS is also an important initiative that seeks to address some of these gaps in the carbon markets.</p>
<ul>
<li>In its interim report launched at COP29 last year, TRACTION outlined common key high-integrity attributes across various methodologies and frameworks for the early retirement of coal and its replacement with clean energy. It also identified the transaction risks and possible risk mitigation solutions, and motivations of different buyer profiles.</li>
</ul>
<p>17.<span> </span>Building on these findings,&nbsp;<span>TRACTION has identified the market and technical conditions where transition credits have the greatest potential to make an impact</span>. This will enable the industry to prioritise a pipeline of suitable transition credits projects.</p>
<p>18.<span> </span><span>TRACTION has also identified the key components of a Just Transition associated with the early retirement of coal plants</span>, to guide project owners and financial institutions to address the socio-economic impacts of coal plant closures on workers and communities.</p>
<p>19.<span> </span>These findings help foster a common understanding of high-integrity and viable transition credit transactions, enhancing the scalability of transition credits as a mechanism to crowd in financing for energy transition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>20.<span> </span>I would also highlight the work of the Singapore Sustainable Finance Association (SSFA). The SSFA is collaborating with the Singapore Government to develop guidance for companies on the credible usage of carbon credits alongside a decarbonisation plan. They are also developing solutions to deepen carbon project financing and collaborating with ASEAN counterparts on the ASEAN Common Carbon Framework.</p>
<p>21.<span> </span>MAS, together with the SSFA, are now considering initiatives to further support financial institutions&rsquo; participation in carbon markets.</p>
<p><span><span>Strengthening Climate and Nature Resilience in the Financial Sector</span></span></p>
<p>22.<span> </span>Let me move on to a growing area of importance, that of adaptation and resilience. As the physical impact of climate change intensifies, there are mounting risks posed by both climate change and nature loss &ndash; risks that have cascading effects across sectors, markets, and value chains.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) intends to consider more closely how climate-related physical risks can pose threats to financial stability.</li>
<li>MAS took early steps in 2020 to embed resilience in the financial system, by issuing a set of&nbsp;<em>Guidelines on Environmental Risk Management (ENRM).</em>&nbsp;These set out expectations for robust governance, risk management, and disclosures related to environmental risks.</li>
<li>Our financial institutions have also started to enhance the resilience of their portfolios to climate and nature risks. For example, by integrating physical climate risk into their internal credit risk models, asset valuation, and due diligence processes. Doing so will enable them to better anticipate and manage financial loss, minimise stranded assets, and uncover new financing and investment opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<p>23.<span> </span>There is growing interest in how nature loss and ecosystem degradation can amplify the effects of climate change and put nature-dependent value chains at risk. It is timely that the SSFA, in partnership with Oliver Wyman, launched a white paper two weeks ago, titled&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Financing Our Natural Capital.&rdquo;</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The whitepaper contextualises global frameworks to our region, identifies sectors of high priority from a nature materiality lens, and provides practical steps for financial institutions to incorporate nature into their business activity<span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>24.<span> </span>Beyond managing their own environmental risk, financial institutions play an essential role in mobilising capital towards solutions that enhance the adaptive capacity of economies and communities.</p>
<ul>
<li>The insurance industry in particular has a key role in developing risk financing solutions for renewable energy and decarbonisation technologies, to reduce the risk of such projects for commercial investors.</li>
<li>Several international insurance brokers have built specialised capabilities in Singapore to support and develop such risk financing solutions, through risk analytics and advisory for physical climate risk, energy transition investments, and carbon and nature markets.</li>
</ul>
<p>25.<span> </span>Ultimately, financial institutions can respond on two fronts: by managing exposure to growing climate and nature-related risks, and by innovating to finance and de-risk adaptation, resilience, and nature-positive solutions.</p>
<p><span><span>Staying the Course and Building the Future&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>26.<span> </span>There are near-term uncertainties about the global momentum for climate action, but Asia can continue to chart a steady course in its transition. Policymakers, financial institutions, and corporates alike should take the long view, stay the course, and invest in the infrastructure, solutions, and capabilities that will enable industries and economies to transition. In doing so, we will unlock new opportunities for growth, create jobs, build resilient economies and make possible a more resilient future for all of us.</span></p>
<p>27.<span> </span>Thank you.</p>

<title>ASIC Acts Against Macquarie Bank For Repeated Compliance Failures</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-acts-against-macquarie-bank-for-repeated-compliance-failures-202557/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-acts-against-macquarie-bank-for-repeated-compliance-failures-202557/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC has imposed additional conditions on Macquarie Bank Limited&rsquo;s (Macquarie) Australian financial services licence after multiple and significant compliance failures &ndash; some going undetected for many years and one for a decade.</p>
<p>The compliance failures relate to Macquarie&rsquo;s futures dealing business and its over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives trade reporting.</p>
<p>The additional licence conditions will require Macquarie to:</p>
<ul>
<li>prepare a remediation plan to address the failures in their futures dealing business and OTC derivatives trade reporting functions and their root causes</li>
<li>appoint an independent expert to review and report on the adequacy of Macquarie&rsquo;s remediation plan to address the failures and their root causes, and</li>
<li>have the independent expert assess the operational effectiveness of Macquarie&rsquo;s remediation activities to prevent, detect and respond to similar issues occurring in its futures dealing and OTC derivatives businesses in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>ASIC Commissioner Simone Constant said, &lsquo;Our intervention underscores our concern with the recurrent nature of Macquarie&rsquo;s failures, which were caused by ineffective supervision and weak compliance and control management.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The control weaknesses ranged from poor change management practices, unclear roles and responsibilities, and an incomplete understanding of its own processes and controls, including around data governance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The additional licence conditions are a significant administrative action to ensure Macquarie comprehensively addresses ASIC&rsquo;s concerns. It cannot be a piece-meal or band-aid fix.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Macquarie must take responsibility and put in place appropriate action to remediate the repeated failures and underlying governance and supervisory failures.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We were particularly disappointed that Macquarie failed to prevent 11 suspicious orders being placed on the electricity futures market via Macquarie terminals shortly after ASIC had referred similar failures to the Markets Disciplinary Panel which fined the bank just under $5 million.&rsquo;</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s administrative action follows the identification or reporting of nine market conduct matters of concern in the last 18 months &ndash; seven matters relating to misreporting of more than 375,000 OTC derivative transactions, and two futures dealing matters concerning the prevention and detection of suspicious trading activity and the withholding of orders on the ASX24 market.</p>
<p>Many of the OTC derivatives trade reporting breaches continued for a number of years without detection.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Misreporting of OTC derivative transactions can undermine market transparency and hinders ASIC&rsquo;s ability to monitor potential risks in Australia&rsquo;s financial system,&rsquo; Ms Constant said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;These licence conditions are necessary to give ASIC confidence the remediation will be effective and drive sustainable change.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ms Constant acknowledged that Macquarie has cooperated with ASIC throughout this process and has consented to the imposition of the additional licence conditions.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In September 2024, ASIC&rsquo;s Markets Disciplinary Panel fined Macquarie a record $4.995 million for failing to prevent suspicious orders being placed on the electricity futures market (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-211mr-macquarie-bank-fined-a-record-4-995m-for-serious-market-gatekeeper-failure/?altTemplate=betanewsroom" title="24-211MR Macquarie Bank fined a record $4.995m for serious market gatekeeper failure">24-211MR</a>).</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Captains of industry, financial leaders, and dignitaries gathered at the Nigerian Exchange Group House for an Afternoon of Tributes and Special Closing Gong Ceremony in honour of late Dr. Pascal G. Dozie, OON, CON, former President of the Council of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE). Organised by Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX Group), the event celebrated a visionary whose leadership and integrity helped shape Nigeria&rsquo;s financial markets and corporate landscape.</p>
<p>In his welcome remarks, Alhaji (Dr.) Umaru Kwairanga, Chairman of NGX Group, reflected on Dr. Dozie&rsquo;s profound influence, stating, &ldquo;Dr. Dozie was a banker, entrepreneur, economist, and philanthropist&mdash;but above all, he was a builder of institutions. His tenure as President of the NSE Council marked a pivotal chapter in our history. With foresight and steady leadership, he laid the foundation for a world-class Exchange that not only serves Nigeria but inspires confidence across Africa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Continuing the stream of tributes, industry leaders shared reflections on Dr. Dozie&rsquo;s legacy of principled leadership and institutional advancement. Dr. Ernest Ndukwe, Chairman of MTN Nigeria Plc, praised his role in entrenching professionalism in the private sector. Mr. Gabriel Idahosa, President of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, described him as &ldquo;a man of unwavering principle whose life embodied ethical leadership and nation-building.&rdquo; Dr. Raymond Obieri, former NSE Council President, recalled their shared commitment to institutional growth: &ldquo;Pascal was the kind of leader who brought calm to chaos and vision to uncertainty. His leadership was never about power, it was always about purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Adding to this sentiment, Mr. Ahonsi Unuigbe, Chairman of Nigerian Exchange Limited, urged attendees to honour Dr. Dozie&rsquo;s legacy through action: &ldquo;He did not just serve; he built, inspired, and transformed. The greatest tribute we can pay is to ensure the institutions he strengthened continue to thrive with integrity, transparency, and innovation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Olaniyi Yusuf, Chairman of the Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG), underscored Dr. Dozie&rsquo;s foundational role: &ldquo;He was not just a founding father of NESG but a compass for our mission to build a globally competitive Nigerian economy. His vision and principled leadership continue to guide us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speaking from a personal perspective, Mr. Uzoma Dozie offered an intimate tribute to his father: &ldquo;Beyond his professional achievements, he was a man of quiet wisdom and grace. His presence commanded respect, and his influence shaped minds and institutions alike. His absence will be deeply felt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Temi Popoola, Group Chief Executive Officer of NGX Group, added: &ldquo;Dr. Dozie was more than an industry titan, he was a mentor, a visionary, and a nation-builder. His contributions were not just pioneering but transformative. To his family, we say thank you for sharing him with the nation. May his soul rest in peace, and may we all carry forward the light he ignited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other notable speakers included Mr. Emmanuel Ikazoboh, former Interim Administrator, NSE; Mr. Oscar N. Onyema, OON, former Group CEO, NGX Group; Mr. Olufemi Akinsanya, Chairman of NGX Regulation; Mrs. Elizabeth Ebi, Managing Director, Futureview Group; and Mr. Frank Aigbogun, Publisher/CEO of BusinessDay Media.</p>
<p>The ceremony concluded with the symbolic Closing Gong Ceremony, not as a farewell, but as a reaffirmation of the values of integrity, excellence, and service to humanity, Dr. Dozie championed.</p>

<title>Ontario Securities Commission Analysis Highlights Increasing Mentions And Diverging Sentiment In AI Disclosures</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ontario-securities-commission-analysis-highlights-increasing-mentions-and-diverg-202557/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) has released&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/industry/artificial-intelligence/how-are-issuers-discussing-ai-their-financial-disclosures">staff research</a>&nbsp;that analyzes the frequency and sentiment of Canadian listed issuers&rsquo; references to Artificial Intelligence (AI) in their financial disclosures.</p>
<p>OSC staff analyzed the Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&amp;A) filings from S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index issuers over a 10-year period.&nbsp; The exploratory study also provided OSC staff with an opportunity to test new large language models (LLMs) for sentiment analysis.</p>
<p>The exploratory research revealed three key findings:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><span>Increased AI Mentions</span>: The OSC observed a substantial rise in the number of issuers mentioning AI in their MD&amp;As, reflecting the growing importance and integration of AI technologies across various sectors.</li>
<li><span>Shift in Tone</span>: The 2024 filing year marks a turning point in the overall tone used by issuers to discuss AI. Previously most issuers that discussed AI had an overall positive sentiment, however along with more issuers mentioning AI, there has been a substantial increase in negative sentiment, indicating a more balanced view of AI's risks and opportunities.</li>
<li><span>Diverging Sentiments</span>: Issuers in the Finance and Information sectors exhibit a distinct divergence in sentiment compared to those in other industries. While Finance and Information sectors maintain a more positive outlook on AI, other industries are increasingly cautious.</li>
</ol>
<p>"This research underscores the evolving landscape of AI in corporate disclosures. As issuers become more attuned to the potential benefits and risks of AI, we see a more nuanced discussion emerging,&rdquo; said Leslie Byberg, Executive Vice President, Strategic Regulation at the OSC.</p>
<p>This exploratory analysis was conducted by staff in the Thought Leadership division of the OSC.</p>
<p>The mandate of the OSC is to provide protection to investors from unfair, improper or fraudulent practices, to foster fair, efficient and competitive capital markets and confidence in the capital markets, to foster capital formation, and to contribute to the stability of the financial system and the reduction of systemic risk. Investors are urged to check the registration of any persons or company offering an investment opportunity and to review the OSC investor materials available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/">http://www.osc.ca</a>.</p>

<title>Quarter Frictions: Remarks Before The Small Business Capital Formation Advisory Committee, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, Washington D.C., May 6, 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/quarter-frictions-remarks-before-the-small-business-capital-formation-advisory-202556/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/quarter-frictions-remarks-before-the-small-business-capital-formation-advisory-202556/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you to the Committee members for your continued service and to today&rsquo;s panelists. I was at the grocery store the other day thinking about, of course, small business capital raising. I shop at several different grocery stores, each of which has its plusses&mdash;low prices, broad selection, high-quality local produce, unique items, proximity to other places I need to go. Each store also has its frictions&mdash;crowded parking lots and aisles, annoying quarter deposits for grocery carts, limited opening hours. I often choose the store based as much on the frictions I will face in going there as on which one has what I want that day. That quarter for a grocery cart might just be the deciding factor against a particular store on a day when I have neither a quarter nor the capacity to carry everything I need to buy. Just as I have choice in grocery stores, small businesses have multiple capital raising options, and frictions often dictate the choice small businesses make.</p>
<p>Regulation A, the topic of today&rsquo;s meeting, is one avenue for small companies to raise capital, but the frictions are high. When an issuer decides to do a Reg A offering, it first must choose between Tier 1 and Tier 2. Neither choice is completely satisfying. Issuers that offer and sell securities under Tier 1 of Reg A can raise up to $20 million in a 12-month period and have fewer ongoing disclosure obligations but miss out on any form of state law preemption. Without state law preemption, issuers are required to register or qualify their offering in any state in which they seek to offer or sell securities, a process that can be costly, time-consuming, and confusing. Issuers that offer and sell securities under Tier 2 of Reg A can raise up to $75 million in a 12-month period and get state law preemption, for primary sales at least, but are subject to more burdensome ongoing reporting requirements. Perhaps those frictions help explain why from July 2023 through June 2024 companies raised only $1.5 billion using Reg A compared to $12 billion using general solicitation under Section 506(c) and $170 billion in private placements under Section 506(b).<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-sbcfac-050625?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;A discussion of Regulation A is therefore timely.</p>
<p>Among the questions I have for your consideration are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Small Business Advocate&rsquo;s 2024 report showed that over the last several years &ldquo;[t]he amounts and number of [Reg A] offerings have continued to decline.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-sbcfac-050625?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;To what do you attribute that decline?</li>
<li>By contrast, &ldquo;[t]he number of offerings raising more than $50 million has remained relatively stable&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-sbcfac-050625?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3">[3]</a>&nbsp;at about 20 per year. To what do you attribute the fact that larger offerings have not declined?</li>
<li>Would Tier 2 of Reg A be a more viable avenue for raising capital if secondary trading enjoyed state law preemption? If so, what conditions should apply to such preemption?</li>
<li>Should the Tier 1 and Tier 2 offering limits be raised to make Reg A a more attractive option for a broader range of companies? What would reasonable caps be?</li>
<li>How could the Commission streamline the regulatory obligations under Reg A without compromising investor protection?</li>
<li>Should, as one commenter recently suggested,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-sbcfac-050625?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4">[4]</a>&nbsp;pooled investment vehicles be permitted under Reg A?</li>
<li>One reason a discussion of Reg A is timely is that some crypto market observers see it as a viable avenue for public offerings of crypto assets.<ol>
<li>Former Committee member Sara Hanks, for example, pointed to Reg A as &ldquo;the most appropriate option for public offerings of either tokenized traditional securities or novel crypto assets, without violence to the original objectives of Regulation A or the need for significant rulemaking.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-sbcfac-050625?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5">[5]</a>&nbsp;Do you agree?</li>
<li>If so, should the Commission take the position that crypto tokens are &ldquo;equity&rdquo; for purposes of a Reg A offering? Would such a position conflict with how crypto assets are treated for accounting purposes? I have heard that at least one crypto asset issuer attempting to use Reg A was advised that the crypto assets should be treated as equity for securities law purposes and debt for accounting purposes.</li>
<li>Would any other aspects of Reg A prove challenging for crypto asset issuers?</li>
<li>Hanks suggested &ldquo;that the &lsquo;exit&rsquo; provisions to Regulation A ongoing reporting suit native digital assets that are securities at inception, but cease to be securities once a specific blockchain project has been sufficiently developed.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-sbcfac-050625?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6">[6]</a>&nbsp;Should the Commission, as she suggests, &ldquo;confirm that when an instrument that was a security ceases to be such (by reason of decentralization, completion of a blockchain project, etc.) there are no longer 300 holders of record of the applicable class of securities?&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-sbcfac-050625?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7">[7]</a></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>I welcome your insights on the frictions associated with Reg A offerings, what we can do to address them, and any unique considerations for the application of Reg A in the crypto context. I hope you have a productive and enjoyable meeting.</p>
