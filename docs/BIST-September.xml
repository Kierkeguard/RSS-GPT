<title>ICE Mortgage Monitor: Rate Drops Make August Most Affordable Month Since February, As Home Price Growth Cools To 12-Month Low</title>

<div> mortgage rates, home affordability, purchase demand, home prices, inventory levels
Summary:
Declining mortgage rates improve home affordability, boosting purchase demand. Home prices cool in some areas due to rising inventory levels. <div>
<div class="bw-subheadline-wrapper">
<ul>
<li>Declining mortgage rates have brought home affordability to its best level since February and boosted refinance incentive for many recent-vintage mortgages</li>
<li>With 30-year conforming rates down 60 bps from just over 7% in May, the principal and interest payment on the average-priced home purchase is $145 less per month than just three months ago</li>
<li>The share of income needed to make payments on that home (34.3%) is still 10 pp above its 30-year average and ICE Market Trends data shows recent record highs in down payments and credit scores</li>
<li>Spurred by rate declines, purchase loan demand had two of its best weeks since March, but remains noticeably below the levels seen earlier this year and in 2023 when rates were at comparable levels</li>
<li>The ICE Home Price Index for July showed the annual rate of home price growth slipping to +3.6% from +4.1% in June, marking the slowest pace in 12 months on rising inventory and still-soft demand</li>
<li>While prices were up +0.19% from June at the national level, they fell by -0.25% or more across each of Florida&rsquo;s nine largest metros which, along with Austin, saw the largest single-month declines in July</li>
<li>In the Midwest and Northeast, inventory shortages persist, and prices continued to push higher in July</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today released its September 2024&nbsp;<a href="https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com/resources/data-reports" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">ICE Mortgage Monitor Report</a>&nbsp;, based on the company&rsquo;s robust mortgage, real estate and public records data sets.</p>
<p>August&rsquo;s mortgage interest rate declines have brought home affordability to its best point in six months. And while purchase mortgage demand has seen a couple of its best weeks since mid-March in response, the rise was muted in comparison to early 2023 and 2024 when rates fell to similar levels. As Andy Walden, ICE Vice President of Research and Analysis, explains, that may actually be good news for the Fed&rsquo;s goal of lowering rates without overheating the market.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Recent easing in mortgage rates brought some much-sought relief to prospective homebuyers,&rdquo; said Walden. &ldquo;Along with a general cooling in home price growth, rates falling below 6.5% made August the most affordable month for housing since February. When it comes to affordability, as always, context is important: it still takes 10 percentage points more of the median income to buy the average house than it has on average over the last 30 years. Our own ICE Market Trends data shows that prospective homebuyers are also facing record high down payments and credit scores among recent purchase mortgages. Affordability is still very much a challenge and that is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, but August&rsquo;s improvement is certainly welcome progress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three of the nation&rsquo;s 100 largest markets are back to their own long-run average affordability levels (Birmingham, Ala.; Des Moines, Iowa; and McAllen, Texas). Cleveland, Toledo, Memphis and Baton Rouge are all within one percentage point (pp) of their respective benchmarks. Another 22 markets are within 5 pp of their benchmarks. In more than half of all major markets, however, it still takes at least 10 pp more of local median income to make the monthly payment on the average home purchase, when compared to their own long run averages. Payment-to-income ratios in some California markets are currently 20 pp higher, or more, than traditionally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even as affordability challenges persist,&rdquo; Walden continued, &ldquo;purchase demand perked up on August&rsquo;s rate drops, hinting at a population of prospective homebuyers poised and ready to act as soon as market movements tip the affordability math in their favor. August&rsquo;s demand remains muted from earlier this year and last, when interest rates were at comparable levels, but that may well turn out to be a good thing on balance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Growing inventory and continuing soft demand led home prices to cool further in July, bringing the annual growth rate down to +3.6% in July from +4.1% in June. Adjusted for seasonality, prices were up +0.19% in the month, equivalent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) of +2.3%. The spread between single-family home and condominium prices continued to widen, with the former up 3.7% year-over-year in July, as compared to +2.3% for condos across the country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The market today is in a good position from the perspective of the Fed and its mission,&rdquo; Walden added. &ldquo;Slower home growth is a positive sign in the Fed&rsquo;s fight against inflation and increased &ndash; but still mild &ndash; demand is good for the market and Fed alike. And of course, in some slightly good news for homebuyers, affordability has improved measurably from recent historic peaks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, recent inventory gains come much more from softer demand than from an increased willingness among homeowners to list their homes for sale. This makes supply &ndash; and its follow-on effect on home prices &ndash; sensitive to rate changes, making demand worth watching closely. Without a meaningful return in new listing volumes, the market is reliant on weak demand to allow inventory to grow, limiting the prospect of stronger sales activity without a corresponding risk of inventory drawdowns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rising inventory levels are resulting in softer home prices across the state of Florida. While prices rose an adjusted +0.19% nationally in July, they fell across each of Florida&rsquo;s nine largest markets by -0.25% or more. Cape Coral saw the largest decline, with prices there falling by a full percentage point in the month. It was followed by North Port, which saw a -0.9% single-month decline, and prices are now 7% and 6% off their respective recent peaks. Prices fell by 0.3% or more in Jacksonville, Deltona, Tampa, Palm Bay, Lakeland, Orlando and Miami.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florida is not alone,&rdquo; Walden added. &ldquo;Other areas where inventory has returned to or exceeded pre-pandemic norms also saw prices edge lower in July. Places like Austin, San Antonio, Memphis, New Orleans and San Francisco. On the other side of that coin, inventory shortages persist in many parts of the Midwest and Northeast, where prices continue to push higher. Just look at Cleveland, Providence, Richmond and Chicago, which &ndash; along with Seattle &ndash; made up the top five performing metros in July from a home price growth perspective.&rdquo;</p>

<p>FIA, the leading global trade organisation for the futures, options and centrally cleared derivatives markets, has<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://email.fia.org/c/12ga8OU1rYJ9FSD8NYG25GqOo84pkF">published a paper</a>&nbsp;outlining its views on how to support the progress of the European Union&rsquo;s&nbsp;Capital Markets Union (CMU).</p>
<div>
<p>FIA&rsquo;s paper &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="https://email.fia.org/c/12ga8PnG22BR4fmLfttIaQpPOWnd7y">Capital Markets Union at a critical juncture</a>&nbsp;&ndash; sets out the role that derivatives play in effective capital markets. Specifically, FIA believes that centrally cleared derivatives are a key ingredient to building a strong CMU.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>&ldquo;As the EU aims to increase investor interest in its markets, it has many options in designing a system that protects its citizens, ensures market liquidity and attracts investors. The ideas shared in this paper, on behalf of the cleared derivatives markets, will help lay the groundwork for fit-for-purpose regulation, open and resilient markets, fair competition and opportunities for innovation. "These adjustments will make EU capital markets more attractive to domestic and international investors and help to boost growth",&nbsp;said Walt Lukken, President and CEO of FIA.<br /><br />The recommendations in FIA&rsquo;s paper support the objectives aligned with delivering a successful CMU:&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Promoting an open, competitive, pragmatic, predictable, safe, well-regulated and fair marketplace for domestic and international financial institutions alike&nbsp;</li>
<li>Increasing transparency, public stakeholder engagement and certainty to ease the often complex and lengthy legislative process in the EU&nbsp;</li>
<li>Establishing a fit-for-purpose regulatory environment that benefits both regulated financial institutions and their customers&nbsp;</li>
<li>Facilitating client choice on where to clear and protecting the international competitiveness of EU market participants&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<div>
<div>
<p>FIA believes these objectives can be met largely through fine-tuning existing regulations, rather than overhauling them, and by international dialogue with peer regulators and global standard setters to avoid a patchwork of regulations that increases costs for all involved and disincentives investment. FIA has identified some specific steps that EU policymakers could undertake to help achieve these objectives, including:&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Establish clear definitions of scope in EU legislation (Level 1) and early clarifications on territorial and personal scope&nbsp;</li>
<li>Allow sufficient time for implementation of requirements before carrying out regulatory and legislative reviews and align compliance dates of Level 1 and Level 2 requirements&nbsp;</li>
<li>Conduct public engagement/consultation with industry and independent experts on important Level 3 rules before publishing them&nbsp;</li>
<li>Provide meaningful cost-benefit analysis before proposing new requirements and add a competitiveness test as part of important policy proposals&nbsp;</li>
<li>Optimise further CCP equivalence reviews and improve transparency&nbsp;</li>
<li>Establish appropriate capital requirements and reduce other restrictive measures to alleviate clearing capacity for intermediaries&nbsp;</li>
<li>Scrutinise the active account requirements under EMIR 3.0 that could, if not properly calibrated, adversely impact the competitiveness of EU firms&nbsp;</li>
<li>Ensure the IFR regime for investment firms is proportionate to the risks these firms bring to their counterparties, themselves and the market as a whole&nbsp;</li>
<li>Ensure globally consistent margin requirements to enable clearing margin transparency&nbsp;</li>
<li>Harmonise certain aspects of non-bank insolvency laws in the EU.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<div> revenue, securities finance industry, equity, global, lending
Summary:
Global securities finance industry revenue decreased, U.S. equity revenue declined, Taiwanese stocks increased, sovereign debt lending warmed, corporate debt cooled. Sirius XM Holdings Inc., Cassava Sciences Inc., Beyond Meat Inc., Tempus AI Inc., and Enbridge Inc. were the top earning securities. <br /><br /> <div>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The global securities finance industry generated $831 million in revenue for lenders in August 2024, according to DataLend, the market data service of fintech EquiLend. The figure represents a 12% decrease from the $945 million generated in August 2023.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Global broker-to-broker activity, where broker-dealers lend and borrow securities from each other, totaled an additional $221 million in revenue in August, down 8% year-over-year.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The equity trends observed in July largely held true for August with U.S. equity lending revenue declining 23% year-over-year. Average fees remained well below their 2023 levels with the U.S. posting a 28% dip in borrow cost from the same period last year. Declining fees have been indicative of fewer securities trading &ldquo;special&rdquo; as market indexes continue to rise. In August, revenue generated from specials was down 30% compared to August 2023.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Though equity revenues declined across global regions, Taiwanese stocks remained a bright spot in APAC, generating the second most revenue globally and a 44% increase year-over-year. In EMEA, the UK and France continued to perform well versus 2023, with revenue increases of 39% and 62% respectively.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Even with central bank rate cuts likely on the horizon in the U.S., sovereign debt lending continued to warm in August with a month-over-month average fee increase of 22% for U.S. treasuries. Lending revenue for U.S. government debt climbed 18% year-over-year.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Corporate debt continued to cool off with a 20% decline in global revenue year-over-year. The dip was largely driven by a 32% decline in U.S. investment-grade corporate lending revenue.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The top five earning securities in August were</span><span>&nbsp;Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (SIRI US), Cassava Sciences Inc. (SAVA US), Beyond Meat Inc. (BYND US),&nbsp;</span><span>Tempus AI Inc. (TEM US)</span><span>&nbsp;and Enbridge Inc. (ENB US)</span><span>. The five securities in total generated $109 million in revenue for the month.</span></p>

<title>LME Progresses Market Structure Evolution To Enhance Liquidity</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/lme-progresses-market-structure-evolution-to-enhance-liquidity/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/lme-progresses-market-structure-evolution-to-enhance-liquidity/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: LME, market structure, transparency, liquidity, block rules <br />
Summary: The LME is modernizing market structure to increase transparency and liquidity. It will introduce block rules and a liquidity provider program.<br /><br />Summary: LME will protect daily prompt dates, introduce block rules, and a liquidity provider program to enhance market transparency and liquidity. <div>
<ul>
<li>LME market structure modernised to boost transparency and increase price competition, for the benefit of all market participants</li>
<li>Protection of daily prompt date structure and Cash price, which are crucial for physical market trading</li>
<li>Introduction of industry-standard block rules with liquidity provider programme to support on-screen liquidity</li>
<li>Crossing rules and increased market data transparency for inter-office trades</li>
<li>Corresponding rules for OTC lookalike trades to ensure level playing field with on-exchange market</li>
</ul>
<p>The London Metal Exchange (LME) has today issued a white paper setting out a package of measures designed to modernise the LME&rsquo;s market structure, boost transparency and increase price competition, while protecting the unique features of its market that serve the physical metal communities.</p>
<p>Matthew Chamberlain, LME CEO, commented: &ldquo;The package of liquidity-enhancing measures we&rsquo;re announcing today marks the next phase of our market structure evolution and is vital for the long-term health and development of LME markets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our daily date system is one of our greatest assets, helping to ensure that our global reference prices are underpinned by real world supply and demand. These future-focused measures &ndash; which align with the global regulatory direction of travel &ndash; seek to grow participation in our markets, and make our prices as representative and accessible as possible, while continuing to support physical market trading practices.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Key measures</b></p>
<p>To increase accessible liquidity on the LME&rsquo;s electronic market (LMEselect) &ndash; particularly on the monthly dates, where many market participants wish to have exposure &ndash; the LME will introduce industry-standard block limit rules. This means that small-sized trades involving liquid dates (each monthly date out to one year) and for the most liquid metals (aluminium, copper, zinc, nickel and lead) will have to be executed on-screen. Crucially, to ensure that key physical market trading practices remain unaffected by the new rules, the block thresholds will not apply to daily prompt dates, so member provision of bespoke averaging for physical clients will not be impacted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These rules also support members in continuing to agree small trades bilaterally with their clients, provided that liquidity is shown on LMEselect for visibility.</p>
<p>Jamie Turner, LME Head of Trading and COO, commented: &ldquo;Introducing block rules is about increasing price transparency, which will lead to greater price competition and participation. This change will allow traders to maximise access to liquidity in the central venue, either directly or through a member desk or platform. While block rules are standard in most peer markets, we recognise that this will have an impact on members&rsquo; business models, and we are committed to working closely with them in a series of working groups over the next 12 months to navigate the implementation details.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To support the implementation of block rules, the LME will also introduce a liquidity provider programme to encourage on-screen trading in certain liquid instruments at the front end of the curve. Additionally, to further increase transparency, the LME will ensure that all trades (in the liquid dates) agreed in the interoffice market &ndash; regardless of their size &ndash; are booked into LME systems and published on external market data feeds.</p>
<p>On 19 August, the LME made its new trading platform available in the production environment for member testing, as one of the key steps prior to launch. This system, LMEselect v10, provides a deterministic and low latency system that offers improved functionality for electronic traders, such as the ability to enter &ldquo;good-till-cancelled&rdquo; (GTC) or &ldquo;persistent&rdquo; order types. Additional functionality will also be rolled out to further support this package of measures, such as recalibrated tick sizes to encourage positive trading behaviours from systematic traders.</p>
<p>To ensure a level playing field and consistent transparency between exchange-traded and OTC markets, the LME intends to apply similar block rule requirements to OTC contracts that reference LME prices and closely align to monthly exchange contracts (or the spreads between these). This will mitigate the risk of volume being incentivised away from the transparent central liquidity pool.</p>
<p>The measures announced in the white paper will be formally consulted on where appropriate over the next 12 months, with the aim of implementing the package of measures in the second half of 2025.</p>
<p><b>Background</b></p>

<br />
Operational resilience is a critical priority for financial firms due to tightening regulations worldwide, requiring extensive system reviews and compliance preparations.
<br /><br />Summary: 
Global regulations prioritize operational resilience, necessitating extensive compliance preparations, including system reviews and cybersecurity focus, with potential enforcement actions for noncompliance. <div>
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="http://www.broadridge.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.</a>&nbsp;(NYSE: BR), a global Fintech leader, released a new whitepaper focused on the imperative need for financial services firms to enhance their operational resilience in reaction to the European Union&rsquo;s Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) and other global regulations. This comprehensive whitepaper, titled&nbsp;<i>'Building Resilience Across Borders: A holistic approach to global operational resilience and navigating the regulatory maze</i>,' highlights the extensive regulatory expectations and the strategic preparations necessary for compliance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now more than ever, operational resiliency is a critical priority for financial firms around the world, driven by a fundamental need to strengthen trust and security in response to the growing risk of cyberattacks and disruptions,&rdquo; said Mike Sleightholme, President of Broadridge International. &ldquo;The broad and in-depth scope of DORA mandates a significant transformation in risk management frameworks, policies and governance structures relating to both inhouse and third-party systems, posing urgent challenges that the industry needs to address ahead of the January 17, 2025 deadline.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Regulators are emphasizing and prioritizing operational resilience, yet there is a growing sense that many firms remain far from ready, exposing themselves not only to operational resiliency risk but also to regulatory compliance risk,&rdquo; said Virginie O&rsquo;Shea, Founder of Firebrand Research, who worked with Broadridge to develop the whitepaper. &ldquo;Firms must act now to mobilize their DORA action plans, including a detailed assessment of their critical systems and services, and an impact analysis to ensure they can deliver a compliant operating model and meet recovery and reporting objectives aligned to DORA&rsquo;s requirements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Key findings from the whitepaper include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Worldwide regulatory priority</b>: Besides the EU, regions such as the US, Canada, the UK, South Africa, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia are also tightening their operational resilience regulations.</li>
<li><b>Global scope and impact of DORA</b>&nbsp;mandates significant changes to operational risk management and resilience across nearly all areas of financial services, impacting firms operating in the EU irrespective of where their headquarters and third-party suppliers are located.</li>
<li><b>Clock is ticking</b>, firms must begin their DORA compliance preparations now, as the January 2025 enforcement date necessitates extensive system reviews and data reporting readiness. Firms must focus resources on mobilising their action plan, potentially leveraging mutualized shared services.</li>
<li><b>Watch out for regulatory enforcement</b>, noncompliance with operational resilience mandates is likely to result in stringent enforcement actions. Firms need to start prioritizing cybersecurity and risk reduction today.</li>
<li><b>Increased regulatory focus on third-party service providers</b>&nbsp;and internal IT systems highlights the need for thorough operational reviews and compliance assurance.</li>

<div> encourages, account providers, vulnerable consumers, financial inclusion, access
<br />
The FCA report urges account providers to support those without bank accounts, increase awareness of basic accounts, and review account denials and closures.
<br /><br />Summary: The FCA encourages account providers to support vulnerable consumers, increase awareness of basic accounts, and review account denials and closures. <div>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>In a new report, the FCA encourages account providers to do more to support those who want a bank account but don&rsquo;t have one.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p><span>The FCA has recognised that banks, building societies and payment firms are trying to support customers to access accounts and is encouraging them to build on examples of existing good practice, such as working with homeless charities to tailor their support to the needs of customers in vulnerable circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span>Banks and other account providers have been urged to increase awareness of basic bank accounts, which allow people to make and receive payments but without the availability of an overdraft. The FCA found that several providers could make it easier to apply for one.</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA has asked account providers to review their overall approach to account denials and closures &ndash; and particularly to ensure that vulnerable consumers aren&rsquo;t losing out. Providers should also ensure people aren&rsquo;t denied access just because they can&rsquo;t produce standard forms of ID, and make it clear which alternative forms of ID are acceptable.</span></p>
<p><span>Where accounts are closed or denied, the regulator has reminded providers that they should act in line with their obligations under the Consumer Duty, including communicating in a way that is clear and helpful for customers.</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA has also published independent, qualitative research on the experiences of some of the most financially excluded consumers when accessing and using financial products and services. This will help industry and consumer groups understand how the right support can help these consumers effectively access services.</span></p>
<p><span>Sheldon Mills, Executive Director of Consumers and Competition at the FCA, said:</span></p>
<p><span>'We&rsquo;ve seen examples of really good practice &ndash; with account providers helping people access a product vital for financial inclusion &ndash; but also areas where there is room for improvement. By sharing both, we want to achieve more consistent outcomes, with people being aware of what accounts there are that might be right for them, more support for the vulnerable and people not being denied access without good reason.'</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA&rsquo;s report also highlighted issues other organisations have experienced accessing accounts &ndash; including pawnbrokers, charities and in the adult entertainment sector. It has set out an expectation that firms should have a clear, properly considered definition of reputational risk. However, it has a limited remit to act for business and charity customers.</span></p>
<p><span>In 2023, the FCA said that it had not found evidence of accounts being closed due to lawfully expressed political opinions. The new report confirms it has not found any further evidence to suggest that this is happening. However, it has asked senior leaders in firms to sign an attestation taking personal responsibility for ensuring rules have been complied with and that they are confident of their compliance going forward.&nbsp;</span></p>

<div> enforcement, regulation, guidance, financial services, consumer resilience <br />
Summary:<br />Effective regulation and enforcement, guidance for financial services, ensuring consumer resilience, supporting market growth, and fairness in financial services. <div>
<p>Tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou katoa</p>
<p>Ko Samantha Barrass toku ingoa</p>
<p>Ko taku mahi ki Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko</p>
<p>Ko te Mana Whakahaere</p>
<p>Tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā tātou katoa.</p>
<p>Many thanks for inviting me to speak to you today. The relationship between the FMA and the FSC has been very strong over many years, and ensuring this continues is vital for me, the FMA Board and my leadership team.</p>
<p>This year's conference theme is "consumer resilience and prosperity". Maintaining resilience through these times while also taking long-term decisions to secure future prosperity is essential to the financial wellbeing of all New Zealanders.</p>
<p>Consumer Resilience and Prosperity is an important theme for the FMA, and for me. That is because, once responsibility for the CCCFA is transferred to us, we will have a role in overseeing the financial products that touch most New Zealanders&rsquo; lives.</p>
<p>Whether it is securing a loan for a car, getting professional financial advice, buying your first home and insuring it, insuring yourself and your livelihood, or saving and investing for your retirement and other financial goals, the FMA will have a key role in making sure New Zealanders have trust and confidence in the financial services sector.</p>
<h3>Regulatory burden</h3>
<p>During this period of regulatory change, it&rsquo;s important the FMA&rsquo;s regulatory approach is clear and understood.</p>
<p>I want to take a moment to step back and explain my personal philosophy of regulation, which is such a great match with the FMA.</p>
<p>This year marks the fortieth anniversary of the fourth Labour Government and a period of significant economic and regulatory reform. Growing up in the 80s in Christchurch, for me, regulation was deeply discredited. I associated it with driving an over-controlled economy including poor services (such as 3 months to get a phone line), and unrealistic controls on prices - the NZ Dollar, rents and interest rates, to name a few. An idealistic economics student, and huge supporter of the role of markets to drive growth and prosperity, I was sceptical about regulation and felt we always needed to be clear that regulation was a necessary intervention to support growth and the long-term prospects of New Zealanders.</p>
<p>It became so much of a driving passion for me that, forty years later, I&rsquo;m here talking to you as the Chief Executive of a regulator. Not many people grow up wanting to be a regulator, but there you go.</p>
<p>The FMA and I are incredibly focused on regulation that genuinely matters and delivers for New Zealanders. The underlying philosophy remains &ndash; we cannot simply regulate for the sake of regulating. Regulation needs to pass the &lsquo;so what&rsquo; test, as well as enabling innovation. By keeping an eye on unnecessary regulatory burden, we can ensure our regulatory approach is achieving the outcomes we, and New Zealanders, expect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s why, for example, we have provided the Government with a list of proposals where both our time, and yours, can be used more valuably - while still ensuring consumers and investors are protected. We have also valued you proactively highlighting to us further changes that the FMA and the Minister should consider.</p>
<p>We are further demonstrating this as we consider a class exemption for green, social, sustainability and sustainability-linked bonds, which offer investors an additional non-financial benefit. The sector has told us that there should be a more efficient route to market for these bonds.</p>
<p>This has the potential to avoid unnecessary compliance costs, as well as incentivise the development of this market.&nbsp; When we hear fair arguments like these, we are prepared to reflect on them and consider changes accordingly.</p>
<h3>Guidance</h3>
<p>Guidance from the FMA can be an efficient approach to supporting the sector meet regulatory expectations as the New Zealand financial sector continues to grow and develop. Our liquidity risk management guidance released this year aims to ensure fund managers have adequate systems, controls and tools in place to manage liquidity, against the full range of assets and business models. It is frustrating to hear this guidance being used as a justification for why firms aren&rsquo;t investing in private or less liquid assets. Having appropriate systems and controls to manage liquidity, enables investment in these types of assets. It means the frameworks and tools are in place to identify and manage the risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Guidance raises awareness, promotes discussion and endeavours to lift standards across a sector. We do not expect firms to simply leave this guidance to their legal and compliance departments. The audience for this guidance, and in fact any guidance we publish, should be senior leaders within your organisations, so they can take a strategic view of what is needed. We are not looking for tick box compliance to our guidance. Our guidance is just that, a guide to help inform how you work. We look forward to continuing our discussion on the guidance with the sector in the months ahead, including at an FSC hosted event next month.</p>
<p>With so much focus on unnecessary regulatory burden, I do want to emphasise that the important point here is on the word &lsquo;unnecessary&rsquo;. We cannot and must not forget the crystalised harm or risk of harm, un-prevented by market forces, that created the need for regulation in the first place. The finance company collapses, and the risks and harm exposed, unmitigated by market forces, created a powerful argument for regulation to support Mum and Dad investors and quality capital markets in New Zealand. The FMA was created out of those ashes, the outcomes sought through the FMCA remain current. We are determined to champion them.</p>
<p>But does it mean that we should always be alive to how we can deliver those outcomes better? Absolutely, and that is why we are leaning into taking an outcomes-focused approach to our work.</p>
<h3>Outcomes focused approach</h3>
<p>We want to ensure the FMA&rsquo;s focus is not just on compliance but on what we are trying to achieve. That is the ultimate way in which we will deliver well focused regulation, keep costs down and make sure we are not unnecessarily cutting across innovation.</p>
<p>The industry response to our consultation on outcomes focused regulation shows we need to take our time to step back, take stock, and pause to consider the right way forward. One of the things the FSC told us in its feedback was that they were worried we were introducing new rules. To be clear, we are not setting out new rules. It is about the FMA, ensuring we remain an effective modern, forward-looking regulator and communicating what we believe that looks like.</p>
<p>We will have more to say in due course, but I hope the philosophy of regulation I set out at the beginning, which is front and centre of my leadership at the FMA, gives you a flavour of how we intend to approach our role.</p>
<h3>Recent enforcement action</h3>
<p>No doubt you will have seen in the news some of the recent enforcement action we have taken. That reflects months, often years of work from our teams, and I want to acknowledge their mahi.</p>
<p>Enforcement is a bottom line for any regulator. It is the bare minimum any regulator needs to do to ensure credibility and create a credible deterrent that encourages compliance. But enforcement is sometimes rightly characterised as the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff. Something has to have gone wrong or be at a real risk of going wrong! Ideally, the bulk of regulatory activity is focused on making sure harm is prevented.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s in our supervision work that we mainly want to be experienced. Sometimes with pointy elbows, but mainly collaboratively, educative and engaged.</p>
<p>As we strive to be the best engagement-led regulator we can be, we know that building strong relationships with firms early can often mean the harm to consumers and investors is prevented in the first place.</p>
<p>Strong regulator-firm relationships benefit all New Zealanders. As we and the industry have acknowledged in the past, this requires the FMA to be properly resourced. Our view remains the same as it has in recent years; that an engagement led approach from a regulator, that can retain good staff and institutional knowledge, offers the right regulation for New Zealand. It delivers a meaningful, proactive supervision approach, supporting firms and customers alike.</p>
<h3>Financial services reforms</h3>
<p>I know you will all be eagerly awaiting ministerial decisions on the financial services reform consultation from earlier in the year.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m sure the Minister will have more to say on this when he speaks to you this evening, I do want to give you a sense of where we are from a practical perspective. The Commerce Commission and the FMA are working very closely on the transfer of credit functions, with several joint activities underway. As part of this, you will also start to see the FMA in some of the Commission&rsquo;s stakeholder engagement activities. Both regulators are very committed to a seamless transfer of responsibilities and await legislation to be passed by Parliament to give effect to this. Until then, the Commerce Commission is still the regulator of the CCCFA, and lenders should continue to engage with the Commission as normal.</p>
<p>Turning to the new CoFI regime, we have been and are continuing to engage with firms ahead of the end of the licensing window in March next year. Firms should now have either made their licence application or be in the final stages of seeking their Board approvals prior to submitting their application. We know which firms are potentially behind where they want to be and have reached out to offer assistance and support as needed. This is the approach the FMA has taken over several years, through the introduction of several different regimes. We know it is one that you and your peers support.</p>
<p>Minister Bayly has signalled a priority of his is to streamline capital market settings to allow businesses greater access to capital to support productivity and growth. We are committed to working with the Minister, MBIE and industry to explore how we might better support these markets to develop.&nbsp; A key focus for the Minister is facilitating investment in private assets. A first step is industry engagement, and several roundtables took place last week. As work on this ministerial priority continues, I want to thank those who have provided support already on the shape of this work programme.</p>
<h3>Regulation as an enabler of markets, not a barrier</h3>
<p>As a regulator, we know we have a role ensuring markets work well for consumers and investors, while also enabling economic growth. There is a natural tension between encouraging competition, financial stability and ensuring consumers are sold products that deliver value and do what they say on the tin. This tension is why the Council of Financial Regulators exists, and why it&rsquo;s work is so important.</p>
<p>The FMA will be looking to do what it can in the months ahead to respond to the Commerce Commission&rsquo;s report, particularly around the recommendation on transparency in mortgage advice. The Minister and the Commerce Commission have clearly expressed concerns about practices in this space. We will be looking to work with financial advice providers and firms across the mortgage spectrum to consider how to tackle this issue. As the CoFI regime settles in from early next year, there will also be opportunities for us to use our supervisory engagement with banks to look at the issues raised in the market study from this angle.</p>
<h3>Concluding remarks&nbsp;</h3>
<p>As I turn back to this year&rsquo;s conference theme, a financial sector that is grounded in fairness is essential to consumer resilience. At the FMA, fairness isn&rsquo;t just a word to us. It&rsquo;s central to why we exist. That&rsquo;s why two months ago we released a research paper where we sought to understand what New Zealanders perceived as fair and unfair in the financial services they use.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the research found that the majority of New Zealanders generally agree on what constitutes fairness in financial services.</p>
<p>In one scenario, 86 percent of respondents believed it was unfair that a bank took over a year to repay a client who had been overcharged fees. At the other end of the spectrum, 62 percent believed it was fair that one client&rsquo;s investment fund had lower fees than his mother&rsquo;s because his fund manager spent less time researching markets and making changes to his investment. The release of the research has also seen the FMA hold roundtables with firms to discuss our findings. This is the first time we&rsquo;ve adopted a roundtable approach to discussing findings, and it won&rsquo;t be the last. We are looking at new, broader ways of engaging with the market to ensure we meet our aims as an &lsquo;engagement led&rsquo; regulator.</p>
<p>As the conduct regulator for New Zealand&rsquo;s financial markets, our vision is more New Zealanders than ever believing that the financial services sector is working well for them.

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority Cancels Integrity Advisers Insurance Limited’s Financial Advice Provider Licence</title>

<div> cancelled, Integrity Advisers Insurance Limited, misconduct, FAP licence, clients<br />
Summary: The FMA cancelled Integrity's FAP licence due to serious misconduct, including pressuring clients to retain insurance policies and making false threats. Clients can seek help through Financial Ombudsman service. <br /> <div>
<p>The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; has cancelled Integrity Advisers Insurance Limited&rsquo;s (Integrity) Financial Advice Provider (FAP) licence for engaging in serious misconduct.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Integrity is a Christchurch-based financial service provider that held a full FAP licence, providing financial advice to approximately 500 retail customers, many of whom are from the Filipino community. Integrity&rsquo;s sole director and shareholder is Mr Yuriy Bazhak who was a financial adviser at Integrity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following an investigation, the FMA found that Integrity breached its market services licensee obligations by failing to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>give priority to client&rsquo;s interests&nbsp;</li>
<li>comply with the Code of Professional Conduct for Financial Advice Services&nbsp;</li>
<li>treat customers fairly&nbsp;</li>
<li>act with integrity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The breaches relate to Integrity&rsquo;s treatment of clients who wanted to cancel their respective insurance policy between September 2022 and June 2023 (affected clients).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If affected clients cancelled their insurance policies, Integrity had to surrender the commission (also known as a clawback charge) it received to the relevant insurance provider. While Integrity did disclose the potential recovery of fees to clients at the start of the engagement, the FMA found Integrity unfairly pressured affected clients to retain their respective policy by issuing them with an invoice which gave them only seven days to reinstate their insurance policy or pay a fee. The fee Integrity charged affected clients was greater than was permitted by Integrity&rsquo;s fees policy, and in some cases equal to the commission Integrity lost.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Integrity told some affected clients that failure to pay the fee would result in Integrity reporting them to Immigration New Zealand, which Integrity said may result in an affected client&rsquo;s visa being cancelled or deportation. Integrity did not make any report to Immigration New Zealand but seriously misled an affected client when it told him that it had made a report. The FMA found that Integrity also tried to mislead the FMA by altering an invoice before providing it to the FMA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Integrity denied significant misconduct. It said invoicing errors were inadvertent or not material, and it denied misleading clients or the FMA.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA is satisfied that Integrity would be likely to breach its market services licensee obligations in the future. The FMA is also satisfied that Integrity&rsquo;s director, Mr Bazhak is no longer a fit and proper person to hold a position as a director or senior manager of a financial advice provider.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FMA Director of Specialist Supervision and Response, Peter Taylor, said: &ldquo;Contrary to its name, this firm lacked any integrity with its clients. Mr Bazhak not only risked causing serious harm to his clients but preyed on their vulnerability through the threat of involving Immigration New Zealand. Actions such as these undermine both the integrity and reputation of the financial advice profession.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cancelling Integrity&rsquo;s licence is one of the strongest tools the FMA can use against a FAP and sends a clear message that this sort of conduct is not acceptable.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Provisions have been made for the care of Integrity&rsquo;s clients, who will be contacted by their new licenced financial advice provider or their insurer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Where clients can get help&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Integrity&rsquo;s clients can complain to Financial Services Complaints Limited&rsquo;s Financial Ombudsman service, which is a disputes resolution service free to consumers. For clients who believe they have been affected and have concerns, we recommend they contact:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial Services Complaints Limited,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fscl.org.nz/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="link to Financial Services Complaints Limited">fscl.org.nz</a>, or&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>their insurer or new adviser to discuss whether to complain to Financial Services Complaints Limited.&nbsp;</li>

<title>SEC Charges Six Credit Rating Agencies With Significant Recordkeeping Failures - Firms Admit To Wrongdoing And Agree To Pay Penalties Totaling More Than $49 Million To Settle SEC Charges</title>

<div> SEC, charges, credit rating agencies, recordkeeping provisions, civil penalties
<br />
The SEC charged six credit rating agencies for failing to maintain and preserve electronic communications, leading to civil penalties and requirements for compliance improvements.
<br /><br />Summary: 
The SEC charged six credit rating agencies for recordkeeping violations, leading to civil penalties and requirements for compliance improvements. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against six nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, or NRSROs, for significant failures by the firms and their personnel to maintain and preserve electronic communications. The firms admitted the facts set forth in their respective SEC orders; acknowledged that their conduct violated recordkeeping provisions of the federal securities laws; agreed to pay combined civil penalties of more than $49 million, as detailed below; and have begun implementing improvements to their compliance policies and procedures to address these violations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Moody&rsquo;s Investors Service, Inc. agreed to pay a $20 million civil penalty;</li>
<li>S&amp;P Global Ratings agreed to pay a $20 million civil penalty;</li>
<li>Fitch Ratings, Inc. agreed to pay an $8 million civil penalty;</li>
<li>HR Ratings de M&eacute;xico, S.A. de C.V. agreed to pay a $250,000 civil penalty;</li>
<li>A.M. Best Rating Services, Inc. agreed to pay a $1 million civil penalty; and</li>
<li>Demotech, Inc. agreed to pay a $100,000 civil penalty.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the credit rating agencies, with the exception of A.M. Best and Demotech, is also required to retain a compliance consultant. A.M. Best and Demotech engaged in significant efforts to comply with the recordkeeping requirements relatively early as registered credit rating agencies and otherwise cooperated with the SEC&rsquo;s investigations, and, as a result, they will not be required to retain a compliance consultant under the terms of their settlements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have seen repeatedly that failures to maintain and preserve required records can hinder the staff&rsquo;s ability to ensure that firms are complying with their obligations and the Commission&rsquo;s ability to hold accountable those that fall short of those obligations, often at the expense of investors,&rdquo; said Sanjay Wadhwa, Deputy Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;In today&rsquo;s actions, the Commission once again makes clear that there are tangible benefits to firms that make significant efforts to comply and otherwise cooperate with the staff&rsquo;s investigations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each of the six firms was charged with violating Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17g-2(b)(7) thereunder. In addition to significant financial penalties, each credit rating agency was ordered to cease and desist from future violations of these provisions and was censured. The four firms ordered to retain compliance consultants have agreed to, among other things, conduct comprehensive reviews of their policies and procedures relating to the retention of electronic communications found on their personnel&rsquo;s personal devices and their respective frameworks for addressing non-compliance by their personnel with those policies and procedures.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigations into Moody&rsquo;s Investors Service, Inc., S&amp;P Global Ratings, A.M. Best Rating Services, Inc., HR Ratings de M&eacute;xico, S.A. de C.V., and Demotech, Inc. were conducted by Wesley W. Wintermyer and Michael S. DiBattista and were supervised by Judith Weinstock and Sheldon L. Pollock, all of the New York Regional Office. The SEC&rsquo;s investigation into Fitch Ratings, Inc. was conducted by Joseph P. Ceglio and Mr. Wintermyer and was supervised by Ms. Weinstock, Joshua I. Brodsky, Osman E. Nawaz, and Mr. Pollock, all of the New York Regional Office.<span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span>SEC staff from the Office of Credit Ratings assisted with the investigation.</p>

<title>Federal Court Orders Oregon Man To Pay Over $209 Million In Monetary Sanctions For Commodity Pool Ponzi Schemes - CFTC Also Recovers $18 Million Stolen From Court-Appointed Receiver</title>

<div> fraud, Ponzi scheme, CFTC, misappropriation, digital assets
Summary:<br />Judge orders $209 million judgment against Sam Ikkurty and Jafia, LLC for Ponzi scheme involving crypto and carbon investments. Millions in stolen digital assets recovered.<br />Summary: <div>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced Judge Mary Rowland of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered an order of final judgment against&nbsp;Sam Ikkurty&nbsp;of Oregon and&nbsp;Jafia, LLC, Ikkurty Capital, LLC d/b/a Rose City Income Fund I LP, Rose City Income Fund II,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Seneca Ventures, LLC&nbsp;imposing a judgment totaling $209,614,892.</p>
<p>This order follows Judge Rowland&rsquo;s prior order granting summary judgment in favor of the CFTC on all counts of the CFTC&rsquo;s solicitation fraud and misappropriation complaint. [See CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8931-24">8931-24</a>] The CFTC also recovered more than $18 million in digital assets that had been stolen from the court-appointed receiver.</p>
<p>The court&rsquo;s order of final judgment and permanent injunction requires the defendants to pay&nbsp;$83,757,249&nbsp;in restitution to customers of the so-called income fund; $36,967,285 in disgorgement of unlawful gains (offset by any amounts paid in restitution); and a $110,901,855 civil monetary penalty. The order also orders Ikkurty to pay an outstanding $14,071,000 contempt fine, following the court&rsquo;s finding he unlawfully transferred digital assets from the Receivership Estate while this lawsuit was pending and violated a court order, as well as ordering Ikkurty to repay $884,788 in professional expenses advanced from the Receivership Estate to fund his defense. The order also permanently bans Ikkurty and Jafia from registering with the CFTC; trading any digital assets or other commodity interests; soliciting or accepting any funds for the purpose of purchasing digital assets or commodity interests; and engaging in conduct that violates the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The defendants portrayed their programs as cutting-edge crypto and carbon investments when in reality they were plain, old-fashioned Ponzi schemes,&rdquo; said Director of Enforcement Ian McGinley. &ldquo;CFTC staff not only shut down the defendants&rsquo; fraudulent schemes and obtained a money judgment of over $200 million, they also recovered more than $18 million in stolen digital assets that may otherwise have been lost forever. This is an outstanding result for the CFTC and for the victims of defendants&rsquo; fraud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Case Background</p>
<p>As described in the summary judgment order, the defendants&rsquo; fraudulent scheme centered on Ikkurty&rsquo;s misrepresentations to participants about the nature of his &ldquo;crypto hedge funds&rdquo; and the supposed &ldquo;net profits&rdquo; they would earn. In reality, Ikkurty did not return any net profits to participants, and instead &ldquo;ran something akin to a Ponzi scheme.&rdquo; Ikkurty also misstated his fund&rsquo;s historical performance and omitted the fact the fund fell in value by 98.99% in only a few months. The order also found Ikkurty invested in unstable digital asset commodities contrary to his promises to participants, and his purported crypto expertise was a sham because his actual experience with digital assets consisted solely of losing his personal Bitcoins to a hack. The court soundly rejected Ikkurty&rsquo;s claim that his misrepresentations about historical performance were inadvertent and his arguments that his false statements were not material.</p>
<p>Notably, in addition to the misrepresentations, the summary judgment order also found the defendants misappropriated funds through a carbon offset program, which the order described as &ldquo;a classic Ponzi scheme.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During this lawsuit, millions of dollars in digital assets recovered from Ikkurty and held by the court-appointed receiver to compensate victims were stolen in a hack. The court held Ikkurty, who had fled to India, in contempt for stealing and refusing to return these assets. However, the CFTC found the assets and on August 27 caused them to be returned to the receiver to give to victims in accordance with the court&rsquo;s order. The recovered assets are currently valued at approximately $18 million.</p>
<p>The CFTC cautions that orders requiring repayment of funds to victims may not always result in the recovery of lost money because the wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets.</p>
<p>* * * * * * *</p>
<p>The CFTC thanks the Federal Bureau of Investigation for its assistance in this matter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this matter are Candy Haan, Heather Dasso, Doug Snodgrass, Joseph Patrick, Elizabeth Streit, Scott Williamson, and Robert Howell, and former staff member David Terrell.</p>
<p>* * * * * * *</p>
<p>Fraud Advisory</p>
<p>The CFTC has issued several customer protection&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/learnandprotect/learningresources">fraud advisories and articles</a>,&nbsp;including the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/fraudadv_commoditypool.html">Commodity Pool Fraud Advisory</a>, which provides information about a type of fraud involving individuals and firms&mdash;often unregistered&mdash;offering investments in commodity pools and how customers can detect, avoid, and report these scams.</p>
<p>The CFTC also strongly urges the public to verify a company&rsquo;s registration with the CFTC before committing funds. If unregistered, a customer should be wary of providing funds to that company. A company&rsquo;s registration status can be found using&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nfa.futures.org/basicnet">NFA BASIC</a>.</p>
<p>Customers and other individuals can report suspicious activities or information, such as possible violations of commodity trading laws, to the Division of Enforcement via a toll-free hotline 866-FON-CFTC (866-366-2382),&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cftc.gov/ConsumerProtection/FileaTiporComplaint/index.htm">file a tip or complaint</a>&nbsp;online, or contact the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.whistleblower.gov/">Whistleblower Office</a>. Whistleblowers may be eligible to receive between 10 and 30 percent of the monetary sanctions collected, paid from the Customer Protection Fund which is financed through monetary sanctions paid to the CFTC by violators of the CEA.</p>

<div> Settled charges, ClearPath Capital Partners, SEC, liability disclaimers, private funds <br />
ClearPath Capital Partners settled charges with SEC for safekeeping non-compliance and impermissible liability disclaimers in advisory and private fund agreements. $65,000 penalty. <br />
Summary: <br />
- Settled charges with SEC
- Safekeeping non-compliance
- Impermissible liability disclaimers
- Advisory and private fund agreements
- $65,000 penalty <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against ClearPath Capital Partners LLC for failing to comply with requirements related to the safekeeping of client assets and for its use of impermissible liability disclaimers in its advisory and private fund agreements.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, ClearPath failed to timely distribute annual audited financial statements to investors in certain private funds that it advised. In addition, in its advisory agreements and certain private fund partnership and operating agreements, ClearPath included liability disclaimers, commonly referred to as hedge clauses, that could lead a client to incorrectly believe that the client had waived non-waivable causes of action against the adviser. Certain of the liability disclaimers also contained misleading statements regarding ClearPath&rsquo;s otherwise unwaivable fiduciary duty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The SEC remains focused on the custody rule, which is vital to investor protection,&rdquo; said Andrew Dean, Co-Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division&rsquo;s Asset Management Unit. &ldquo;In addition, all advisers, including private fund advisers, should be mindful about including hedge clauses in agreements. Even for private fund advisers, in certain circumstances, such clauses could be misleading.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC's order finds that ClearPath violated sections 206(2) and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rules 206(4)-2 and 206(4)-7 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, ClearPath agreed to a censure, to cease and desist from further violations of the charged provisions, and to pay a $65,000 civil penalty.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Steven Varholik of the Asset Management Unit in the San Francisco Regional Office, with assistance from Carol Lee, Kathleen Purcell, Thu Ta, and Bradley Cline of the Division of Examinations. The investigation was supervised by Jeremy Pendrey, Mr. Dean, and Corey Schuster.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Creative Legal Fundings CEO Maria Dickerson With Operating Multimillion Dollar Ponzi Scheme That Targeted Filipino-American Community</title>

<div> charged, fraudulent, securities, investors, lawsuit <br />
Summary: The SEC charged Maria Dulce Pino Dickerson and her companies with defrauding investors of $7 million through a fraudulent securities offering targeting the Filipino-American community. <br /> <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Maria Dulce Pino Dickerson and her companies Creative Legal Fundings in CA and The Ubiquity Group LLC with raising approximately $7 million from more than 130 investors through a fraudulent securities offering targeting members of the Filipino-American community across the United States.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, from approximately March 2021 through May 2023, Sacramento, California resident Dickerson convinced investors to acquire interests in Creative Legal Fundings by falsely claiming that she would use their investments to make loans to personal injury attorneys to fund their lawsuits. In exchange, Dickerson allegedly claimed, Creative Legal Fundings would receive a portion of any eventual settlements or recoveries. According to the complaint, Dickerson promised investors guaranteed high returns of 10 to 17.5 percent per month. In reality, the complaint alleges, Creative Legal Fundings did not make any loans, conduct any other business, or generate any returns. Instead, Dickerson allegedly spent at least $2.5 million in investor funds on personal real estate, gambling, travel and designer goods purchases. The complaint also alleges that Dickerson made Ponzi-like payments to earlier investors using funds from new investors in an attempt to keep the scheme going. The complaint further alleges that, after Dickerson ran out of money to pay Creative Legal Fundings&rsquo; investors in around May 2023, she shuttered that company, opened The Ubiquity Group, and tried to raise additional funds using similar misrepresentations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As alleged, Creative Legal Fundings' operations were neither creative, nor legal. This was nothing more than fraud perpetrated against retail investors, many of whom were members of the Filipino-American community,&rdquo; said Monique C. Winkler, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s San Francisco Regional Office.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California, charges Dickerson, Creative Legal Fundings, and The Ubiquity Group with violating the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, including conduct-based injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The SEC also seeks an officer-and-director bar against Dickerson.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was part of the San Francisco Regional Office and Los Angeles Regional Office&rsquo;s task force focused on affinity frauds, the Western Alliance to Protect Targeted Communities. The SEC&rsquo;s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-alerts/investor-alert-have-something-common-someone-selling-investment-it-may-make-you-target-fraud">Investor Alert</a>&nbsp;with tips on how investors can identify and avoid affinity frauds.</p>
<p>In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Eastern District of California today announced criminal charges against Dickerson.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Duncan C. Simpson LaGoy and Michael Foley and supervised by David Zhou and Jason H. Lee of the San Francisco Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Robin Andrews and Mr. Simpson LaGoy.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Crypto-Focused Advisory Firm Galois Capital For Custody Failures - Firm Also Misled Investors About Its Redemption Practices</title>

<div> charges, Galois Capital Management, crypto assets, Investment Advisers Act, civil penalty
Summary:
SEC charges Galois Capital Management for violating custody rule and misleading investors. Ordered to pay $225,000 civil penalty. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against Florida-based Galois Capital Management LLC, a former registered investment adviser for a private fund that primarily invested in crypto assets, for failing to comply with requirements related to the safeguarding of client assets, including crypto assets being offered and sold as securities. The Commission also found that Galois misled fund investors about the notice period required for redemptions. To settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges, Galois agreed to pay a civil penalty of $225,000, which will be distributed to its fund&rsquo;s harmed investors.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order found that, beginning in July 2022, Galois Capital failed to ensure that certain crypto assets held by the private fund that it advised were maintained with a qualified custodian, a violation of the Investment Advisers Act&rsquo;s Custody Rule. According to the order, Galois Capital held certain crypto assets in online trading accounts on crypto asset trading platforms, including FTX Trading Ltd., that were not qualified custodians. Approximately half of the fund&rsquo;s assets under management from early to mid-November 2022 were lost in connection with the collapse of FTX. The SEC&rsquo;s order also found that Galois Capital misled certain investors by representing to them that redemptions required at least five business days&rsquo; notice before month end while allowing other investors to redeem with fewer days&rsquo; notice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By failing to comply with Custody Rule provisions, Galois Capital exposed investors to risks that fund assets, including crypto assets, could be lost, misused, or misappropriated,&rdquo; said Corey Schuster, Co-Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division&rsquo;s Asset Management Unit. &ldquo;We will continue to hold accountable advisers who violate their core investor protection obligations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order found that Galois Capital violated the Investment Advisers Act. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, Galois Capital consented to the entry of an order requiring it to cease and desist from further violations of the Advisers Act, censuring it, and imposing the civil penalty discussed above.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Annie Hancock and Rory Alex and supervised by Colin Forbes, Brent Wilner, Mr. Schuster, and Andrew Dean, all of the Division of Enforcement's Asset Management Unit. The team was assisted by Kelly Kibbie, Neil Lombardo, and Janet Grossnickle of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Investment Management.</p>

<div> survey, farm income, farmland values, financial conditions, commodity prices
<br />
The August farm survey showed decreased farm income expectations, lower farmland values, and weakened financial conditions, leading to decreased investment optimism and concern over commodity prices.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The August&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4243260-1&amp;h=1915940469&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fageconomybarometer%2F&amp;a=Purdue+University%2FCME+Group+Ag+Economy+Barometer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="xn-org">Purdue University</span>/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer</a>&nbsp;dropped 13 points from July to a reading of 100, echoing levels seen from fall 2015 to winter 2016 during the early stages of a significant downturn in the U.S. farm economy. The Index of Current Conditions also dropped 17 points to 83, while the Index of Future Expectations decreased by 11 points to 108. Weakening farm income prospects weighed on farmers' sentiment as the outlook for a bountiful fall harvest was more than offset by declining crop prices. This month's survey was conducted from&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">Aug. 12-16, 2024</span>.</p>
<p>"Weakness in the barometer and related indices provide a signal that farmers are concerned about the possibility of extended weakness in farm incomes, similar to what took place from 2015 to 2019,"&nbsp;said&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4243260-1&amp;h=2802801166&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fageconomybarometer%2Fteam%2Fjim-mintert%2F&amp;a=James+Mintert" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="xn-person">James Mintert</span></a>, the barometer's principal investigator and director of&nbsp;<span class="xn-org">Purdue University's</span>&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4243260-1&amp;h=3861785331&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fhome%2F&amp;a=Center+for+Commercial+Agriculture" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Center for Commercial Agriculture</a>.</p>
<p>August's survey results indicate a shift among farmers' primary concerns, with 30% of respondents identifying lower commodity prices as their primary concern, compared to 33% who cited high input costs. Last year at this time only 20% pointed to weak commodity prices as a top concern.</p>
<p>However, concerns about rising interest rates have lessened, with only 17% of farmers mentioning this issue, down from 24% last year. Looking ahead, 68% of respondents expect interest rates to decrease in the coming year, while just 19% anticipate an increase.</p>
<p>The Farm Financial Performance Index dropped 9 points from July's survey and 14 points from a year ago, reaching its lowest level since&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">July 2020</span>, when there was widespread uncertainty from COVID-related lockdowns. The decline in financial performance reflects ongoing concerns about weak financial conditions. In turn, weakening financial conditions led many farmers to say that now is not a good time to invest, resulting in the Farm Capital Investment Index falling 7 points to 31, matching its all-time low.</p>
<p>"Farmers have also become less optimistic about farmland values this summer than in recent years," said Mintert. "The percentage of farmers who think farmland values could decline within the upcoming year has been rising, which is consistent with the weak outlook for financial conditions. The weak capital investment index reading suggests farmers are going to pull back on capital expenditures."</p>
<p>Respondents' outlook on farmland values faded in August, with the Short-Term Farmland Value Expectations Index dropping 13 points to 105. This marks a 21-point decline from a year ago and a 41-point drop from three years ago, when the index was at its peak. The decrease is attributable to a rise in the percentage of producers expecting farmland values to decline over the next year, increasing from 13% in July to 24% in August. The Long-Term Farmland Value Index also fell, dropping 4 points to 142.</p>
<p>Despite concerns about weakening farm income, a majority of respondents expect farmland cash rental rates for the 2025 crop year to remain stable. According to this month's survey, 70% of U.S. crop farmers anticipate that rental rates will stay the same, while only 16% expect a decline in lease rates.</p>

<div> Index, Small Business, Sales, Transactions, Growth
<br />
Small business sales and transactions showed year-over-year growth but declined month-over-month. Retail and restaurants saw positive trends.
<br /><br />Summary: 
Small business sales and transactions showed year-over-year growth but declined month-over-month. Retail and restaurants saw positive trends. <div>
<ul>
<li><i>Fiserv Small Business Index is unchanged at 141</i></li>
<li><i style="font-family: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">Small business sales grew 1.6% year over year, and declined 0.3% month over month; transactions grew 5.7% year over year, and 1.3% month over month</i></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.fiserv.com/" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Fiserv, Inc.</a>&nbsp;(NYSE: FI), a leading global provider of payments and financial services technology, has published the Fiserv Small Business Index for August 2024. The Fiserv Small Business Index is an indicator of the pace and mix of consumer spending at small businesses in the United States at national, state and industry levels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the beginning of each month, the Fiserv Small Business Index provides first-to-market insight into consumer spending at small businesses,&rdquo; said Jennifer LaClair, Head of Merchant Solutions at Fiserv. &ldquo;This monthly view of consumer spending has become an important economic indicator, providing a timely understanding of small business performance so we can better serve clients and partners across the small business ecosystem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nationally, the seasonally adjusted&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fiserv.com/en/fiserv-small-business-index.html" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Fiserv Small Business Index</a>&nbsp;in August was 141, unchanged from July. On a year-over-year basis, both small business sales (+1.6%) and total transactions (+5.7%) grew compared to August 2023, pointing to healthy consumer foot traffic. Month-over-month sales declined slightly (-0.3%) compared to July despite transactions growing (+1.3%). Transaction growth outpacing total sales can partly be attributed to recent declines in inflation, including July 2024 marking the lowest inflation rate since early 2021.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consumers made notable shifts to their spending patterns in August, resulting in restaurant and retail &ndash; including grocery, gas stations, and clothing &ndash; all trending upward in the month,&rdquo; said Prasanna Dhore, Chief Data Officer at Fiserv. &ldquo;Meanwhile, many service-based businesses, including specialty trade contractors and professional services, saw growth rates slow.&rdquo;</p>
<h4><span>Retail Growth Continues</span></h4>
<p>The Small Business Retail Index rose one point in August to 147. Year-over-year sales (+3.0%) and transactions (+7.3%) grew significantly as average ticket sizes saw a noticeable decline (-4.3%) compared to 2023. Back-to-school shopping, favorable pricing trends and a recently reported rise in consumer confidence contributed to this growth. Year over year, the fastest growing retail categories were General Merchandise (+8.8%), Food and Beverage Stores (+7.9%) and Sporting Goods (+5.6%).</p>
<p>Following the yearly trend, month-over-month retail sales (+1.0%) and transactions (+1.5%) both grew as average ticket sizes declined (-0.5%). Monthly growth highlighted a different mix of consumer priorities, with Clothing (+2.1%), Food and Beverage (+1.9%) and Furniture (+1.3%) seeing the most growth compared to July.</p>
<h4><span>Restaurants Reverse Trend</span></h4>
<p>Food Services and Drinking Places, which includes restaurants,<span>&nbsp;</span>indexed at 126 in August, a 3-point gain compared to July. The upward swing in spend marked a notable turnaround compared to July&rsquo;s index, when spend slowed on both an annual and monthly basis. Gains were widespread across the U.S., with nearly every state in the country seeing increased restaurant patronage in August.</p>
<p>Year over year, restaurants saw strong growth in both total sales (+4.9%) and foot traffic (+4.2%); average ticket size grew slightly (+0.7%). Month-over-month restaurant sales (+2.7%) and transactions (+1.1%) increased compared to July, reversing a streak of two consecutive months of slowing restaurant sales and foot traffic. Average ticket size also grew (+1.5%) month over month.</p>
<h4><span>Other Industry Movers</span></h4>

ShipFinex and Tokeny join forces to democratize maritime investments, ensuring regulatory compliance, and accelerating the growth of tokenized maritime assets. <br />Summary: <div>
<div class="wpb_text_column ">
<div class="wpb_wrapper">
<p><a href="https://www.shipfinex.com/">ShipFinex</a>, a leading innovator in maritime finance, and&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, the pioneering onchain finance operating system for tokenized securities, are proud to announce a strategic partnership aimed at transforming the way maritime assets are tokenized and managed.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="wpb_text_column ">
<div class="wpb_wrapper">
<h5><b>Elevating Maritime Finance</b></h5>
<p>Shipping and Maritime Finance have been an exclusive asset class/sector due to limited access in public equity markets and significant initial capital requirements to invest in assets, making it challenging for many to participate despite the Shipping market consistently outperforming many other asset classes.</p>
<p>ShipFinex and Tokeny are committed to democratizing access to maritime investments. Through this partnership, ShipFinex will leverage Tokeny&rsquo;s cutting-edge technology to ensure that all tokenized maritime assets on its platform meet the highest standards of regulatory compliance and security, using the ERC-3643 standard. This integration not only enhances investor confidence but also positions both companies as leaders in the digital transformation of maritime finance.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="wpb_text_column ">
<div class="wpb_wrapper">
<h5><b>Strategic Alignment</b></h5>
<p>The partnership between ShipFinex and Tokeny is a strategic alignment that amplifies the strengths of both companies. ShipFinex&rsquo;s expertise in maritime finance, combined with Tokeny&rsquo;s proven track record in tokenized securities infrastructure, creates a powerful synergy that is expected to accelerate the growth and adoption of tokenized maritime assets globally.</p>
<p>Following ShipFinex&rsquo;s recent announcement of receiving initial approval from VARA in the UAE, this partnership underscores the company&rsquo;s commitment to adopting world-class solutions to enhance its platform&rsquo;s security and compliance. This collaboration highlights robust infrastructure and innovative regulated approach underpinning ShipFinex&rsquo;s operations.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="wpb_text_column ">
<div class="wpb_wrapper">
<h5><b>Looking Ahead</b></h5>
<p>This strategic partnership sets the stage for future growth and expansion, as both ShipFinex and Tokeny continue to innovate and lead in their respective fields. The integration of their capabilities will facilitate the broader adoption of tokenized maritime assets, offering investors a secure and efficient marketplace.</p>

<title>Companies, Banks And The Public Sector Raise Their Stakes In The Spanish Stock Market, Of Which International Investors Own 49%</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> investors, Spanish stock market, public sector, international, households <br />
<br />
Public sector, non-financial companies, banks, and international investors increased their share ownership in the Spanish stock market. Household ownership also rose. International investors continue to hold nearly half of the market. <br />
Non-financial companies and banks also saw increased ownership in the Spanish stock market, while international investors continue to hold nearly half of its capitalization. Spanish households also increased their share ownership. Public sector investment is at a 26-year high. <br /> <div>
<ul>
<li><span>Public sector investment in the Spanish stock market is at a 26-year high of 3.3%</span></li>
<li><span>The Spanish stock market is 49% controlled by international investors, a drop of one percentage point from last year's all-time high</span></li>
<li><span>In contrast, the share of Spanish households increases by two tenths of a percentage point compared to the 2023 data, to 16.4%</span></li>
<li><span>The share of non-financial companies in the ownership of Spanish shares rises to 21.9%, a twelve-year high, and that of banks rebounds by four tenths of a percentage point.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Non-financial companies, banks and the public sector increased their share ownership in the Spanish stock market at the end of 2023, with international investors continuing to control nearly half of its capitalization. This is reflected in the Report on the Ownership of Listed Spanish Shares published today by BME's Research Department.</p>
<p>As the report points out, public sector participation in the stock market reached its highest level (16.6%) in 1992, when the privatisation process of a large number of public companies began, which reduced it to residual levels (0.6%). However, this dynamic has been reversing in the last decade following public aid to some banks and the maintenance and revaluation of significant stakes in listed companies, to reach the current figures, which place its weight at 3.3%, valued at around 23,000 million euros. The data in the report refer to the end of 2023, so they do not yet include the successive acquisitions of Telef&oacute;nica shares up to at least 10% of the capital made as early as 2024.</p>
<p>Another relevant fact is the large presence of non-resident investors in the Spanish stock market, with 49% of capitalization, a fall of 1.3 percentage points compared to last year. Once again this year, the comparative figure for international investor participation in unlisted and listed companies stands out. In the former, foreign investors hold an average of 25% compared to 48.7% in listed companies, which shows that being listed on the stock market is attractive to international investors.</p>
<p>In this category, sovereign wealth funds such as the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund, which at the end of 2023 had a stake of close to 12.5 billion euros in the Spanish stock market, the QIA sovereign wealth fund (7.1 billion), the Japanese GPIF (close to 3.2 billion) and the Singapore sovereign wealth fund, GIC (1.6 billion), are gaining increasing weight. As for the large international fund managers, BlackRock, which has 30.6 billion euros in Spanish listed companies, Vanguard Group with more than 21.8 billion, and Fidelity with almost 9.5 billion stand out, among others.</p>
<p>The report stresses that the high participation of international investors in the Spanish stock market further emphasizes the importance of promoting stock market listings so that more companies can benefit from the advantages of financial markets, such as global investment flows. This is highlighted in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bolsasymercados.es/docs/BME/docsSubidos/Estudios-Articulos/BME-Whitepaper.pdf">White Paper on fostering the competitiveness of Spanish capital markets</a>, published by BME in January and which has been received with broad consensus in the sector.</p>
<p>In the case of households, the report reveals that their shareholding in the Spanish stock market increased by two tenths in 2023 to 16.4%. Some 12.5% of Spanish households own shares in listed companies, which amounts to 2.4 million families, according to figures from the latest Household Financial Survey, compiled by the Bank of Spain. Although the accumulated financial assets in the hands of Spanish households reached 2.83 trillion euros, 5.8% more than in 2022 and a growth of 40% compared to a decade ago, it continues to maintain a high concentration in bank deposits.</p>
<p>Finally, non-financial companies control 21.9% of the Spanish stock market, nine tenths more than a year ago and a nine-year high; banks and savings banks reach a 3.5% share after a rebound of 4 tenths and Collective Investment Institutions, insurance and other non-banking financial institutions control 5.9% of total listed shares, the same percentage as a year ago.</p>
<p>You can find the report at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bolsasymercados.es/docs/BME/docsSubidos/Estudios-Articulos/BME-Report-Ownership-Listed-Spanish-Stock-2023.pdf?v=0ZqCLg!!">the following link</a>.</p>

<div> platform, data, Tradeverse, harmonization, AI 
<br />
Summary: Tradeverse, a data platform by Broadridge, harmonizes multi-asset class data, ensures data integrity, and enables AI initiatives for trading firms. It enhances efficiency and productivity. <div>
<p>The launch of Tradeverse, a new data platform by global Fintech leader&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.broadridge.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Broadridge Financial Solutions</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span>Inc. (NYSE: BR), will help trading firms eliminate data silos, unleash the potential of their data across the enterprise and better manage costs, reconciliation, and the data quality and lineage challenges of firms typical complex platform ecosystems.</p>
<p>Tradeverse consolidates real-time, multi-asset class data from multiple vendor applications and platforms from orders and executions through settlement into a unified, harmonized data platform. It reduces errors, simplifies access with a common data ontology across front, middle and back office and incorporates robust security to protect sensitive information and maintain data integrity. The clear data structure unlocks insights for all key functions &ndash; trading desks, operations, risk, finance, and regulatory - by providing a trusted and transparent data source.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;A Tradeverse implementation we&rsquo;ve recently completed with a global bank is proving the power of harmonizing trade data&rdquo;&nbsp;</i>said&nbsp;<b>Hugh Daly, Head of Data and AI, Capital Markets, Broadridge</b>.&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;The solution delivers efficiencies for their regulatory reporting and compliance teams, allowing direct access to the data for business users initiating complex searches using natural language.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Many enterprise data warehouse projects fail to deliver the expected benefits due to the complexity arising from disparate representations of the source data. Tradeverse is focused on ensuring true data harmonization. The application of business logic and constraint of the data ontology is critical to that. This leads to seamless access to high quality data, which ultimately accelerates time-to-value for multiple AI initiatives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In another use case, the Securities Operations team of a top ten capital markets firm is using Tradeverse&rsquo;s harmonized data platform coupled with Broadridge&rsquo;s Generative AI tool for Operations (<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.broadridge.com/financial-services/capital-markets/transform-trade-life-cycle/opsgpt" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OpsGPT</a>) to empower users.&nbsp; This is allowing the teams to identify and implement productivity gains such as settlement fails analysis that were previously incredibly hard to capture in a fragmented ecosystem.</p>
<p>Tradeverse will be the cornerstone of a number of innovative value-add business solutions that Broadridge will bring to market in the coming months.</p>

<div> Singapore, Asia, finance, regulations, growth
Summary:
Collaboration, Rapid Response, Alliance, Flexibility, Technology are key to upholding market integrity in Asia's growing financial landscape. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Wilson and Kyle, for inviting me to speak at this event. It's a pleasure to be back in Singapore where I began the Asian phase of my career almost exactly 25 years ago in September 1999. Somewhat distressingly, I am told kids today refer to this as the late 1900s.</p>
<p>Also, congratulations to the Singaporeans on your country&rsquo;s 59th anniversary. I&rsquo;m sure you all share my gratification in seeing the economic miracle the city-state has achieved, and that also epitomises the impressive progress of Asia as a whole in the past decades. Indeed, both Singapore and Hong Kong have grown together as closer partners and also as leading financial hubs in the region. Core to our success is a shared belief in the rule of law, which translates into a robust regulatory framework and a market of integrity in finance. These elements are vital to sustaining Asia&rsquo;s remarkable growth and attracting investments much needed to power an even brighter future for Asia.</p>
<p>This year also marks the 35th anniversary of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC). Under our four strategic priorities for 2024-2026, we commit ourselves to bolstering market resilience, global competitiveness, financial innovation, and operational efficiency. For the Enforcement Division which I lead, our primary goal to uphold market integrity is certainly critical to a resilient and competitive market.</p>
<p>Achieving this goal is increasingly challenging. Technological advancements and global connectivity mean we are facing far more sophisticated financial crimes and have to swiftly adapt. In this context, I&rsquo;ll share with you how we &ldquo;CRAFT&rdquo; our strategies through: Collaboration, Rapid Response, Alliance, Flexibility and Technology.</p>

<p>These indices, which are administered by ICE Data Indices, LLC, are accessible in ICE&rsquo;s Custom Index Tool, which provides a variety of ways to prototype and back test strategies for multiple use cases, including research, benchmark construction, designing new financial products such as ETFs or enabling services such as direct indexing.</p>
<p>This new suite of indices is designed to provide comprehensive and transparent benchmarks for tracking the performance of AUD-denominated residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS). The new index family includes:</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">

<p>&ldquo;Despite ongoing global economic uncertainty, the Australian residential MBS market has demonstrated impressive resilience and a promising outlook for growth and new issuance," said Magnus Cattan, Head of APAC Client Development at ICE Data Services. "With the introduction of these new indices, we look forward to supporting our clients across the global fixed income ecosystem and enhancing their investment strategies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Australian RMBS index family leverages ICE&rsquo;s extensive experience in fixed income pricing and reference data, and the companies deep global product coverage.

<div> collaboration, financial literacy, SET, NSF, SLF
<br /><br />Summary: 
The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) renews collaboration with NSF and SLF to promote financial literacy and planning for various target groups. <div>
<p>The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) has renewed a Memorandum of Understanding with the National Savings Fund (NSF) and the Student Loan Fund (SLF), marking the 7th consecutive year of collaboration to promote financial planning knowledge. This initiative aims to enhance learning in the digital era, helping Thais achieve financial well-being across various target groups. The financial literacy content, available both online and offline, is expected to reach over 2.5 million members of NSF and SLF nationwide annually.</p>
<p><b>SET Senior Executive Vice President Soraphol Tulayasathien</b> highlighted that Thailand is currently facing various financial challenges, including rising household debt levels and the transition to a super-aged society. Most Thais are encountering the problem of aging before achieving financial stability, leaving them with insufficient funds to live during retirement. SET is accelerating its efforts to promote financial literacy, a crucial skill for building financial security for all ages. This aligns with SET's strategic plan and its 50th-anniversary concept of &ldquo;Make it Work for Every Future." SET has modernized financial and investment knowledge resources, including the SET e-Learning platform, which offers diverse courses tailored to individual needs in line with new learning paradigms. In collaboration with partners, SET aims to deliver this knowledge to various target groups, ultimately improving Thai people&rsquo;s long-term financial stability and quality of life.</p>
<p>SET has recently renewed the MOU with NSF and SLF to promote financial literacy, marking the 7th consecutive year of this collaboration. This four-year MOU aims to expand financial knowledge to people from all walks of life, including students, working professionals, informal workers, freelancers, and the general public. The initiative seeks to foster financial literacy, enabling individuals to manage debt effectively, design appropriate savings plans, and ensure adequate pensions for retirement.</p>
<p><b>NSF Secretary-General Jaruluk Ruangsuwan</b> emphasized that NSF is driving the promotion of financial and investment literacy, as well as fostering social sustainability by establishing basic pension security for the future. NSF also advances learning in the new digital era, enabling Thai people to achieve financial well-being. This aligns with NSF's vision of building a foundation for savings and driving comprehensive pension schemes for the public sector. At present, NSF has 2.6 million members<b>.</b></p>
<p>The collaboration between SET and NSF, which began in 2018, has successfully enhanced public understanding of financial planning, strengthened financial stability, and created healthy financial practices, ensuring quality retirement through savings with NSF. Building on this success, SET and NSF have renewed the MOU to continue joint efforts in promoting financial planning for Thais and enhancing understanding of financial management, particularly retirement planning, to ensure sustainability and efficiency moving forward."</p>
<p><b>SLF Manager Chainarong Kajchapanan</b> said that SLF is dedicated to promoting knowledge and various skills to increase educational opportunities for Thai youth, especially in financial literacy essential for everyone. This initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance and value of student loans and foster responsibility in loan repayment.</p>
<p>SLF and SET have maintained a strong partnership for seven years since 2018. Currently, there are 71 SET e-Learning courses provided to SLF targets covering financial planning, investment, and entrepreneurship. These courses are available free of charge, allowing loan borrowers to accumulate public service hours as required by the Fund. The program has seen remarkable success, with a cumulative enrollment of over 10 million, showing significant year-on-year growth.</p>
<p>The Fund expects all borrowers to gain financial knowledge to manage their income, assets, and liabilities appropriately. This knowledge will be beneficial in preparing for and creating additional opportunities for their future. Moreover, it will enable them to repay their loans on schedule, ensuring a revolving fund that can continue to provide educational opportunities for future generations.</p>
<p>This collaboration between the two organizations builds upon previous successes by strengthening financial literacy among Thai youth. This initiative is crucial in developing a capable workforce that will play a vital role in the country's future development.</p>
<p class="p1">SET has been determined to drive financial and investment knowledge for the public for over two decades, collaborating with both public and private sector partners. Initiatives include the "Happy Money, Happy Young Old" project, the "Happy Money, Financial Mentor" program, and various online resources such as articles, video clips, and infographics. Moreover, SET e-Learning courses cover financial planning, debt management, retirement planning, and investment.

<title>Cboe Europe Secures Support Of Key Participants For Launch Of Cboe BIDS VWAP-X Service</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Exchange, Cboe BIDS VWAP-X, liquidity, European equities, participants
Summary:<br /> Cboe Europe announces BIDS VWAP-X service with support from major participants, offering trajectory crossing for European equities. Scheduled to launch October 21. <div>
<p>Cboe Europe, the largest pan-European stock exchange<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;and a division of Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe: CBOE), today announces that it has secured the support of a broad range of participants for Cboe BIDS VWAP-X, its new trading service allowing participants to source and match liquidity at a forward benchmark price. This service is scheduled to launch on October 21, subject to regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>Early adopters of the Cboe BIDS VWAP-X service include Bernstein, BNP Paribas, BMO Capital Markets, Instinet Europe, Jefferies, KCx and Virtu Financial.</p>
<p>Natan Tiefenbrun, President, North American and European Equities, Cboe Global Markets, said: "We are delighted to have secured such a strong group of initial Participants to support Cboe BIDS VWAP-X and are in active discussions with numerous others who are looking to utilise this service at the earliest opportunity. This demonstrates that we've listened to our Participants to meet their needs for an exchange-regulated crossing platform to execute participative volume at an interval-based price. We're excited to be bringing this first-of-its-kind service to the European equities market and help enhance execution outcomes for end investors."</p>
<p>Eric Stockland, Co-Head of Global Electronic Trading, BMO Capital Markets, said: "Trajectory crossing in EMEA is a major development for the institutional investor because it helps minimise tracking error to benchmark performance and helps mitigate adverse selection faced on other multilateral trading facilities (MTFs) and liquidity pools."</p>
<p>Brian Gallagher, Head of Equity Execution, BNP Paribas, said: "We support innovation in the European market, and we will embrace it when it complements BNP Paribas's liquidity access and enriches our clients' execution experience".</p>
<p>Salvador Rodriguez, EMEA Head of Global Execution Services, Instinet Europe Limited, said: "Benchmark Crossing offers an encouraging innovation in Equity Market Structure in EMEA that should improve the ability for algos to find high quality counterpart liquidity. The approach and implementation should allow for agency algos to trade versus multiple benchmarks at a fair price with a good balance of simplicity, as well as allowing more complex control features based on differing client interaction requirements."</p>
<p>Ben Springett, Head of Electronic and Program Trading, EMEA, Jefferies, said: "Jefferies welcome this innovation enabling us to provide incremental liquidity opportunities to our client base. VWAP crossing mechanisms can unlock liquidity that otherwise wouldn't necessarily meet on a multilateral venue, utilising a mechanism that we have seen prove beneficial for algo performance on a range of benchmarks."</p>
<p>Chris McConville, Global Head of Execution Services and Trading at KCx, said: "KCx welcomes this innovation to the European market. We believe trajectory crossing is a positive disruption to the marketplace and could provide incremental liquidity to our client base."</p>
<p>James Osborne, Global Head of Algorithmic Development, Virtu Financial, said: "Trajectory crossing is more than just a useful feature for VWAP algorithms - it's a unique matching mechanism that can benefit many trading algorithms when utilised in conjunction with target benchmarks. Many of Virtu's US algorithms already leverage elements of trajectory crossing to enhance performance and we look forward to extending the same benefits to our European algorithms with the launch of Cboe BIDS VWAP-X."</p>
<p>As previously announced, Cboe BIDS VWAP-X is a first-of-its-kind, exchange-operated trajectory crossing service for European equities, which allows participants to source and match liquidity at a forward benchmark price. It is being provided as a service of Cboe BIDS Europe, the region's largest block trading platform<sup>2</sup>, utilising BIDS' proven conditional trade negotiation and execution workflow to match orders based on a standard, exchange-regulated volume weighted average price (VWAP) methodology.</p>
<p>Cboe BIDS VWAP-X will allow market participants to submit conditional VWAP indications of interest (IOIs) into the service. Once a potential match is found, firms will be invited to firm-up their IOIs, and after eligible order quantities are matched a standard matching cycle will take place to calculate the interval-VWAP trade price. Trades will be reported as off-book, on-exchange executions in real-time, allowing them to be centrally cleared through Cboe Europe's interoperable clearing model.</p>
<p>The service will benefit from BIDS' established protections against information leakage surrounding IOIs, including disclosure and interactions controlled by customisable tools and counterparty score-carding and filtering based on past trading behaviour.</p>
<p>At launch, the service will be accessible by sell side participants through FIX connectivity. Customer testing is already underway ahead of a planned launch on October 21, subject to regulatory approvals.</p>

<div> workshop, audit quality, financial reporting, enforcement, surveillance 
Summary: The AARG and FSSG workshop focused on audit quality, financial reporting compliance, enforcement, and surveillance strategies with ASEAN regulators and industry leaders. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The ASEAN Audit Regulators Group (AARG) and Financial Statements Surveillance Group (FSSG) recently held a workshop hosted by the Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) to strengthen audit quality and financial reporting compliance in the region.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The event brought together regulators and industry leaders from Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines.</p>
<p>As part of ongoing efforts by ASEAN members of the International Forum of Independent Audit Regulators (IFIAR), the workshop served as a platform for collaboration and knowledge sharing.</p>
<p>Participants discussed key regulatory issues including the implementation of the new International Standard on Quality Management (ISQM) requirements affecting audit firms and approaches to ISQM 1 reviews across ASEAN.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A unique aspect of the workshop was the focus on enforcement and communication strategies, building on efforts to drive impactful enforcement of audit regulations. The AARG also had discussions with the regional leadership of three global network audit firms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FSSG workshop addressed the importance of consistency in financial reporting. This is a common challenge for regulators in today&rsquo;s globalised financial markets as consistent reporting helps to ensure more accurate assessments of the financial statements. Consistent financial reporting also eases comparability within a company over time and across different companies, industries, and jurisdictions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The workshop further explored effective surveillance strategies and approaches, including greater technology integration.</p>
<p>The audit and surveillance regulators reaffirmed the importance of compliance with financial reporting regulations in promoting market integrity and enhancing investor protection.</p>

<br />
The SFC published new guides for licensing professionals, updated guides for Mainland practitioners, and plans to organize workshops for industry understanding.
<br /><br />Summary: <br />The SFC published new licensing guides, updated guides for Mainland practitioners, and plans to organize industry workshops. <div>
<p>The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) today published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/Regulatory-functions/Intermediaries/Licensing/Quick-licensing-guide" target="_blank">two new quick reference guides</a>&nbsp;to assist visiting and returning professionals in understanding the SFC's pragmatic licensing regime, complementing the five popular quick reference guides published in 2023 (Note 1).</p>
<p>Illustrating with case studies, the two new guides offer useful information about licensing options and processes as well as various conditions for examination exemptions, in order to facilitate a smooth and compliant transition to the Hong Kong financial markets for these professionals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We see a growing trend of financial talents coming to Hong Kong and we offer a pragmatic licensing regime to accommodate such demand,&rdquo; said Dr Eric Yip, the SFC&rsquo;s Executive Director of Intermediaries. &ldquo;While the first series was very well received, these new handy guides should help industry practitioners and potential applicants better grasp the essence of the SFC&rsquo;s expectations and licensing requirements with an aim to continuously strengthen Hong Kong&rsquo;s pool of financial talents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SFC plans to organise workshops later this year to help the industry better understand its licensing policies and recent initiatives.</p>
<p>Additionally, the SFC has updated the Chinese version of the quick reference guide for Mainland practitioners (Note 2) and released a new English version.</p>
<p>These quick reference guides can be accessed on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/Regulatory-functions/Intermediaries/Licensing/Quick-licensing-guide" target="_blank">the SFC website</a>, and prospective licence applicants are encouraged to contact the SFC at licensing@sfc.hk for further assistance.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>The SFC published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/Regulatory-functions/Intermediaries/Licensing/Quick-licensing-guide" target="_blank">quick reference guides</a>&nbsp;to licensing and competence requirements for family offices, private equity firms, hedge fund managers and overseas and Mainland practitioners in March 2023. More than 32,000 copies of quick reference guides have been distributed, downloaded or viewed since then.</li>
<li>The Chinese version of the SFC&rsquo;s quick reference guide to competence requirements for Mainland practitioners was first published in March 2023.</li>

<div> Amendments, Liquidity Provider, Qatar Stock Exchange, Market Efficiency, Dividend Distribution
Summary:<br />
QSE introduces new criteria for liquidity providers, aiming to boost liquidity, market efficiency, and investor confidence. Additionally, dividend regulations enhance market attractiveness. 
Summary: <div>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>On the occasion of the commencement of the new amendments to the Liquidity Provider (LP) Scheme, particularly concerning the performance evaluation criteria for liquidity providers, Qatar Stock Exchange (QSE) announces the inclusion of all these amendments and new criteria in the standardized and approved contracts for this activity, effective from today, Sunday, September 1, 2024. These criteria will be reviewed on a semi-annual basis to ensure their alignment with international best practices and market needs.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>These amendments are part of a package of incentives offered by Qatar Stock Exchange to develop the liquidity provider activity in the Qatari market, contributing to increased liquidity and trading, attracting more investors, and enhancing the competitiveness of the Qatari market. This development is part of the ongoing efforts of the Qatar Financial Markets Authority and Qatar Stock Exchange to improve market efficiency and increase its appeal to both local and international investors, thereby contributing to the sustainable growth of the Qatari market.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>It is worth noting that a liquidity provider is a licensed financial services company authorized to engage in liquidity provision activities, which enhance the liquidity of listed securities by continuously offering buy or sell prices for a specific security, in accordance with the terms and conditions outlined in the agreement between the liquidity provider and the listed company.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The introduction of the revised Liquidity Provider scheme is set to significantly lower liquidity costs and provide more depth in the order book, ensuring a more efficient, stable and transparent trading environment.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>As part of the aforementioned incentive package, the Qatar Financial Markets Authority recently introduced regulations for dividend distribution for listed joint-stock companies, allowing them to distribute interim dividends. In light of this step, some listed companies distributed semi-annual dividends in 2024. This important step enhances the attractiveness of the Qatari market by providing shareholders with more frequent returns on their investments, thereby increasing investor confidence and boosting trading activity in the market.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Interim dividends provide a steady return on investment before the company&rsquo;s final year-end dividend, offering investors regular income and a more predictable cash flow. This approach not only boosts investor confidence but also encourages long-term commitment to the market, fostering greater market participation and liquidity.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>QSE is continuously working on developing investment tools by launching various initiatives that align with market needs and international best practices. As part of its strategy, the exchange is committed to enhancing market efficiency, transparency, accessibility, and ensuring a better trading experience for all market participants.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span>FINRA has filed new amendments to proposed FINRA Rule 12800(g)(1). Proposed Rule 12800(g)(1)(A) would provide that Document Production Lists apply to arbitrations in which the customer requests an Option One hearing. Also, proposed Rule 12800(g)(1)(B) would provide that such would not apply to arbitrations in which the customer requests no hearing or an Option Two special proceeding, unless the customer requests that the Document Production Lists apply to all parties.</span><br /><br /><span>Please refer to the following Regulatory Circulars for more information on the amendments:</span></p>
