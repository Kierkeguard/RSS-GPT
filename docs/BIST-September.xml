<title>SEC Charges Creative Legal Fundings CEO Maria Dickerson With Operating Multimillion Dollar Ponzi Scheme That Targeted Filipino-American Community</title>

<div> charged, fraudulent, securities, investors, lawsuit <br />
Summary: The SEC charged Maria Dulce Pino Dickerson and her companies with defrauding investors of $7 million through a fraudulent securities offering targeting the Filipino-American community. <br /> <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Maria Dulce Pino Dickerson and her companies Creative Legal Fundings in CA and The Ubiquity Group LLC with raising approximately $7 million from more than 130 investors through a fraudulent securities offering targeting members of the Filipino-American community across the United States.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, from approximately March 2021 through May 2023, Sacramento, California resident Dickerson convinced investors to acquire interests in Creative Legal Fundings by falsely claiming that she would use their investments to make loans to personal injury attorneys to fund their lawsuits. In exchange, Dickerson allegedly claimed, Creative Legal Fundings would receive a portion of any eventual settlements or recoveries. According to the complaint, Dickerson promised investors guaranteed high returns of 10 to 17.5 percent per month. In reality, the complaint alleges, Creative Legal Fundings did not make any loans, conduct any other business, or generate any returns. Instead, Dickerson allegedly spent at least $2.5 million in investor funds on personal real estate, gambling, travel and designer goods purchases. The complaint also alleges that Dickerson made Ponzi-like payments to earlier investors using funds from new investors in an attempt to keep the scheme going. The complaint further alleges that, after Dickerson ran out of money to pay Creative Legal Fundings&rsquo; investors in around May 2023, she shuttered that company, opened The Ubiquity Group, and tried to raise additional funds using similar misrepresentations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As alleged, Creative Legal Fundings' operations were neither creative, nor legal. This was nothing more than fraud perpetrated against retail investors, many of whom were members of the Filipino-American community,&rdquo; said Monique C. Winkler, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s San Francisco Regional Office.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California, charges Dickerson, Creative Legal Fundings, and The Ubiquity Group with violating the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, including conduct-based injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The SEC also seeks an officer-and-director bar against Dickerson.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was part of the San Francisco Regional Office and Los Angeles Regional Office&rsquo;s task force focused on affinity frauds, the Western Alliance to Protect Targeted Communities. The SEC&rsquo;s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-alerts/investor-alert-have-something-common-someone-selling-investment-it-may-make-you-target-fraud">Investor Alert</a>&nbsp;with tips on how investors can identify and avoid affinity frauds.</p>
<p>In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Eastern District of California today announced criminal charges against Dickerson.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Duncan C. Simpson LaGoy and Michael Foley and supervised by David Zhou and Jason H. Lee of the San Francisco Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Robin Andrews and Mr. Simpson LaGoy.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Crypto-Focused Advisory Firm Galois Capital For Custody Failures - Firm Also Misled Investors About Its Redemption Practices</title>

<div> charges, Galois Capital Management, crypto assets, Investment Advisers Act, civil penalty
Summary:
SEC charges Galois Capital Management for violating custody rule and misleading investors. Ordered to pay $225,000 civil penalty. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against Florida-based Galois Capital Management LLC, a former registered investment adviser for a private fund that primarily invested in crypto assets, for failing to comply with requirements related to the safeguarding of client assets, including crypto assets being offered and sold as securities. The Commission also found that Galois misled fund investors about the notice period required for redemptions. To settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges, Galois agreed to pay a civil penalty of $225,000, which will be distributed to its fund&rsquo;s harmed investors.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order found that, beginning in July 2022, Galois Capital failed to ensure that certain crypto assets held by the private fund that it advised were maintained with a qualified custodian, a violation of the Investment Advisers Act&rsquo;s Custody Rule. According to the order, Galois Capital held certain crypto assets in online trading accounts on crypto asset trading platforms, including FTX Trading Ltd., that were not qualified custodians. Approximately half of the fund&rsquo;s assets under management from early to mid-November 2022 were lost in connection with the collapse of FTX. The SEC&rsquo;s order also found that Galois Capital misled certain investors by representing to them that redemptions required at least five business days&rsquo; notice before month end while allowing other investors to redeem with fewer days&rsquo; notice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By failing to comply with Custody Rule provisions, Galois Capital exposed investors to risks that fund assets, including crypto assets, could be lost, misused, or misappropriated,&rdquo; said Corey Schuster, Co-Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division&rsquo;s Asset Management Unit. &ldquo;We will continue to hold accountable advisers who violate their core investor protection obligations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order found that Galois Capital violated the Investment Advisers Act. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, Galois Capital consented to the entry of an order requiring it to cease and desist from further violations of the Advisers Act, censuring it, and imposing the civil penalty discussed above.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Annie Hancock and Rory Alex and supervised by Colin Forbes, Brent Wilner, Mr. Schuster, and Andrew Dean, all of the Division of Enforcement's Asset Management Unit. The team was assisted by Kelly Kibbie, Neil Lombardo, and Janet Grossnickle of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Investment Management.</p>

<div> survey, farm income, farmland values, financial conditions, commodity prices
<br />
The August farm survey showed decreased farm income expectations, lower farmland values, and weakened financial conditions, leading to decreased investment optimism and concern over commodity prices.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The August&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4243260-1&amp;h=1915940469&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fageconomybarometer%2F&amp;a=Purdue+University%2FCME+Group+Ag+Economy+Barometer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="xn-org">Purdue University</span>/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer</a>&nbsp;dropped 13 points from July to a reading of 100, echoing levels seen from fall 2015 to winter 2016 during the early stages of a significant downturn in the U.S. farm economy. The Index of Current Conditions also dropped 17 points to 83, while the Index of Future Expectations decreased by 11 points to 108. Weakening farm income prospects weighed on farmers' sentiment as the outlook for a bountiful fall harvest was more than offset by declining crop prices. This month's survey was conducted from&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">Aug. 12-16, 2024</span>.</p>
<p>"Weakness in the barometer and related indices provide a signal that farmers are concerned about the possibility of extended weakness in farm incomes, similar to what took place from 2015 to 2019,"&nbsp;said&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4243260-1&amp;h=2802801166&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fageconomybarometer%2Fteam%2Fjim-mintert%2F&amp;a=James+Mintert" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="xn-person">James Mintert</span></a>, the barometer's principal investigator and director of&nbsp;<span class="xn-org">Purdue University's</span>&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4243260-1&amp;h=3861785331&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fhome%2F&amp;a=Center+for+Commercial+Agriculture" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Center for Commercial Agriculture</a>.</p>
<p>August's survey results indicate a shift among farmers' primary concerns, with 30% of respondents identifying lower commodity prices as their primary concern, compared to 33% who cited high input costs. Last year at this time only 20% pointed to weak commodity prices as a top concern.</p>
<p>However, concerns about rising interest rates have lessened, with only 17% of farmers mentioning this issue, down from 24% last year. Looking ahead, 68% of respondents expect interest rates to decrease in the coming year, while just 19% anticipate an increase.</p>
<p>The Farm Financial Performance Index dropped 9 points from July's survey and 14 points from a year ago, reaching its lowest level since&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">July 2020</span>, when there was widespread uncertainty from COVID-related lockdowns. The decline in financial performance reflects ongoing concerns about weak financial conditions. In turn, weakening financial conditions led many farmers to say that now is not a good time to invest, resulting in the Farm Capital Investment Index falling 7 points to 31, matching its all-time low.</p>
<p>"Farmers have also become less optimistic about farmland values this summer than in recent years," said Mintert. "The percentage of farmers who think farmland values could decline within the upcoming year has been rising, which is consistent with the weak outlook for financial conditions. The weak capital investment index reading suggests farmers are going to pull back on capital expenditures."</p>
<p>Respondents' outlook on farmland values faded in August, with the Short-Term Farmland Value Expectations Index dropping 13 points to 105. This marks a 21-point decline from a year ago and a 41-point drop from three years ago, when the index was at its peak. The decrease is attributable to a rise in the percentage of producers expecting farmland values to decline over the next year, increasing from 13% in July to 24% in August. The Long-Term Farmland Value Index also fell, dropping 4 points to 142.</p>
<p>Despite concerns about weakening farm income, a majority of respondents expect farmland cash rental rates for the 2025 crop year to remain stable. According to this month's survey, 70% of U.S. crop farmers anticipate that rental rates will stay the same, while only 16% expect a decline in lease rates.</p>

<div> Index, Small Business, Sales, Transactions, Growth
<br />
Small business sales and transactions showed year-over-year growth but declined month-over-month. Retail and restaurants saw positive trends.
<br /><br />Summary: 
Small business sales and transactions showed year-over-year growth but declined month-over-month. Retail and restaurants saw positive trends. <div>
<ul>
<li><i>Fiserv Small Business Index is unchanged at 141</i></li>
<li><i style="font-family: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">Small business sales grew 1.6% year over year, and declined 0.3% month over month; transactions grew 5.7% year over year, and 1.3% month over month</i></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.fiserv.com/" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Fiserv, Inc.</a>&nbsp;(NYSE: FI), a leading global provider of payments and financial services technology, has published the Fiserv Small Business Index for August 2024. The Fiserv Small Business Index is an indicator of the pace and mix of consumer spending at small businesses in the United States at national, state and industry levels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the beginning of each month, the Fiserv Small Business Index provides first-to-market insight into consumer spending at small businesses,&rdquo; said Jennifer LaClair, Head of Merchant Solutions at Fiserv. &ldquo;This monthly view of consumer spending has become an important economic indicator, providing a timely understanding of small business performance so we can better serve clients and partners across the small business ecosystem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nationally, the seasonally adjusted&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fiserv.com/en/fiserv-small-business-index.html" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Fiserv Small Business Index</a>&nbsp;in August was 141, unchanged from July. On a year-over-year basis, both small business sales (+1.6%) and total transactions (+5.7%) grew compared to August 2023, pointing to healthy consumer foot traffic. Month-over-month sales declined slightly (-0.3%) compared to July despite transactions growing (+1.3%). Transaction growth outpacing total sales can partly be attributed to recent declines in inflation, including July 2024 marking the lowest inflation rate since early 2021.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consumers made notable shifts to their spending patterns in August, resulting in restaurant and retail &ndash; including grocery, gas stations, and clothing &ndash; all trending upward in the month,&rdquo; said Prasanna Dhore, Chief Data Officer at Fiserv. &ldquo;Meanwhile, many service-based businesses, including specialty trade contractors and professional services, saw growth rates slow.&rdquo;</p>
<h4><span>Retail Growth Continues</span></h4>
<p>The Small Business Retail Index rose one point in August to 147. Year-over-year sales (+3.0%) and transactions (+7.3%) grew significantly as average ticket sizes saw a noticeable decline (-4.3%) compared to 2023. Back-to-school shopping, favorable pricing trends and a recently reported rise in consumer confidence contributed to this growth. Year over year, the fastest growing retail categories were General Merchandise (+8.8%), Food and Beverage Stores (+7.9%) and Sporting Goods (+5.6%).</p>
<p>Following the yearly trend, month-over-month retail sales (+1.0%) and transactions (+1.5%) both grew as average ticket sizes declined (-0.5%). Monthly growth highlighted a different mix of consumer priorities, with Clothing (+2.1%), Food and Beverage (+1.9%) and Furniture (+1.3%) seeing the most growth compared to July.</p>
<h4><span>Restaurants Reverse Trend</span></h4>
<p>Food Services and Drinking Places, which includes restaurants,<span>&nbsp;</span>indexed at 126 in August, a 3-point gain compared to July.

ShipFinex and Tokeny join forces to democratize maritime investments, ensuring regulatory compliance, and accelerating the growth of tokenized maritime assets. <br />Summary: <div>
<div class="wpb_text_column ">
<div class="wpb_wrapper">
<p><a href="https://www.shipfinex.com/">ShipFinex</a>, a leading innovator in maritime finance, and&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, the pioneering onchain finance operating system for tokenized securities, are proud to announce a strategic partnership aimed at transforming the way maritime assets are tokenized and managed.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="wpb_text_column ">
<div class="wpb_wrapper">
<h5><b>Elevating Maritime Finance</b></h5>
<p>Shipping and Maritime Finance have been an exclusive asset class/sector due to limited access in public equity markets and significant initial capital requirements to invest in assets, making it challenging for many to participate despite the Shipping market consistently outperforming many other asset classes.</p>
<p>ShipFinex and Tokeny are committed to democratizing access to maritime investments. Through this partnership, ShipFinex will leverage Tokeny&rsquo;s cutting-edge technology to ensure that all tokenized maritime assets on its platform meet the highest standards of regulatory compliance and security, using the ERC-3643 standard. This integration not only enhances investor confidence but also positions both companies as leaders in the digital transformation of maritime finance.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="wpb_text_column ">
<div class="wpb_wrapper">
<h5><b>Strategic Alignment</b></h5>
<p>The partnership between ShipFinex and Tokeny is a strategic alignment that amplifies the strengths of both companies. ShipFinex&rsquo;s expertise in maritime finance, combined with Tokeny&rsquo;s proven track record in tokenized securities infrastructure, creates a powerful synergy that is expected to accelerate the growth and adoption of tokenized maritime assets globally.</p>
<p>Following ShipFinex&rsquo;s recent announcement of receiving initial approval from VARA in the UAE, this partnership underscores the company&rsquo;s commitment to adopting world-class solutions to enhance its platform&rsquo;s security and compliance. This collaboration highlights robust infrastructure and innovative regulated approach underpinning ShipFinex&rsquo;s operations.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="wpb_text_column ">
<div class="wpb_wrapper">
<h5><b>Looking Ahead</b></h5>
<p>This strategic partnership sets the stage for future growth and expansion, as both ShipFinex and Tokeny continue to innovate and lead in their respective fields. The integration of their capabilities will facilitate the broader adoption of tokenized maritime assets, offering investors a secure and efficient marketplace.</p>

<title>Companies, Banks And The Public Sector Raise Their Stakes In The Spanish Stock Market, Of Which International Investors Own 49%</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> investors, Spanish stock market, public sector, international, households <br />
<br />
Public sector, non-financial companies, banks, and international investors increased their share ownership in the Spanish stock market. Household ownership also rose. International investors continue to hold nearly half of the market. <br />
Non-financial companies and banks also saw increased ownership in the Spanish stock market, while international investors continue to hold nearly half of its capitalization. Spanish households also increased their share ownership. Public sector investment is at a 26-year high. <br /> <div>
<ul>
<li><span>Public sector investment in the Spanish stock market is at a 26-year high of 3.3%</span></li>
<li><span>The Spanish stock market is 49% controlled by international investors, a drop of one percentage point from last year's all-time high</span></li>
<li><span>In contrast, the share of Spanish households increases by two tenths of a percentage point compared to the 2023 data, to 16.4%</span></li>
<li><span>The share of non-financial companies in the ownership of Spanish shares rises to 21.9%, a twelve-year high, and that of banks rebounds by four tenths of a percentage point.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Non-financial companies, banks and the public sector increased their share ownership in the Spanish stock market at the end of 2023, with international investors continuing to control nearly half of its capitalization. This is reflected in the Report on the Ownership of Listed Spanish Shares published today by BME's Research Department.</p>
<p>As the report points out, public sector participation in the stock market reached its highest level (16.6%) in 1992, when the privatisation process of a large number of public companies began, which reduced it to residual levels (0.6%). However, this dynamic has been reversing in the last decade following public aid to some banks and the maintenance and revaluation of significant stakes in listed companies, to reach the current figures, which place its weight at 3.3%, valued at around 23,000 million euros. The data in the report refer to the end of 2023, so they do not yet include the successive acquisitions of Telef&oacute;nica shares up to at least 10% of the capital made as early as 2024.</p>
<p>Another relevant fact is the large presence of non-resident investors in the Spanish stock market, with 49% of capitalization, a fall of 1.3 percentage points compared to last year. Once again this year, the comparative figure for international investor participation in unlisted and listed companies stands out. In the former, foreign investors hold an average of 25% compared to 48.7% in listed companies, which shows that being listed on the stock market is attractive to international investors.</p>
<p>In this category, sovereign wealth funds such as the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund, which at the end of 2023 had a stake of close to 12.5 billion euros in the Spanish stock market, the QIA sovereign wealth fund (7.1 billion), the Japanese GPIF (close to 3.2 billion) and the Singapore sovereign wealth fund, GIC (1.6 billion), are gaining increasing weight. As for the large international fund managers, BlackRock, which has 30.6 billion euros in Spanish listed companies, Vanguard Group with more than 21.8 billion, and Fidelity with almost 9.5 billion stand out, among others.</p>
<p>The report stresses that the high participation of international investors in the Spanish stock market further emphasizes the importance of promoting stock market listings so that more companies can benefit from the advantages of financial markets, such as global investment flows. This is highlighted in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bolsasymercados.es/docs/BME/docsSubidos/Estudios-Articulos/BME-Whitepaper.pdf">White Paper on fostering the competitiveness of Spanish capital markets</a>, published by BME in January and which has been received with broad consensus in the sector.</p>
<p>In the case of households, the report reveals that their shareholding in the Spanish stock market increased by two tenths in 2023 to 16.4%. Some 12.5% of Spanish households own shares in listed companies, which amounts to 2.4 million families, according to figures from the latest Household Financial Survey, compiled by the Bank of Spain. Although the accumulated financial assets in the hands of Spanish households reached 2.83 trillion euros, 5.8% more than in 2022 and a growth of 40% compared to a decade ago, it continues to maintain a high concentration in bank deposits.</p>
<p>Finally, non-financial companies control 21.9% of the Spanish stock market, nine tenths more than a year ago and a nine-year high; banks and savings banks reach a 3.5% share after a rebound of 4 tenths and Collective Investment Institutions, insurance and other non-banking financial institutions control 5.9% of total listed shares, the same percentage as a year ago.</p>
<p>You can find the report at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bolsasymercados.es/docs/BME/docsSubidos/Estudios-Articulos/BME-Report-Ownership-Listed-Spanish-Stock-2023.pdf?v=0ZqCLg!!">the following link</a>.</p>

<div> platform, data, Tradeverse, harmonization, AI 
<br />
Summary: Tradeverse, a data platform by Broadridge, harmonizes multi-asset class data, ensures data integrity, and enables AI initiatives for trading firms. It enhances efficiency and productivity. <div>
<p>The launch of Tradeverse, a new data platform by global Fintech leader&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.broadridge.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Broadridge Financial Solutions</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span>Inc. (NYSE: BR), will help trading firms eliminate data silos, unleash the potential of their data across the enterprise and better manage costs, reconciliation, and the data quality and lineage challenges of firms typical complex platform ecosystems.</p>
<p>Tradeverse consolidates real-time, multi-asset class data from multiple vendor applications and platforms from orders and executions through settlement into a unified, harmonized data platform. It reduces errors, simplifies access with a common data ontology across front, middle and back office and incorporates robust security to protect sensitive information and maintain data integrity. The clear data structure unlocks insights for all key functions &ndash; trading desks, operations, risk, finance, and regulatory - by providing a trusted and transparent data source.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;A Tradeverse implementation we&rsquo;ve recently completed with a global bank is proving the power of harmonizing trade data&rdquo;&nbsp;</i>said&nbsp;<b>Hugh Daly, Head of Data and AI, Capital Markets, Broadridge</b>.&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;The solution delivers efficiencies for their regulatory reporting and compliance teams, allowing direct access to the data for business users initiating complex searches using natural language.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Many enterprise data warehouse projects fail to deliver the expected benefits due to the complexity arising from disparate representations of the source data. Tradeverse is focused on ensuring true data harmonization. The application of business logic and constraint of the data ontology is critical to that. This leads to seamless access to high quality data, which ultimately accelerates time-to-value for multiple AI initiatives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In another use case, the Securities Operations team of a top ten capital markets firm is using Tradeverse&rsquo;s harmonized data platform coupled with Broadridge&rsquo;s Generative AI tool for Operations (<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.broadridge.com/financial-services/capital-markets/transform-trade-life-cycle/opsgpt" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OpsGPT</a>) to empower users.&nbsp; This is allowing the teams to identify and implement productivity gains such as settlement fails analysis that were previously incredibly hard to capture in a fragmented ecosystem.</p>

<div> Singapore, Asia, finance, regulations, growth
Summary:
Collaboration, Rapid Response, Alliance, Flexibility, Technology are key to upholding market integrity in Asia's growing financial landscape. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Wilson and Kyle, for inviting me to speak at this event. It's a pleasure to be back in Singapore where I began the Asian phase of my career almost exactly 25 years ago in September 1999. Somewhat distressingly, I am told kids today refer to this as the late 1900s.</p>
<p>Also, congratulations to the Singaporeans on your country&rsquo;s 59th anniversary. I&rsquo;m sure you all share my gratification in seeing the economic miracle the city-state has achieved, and that also epitomises the impressive progress of Asia as a whole in the past decades. Indeed, both Singapore and Hong Kong have grown together as closer partners and also as leading financial hubs in the region. Core to our success is a shared belief in the rule of law, which translates into a robust regulatory framework and a market of integrity in finance. These elements are vital to sustaining Asia&rsquo;s remarkable growth and attracting investments much needed to power an even brighter future for Asia.</p>
<p>This year also marks the 35th anniversary of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC). Under our four strategic priorities for 2024-2026, we commit ourselves to bolstering market resilience, global competitiveness, financial innovation, and operational efficiency. For the Enforcement Division which I lead, our primary goal to uphold market integrity is certainly critical to a resilient and competitive market.</p>
<p>Achieving this goal is increasingly challenging. Technological advancements and global connectivity mean we are facing far more sophisticated financial crimes and have to swiftly adapt. In this context, I&rsquo;ll share with you how we &ldquo;CRAFT&rdquo; our strategies through: Collaboration, Rapid Response, Alliance, Flexibility and Technology.</p>

<br /><br />Summary: 
Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) launches indices for Australian RMBS market, providing benchmarks for tracking RMBS performance and supporting investment strategies. <div>

<p>These indices, which are administered by ICE Data Indices, LLC, are accessible in ICE&rsquo;s Custom Index Tool, which provides a variety of ways to prototype and back test strategies for multiple use cases, including research, benchmark construction, designing new financial products such as ETFs or enabling services such as direct indexing.</p>
<p>This new suite of indices is designed to provide comprehensive and transparent benchmarks for tracking the performance of AUD-denominated residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS). The new index family includes:</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li><span>ICE Australian RMBS Composite Index (ARMBS).</span>&nbsp;Tracks the performance of RMBS.</li>
<li><span>ICE AAA Australian RMBS Index (ARMBSAAA).</span>&nbsp;Tracks the performance of RMBS rated AAA.</li>

<p>Each index is market cap weighted, accrues interest assuming next-day settlement, retains cash flows from bond payments until the end of the month, and is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These indices provide a new set of benchmarking options for customers investing in the Australian residential MBS market,&rdquo; said Varun Pawar, Chief Product Officer at ICE Data Services. &ldquo;As we continue to expand our diverse set of indexing and benchmarking solutions, this launch represents a significant advancement in providing greater transparency and performance evaluation for markets globally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Despite ongoing global economic uncertainty, the Australian residential MBS market has demonstrated impressive resilience and a promising outlook for growth and new issuance," said Magnus Cattan, Head of APAC Client Development at ICE Data Services. "With the introduction of these new indices, we look forward to supporting our clients across the global fixed income ecosystem and enhancing their investment strategies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Australian RMBS index family leverages ICE&rsquo;s extensive experience in fixed income pricing and reference data, and the companies deep global product coverage.

<div> collaboration, financial literacy, SET, NSF, SLF
<br /><br />Summary: 
The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) renews collaboration with NSF and SLF to promote financial literacy and planning for various target groups. <div>
<p>The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) has renewed a Memorandum of Understanding with the National Savings Fund (NSF) and the Student Loan Fund (SLF), marking the 7th consecutive year of collaboration to promote financial planning knowledge. This initiative aims to enhance learning in the digital era, helping Thais achieve financial well-being across various target groups. The financial literacy content, available both online and offline, is expected to reach over 2.5 million members of NSF and SLF nationwide annually.</p>
<p><b>SET Senior Executive Vice President Soraphol Tulayasathien</b> highlighted that Thailand is currently facing various financial challenges, including rising household debt levels and the transition to a super-aged society. Most Thais are encountering the problem of aging before achieving financial stability, leaving them with insufficient funds to live during retirement. SET is accelerating its efforts to promote financial literacy, a crucial skill for building financial security for all ages. This aligns with SET's strategic plan and its 50th-anniversary concept of &ldquo;Make it Work for Every Future." SET has modernized financial and investment knowledge resources, including the SET e-Learning platform, which offers diverse courses tailored to individual needs in line with new learning paradigms. In collaboration with partners, SET aims to deliver this knowledge to various target groups, ultimately improving Thai people&rsquo;s long-term financial stability and quality of life.</p>
<p>SET has recently renewed the MOU with NSF and SLF to promote financial literacy, marking the 7th consecutive year of this collaboration. This four-year MOU aims to expand financial knowledge to people from all walks of life, including students, working professionals, informal workers, freelancers, and the general public. The initiative seeks to foster financial literacy, enabling individuals to manage debt effectively, design appropriate savings plans, and ensure adequate pensions for retirement.</p>
<p><b>NSF Secretary-General Jaruluk Ruangsuwan</b> emphasized that NSF is driving the promotion of financial and investment literacy, as well as fostering social sustainability by establishing basic pension security for the future. NSF also advances learning in the new digital era, enabling Thai people to achieve financial well-being. This aligns with NSF's vision of building a foundation for savings and driving comprehensive pension schemes for the public sector. At present, NSF has 2.6 million members<b>.</b></p>
<p>The collaboration between SET and NSF, which began in 2018, has successfully enhanced public understanding of financial planning, strengthened financial stability, and created healthy financial practices, ensuring quality retirement through savings with NSF. Building on this success, SET and NSF have renewed the MOU to continue joint efforts in promoting financial planning for Thais and enhancing understanding of financial management, particularly retirement planning, to ensure sustainability and efficiency moving forward."</p>
<p><b>SLF Manager Chainarong Kajchapanan</b> said that SLF is dedicated to promoting knowledge and various skills to increase educational opportunities for Thai youth, especially in financial literacy essential for everyone. This initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance and value of student loans and foster responsibility in loan repayment.</p>
<p>SLF and SET have maintained a strong partnership for seven years since 2018. Currently, there are 71 SET e-Learning courses provided to SLF targets covering financial planning, investment, and entrepreneurship. These courses are available free of charge, allowing loan borrowers to accumulate public service hours as required by the Fund. The program has seen remarkable success, with a cumulative enrollment of over 10 million, showing significant year-on-year growth.</p>
<p>The Fund expects all borrowers to gain financial knowledge to manage their income, assets, and liabilities appropriately. This knowledge will be beneficial in preparing for and creating additional opportunities for their future. Moreover, it will enable them to repay their loans on schedule, ensuring a revolving fund that can continue to provide educational opportunities for future generations.</p>
<p>This collaboration between the two organizations builds upon previous successes by strengthening financial literacy among Thai youth. This initiative is crucial in developing a capable workforce that will play a vital role in the country's future development.</p>
<p class="p1">SET has been determined to drive financial and investment knowledge for the public for over two decades, collaborating with both public and private sector partners. Initiatives include the "Happy Money, Happy Young Old" project, the "Happy Money, Financial Mentor" program, and various online resources such as articles, video clips, and infographics. Moreover, SET e-Learning courses cover financial planning, debt management, retirement planning, and investment.

<div> harmonises, transmission system operators, capacity allocation mechanisms, network code, ACER<br />
Summary:<br />
The Capacity Allocation Mechanisms Network Code (CAM NC) is being revised to address the evolving gas market and decarbonisation goals in Europe. ACER will hold a final public consultation and make recommendations to the Commission for the updated text of the network code. <div>
<p>The Capacity Allocation Mechanisms Network Code (<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsFBFcGBVlTUEwPVwIBHVZbDQYdClgDBBoCXQJUAwEFA1BQUlAdWFdWB10ABgcdV10AVx0GCAJfGgxWAwAZBQ0AAwlQVVAHU1NXRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CAM NC</a>) harmonises how Transmission System Operators (TSOs) offer and allocate available gas transmission pipeline capacity to network users. With Europe&rsquo;s decarbonisation goals and the evolving gas market, the network code, last amended in 2017, now needs to be updated.</p>

<title>Cboe Europe Secures Support Of Key Participants For Launch Of Cboe BIDS VWAP-X Service</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Exchange, Cboe BIDS VWAP-X, liquidity, European equities, participants
Summary:<br /> Cboe Europe announces BIDS VWAP-X service with support from major participants, offering trajectory crossing for European equities. Scheduled to launch October 21. <div>
<p>Cboe Europe, the largest pan-European stock exchange<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;and a division of Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe: CBOE), today announces that it has secured the support of a broad range of participants for Cboe BIDS VWAP-X, its new trading service allowing participants to source and match liquidity at a forward benchmark price. This service is scheduled to launch on October 21, subject to regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>Early adopters of the Cboe BIDS VWAP-X service include Bernstein, BNP Paribas, BMO Capital Markets, Instinet Europe, Jefferies, KCx and Virtu Financial.</p>
<p>Natan Tiefenbrun, President, North American and European Equities, Cboe Global Markets, said: "We are delighted to have secured such a strong group of initial Participants to support Cboe BIDS VWAP-X and are in active discussions with numerous others who are looking to utilise this service at the earliest opportunity. This demonstrates that we've listened to our Participants to meet their needs for an exchange-regulated crossing platform to execute participative volume at an interval-based price. We're excited to be bringing this first-of-its-kind service to the European equities market and help enhance execution outcomes for end investors."</p>
<p>Eric Stockland, Co-Head of Global Electronic Trading, BMO Capital Markets, said: "Trajectory crossing in EMEA is a major development for the institutional investor because it helps minimise tracking error to benchmark performance and helps mitigate adverse selection faced on other multilateral trading facilities (MTFs) and liquidity pools."</p>
<p>Brian Gallagher, Head of Equity Execution, BNP Paribas, said: "We support innovation in the European market, and we will embrace it when it complements BNP Paribas's liquidity access and enriches our clients' execution experience".</p>
<p>Salvador Rodriguez, EMEA Head of Global Execution Services, Instinet Europe Limited, said: "Benchmark Crossing offers an encouraging innovation in Equity Market Structure in EMEA that should improve the ability for algos to find high quality counterpart liquidity. The approach and implementation should allow for agency algos to trade versus multiple benchmarks at a fair price with a good balance of simplicity, as well as allowing more complex control features based on differing client interaction requirements."</p>
<p>Ben Springett, Head of Electronic and Program Trading, EMEA, Jefferies, said: "Jefferies welcome this innovation enabling us to provide incremental liquidity opportunities to our client base. VWAP crossing mechanisms can unlock liquidity that otherwise wouldn't necessarily meet on a multilateral venue, utilising a mechanism that we have seen prove beneficial for algo performance on a range of benchmarks."</p>
<p>Chris McConville, Global Head of Execution Services and Trading at KCx, said: "KCx welcomes this innovation to the European market. We believe trajectory crossing is a positive disruption to the marketplace and could provide incremental liquidity to our client base."</p>
<p>James Osborne, Global Head of Algorithmic Development, Virtu Financial, said: "Trajectory crossing is more than just a useful feature for VWAP algorithms - it's a unique matching mechanism that can benefit many trading algorithms when utilised in conjunction with target benchmarks. Many of Virtu's US algorithms already leverage elements of trajectory crossing to enhance performance and we look forward to extending the same benefits to our European algorithms with the launch of Cboe BIDS VWAP-X."</p>
<p>As previously announced, Cboe BIDS VWAP-X is a first-of-its-kind, exchange-operated trajectory crossing service for European equities, which allows participants to source and match liquidity at a forward benchmark price. It is being provided as a service of Cboe BIDS Europe, the region's largest block trading platform<sup>2</sup>, utilising BIDS' proven conditional trade negotiation and execution workflow to match orders based on a standard, exchange-regulated volume weighted average price (VWAP) methodology.</p>
<p>Cboe BIDS VWAP-X will allow market participants to submit conditional VWAP indications of interest (IOIs) into the service. Once a potential match is found, firms will be invited to firm-up their IOIs, and after eligible order quantities are matched a standard matching cycle will take place to calculate the interval-VWAP trade price. Trades will be reported as off-book, on-exchange executions in real-time, allowing them to be centrally cleared through Cboe Europe's interoperable clearing model.</p>
<p>The service will benefit from BIDS' established protections against information leakage surrounding IOIs, including disclosure and interactions controlled by customisable tools and counterparty score-carding and filtering based on past trading behaviour.</p>
<p>At launch, the service will be accessible by sell side participants through FIX connectivity. Customer testing is already underway ahead of a planned launch on October 21, subject to regulatory approvals.</p>

<div> workshop, audit quality, financial reporting, enforcement, surveillance 
Summary: The AARG and FSSG workshop focused on audit quality, financial reporting compliance, enforcement, and surveillance strategies with ASEAN regulators and industry leaders. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The ASEAN Audit Regulators Group (AARG) and Financial Statements Surveillance Group (FSSG) recently held a workshop hosted by the Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) to strengthen audit quality and financial reporting compliance in the region.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The event brought together regulators and industry leaders from Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines.</p>
<p>As part of ongoing efforts by ASEAN members of the International Forum of Independent Audit Regulators (IFIAR), the workshop served as a platform for collaboration and knowledge sharing.</p>
<p>Participants discussed key regulatory issues including the implementation of the new International Standard on Quality Management (ISQM) requirements affecting audit firms and approaches to ISQM 1 reviews across ASEAN.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A unique aspect of the workshop was the focus on enforcement and communication strategies, building on efforts to drive impactful enforcement of audit regulations. The AARG also had discussions with the regional leadership of three global network audit firms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FSSG workshop addressed the importance of consistency in financial reporting. This is a common challenge for regulators in today&rsquo;s globalised financial markets as consistent reporting helps to ensure more accurate assessments of the financial statements. Consistent financial reporting also eases comparability within a company over time and across different companies, industries, and jurisdictions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The workshop further explored effective surveillance strategies and approaches, including greater technology integration.</p>
<p>The audit and surveillance regulators reaffirmed the importance of compliance with financial reporting regulations in promoting market integrity and enhancing investor protection.</p>

<br />
The SFC published new guides for licensing professionals, updated guides for Mainland practitioners, and plans to organize workshops for industry understanding.
<br /><br />Summary: <br />The SFC published new licensing guides, updated guides for Mainland practitioners, and plans to organize industry workshops. <div>
<p>The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) today published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/Regulatory-functions/Intermediaries/Licensing/Quick-licensing-guide" target="_blank">two new quick reference guides</a>&nbsp;to assist visiting and returning professionals in understanding the SFC's pragmatic licensing regime, complementing the five popular quick reference guides published in 2023 (Note 1).</p>
<p>Illustrating with case studies, the two new guides offer useful information about licensing options and processes as well as various conditions for examination exemptions, in order to facilitate a smooth and compliant transition to the Hong Kong financial markets for these professionals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We see a growing trend of financial talents coming to Hong Kong and we offer a pragmatic licensing regime to accommodate such demand,&rdquo; said Dr Eric Yip, the SFC&rsquo;s Executive Director of Intermediaries. &ldquo;While the first series was very well received, these new handy guides should help industry practitioners and potential applicants better grasp the essence of the SFC&rsquo;s expectations and licensing requirements with an aim to continuously strengthen Hong Kong&rsquo;s pool of financial talents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SFC plans to organise workshops later this year to help the industry better understand its licensing policies and recent initiatives.</p>
<p>Additionally, the SFC has updated the Chinese version of the quick reference guide for Mainland practitioners (Note 2) and released a new English version.</p>
<p>These quick reference guides can be accessed on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/Regulatory-functions/Intermediaries/Licensing/Quick-licensing-guide" target="_blank">the SFC website</a>, and prospective licence applicants are encouraged to contact the SFC at licensing@sfc.hk for further assistance.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>The SFC published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/Regulatory-functions/Intermediaries/Licensing/Quick-licensing-guide" target="_blank">quick reference guides</a>&nbsp;to licensing and competence requirements for family offices, private equity firms, hedge fund managers and overseas and Mainland practitioners in March 2023. More than 32,000 copies of quick reference guides have been distributed, downloaded or viewed since then.</li>
<li>The Chinese version of the SFC&rsquo;s quick reference guide to competence requirements for Mainland practitioners was first published in March 2023.</li>

<div> Amendments, Liquidity Provider, Qatar Stock Exchange, Market Efficiency, Dividend Distribution
Summary:<br />
QSE introduces new criteria for liquidity providers, aiming to boost liquidity, market efficiency, and investor confidence. Additionally, dividend regulations enhance market attractiveness. 
Summary: <div>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>On the occasion of the commencement of the new amendments to the Liquidity Provider (LP) Scheme, particularly concerning the performance evaluation criteria for liquidity providers, Qatar Stock Exchange (QSE) announces the inclusion of all these amendments and new criteria in the standardized and approved contracts for this activity, effective from today, Sunday, September 1, 2024. These criteria will be reviewed on a semi-annual basis to ensure their alignment with international best practices and market needs.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>These amendments are part of a package of incentives offered by Qatar Stock Exchange to develop the liquidity provider activity in the Qatari market, contributing to increased liquidity and trading, attracting more investors, and enhancing the competitiveness of the Qatari market. This development is part of the ongoing efforts of the Qatar Financial Markets Authority and Qatar Stock Exchange to improve market efficiency and increase its appeal to both local and international investors, thereby contributing to the sustainable growth of the Qatari market.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>It is worth noting that a liquidity provider is a licensed financial services company authorized to engage in liquidity provision activities, which enhance the liquidity of listed securities by continuously offering buy or sell prices for a specific security, in accordance with the terms and conditions outlined in the agreement between the liquidity provider and the listed company.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The introduction of the revised Liquidity Provider scheme is set to significantly lower liquidity costs and provide more depth in the order book, ensuring a more efficient, stable and transparent trading environment.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>As part of the aforementioned incentive package, the Qatar Financial Markets Authority recently introduced regulations for dividend distribution for listed joint-stock companies, allowing them to distribute interim dividends. In light of this step, some listed companies distributed semi-annual dividends in 2024. This important step enhances the attractiveness of the Qatari market by providing shareholders with more frequent returns on their investments, thereby increasing investor confidence and boosting trading activity in the market.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Interim dividends provide a steady return on investment before the company&rsquo;s final year-end dividend, offering investors regular income and a more predictable cash flow. This approach not only boosts investor confidence but also encourages long-term commitment to the market, fostering greater market participation and liquidity.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>QSE is continuously working on developing investment tools by launching various initiatives that align with market needs and international best practices. As part of its strategy, the exchange is committed to enhancing market efficiency, transparency, accessibility, and ensuring a better trading experience for all market participants.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span>FINRA has filed new amendments to proposed FINRA Rule 12800(g)(1). Proposed Rule 12800(g)(1)(A) would provide that Document Production Lists apply to arbitrations in which the customer requests an Option One hearing. Also, proposed Rule 12800(g)(1)(B) would provide that such would not apply to arbitrations in which the customer requests no hearing or an Option Two special proceeding, unless the customer requests that the Document Production Lists apply to all parties.</span><br /><br /><span>Please refer to the following Regulatory Circulars for more information on the amendments:</span></p>
