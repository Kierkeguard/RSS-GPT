This new digital marketplace will serve as the central hub for all JSE data products and services.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span>The launch of the Marketplace is a major milestone in the JSE&rsquo;s digital growth journey. The bourse has digitised client contracting for index agreements and introduced Trade Explorer for member analytics services. With its core data now cloud-hosted, the JSE is gearing up to launch a virtual storefront that allows clients to easily purchase data online.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span>By leveraging DataBP's advanced platform, the Marketplace will simplify client onboarding, streamline product development and automate data access entitlements and billing processes. The new data Marketplace will enable customers and redistributors to access a wide range of products efficiently. Additionally, the platform will host third-party content and analytics services, enhancing the value of the JSE&rsquo;s proprietary data and expanding the distribution capabilities of the cloud marketplace.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span>&ldquo;DataBP is excited to provide our cloud data marketplace solution to our partners at JSE,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<strong>Mark Schaedel, CEO of DataBP</strong>. &ldquo;JSE has developed a comprehensive cloud distribution platform with the intent of integrating all of its commercial information services under this cloud marketplace. Together we have developed a dynamic product catalog and order configuration process which integrates with data licensing and automated data access. We are proud to partner with clients who are combining content and cloud services to unlock value for their customers and drive product innovation. At DataBP, we are committed to leveraging cloud-native technologies to streamline commercial market data practices. We look forward to continuing our partnership with JSE and supporting their success in the marketplace.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p align="left"><span><strong>Mark Randall, Director of Information Services at the JSE</strong>, emphasised the strategic importance of this initiative. &ldquo;Migrating data offerings to the cloud is a key part of JSE&rsquo;s Information and Communications Technology (ICT) strategy. It not only reduces infrastructure costs but also increases flexibility,&rdquo; said Randall. &ldquo;This offering marks the successful completion of the first phase of our market data modernisation strategy. Ultimately, the JSE aims to leverage cloud services to provide clients with analytics and insights, rather than just raw data.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p align="left"><span>In support of this effort, the JSE also provides real-time market data, historical data, analytical tools and indices, hence playing an essential role in ensuring the overall integrity and efficacy of the market. By embracing technological advancements and maintaining a strong focus on regulatory compliance, customer support and data, the JSE reaffirms its position as a centre of innovation for financial markets on the African continent.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span>This holistic approach not only enhances the JSE&rsquo;s service offerings but also contributes to the overall health and transparency of the financial landscape. As part of the JSE&rsquo;s next phase of growth, this collaboration and the launch of the cloud marketplace is a strategic move that underscores its commitment to leveraging technology for market enhancement. By introducing the cloud marketplace, the JSE is not only improving the scalability, reliability and efficacy of its data products but also positions itself at the forefront of market innovation. This step is a testament to the JSE&rsquo;s dedication to providing world-class products and services.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span>The integration of cloud technology is set to redefine the landscape of data services in the financial sector, with JSE and DataBP at the forefront of this transformation.</span></p>

In addition, they will announce the results of a surveillance into how superannuation funds handle death benefits claims. <div>
<p>ASIC today released its&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-794-asic-enforcement-and-regulatory-update-january-to-june-2024/" title="REP 794 ASIC enforcement and regulatory update: January to June 2024">Enforcement and regulatory update</a>&nbsp;(1 January to 30 June 2024), which sets out recent outcomes in enforcement and regulation.</p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority Cancels Rockfort Markets’ Derivative Issuer Licence Following High Court Appeal</title>

<div> cancelled, Rockfort Markets Limited, derivative issuer licence, contravened licence obligations, FMA

Summary:<br>Rockfort Markets Limited's derivative issuer licence was cancelled by FMA due to multiple, material contraventions of licence obligations. Rockfort failed to comply. <div>
<p>The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash;&nbsp;has cancelled Rockfort Markets Limited&rsquo;s1&nbsp;(Rockfort) Derivative Issuer (DI) licence. The cancellation took place on 19 July 2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA initially decided to cancel Rockfort&rsquo;s licence in March 2023 because it was satisfied Rockfort materially contravened its licence obligations. Rockfort appealed the FMA&rsquo;s decision to the High Court and obtained orders preventing publication of any information relating to the case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rockfort argued it only breached four of its licence obligations, that the breaches were not material, that the FMA was wrong to find it no longer met the requirements for a licence, and that a more lenient regulatory response would have been sufficient to deal with its non-compliance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Justice Edwards dismissed Rockfort&rsquo;s appeal on the above points in November 2023. Rockfort appealed the High Court judgment to the Court of Appeal and the non-publication order remained in place; however, it has now discontinued its appeal and the FMA can publish the case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Reasons for cancellation&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Rockfort&rsquo;s licence was cancelled because the FMA was satisfied Rockfort materially contravened eight of its licence obligations. They included, but were not limited to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Failure to comply with a Direction Order issued to Rockfort on 3 March 2021.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Failure to maintain adequate and effective systems, policies, processes, and controls to ensure compliance with its obligations under the standard conditions of its licence (including in relation to its advertising) in an effective manner.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Failure to maintain the same or better standard of capability, governance, and compliance as was the case when the FMA assessed Rockfort's initial licensee application.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Rockfort&rsquo;s product disclosure statement did not contain mandatory information relating to hedging counterparties.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The FMA found that Rockfort was no longer capable of effectively performing the role of a DI. The FMA also had reason to believe that Rockfort would be likely to contravene its market service obligations in the future.</p>
<p>The FMA engaged with Rockfort in 2019 and 2020 in relation to potentially false or misleading advertising. On both occasions Rockfort did not fully comply with the FMA&rsquo;s requests to remove the advertising. In March 2021, the FMA ordered Rockfort to remove what it considered to be false or misleading advertising on its website. The advertising in question suggested Rockfort was licenced to provide forex and share broking activities when those were not covered by its licence. The FMA subsequently found the advertising remained on Rockfort&rsquo;s website in August 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FMA General Counsel, Liam Mason, said: &ldquo;Removing a market licence is one of our most significant interventions. In this instance, due to the serious and widespread nature of the contraventions, Rockfort&rsquo;s compliance history, and the fact the FMA failed to see any improvement following our earlier actions, the FMA believes that Rockfort is not fit to hold a licence. Cancelling Rockfort&rsquo;s licence is an appropriate and proportionate response to the multiple, material contraventions of its licence obligations.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA imposed additional specific conditions and requested Rockfort close out the few remaining open derivatives contracts it had with customers ahead of the licence cancellation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notes&nbsp;</p>
<p><sup>1</sup>Rockfort Markets changed its trading name to RockGlobal on 15 May 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rockfort was issued a DI licence by the FMA in 2018. The FMA cancelled Rockfort&rsquo;s licence under section 414(3) of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013.&nbsp;</p>

<title>SEC Charges Esmark Inc. And Chairman James Bouchard With Announcing False Tender Offer To Purchase U.S. Steel Corp.</title>

<div> charges, Esmark Inc., James P. Bouchard, tender offer, Securities and Exchange Commission
Summary:<br />SEC settled charges against Esmark Inc. and James P. Bouchard for falsely announcing a tender offer for U.S. Steel. They agreed to pay civil penalties. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against Esmark Inc. and its founder, chairman, and former CEO, James P. Bouchard, for publicly announcing a tender offer to purchase U.S. Steel Corporation for $35 per share even though Esmark lacked the financial means to consummate the offer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, on Aug. 14, 2023, at Bouchard&rsquo;s direction and approval, Esmark announced an offer for all issued and outstanding shares of U.S. Steel for $35 per share, which would have required $7.8 billion in cash to complete. The following day, Bouchard appeared on a cable news program and said that Esmark had $10 billion available in cash committed to the deal and would not put up any of Esmark&rsquo;s assets as collateral. The order finds that these statements were false because Esmark did not have the $7.8 billion in cash required to complete the purchase of U.S. Steel, and, therefore, Esmark and Bouchard did not have a reasonable belief that they would have the means to purchase the securities needed to complete the announced tender offer for U.S. Steel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bouchard and Esmark could not have completed the tender offer for U.S. Steel that they announced,&rdquo; said Antonia M. Apps, Director of the New York Regional Office. &ldquo;Investors should be able to trust companies&rsquo; and executives&rsquo; public statements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that Esmark and Bouchard violated Section 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 14e-8 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, Esmark and Bouchard agreed to cease and desist from committing or causing any future violations of these provisions and to pay civil penalties of $500,000 and $100,000 respectively.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Alicia Guo, Lindsay S. Moilanen, and George D. O&rsquo;Kane and was supervised by Thomas P. Smith, Jr. of the New York Regional Office.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<div> enhanced AR rules, principals, monitoring, review, FCA
Summary:<br />Principals must effectively monitor their Appointed Representatives, carrying out self-assessments, annual reviews, and using a range of checks. FCA will take swift action where standards not met. <div>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has set out good practice and areas for improvement to help principal firms effectively monitor their Appointed Representatives (ARs).</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>The findings follow a review of how principals are meeting its enhanced AR rules, introduced in December 2022. The analysis involved a telephone survey with 251 principals and in-depth assessments of documentation from 23 firms.</p>
<p>Examples of good practice from principals included keeping clear documentation to show compliance with the FCA&rsquo;s enhanced rules and using a broad range of checks and information to oversee and monitor ARs&rsquo; activities.</p>
<p>But the FCA found some firms were taking a tick-box approach to complying with its rules, relying on basic information like website checks, or using self-declarations from their ARs, to demonstrate effective oversight.</p>
<p>The review also found:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>1 in 5 principals had not carried out a required self-assessment or annual review of their ARs.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Approximately half of principals were not regularly reviewing their AR agreements.</li>
<li>A third of principals were not using data or management information to keep tabs on whether ARs were acting within the scope of AR agreements.</li>
<li>Most firms had not changed their AR onboarding or termination procedures since the rules were introduced.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Jane Savidge, Interim Head of Department for Appointed Representatives said</span>:</p>
<p>'Some firms have been embedding our rules well, but some aren&rsquo;t getting the basics right and are taking a &lsquo;bare minimum&rsquo; approach.</p>
<p>'Principals must have clear, written AR agreements from the outset and effectively monitor their ARs to make sure they act within scope.'</p>
<p>The FCA has followed up directly with firms in the review and will take swift action where it sees principals not meeting its standards in the future.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>

<div> Fed Chairman, U.S. Economy, Monetary Policy, Labor Market, Inflation<br />
Summary:<br />
Fed Chairman discusses the outlook for the U.S. economy and implications for monetary policy. He sees evidence of labor market softening and supports reducing the federal funds rate.<br /> <div>
<p>Thank you, Eric, and thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240906a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;My topic is the outlook for the U.S. economy and the implications for monetary policy, a set of judgements that have, of course, been influenced by this morning's jobs report. When I scheduled this speech several months ago, I knew it might be challenging to speak a few hours after the release of such an important piece of data. But we like to say that monetary policy must be nimble, so that means policymakers must be nimble also. Not&nbsp;<em>Simone Biles nimble</em>, but nimble. As you will hear, I believe the data we have received this week reinforces the view that there has been continued moderation in the labor market. In light of the considerable and ongoing progress toward the Federal Open Market Committee's 2 percent inflation goal, I believe that the balance of risks has shifted toward the employment side of our dual mandate, and that monetary policy needs to adjust accordingly.</p>
<p>Looking back at the economic data over the first six months of 2024, it portrayed an economy slowly cooling and not showing signs of significant weakening. The labor market had been gradually moderating for the past year or so, and although inflation rose in the first quarter, it then retreated in the second, and there was a widespread view heading into the second half of the year that the FOMC was on track to achieve a much desired but unusual "soft landing."</p>
<p>Then the July jobs report came in unexpectedly soft. Job creation slowed and the unemployment rate increased by two tenths of a percentage point to 4.3 percent, the highest since October 2021. There was speculation that weather-related issues might have distorted these results and, in fact, the unemployment rate ticked down in this morning's release. But, overall, the August report along with other recent labor data tend to confirm that there has been a continued moderation in the labor market.</p>
<p>The ups and downs in the data over time highlight what I consider the right approach to meeting the FOMC's dual mandate goals&mdash;I believe we should be data dependent, but not overreact to any data point, including the latest data. When we faced a period of banking instability in the spring of 2023, there were calls from some to stop rate hikes despite inflation still running over 5 percent. But there were other tools in hand to deal with that stress, monetary policy did not overreact, and the FOMC continued tightening policy. When inflation fell unexpectedly in the second half of last year, we did not overreact and immediately cut the policy rate. Then when inflation accelerated in the first quarter, we did not overreact and raise rates despite some calls to do so. I will be looking at these last two employment reports in combination with all other data as we head into the September FOMC meeting to decide the best stance of policy. I believe our patience over the past 18 months has served us well. But the current batch of data no longer requires patience, it requires action.</p>
<p>Today's jobs report continues the longer-term pattern of a softening of the labor market that is consistent with moderate growth in economic activity, the details of which I will get into in a moment. As I said at the outset, considering the progress we have made on getting inflation back to target, I believe that the balance of risks is now weighted more toward downside risks to the FOMC's maximum-employment mandate.</p>
<p>While the labor market has clearly cooled, based on the evidence I see, I do not believe the economy is in a recession or necessarily headed for one soon. The collective set of economic data indicates to me that the labor market and the economy are performing in a solid manner and the prospects for continued growth and job creation are good, with inflation near 2 percent. I continue to believe that this can occur without substantial harm to the labor market. But I also believe that maintaining the economy's forward momentum means that, as Chair Powell said recently, the time has come to begin reducing the target range for the federal funds rate.</p>
<p>In the rest of my remarks, I will lay out my reasons for believing that the economy and employment will likely keep growing as inflation moves toward 2 percent. The first of these is the large body of evidence that economic activity is continuing to grow at a solid pace. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at a 2.2 percent annual rate in the first half of this year and recent data indicates that growth is continuing at around this pace in the third quarter.</p>
<p>Retail sales were stronger than expected in July and showed that households continue to spend as their finances, in the aggregate, remain healthy. The increase was fairly broad based across goods categories. While many online retailers offered discounts last month, this was not a dominant factor in the solid results. Although manufacturing output fell in July and the August Institute for Supply Management manufacturing survey pointed to weak production and new orders, the similar survey for the larger, nonmanufacturing sector was consistent with a modest expansion of activity.</p>
<p>As for the labor market, on balance, the data that we have received in the past three days indicates to me that the labor market is continuing to soften but not deteriorate, and this judgement is important to our upcoming decision on monetary policy. As I said earlier, Wednesday's report on job openings in July was consistent with a moderating labor market. Meanwhile, the four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance has risen gradually since January but has changed little on net in the past two months, with initial claims remaining fairly low.</p>
<p>The jobs report for August, released this morning, supported the story of ongoing moderation in the labor market. After rising to 4.3 percent in July, the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.2 percent in August. Taking a longer perspective, the unemployment rate over the past 16 months has increased gradually but fairly steadily from 3.4 percent to 4.2 percent in today's release. Payrolls rose by 142,000 in August compared with 89,000 in July, leaving the three-month average payroll gain at 116,000, compared with the 267,000 average in the first quarter and 147,000 in the second. Accounting for revisions to the jobs numbers that we received in August, that level is a bit below what I see as the breakeven pace for job creation that absorbs new entrants to the workforce and keeps the unemployment rate constant.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240906a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a></p>
<p>July marked the first time that the three-month average unemployment rate has increased by at least a half of a percentage point above its 12-month low, which was 3.6 percent in July 2023. This breached a threshold established by the Sahm rule, which observes that when this has occurred in the past, it has been a reliable indicator of the economy entering a recession.</p>
<p>While this is a correlation that certainly bears attention, I want to make a few cautionary points about relying on such rules in deciding that a recession has begun. As we have seen in the recent past with other supposedly reliable recession rules, such as an inverted yield curve, there is more to forecasting economic outcomes than the relationships between a couple of variables.</p>
<p>First, these rules are nothing more than a mechanical, statistical description of past economic outcomes&mdash;they do not seek to explain what economic forces drive the relationship between the data, nor are they based on the totality of economic data. All recessions rules do is pick up a correlation between movements in economic data and the dates of recessions or other outcomes. A second point is that, setting aside the unusual circumstances of the 1981&ndash;82 recession, recessions occur when a major shock hits the economy.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240906a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;In the absence of a big negative shock, an inversion of the yield curve or a triggering of the Sahm rule doesn't necessarily mean we are entering a recession.</p>
<p>Third, recession rules typically pick up demand-driven recessions. But this is not why unemployment is rising now. GDP forecasts for the current quarter all show solid growth, labor market data show lay off rates are stable, and consumer spending is growing at a healthy rate. These data suggest demand is fairly strong. Instead, most of the increase in the unemployment rate is from workers entering the labor force and not finding jobs right away. So, the recent rise in the unemployment rate appears to be more of a supply-side-driven phenomenon, not demand driven.</p>
<p>And lastly, it should be clear to everyone that many pre-pandemic economic relationships have not proven to be good policy guides post-pandemic. Reliance on old lessons from inverted yield curves to predict a recession, a Phillips curve to predict inflation, or a flat Beveridge curve to predict the movement in the unemployment rate have all led to mistaken economic forecasts.</p>
<p>While I don't see the recent data pointing to a recession, I do see some downside risk to employment that I will be watching closely. But at this point, I believe there is substantial evidence that the economy retains the strength and momentum to keep growing, supported by an appropriate loosening of monetary policy.</p>
<p>Let me now turn to the outlook for inflation. With the labor market cooling, it doesn't surprise me that wage growth has slowed to a pace consistent with the FOMC's price-stability goal, and this is supporting ongoing progress toward that objective. The employment cost index grew at an annualized rate of 3.5 percent from March to June, and the 12-month change was 3.9 percent for private sector workers, the lowest since late 2021.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240906a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;Average hourly earnings, reported in today's jobs report, rose at a three-month annualized pace of 3.8 percent in August, the same as the 12-month change.</p>
<p>Inflation in July continued to show progress toward the FOMC's goal. The price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), the Committee's preferred inflation measure, increased at a monthly pace of 0.2 percent in July for both total and core PCE inflation. Core PCE inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is a good guide to underlying inflation, and it increased 2.7 percent over the past 12 months. Given the downward trajectory of monthly readings, I also look at the 6- and 3-month annualized rate. These stand at 2.6 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively. These numbers are good news and suggest that our restrictive policy stance has put us on the right path to attain our 2 percent inflation target.</p>
<p>Looking across the components of inflation, one can see the breadth of the disinflation. Over 50 percent of categories in the total and core market baskets had annualized monthly inflation less than 2.5 percent in August. In fact, the index of core goods prices has reverted to its historical pattern of slight deflation, reflecting normalized supply after the disruptions of the pandemic as well as ongoing technological and productivity advances. Meanwhile, services price inflation has slowed as wage growth has slowed, since labor is a large input for much of the service sector. Overall, I see significant and ongoing progress toward the FOMC's inflation goal that I expect will continue over the remainder of this year.</p>
<p>Now let me discuss the implications of this outlook for monetary policy. As I said at the outset, considering the achieved and continuing progress on inflation and moderation in the labor market, I believe the time has come to lower the target range for the federal funds rate at our upcoming meeting. Reducing the policy rate now is consistent with many versions of the Taylor rule, which suggest reducing the policy rate is appropriate given the data in hand.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I do not expect this first cut to be the last. With inflation and employment near our longer-run goals and the labor market moderating, it is likely that a series of reductions will be appropriate. I believe there is sufficient room to cut the policy rate and still remain somewhat restrictive to ensure inflation continues on the path to our 2 percent target.</p>
<p>Determining the appropriate pace at which to reduce policy restrictiveness will be challenging. Choosing a slower pace of rate cuts gives time to gradually assess whether the neutral rate has in fact risen, but at the risk of moving too slowly and putting the labor market at risk. Cutting the policy rate at a faster pace means a greater likelihood of achieving a soft landing but at the risk of overshooting on rate cuts if the neutral rate has in fact risen above its pre-pandemic level. This would cause an undesired loosening of monetary policy.</p>
<p>Determining the pace of rate cuts and ultimately the total reduction in the policy rate are decisions that lie in the future. As of today, I believe it is important to start the rate cutting process at our next meeting. If subsequent data show a significant deterioration in the labor market, the FOMC can act quickly and forcefully to adjust monetary policy. I am open-minded about the size and pace of cuts, which will be based on what the data tell us about the evolution of the economy, and not on any pre-conceived notion of how and when the Committee should act. If the data supports cuts at consecutive meetings, then I believe it will be appropriate to cut at consecutive meetings. If the data suggests the need for larger cuts, then I will support that as well. I was a big advocate of front-loading rate hikes when inflation accelerated in 2022, and I will be an advocate of front-loading rate cuts if that is appropriate. Those decisions will be determined by new data and how it adds to the totality of the data and shapes my understanding of economic conditions. While I expect that these cuts will be done carefully as the economy and employment continue to grow, in the context of stable inflation, I stand ready to act promptly to support the economy as needed.</p>

<p><a name="fn1"></a>1. The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn2"></a>2. The preliminary estimate of the annual benchmark revision to the establishment survey data, which was announced on August 21, suggests that payroll growth between April 2023 and March 2024 will likely be revised down early next year by about 68,000 per month on average. The implications for payroll growth beyond March are less clear.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn3"></a>3. The 1981&ndash;82 recession was triggered by tight monetary policy in an effort to fight mounting inflation. For more information about this recession, see&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/recession-of-1981-82">Federal Reserve History</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn4"></a>4. The employment cost index is a valuable measure of compensation growth because it covers non-wage benefits and accounts for shifts in the shares of workers in different occupations and industries.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tradeweb Markets Inc. (Nasdaq: TW), a leading, global operator of electronic marketplaces for rates, credit, equities and money markets, today reported record total trading volume for the month of August 2024 of $50.9 trillion (tn)<a href="https://www.tradeweb.com/newsroom/media-center/news-releases/tradeweb-reports-record-august-2024-total-trading-volume-of-$50.9-trillion-and-record-average-daily-volume-of-$2.21-trillion/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>[1]</span></a>. Average daily volume (ADV) for the month was a record $2.21tn, an increase of 53.9 percent (%) year-over-year (YoY).<a href="https://www.tradeweb.com/newsroom/media-center/news-releases/tradeweb-reports-record-august-2024-total-trading-volume-of-$50.9-trillion-and-record-average-daily-volume-of-$2.21-trillion/#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span>[2]</span></a>&nbsp;Excluding the impact of the ICD acquisition, which closed on August 1, 2024, total ADV for the month of August was up 35.7% YoY.</p>
<p>Tradeweb CEO Billy Hult said: "Our record volumes in August highlight the strength of Tradeweb&rsquo;s platform, which now includes ICD. The significant growth across our key markets, particularly in U.S. government bonds and global repurchase agreements, underscores the continued trust our clients place in us to deliver solutions that enhance transparency, efficiency, and innovation in our markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In August 2024, Tradeweb records included:</p>

<title>Nasdaq Implements AxiomSL Revenue Recognition Change</title>

<div> revenue, AxiomSL, accounting change, Nasdaq, growth outlook<br />
Summary:<br />
Nasdaq implements accounting change for AxiomSL revenues, recognizing 100% ratably over contract term. Reaffirms growth outlook and expectations for 2024.  <div>
<p align="left">Nasdaq, Inc.&nbsp;(Nasdaq: NDAQ) today announced that it has implemented a change to the accounting treatment of the revenues associated with AxiomSL on-premises subscription contracts. This change was previously referenced during Nasdaq&rsquo;s second quarter earnings and is related to the finalization of the&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP purchase accounting in connection with the Adenza acquisition.</p>
<p>The accounting change reflects the frequent and ongoing mandatory updates to AxiomSL&rsquo;s regulatory reporting software, which are critical to the utility and value of the product for its clients. Going forward, Nasdaq will recognize 100% of AxiomSL on-premises subscription revenue ratably over the contract term, whereas Adenza previously recognized approximately 50% of AxiomSL&rsquo;s total contract revenue upfront and the remainder over the contract term.</p>
<p>Beginning in the third quarter of 2024, Nasdaq's financial and operational results will reflect the new accounting treatment. In its third quarter 2024 results, Nasdaq will record a net&nbsp;$32 million&nbsp;one-time, non-cash GAAP revenue reduction for the period&nbsp;November 1, 2023&nbsp;through&nbsp;June 30, 2024, reflecting the net impact of the accounting change on AxiomSL subscription revenue since the close of the acquisition. This&nbsp;$32 million&nbsp;net reduction consists of a decrease of&nbsp;$34 million&nbsp;related to the November and&nbsp;December 2023&nbsp;periods, which will be excluded from our non-GAAP third quarter 2024 results, partially offset by a net increase of&nbsp;$2 million&nbsp;related to the January through&nbsp;June 2024&nbsp;period.</p>
<p>This change enhances Nasdaq&rsquo;s financial reporting, as AxiomSL&rsquo;s revenues will more closely align with the annualized recurring revenue (ARR) and cash economics of its on-premises subscription contracts. There are no changes to professional services revenues or to AxiomSL&rsquo;s cloud-delivered license revenues, which are already recognized as ratable over the life of the contract. This change also does not impact AxiomSL&rsquo;s historical ARR or cash flows.</p>
<p><span>2024 Expectations and Medium-Term Growth Outlook</span><br />Nasdaq reaffirms its medium-term growth outlook for all divisions, sub-divisions, and AxiomSL and Calypso combined. Nasdaq also reaffirms all 2024 expectations shared in its second quarter 2024 earnings call and expects the Regulatory Technology sub-division to grow within its medium-term revenue growth outlook range for full-year 2024. Nasdaq will provide additional details in the accompanying presentation and publicly announced conference call on this topic.</p>
<p><span>Conference Call</span><br />As previously announced, Nasdaq will host a conference call today,&nbsp;September 6, 2024, at&nbsp;8:00 AM ET&nbsp;to discuss this announcement in more detail. All participants can access the conference via webcast and related materials through the Nasdaq Investor Relations website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=PADs9mp1CYxmygjkTHh-dvOpZmg9dnYyqBlflCL_7UY9m6vLQR3fd1o1TBqP3lVXfcGQlhI39VJfjCftJprGJuLnpefJG0u3NHbEDIK_mhs=" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://ir.nasdaq.com/</a>.</p>

<div> Financial Advisers, St Martin's Partners LLP, FCA, Pension Transfer, Upper Tribunal <br />
The FCA banned and fined four individuals from SMP for providing risky pension transfer advice, disregarding customers' financial needs.<br /><br />Summary: The FCA banned and fined four individuals from SMP for providing risky pension transfer advice, disregarding customers' financial needs. <div>
<p><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<div class="copy-block__call-out">
<p><span>Mr Adrian Douglas, Mr Liam Martin and Mr Frank Oxberry have each referred their Decision Notices to the Upper Tribunal. The findings outlined in the Decision Notices given to them reflect the FCA&rsquo;s belief as to what occurred and how it considers their conduct should be characterised. The proposed action outlined in their Decision Notices will have no effect pending the determination of the references by the Tribunal whose decision will be made public on its website.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Tribunal will determine, in the case of the decision to impose a financial penalty what (if any) the appropriate action is for the FCA to take, and remit the matter to the FCA with such directions as the Tribunal considers appropriate and, in relation to the decision to make prohibition orders or a decision to withdraw approval, whether to dismiss the reference or remit it to the FCA with a direction to reconsider and reach a decision in accordance with the findings of the Tribunal.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Mr Alec Cuthbert agreed to settle the FCA&rsquo;s case against him and therefore has not made a reference to the Tribunal of our decision to take action. The Final Notice given to him has not been the subject of any judicial finding. It includes criticisms of Mr Oxberry who has been given a Decision Notice in relation to the same matter. As above, Mr Oxberry disputes his Decision Notice and has referred it to the Upper Tribunal for determination.</span></p>

<div class="container">
<p><span>The FCA has decided to ban 2 financial advisers and 2 partners at St Martin&rsquo;s Partners LLP (SMP) from working in financial services, and collectively fine them &pound;590,544. The regulator considers the 4 were responsible for a pension transfer advice model that put at risk people&rsquo;s guaranteed retirement benefits.</span></p>
<p><span>Between October 2015 and July 2016, SMP&rsquo;s advice model put 547 customers at significant risk of transferring out of guaranteed defined benefit pensions into investments which were unlikely to be suitable for them, including investments in hotel developments in Cape Verde offered by The Resort Group Plc.</span></p>
<p><span>Many of those customers were brought to SMP by &lsquo;introducer&rsquo; firms, including First Review Pension Services Ltd (FRPS), a subsidiary of The Resort Group. In the FCA&rsquo;s view, SMP had clear indications of the link between FRPS and The Resort Group.</span></p>
<p><span>SMP&rsquo;s advice model did not take into account the information required to assess the suitability of a pension transfer or how the benefits of the customer&rsquo;s existing scheme compared to the new investment. SMP did not intend it to.</span></p>
<p><span>Adrian Douglas and Liam Martin, both qualified pension advisers, played important roles in designing and operating the transfer advice model used at the Essex-based firm.</span></p>
<p><span>SMP&rsquo;s two partners, Mr Oxberry and Mr Cuthbert, had oversight of the firm and its advisers. They did not ensure that due diligence was carried out on either FRPS or at least 16 other introducer firms involved in the model.</span></p>
<p><span>A requirement was agreed in November 2016 that stopped SMP using the advice model.</span></p>
<p><span>Therese Chambers, Joint Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight, said:</span></p>
<p><span>'People need to be able to trust the advice they receive about their pensions. But these 4 individuals put SMP&rsquo;s customers in danger of giving up guaranteed retirement income for high-risk investments, like overseas hotel developments. They received significant financial benefit in doing so, at the expense of their customers.</span></p>
<p><span>'There was a reckless disregard for customers&rsquo; financial situation, their needs through retirement and how their existing benefits compared to the proposed alternative. It is right the FCA takes steps to prevent these people from working in the financial industry and impose penalties.'</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA has decided to fine Mr Oxberry &pound;241,869, Mr Martin &pound;128,356 and Mr Douglas &pound;128,356 and ban them from working in financial services. They have referred the FCA&rsquo;s decisions to the Tribunal.</span></p>
<p><span>Mr Cuthbert has been fined &pound;91,963 and banned from working in financial services. Mr Cuthbert agreed to settle his case and has not referred the FCA&rsquo;s decision to the Tribunal.</span></p>
<p><span>SMP is now in liquidation. To date, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) has paid over &pound;13.4m in compensation to SMP&rsquo;s clients as a result of losses suffered following advice they received.</span></p>

<li><span>Nasdaq Chief Strategy Officer,&nbsp;
Jeremy Skule, to Take on Expanded Role as Executive Chair of Nasdaq&rsquo;s Financial Crime Management Technology Business</span> </li>
</ul>
<p>Nasdaq (Nasdaq: NDAQ), today announced a new leadership structure including leadership appointment for its Financial Crime Management Technology business, designed to support the business&rsquo; strong momentum and continuing its growth trajectory.</p>
<p>Effective today,&nbsp;
Brendan Brothers, EVP, Head of Financial Crime Management Technology, and Verafin Co-Founder will step back from his current executive responsibilities and will transition into a senior strategic advisory role until at least&nbsp;December 31, 2024.</p>
<p>Coinciding with Brothers&rsquo; transition to an advisory role, Nasdaq will implement a new leadership structure for Financial Crime Management Technology with the establishment of an Executive Chair position.</p>
<p>
Stephanie Champion, current SVP and Head of Sales, will succeed Brothers as EVP and Head of Nasdaq Verafin, responsible for overseeing the business. A 13-year&nbsp;Verafin&nbsp;veteran, Champion brings a breadth of expertise across the anti-financial crime industry, a deep and robust client network, and a track record of growth and performance. Throughout her tenure, Champion has held several key leadership roles at Nasdaq Verafin, including as the head of the mid-market and enterprise business units, where she led the product, client onboarding and success, and sales teams. Most recently, Champion was responsible for the strategy supporting Nasdaq Verafin&rsquo;s growth in the upmarket client segment which has resulted in the signing of four Tier-1 and four Tier-2 bank clients in under 18 months. She has been instrumental in driving the business&rsquo; consistent, strong revenue growth over the past several years as the business continues to attract banks of all sizes to its unique, modern technology solutions to support their crime-fighting efforts.</p>
<p>
Jeremy Skule, EVP and Nasdaq Chief Strategy Officer will take on an additional responsibility as Executive Chair of Financial Crime Management Technology. In this expanded role, Skule will support the development of Nasdaq Verafin&rsquo;s strategic roadmap, including its global business expansion, as well as provide guidance to the Nasdaq Verafin leadership team and continue to advance its integration and cross-sell objectives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to express my sincere gratitude to Brendan for his numerous contributions to&nbsp;Verafin&nbsp;and his role as a driving force behind the company&rsquo;s founding through to its position today as the leading anti-financial crime platform,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>
Adena T. Friedman, Chair and Chief Executive Officer of Nasdaq</span>. &ldquo;I am very excited to appoint Stephanie and Jeremy in their new leadership roles. As the new Head of Nasdaq Verafin, Stephanie will be responsible for the business&rsquo; strategic and operational performance. She brings deep expertise and client relationships that she has developed over her 13 years in the business, as well as serving as a true culture carrier for the organization. Her leadership has been essential to the acceleration of our upmarket growth strategy. As Executive Chair, Jeremy will oversee the strategic direction of the business. He brings over a decade track record of strategic leadership and business expansion at Nasdaq, and I am confident their partnership best positions us to solve one of the financial system&rsquo;s largest, most complex challenges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am thrilled to take on the leadership role at such a pivotal and exciting time in Nasdaq Verafin&rsquo;s journey,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>
Stephanie Champion, EVP and Head of Nasdaq Verafin</span>. &ldquo;Being part of the wider Nasdaq platform has transformed our ability to drive sustained, scalable growth across the global market of financial institutions of all sizes. We continue to drive strong growth across the small- and medium-sized banking space while we make significant inroads into the Tier 1 and 2 segments. I look forward to the continued partnership with Jeremy and the wider Nasdaq Verafin leadership team as we capitalize on the opportunities ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Financial crime is a&nbsp;$3 trillion&nbsp;drag on the financial system &ndash; a major, global challenge and a problem that Nasdaq Verafin is uniquely placed to address,&rdquo; said&nbsp;
Jeremy Skule,&nbsp;<span>EVP, Chief Strategy Officer, and Executive Chair of Financial Crime Management Technology</span>. &ldquo;I am excited to take on this expanded role and look forward to continuing to work with the Nasdaq Verafin team to advance our leading solutions to help financial institutions eradicate financial crime from their networks.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span>Speaker</span>: Sarah Pritchard, executive director of markets and international<br /><span>Event</span>: The Capital Markets Industry Taskforce conference<br /><span>Delivered</span>: 6 September 2024<br /><br /></p>
<h2>Key messages</h2>
<ul>
<li>We are continuing with our ambitious package of reforms to strengthen the UK&rsquo;s position in global wholesale markets.</li>
<li>After undertaking the biggest change to the listing rules in over three decades, we followed up weeks later with a package of measures to further boost the UK&rsquo;s position as a global and vibrant financial centre.</li>
<li>Success isn't measured in days, weeks or months. Success is measured in the long-term economic growth of UK capital markets.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>In its first year, the Great North Run was advertised as a local fun run. It has now grown into one of the biggest races in the country.</p>
<p>On Sunday, 60,000 runners will make their way along the 13.1 mile route from Newcastle to South Shields. The more than &pound;25m it raises each year for charity relies on more than one person&rsquo;s half marathon on one particular day.</p>
<p>It relies on the collective thousands of hours in training. Analysing vast amounts of data on smart watches or on Strava. It's the interplay of individual performances in one competitive race.</p>
<p>Likewise for capital markets, it's not about one individual player. It&rsquo;s about the entire ecosystem coming together so participants can compete, grow and achieve the best results. And for the greater good of a thriving economy.</p>
<p>With your support, we continue to deliver on our ambitious programme of work to strengthen the UK&rsquo;s position in global wholesale markets.</p>
<p>While we have crossed many milestones, we are not finished yet. Like a long-distance runner attempting to complete the six major marathons across the world to receive the coveted six-star medal, we have many races to come.</p>
<h2>Listings reform</h2>
<p>Regulation has a role to play in making sure UK capital markets are race fit. That is why we have undertaken the biggest change to the listing rules in over three decades.&nbsp;<br /><br />It is now exactly 6 weeks since our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/FCA%20overhauls%20listing%20rules%20to%20boost%20growth%20and%20innovation%20on%20UK%20stock%20markets">new listing rules</a>&nbsp;became operational on 29 July.</p>
<p>Over the years the rules governing listed companies in the UK had grown in reach and complexity. With fewer people taking advantage of those complex rules.<br /><br />Taken as a package, and in light of market evolution, we were told that the regime created disproportionate burdens and restrictions on companies with ambitions to innovate and grow.</p>
<p>Some went so far as to say that listing in the UK was being lost as a consideration. The regime was just too complex with too many barriers. And in the low-interest rate environment, private equity markets were racing ahead. Maintaining the status quo wasn&rsquo;t an option if we wanted to reverse long-term decline. But it wasn&rsquo;t easy either.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we engaged extensively with all parts of the market to listen to all views. Our aim throughout was to start an inclusive and thorough debate to make sure all voices were heard.</p>
<p>We tried to build consensus as much as possible rather than compromise on everything. That can result in decisions no one supports.</p>
<p>And we sought consensus through a discussion on risk appetite &ndash; to inform the decisions we have now made which we hope will support capital markets for decades to come.</p>
<p>We looked at our regime holistically and determined that a change in philosophy was needed &ndash; moving towards a more disclosure-based regime, which puts the right information in the hands of investors so they can make their own decisions.</p>
<p>This is a better approach for modern markets. It recognises that investors make their own decisions, daily, on where, how and what to invest in.</p>
<p>We concluded that a 'one size fits all' regulator-prescribed approach, written in 2024, would not provide sufficient flexibility for the range of companies who may wish to list. And risks becoming out of date very quickly.</p>
<p>The new rules introduce a simplified regime that maintains high standards, one that is right for the UK, compares well internationally and one which we hope will help boost UK stock markets.</p>
<p>Companies listed in the UK will still be expected to uphold high standards regarding disclosure and corporate governance. And shareholders retain the ability to exercise good stewardship to influence company behaviour and hold the management of the companies they co-own to account.<br /><br />These remain important and longstanding pillars of the UK markets. We want investors in UK listed markets to have access to timely and appropriate disclosures to make informed investment choices, in a more diverse market of opportunities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have been clear from the outset that these changes will shift the dial on risk, but we made this choice in recognition that capital markets are increasingly international. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The investor base has evolved and become more global. UK investors are investing in jurisdictions where they see competitive companies with the promise of attractive returns, and where the frictions we have now removed do not exist. Companies are operating and going public across borders. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Put simply, companies raising capital and investors deploying it have global choices. We want them to choose the UK.</p>
<p>We want to support investors to make their own choices too about the companies they invest in, through timely and appropriate disclosures. And we want to show the regulatory dynamism, which some wags may say is a somewhat oxymoronic phrase, that one commentator credited us with recently. We&rsquo;ve come a long way and as you know the journey isn't over yet.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Public offers and admissions to trading regime&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Just like Sifan Hassan competing for the 5,000m, 10,000m and the marathon at the Paris Olympics, we have not stood still. She continually raised her own bar and ran all three courses in the same week, including the hardest Olympic marathon ever.</p>
<p>Indeed, step by step we continue to run at pace to support the whole ecosystem of the UK&rsquo;s capital markets.</p>
<p>Just 2 weeks after we confirmed the listing rules reform, we set out proposals for a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/consultation-papers/cp24-12-consultation-new-public-offers-admission-trading-regulations-regime-poatrs" title="CP24/12: Consultation on the new Public Offers and Admission to Trading Regulations regime (POATRs) ">new public offers and admissions to trading regime</a>, to make it cheaper and easier for companies to raise money in the UK.</p>
<p>We progressed this work in tandem because we know the importance of making sure the whole markets ecosystem works. Our proposals were informed by close engagement with the markets.</p>
<p>As part of the process, we set up brand new ways of working through bitesize &lsquo;Engagement Papers&rsquo; (or &lsquo;EPs&rsquo;). Not just because we love acronyms at the FCA, but because we were keen to work differently to solicit views early and openly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are proposing more proportionate rules on the disclosures companies are required to make when they seek to admit securities to a regulated market.&nbsp;While we intend to retain prospectus for initial admissions, we will require a prospectus in far fewer cases for further issuances of securities.</p>
<p>This recognises that once issuers already have securities on UK public markets, the wider regulatory framework ensures a high level of transparency and ongoing reporting.</p>
<p>But we will still accept voluntary prospectuses for those issuers that want FCA approved documents, for example to support cross-border capital raising.</p>
<p>High quality disclosures are important. They should evolve with market developments. That is why we proposed some enhancements to prospectus disclosures in relation to sustainability, particularly on climate-related matters and debt instruments marketed as having sustainability-linked features or use of proceeds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new framework will allow a more proportionate and agile approach to regulation. It adopts the same philosophy as our listings reform &ndash; with a disclosure-based approach that seeks to encourage a rebalanced risk appetite while keeping high standards.&nbsp;We want to get the balance right.</p>
<p>Although our proposals are already informed by a huge amount of prior market input via our engagement papers, we want to know what you think.</p>
<p>Please submit your views online by 18 October.</p>
<h2>Investment research</h2>
<p>Next on the starting line were new rules that give asset managers greater freedom in how they pay for investment research, by allowing the &lsquo;bundling&rsquo; of payments for research and trade execution. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We commissioned data surveys and arranged roundtables to test drive our proposals. It meant we could race forward with our proposals at the point of formal consultation.</p>
<p>We saw that investors are largely getting the research they need, but that there can be operational complexities and unnecessary burdens in doing so. This had adverse impacts on small asset managers.</p>
<p>We listened to these concerns.</p>
<p>Our final rules are shaped by four key themes:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Flexibility</span>: To work across different types of asset managers.&nbsp;</li>
<li><span>Adaptability</span>: Making it easier for asset managers to buy research across borders.</li>
<li><span>Investor protection</span>: Guardrails to ensure sufficient investor protection and good outcomes, for example to make sure investors do not absorb the cost of less disciplined overconsumption of low-quality research. &nbsp;</li>
<li><span>Preserving competition</span>: To ensure bundled payments do not impede competition in distinct markets.</li>
</ul>
<p>We intend to have in place similar requirements for pooled funds. Rest assured we will get the market&rsquo;s input, so the all the practicalities are considered. Please look out for our consultation very soon.</p>
<h2>Digital securities sandbox and PISCES</h2>
<p>As we race ahead with reforms, we are changing how we engage the market. Markets are always evolving and we know that we cannot stand still as we focus on growth and innovation. We want to be agile, but we want our interventions to be evidence-based and future-proof.</p>
<p>And you can expect us to take the same approach in convening, listening and engaging as we explore ways to harness these opportunities.</p>
<p>Including by helping companies to innovate and scale, while initially remaining private, by creating the world&rsquo;s first private intermittent capital exchange system &ndash; or PISCES.</p>
<p>The PISCES platform will give new investors an opportunity to help companies access new capital to grow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Growth companies need to meet their own funding requirements to contribute to the overall growth of the economy. This is sometimes referred to as a &lsquo;growth escalator&rsquo;. Companies will access the escalator in different ways, and the primary, secondary and private markets along that journey. The FCA has a role ensuring regulation doesn't get in the way of companies accessing the capital they need as they move upwards.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve ushered in a new era with our package of capital markets reform and the new Digital Securities Sandbox will allow firms to keep up the pace. The sandbox allows firms to test drive innovative new technologies for trading and settling assets, in a live regulatory environment.</p>
<p>We will continue to work with the Bank of England, government and industry to harness new technologies while protecting the integrity and cleanliness of UK markets.</p>
<h2>Value for money framework</h2>
<p>When we think about capital markets, it is not enough to just think about issuers. We need to consider the whole investment ecosystem.&nbsp;Pensions schemes are significant investors in capital markets, and it is important that they think carefully about how the best returns can be generated for consumers. This can also have a beneficial impact overall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why does that matter?</p>
<p>16 million people are actively saving for their retirement into defined contribution pension schemes, and the vast majority are in the default investments offered to them.</p>
<p>We are proposing greater transparency and metrics that drive a shift from cost to value. It could make a difference for the savings of millions of people and help them get the value they deserve. Here our race becomes a relay.</p>
<p>Never one to jump the gun, we are running the first leg but we&rsquo;ll work closely with&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-work-pensions" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DWP<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/en" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Pensions Regulator<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;to gather feedback and insight so we can pass the baton and reach the finish line. On pensions you need a whole system approach. This Value for Money Framework does that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important we get this right and we welcome feedback on whether the proposals are right for consumers and for businesses.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Before 11 July, many of you may have thought the Listing Rules reforms could not have been delivered. That it would have been too difficult to have a public debate on a shift in risk appetite and it would have been impossible for regulators to support that. That it would have been too difficult to be bold where there are strong differences of view in the market. That the regulator wouldn&rsquo;t listen. Or that the market wouldn&rsquo;t tell the regulator what it really thinks.</p>
<p>As I stand before you today, I hope that we can all take confidence from the reforms we have delivered or are consulting on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Confidence that bold reforms are possible &ndash; even where there are diverging views. Confidence that we will listen and confidence that you and market participants will tell us what you think. Confidence that the FCA will work at pace to deliver.</p>
<p>We are continuing with our ambitious package of reforms to strengthen the UK&rsquo;s position in global wholesale markets.</p>
<p>You can expect us to take the same professional approach in all of this. A willingness to listen, to convene where there are differing views, to make difficult decisions where needed, and to focus on delivery and outcomes.</p>
<p>That outcome is a strong UK capital market. Companies will go where the opportunities exist and we want to set the right race conditions so they can choose the UK.</p>
<p>These changes better reflect the risk appetite needed to achieve growth and a more diversified market. We are putting the choice back to issuers, investors, and markets.</p>
<p>Regulation is only one part of the answer; these changes alone will not guarantee growth so we&rsquo;re continuing to work closely with government and industry to achieve sustainable growth together.</p>
<p>This is a marathon not a sprint. Success isn't measured in days, weeks or months. Success is measured in the long-term economic growth of UK capital markets. It&rsquo;s measured in a greater range of companies choosing to list in the UK, grow in the UK and compete on the global stage.</p>

<li><span>The Capital Markets of Tomorrow report is aimed at revitalising the UK investment landscape.</span></li>
<li><span>The document from the Capital Markets Industry Taskforce* puts retail investors front and centre of future plans.</span></li>
<li><span>Retail share ownership levels among UK households has more than halved over the past 20 years.</span></li>
<li><span>Research from HL shows that too many people are sitting on excess cash savings which could be deployed in the economy and delivering longer term returns</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>*The UK Capital Markets Industry Taskforce (CMIT) comprises CEOs, chairs and industry leaders representing private and publicly listed companies, asset owners and managers, and advisory services that support their access to capital and investments.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets, Hargreaves Lansdown:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&lsquo;&rsquo;It&rsquo;s clear there is a great deal of work which needs to be done to boost investment in&nbsp;<span><span>London listings</span>&nbsp;</span>and help power up economic growth.<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>This report makes some helpful suggestions on revitalising the UK investment landscape to help lay the groundwork for long-term expansion.</span></p>
<p><span>Retail investors are enthusiastic holders of UK equities, helping provide the capital for companies to expand. Of those equities held on HL&rsquo;s platform, 80% of the trades in the last year were on the London markets. But greater efforts need to be made to encourage more people to start investing.</span></p>
<p><span>As the report points out, Britain has had a strong tradition of pensions savings and direct retail investment in shares. This peaked with the privatisations of the 1980s and 1990s and continued through the dotcom boom of the early 2000s. But it&rsquo;s shocking to see that retail share ownership levels among UK households have more than halved over the past 20 years.</span></p>
<p><span>Research from HL shows that too many people are sitting on excess cash savings, which could be deployed in the economy and delivering longer term returns.&nbsp; Our latest Savings and Resilience Barometer into the efficient use of money from April 2024 shows that over 12 million households have excess cash savings.&nbsp; These could be redeployed to pensions and investments which have the potential to deliver higher returns.</span></p>
<p><span>In many ways, it's not surprising people have been turned off from dipping their toe into investing. All too often they have been left out of initial public offerings on the stock market, only able to get a small foot in the door after institutional investors have taken their pickings. Time after time retail investors are left disappointed by the their small allocation in IPOs. &nbsp;HL was significantly oversubscribed for the Raspberry Pi IPO, which only allocated &euro;8million to retail investors. This shows there are still matters on the supply side to fix. It&rsquo;s heartening to see that retail investors will be pushed more towards the centre of future plans through the FCA&rsquo;s proposed reforms of the listings and prospectus regime.</span></p>
<p><span>Tax wrappers like ISAs and SIPPs make all the difference to people building their pots for the future and for major events in their lives.&nbsp; ISAs are part of the furniture &ndash; in a good way. They&rsquo;ve been around for 25 years and are well established and well loved. Of course, like anything we&rsquo;ve been wedded to for 25 years, we can always think of ways they could improve. But while small changes would be welcome, its essential they do not over-complicate the landscape and that tax-free allocations are either increased or at the very least maintained.</span></p>
<p><span>What would also help simplify retail investing and encourage more people to take the plunge into the stock market is reducing the Lifetime ISA (LISA) penalty from 25% to 20%. The 25% penalty not only claws back the government bonus to save, but also applies an additional 6.25% penalty based on the net amount invested. It would give investors more confidence to use this highly useful tax wrapper to climb onto the housing ladder or save for retirement with the knowledge that they won&rsquo;t be penalised if their circumstances change.&rsquo;&rsquo;&nbsp;</span></p>

<title>Securities Commission Malaysia Cautions Public On Investment Scams Using Fake Information Memorandums</title>

<div> Scam, Investment, Information Memorandums, Securities Commission Malaysia, Endorsement<br />
<br />
The Securities Commission Malaysia warns of a new investment scam using fake Information Memorandums claiming endorsement by the SC. Investors urged to verify and report.<br />
Summary:<br />Immediate action taken including police report and adding company to Investor Alert List. SC warns public to verify investment claims and report suspicious activities. <div>
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) today cautioned the public on a new investment scam which uses fake Information Memorandums (IM)<sup>1</sup> to procure investment from the public, falsely claiming that it has been lodged with or endorsed by the SC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the Capital Markets and Services Act 2007 (CMSA), unlisted public companies issuing IMs to raise funds are required to lodge them with the SC within seven days of issuance to potential investors. However, the lodgment of an IM does not constitute an endorsement by the SC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this case, the SC found that the company represented to investors that it has issued an IM purportedly lodged with the SC, thus misleading investors and lending credibility to its investment scheme. The SC confirms that the company did not lodge any IM with the SC and suspects that it is part of an investment scam.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Immediate action has been taken including filing a police report and adding the company on SC&rsquo;s Investor Alert List at <a href="https://www.sc.com.my/investor-alert-list">https://www.sc.com.my/investor</a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/investor-alert-list">-</a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/investor-alert-list">alert</a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/investor-alert-list">-</a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/investor-alert-list">list</a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/investor-alert-list">.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SC views this matter seriously, as such an act may lead the public to believe that the SC endorses and approves the investment product.</p>
<p>The public is strongly encouraged to verify any claims using the name of the SC or any of its officers, and to report this as well as any suspicious activities or investment information to the SC. This will help protect investors from potential risks and assist them in making informed investment decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The public can verify investment offers through the SC Investment Checker at <a href="http://www.sc.com.my/investment-checker">www.sc.com.my/investment</a><a href="http://www.sc.com.my/investment-checker">-</a><a href="http://www.sc.com.my/investment-checker">checker</a><a href="http://www.sc.com.my/investment-checker">.</a></p>
<p>For reports or enquiries, the SC&rsquo;s Consumer and Investor Office can be reached at +603 6204 8999 or through email via <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="mailto:aduan@seccom.com.my" title="aduan@seccom.com.my">aduan@seccom.com.my</a></span>.&nbsp;</p>

<div> power, environmental, trading, records, Nodal Exchange <br />
<br />
Nodal Exchange set new records in power and environmental trading in August 2024, with increased volumes and open interest in both markets. <br />
Summary: <div>
<p>Nodal Exchange announced new power and environmental trading records in August 2024.&nbsp;In power, Nodal set a calendar month record for August with 266 million MWh of traded power futures volume in the month, up 58% from the prior year.<span id="more-29829">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;Nodal continues to be the market leader in North American power futures having the majority of the open interest with 1.4 billion MWh.</p>
<p>Environmental futures and options on Nodal Exchange set a new all-time volume record of 105,571 lots in August, up 189% from 36,495 lots a year earlier. The monthly volume topped the prior record in July of 64,562 lots.</p>
<p>Open interest in the environmental product suite on Nodal ended the month at an all-time high of 380,647 lots, up 45% from 262,680 contracts a year earlier.</p>
<p>Environmental volume and open interest growth was driven by increased trading activity in North American carbon (including California Carbon Allowances (CCAs) and Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) Allowances) and renewable energy certificate (REC) contracts.</p>
<p>Carbon futures and options volumes totaled 63,283 contracts in August, while open interest rose to 65,925 lots, up 98% from 33,228 lots a year earlier.</p>
<p>The REC product group volume totaled &nbsp;39,529 contracts in August, up 87% from 21,142 lots the year prior. REC open interest rose 17% to 252,608 lots at month-end from 215,552 lots a year earlier.</p>
<p>Nodal, in collaboration with IncubEx, offers the world&rsquo;s largest suite of environmental products.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nodal Exchange is proud to have achieved these new records in power and environmental markets and appreciates the support of its community&rdquo; said Paul Cusenza, Chairman and CEO of Nodal Exchange and Nodal Clear.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Former Finance Director At CIRCOR International With Accounting Fraud - Company Settles SEC’s Charges For Related Accounting Controls Violations; Avoids Penalties Based On Self-Report, Cooperation, And Remediation</title>

<div> SEC, fraud charges, CIRCOR International Inc., financial reporting, internal accounting controls
Summary: SEC charges Nicholas Bowerman for fraud at CIRCOR International, leading to misleading financial statements. CIRCOR settles related internal accounting charges. 

Summary:<br /><br />SEC files fraud charges against former CIRCOR International finance director. CIRCOR settles internal accounting charges. No penalty due to self-reporting. <div>
<p><span><span>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced fraud charges against Nicholas Bowerman, a former finance director of CIRCOR International Inc., a formerly publicly traded technology manufacturer. The SEC alleges that Bowerman&rsquo;s fraud led to the company making misleading statements to the public about the company&rsquo;s financial performance from 2019 through 2021. The SEC also announced related settled internal accounting charges against CIRCOR.</span></span></p>
<p>Bowerman worked at CIRCOR&rsquo;s U.K.-based business unit, Pipeline Engineering. According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint against Bowerman, between 2019 and 2021, Bowerman manipulated CIRCOR&rsquo;s internal accounting records by falsifying Pipeline Engineering&rsquo;s financial results before they were included in CIRCOR&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements. The complaint further alleges that Bowerman concealed his misconduct by manipulating account reconciliations, falsifying certifications, fabricating bank confirmation documents, and misleading CIRCOR&rsquo;s management and independent auditors. The SEC&rsquo;s separate order against CIRCOR finds that the company failed to devise and maintain sufficient internal accounting controls concerning financial statement preparation, reconciliation processes, and access to bank accounts. Because of these deficiencies, CIRCOR was unable to prevent Bowerman&rsquo;s fraud and, as a result, overstated by millions of dollars its performance for fiscal years 2019 and 2020 and the nine months ending October 3, 2021.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, the SEC did not seek a civil penalty against CIRCOR because CIRCOR self-reported its financial reporting violations to the SEC shortly after commencing an internal investigation and thereafter provided substantial cooperation to the staff, including providing detailed examples of Bowerman&rsquo;s unsupported and unauthorized adjustments, summarizing interviews of witnesses located outside the United States, and making CIRCOR employees and external forensic accountants available for interviews. CIRCOR also promptly implemented remedial measures, which included strengthening its internal accounting controls, hiring additional experienced finance and accounting personnel, and canceling compensation scheduled to be paid to a former executive officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While this matter involves serious violations of the securities laws, once the company became aware of the violations, it promptly self-reported, cooperated, and remediated the gaps in its accounting systems,&rdquo; said Nicholas P. Grippo, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Philadelphia Regional Office. &ldquo;As also reflected in other recent Commission resolutions, this kind of response by a corporate entity can lead to significant benefits including, as here, no penalty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, charges Bowerman with violating the antifraud, financial reporting, books and records, and internal accounting controls provisions of the federal securities laws and seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order against CIRCOR finds that CIRCOR violated the financial reporting, books and records, and internal accounting controls provisions of the federal securities laws. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s finding, CIRCOR agreed to cease and desist from further violations of the charged securities laws.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Christine R. O&rsquo;Neil, Samika N. Osbourne, and Brian R. Higgins, and supervised by Brendan P. McGlynn, all of the Philadelphia Regional office. The SEC&rsquo;s litigation against Bowerman will be conducted by Judson T. Mihok and supervised by Gregory R. Bockin, also of the Philadelphia Regional Office.</p>

Fighting financial crime is a priority for the FCA, focusing on outcomes and using a targeted, data-led and partnership approach to enforcement. <div>

<p><span>Speaker:&nbsp;</span>Sarah Pritchard, executive director, markets and executive director, international<br /><span>Event:&nbsp;</span>The Financial Crime Summit, London<br /><span>Delivered:&nbsp;</span>05/09/2024<br /><span>Note:</span> This is a drafted speech and may differ from the delivered version</p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fighting financial crime is a priority for the FCA and a key commitment in our 3-year strategy.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Consistent with the national economic crime plan and fraud strategy, our work is based on a partnership approach. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Financial crime is not just an issue for the financial sector, but for other sectors too, sharing data and intelligence is a vital tool in staying one step ahead. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Picture the scene.</p>
<p>London, 1666: a labyrinth of narrow streets, lined with wonky wooden buildings hunched tightly together.</p>
<p>On a balmy evening in early September, a small flame ignites in a local bakery.</p>
<p>As first, it seems like a minor incident. No big deal. Just a small fire that can be pretty easily managed.</p>
<p>But as the flames begin to spread, the fire leaps from house to house, street to street, growing stronger and more ferocious.</p>
<p>People try to stop the spread, but they don&rsquo;t use the right tools. Their efforts are unfocused and uncoordinated.</p>
<p>Soon, the fire grows out of control, and before you know it, the blaze has swallowed vast swathes of the city &ndash; taking lives and livelihoods with it, transforming the London skyline forever.</p>
<p>Now think of financial crime as that spark in the bakery.</p>
<p>Sure, it may start small &ndash; just a minor fraud or a simple scam. But if left unchecked, if not targeted and contained, it can grow into something much larger &hellip; sweeping through the economy, damaging businesses, damaging livelihoods and damaging trust in our financial systems.</p>
<h2>Fighting financial crime &ndash; focusing on outcomes</h2>
<p>Like the firebreaks that could have saved much of London, a targeted approach to tackling financial crime is what I want to talk about today.</p>
<p>An approach that uses data to spot outliers and issues.</p>
<p>An approach where we share what that data is telling us &ndash; and what good practice and poor practice look like &ndash; so everyone can understand the outcomes we expect.</p>
<p>Because a targeted, and outcomes-focused approach is essential if we are to bear down on financial crime in an effective and proportionate way.</p>
<h2>A targeted approach to enforcement</h2>
<p>Of course, we are, first and foremost, a regulator.</p>
<p>And we enforce our regulations with vigour.</p>
<p>Because financial crime costs every one of us here today &ndash; consumers and firms alike.</p>
<p>It violates the financial systems we rely on to live our everyday lives and uses them against us &hellip; It fuels all manner of harmful activities from terrorist financing to money laundering, to fraud &hellip; And it damages the integrity of our markets, undermining our international competitiveness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why fighting financial crime is a key commitment in the FCA&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/corporate/our-strategy-2022-25.pdf" title="Our Strategy 2022 to 2025">3-year strategy</a>.</p>
<p>Cases are complex and can be difficult to prosecute, but where we see harm and where our objectives are engaged, we will use all of the tools in our regulatory &ldquo;toolbox&rdquo; to respond.</p>
<p>In the last financial year, we charged 21 individuals with financial crime offences; the highest number of charges we have achieved in any single year.</p>
<p>In 2023 we secured 3 times as many freezing orders as in 2022, restraining more than &pound;21m in assets of individuals under investigation.</p>
<p>And just last month we took firm&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/pwc-fined-failing-alert-fca-suspected-fraudulent-activity-london-capital-finance-plc" title="PwC fined &pound;15 million for failing to alert the FCA to suspected fraudulent activity at London Capital &amp; Finance plc">enforcement action against the auditor PwC</a>, fining it &pound;15m for failing to alert us to suspected fraudulent activity.</p>
<p>So, we are using our powers more assertively than ever.</p>
<h2>Preventing fires breaking out</h2>
<p>But I do not want us to be constantly hosing down fires where they arise.</p>
<p>I want us to also be making strategic interventions to stop them breaking out in the first place.</p>
<p>That means working with partners across the whole UK system, through the UK&rsquo;s public and private partnerships and the&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/economic-crime-plan-2023-to-2026" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Economic crime plan 2023 to 2026 | GOV.UK">economic crime plan<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;at the same time as driving a more integrated and targeted approach to tackling financial crime across the FCA.</p>
<p>A first step is how diligent and assertive we are at the gateway with those seeking authorisation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rightly a rigorous process.</p>
<p>We want firms to have the right systems and controls in place before we authorise them, so they aren&rsquo;t used to facilitate financial crime.</p>
<p>In the last financial year, 36% of Annex 1 firms &ndash; that is firms seeking to register with us for anti-money laundering purposes only &ndash; withdrew their applications, or had their applications rejected.</p>
<p>It is our job to make sure standards are met. And we make no apology for that.</p>
<p>Let me be clear though &ndash; we don&rsquo;t&nbsp;<em>want&nbsp;</em>to reject applications.</p>
<p>Those firms who have the right standards, following the guidance and expectations that we have clearly set out, can and will achieve registration.</p>
<p>And I would like to see more of this &ndash; more firms meeting the money laundering standards that we expect, first time round.</p>
<h2>Innovative and data-led</h2>
<p>When it comes to countering financial crime, we know we must embrace change to stay ahead of the criminals.</p>
<p>Whether it is pre-empting the way they use new technology such as AI, or coming together to share and interrogate data &hellip; we must be vigilant, constantly improving our systems and controls against those seeking to exploit them.</p>
<p>One area where our innovative methods are bearing fruit, is in reducing the risk to consumers of illegal or non-compliant financial promotions.</p>
<p>Using data and technology, we have increased our capacity to identify illegal financial promotions on websites or social media.</p>
<p>We are tackling fraud faster by scanning approximately 100,000 websites every day to identify those that appear to be scams.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/financial-watchdog-stops-thousands-misleading-ads-promotions" title="Financial watchdog stops thousands of misleading ads and promotions">Over 10,000 potentially misleading adverts</a>&nbsp;were either amended or withdrawn because of our action in 2023 &ndash; an increase of 17% on 2022.</p>
<p>And last year we hosted a 3-day investment fraud tech sprint drawn from regulatory, intelligence and law enforcement agencies to design new ways to tackle this type of fraud.</p>
<p>Using the FCA&rsquo;s own supervisory reach, we have also created a dedicated financial crime function within our Consumer Investments department &ndash; an area where we have seen evolving threats of financial crime and fraud.</p>
<p>Their work is proactive and highly targeted: identifying outliers, spotting trends earlier and snuffing out threats before they spread like wildfire.</p>
<p>For example, a high turnover of money laundering reporting officers, frequent changes to a firm&rsquo;s registered name, or significant changes to the nature of service provided post FCA-authorisation, are all risk indicators that can raise a red flag.</p>
<p>Over the past 18 months the team have been out on unannounced spot visits, gathering evidence and intervening to prevent harm.</p>
<p>This has included placing requirements on firm&rsquo;s permissions, imposing asset restrictions and, in certain cases, even stopping firms providing financial services altogether.</p>
<p>More of that assertiveness I was talking about earlier.</p>
<p>We are working with other regulatory and law enforcement partners too. In July we were pleased to join with the National Crime Agency (NCA) and 7 UK banks as part of a&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/ground-breaking-public-private-partnership-launched-to-identify-criminality-using-banking-data" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Ground breaking public private partnership launched to identify criminality using banking data | NCA">major NCA-led project<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;to identify and act against organised crime.</p>
<p>A joint team analysed account data shared by participating banks that suggested potential criminality.</p>
<p>As well as identifying several new organised crime networks, the project has delivered vital intelligence in support of wider NCA and law enforcement investigations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an innovative approach, and one yielding real outcomes.</p>
<p>It also highlights the importance of having the FCA at the table alongside industry and law enforcement to answer the question: what will the regulator think of this?</p>
<h2>Taking a system-wide approach</h2>
<p>And while of course the financial services sector must continue to take the lead, it&rsquo;s important to emphasise we are part of a whole system response &ndash; a bucket brigade, if you will, to tackling and extinguishing financial crime.</p>
<p>As part of the national economic crime plan and&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fraud-strategy" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Fraud strategy | GOV.UK">fraud strategy<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>, we are working with partners to support system-wide improvements.</p>
<p>Because we are clear it takes the efforts of both public and private sectors &ndash; including regulated firms themselves &ndash; to reduce and prevent financial crime.</p>
<p>In the past year, we have taken a leading role in influencing Big Tech companies to stop scams and illegal ads from appearing on their platforms.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve worked with the likes of Google, Bing, Meta and others, and they now ban paid-for adverts for UK financial services that are not approved by an FCA-authorised firm.</p>
<p>We have also worked with Apple and Google to remove apps from their stores that breach our financial promotions rules, further protecting UK consumers.</p>
<p>This risk-based approach really works when outcomes are aligned, and the risk is collectively managed across multiple industries. And it&rsquo;s a powerful example of how targeted, proportionate action can lead to positive outcomes.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, we are using our powers through the Office for Professional Body Anti-Money Laundering Supervision (OPBAS) to improve standards in the legal and accountancy sectors.</p>
<p>In the last financial year, OPBAS used its powers to direct 2 Professional Body Supervisors (PBSs) to take action to remedy money laundering shortfalls. Just one example of how OPBAS is using an increasing range of regulatory tools and powers to hold PBSs accountable.</p>
<h2>Our joint efforts are working</h2>
<p>Financial crime is notoriously difficult to quantify.</p>
<p>But the data tells us that the system-wide work to block fraud at source, educate consumers and disrupt those engaged in fraud, is having an impact.</p>
<p>The latest&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/crimeinenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2024" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Crime in England and Wales: year ending March 2024 | ONS">ONS crime figures<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;for the last financial year showed that fraud had decreased by 10%, with reductions in bank and credit account fraud, advance fee fraud, and other fraud also falling.</p>
<p>The rate of growth in the number of investment fraud victims slowed from 28% in 2022 to 4% in 2023.</p>
<p>Moreover, the reported losses suffered by victims reduced by 40% in 2023, compared to 2022.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s genuine progress &ndash; but progress that needs to be sustained. That&rsquo;s why fighting financial crime will remain at the heart of the next FCA multi-year strategy.</p>
<h2>Proportionality</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m often asked if our response to financial crime is proportionate.</p>
<p>I know that the cost of financial crime compliance, including customer due diligence and anti-money laundering, can be significant.</p>
<p>What I would say is that all the right elements are now in place to shape that debate.</p>
<p>As part of our outcomes-based mindset towards financial crime, we are sharing our approach, expectations and findings more publicly and more frequently than ever.</p>
<p>Since April 2023, we have published 5 reviews of firms&rsquo; financial crime controls, sharing good and poor practice across the sector &hellip; so that firms can target their approach and know what good looks like.</p>
<p>Once we have those basics in place, using the right data to calibrate risk and respond accordingly, it&rsquo;s easier to see outliers &ndash; and then easier to take forward a more meaningful discussion on proportionality.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So where does this leave us? I come back to the importance of being driven by the outcomes we wish to achieve.</p>
<p>357 years ago today, the Great Fire was raging just metres from where we gather today.</p>
<p>The lessons learned from that disaster are as relevant now as ever.</p>
<p>If our strategy isn&rsquo;t right, if we don&rsquo;t use the right tools, if we just spray water around in a disordered fashion, we might dampen the surroundings, but the fire will continue to burn.</p>
<p>But by working together, all hands to the pump &hellip; equipped with the right tools and aiming directly at the flames &hellip; we can prevent small sparks from becoming devastating infernos that threaten the financial health of our entire nation.</p>
<p>I look forward to continuing to work with you all on this.</p>

<div> Euronext Dublin, IPOready 2025, pre-IPO programme, Irish companies, strategic financing<br />
<br />
Summary: Euronext and Irish government launch IPOready 2025 program to equip Irish CEOs/CFOs with skills for strategic financing, including IPO, supported by Enterprise Ireland and ISIF. <div>
<p class="BodyText1">The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Peter Burke and Euronext Dublin, formerly the Irish Stock Exchange, have today launched the recruitment for Euronext&nbsp;<em>IPOready 2025&nbsp;</em>in Ireland<em>,&nbsp;</em>at an event on the historic Market Floor at Euronext Dublin<em>.</em>&nbsp;This is the latest edition of Euronext&rsquo;s leadership programme designed to equip executives with the skills to scale and secure growth financing, up to and including through an Initial Public Offering (IPO).&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyText1">Commencing in January 2025, this six-month pre-IPO educational programme offers a blend of interactive workshops, international networking events with peers, investor pitches, and tailored mentoring sessions for CEOs and CFOs of scaling Irish companies. It is crafted to equip company leaders with the essential skills and insights needed to assess and pursue strategic financing options, including how to achieve a successful IPO to support long-term business expansion.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyText1">Recognising the vital role that homegrown enterprises play in the Irish economy, Euronext IPOready in Ireland has been instrumental in guiding over 55 indigenous alumni companies on options for financing their growth journeys. Recent alumni from the last programme include CWSI, Fortus Group, Mail Metrics, and Neurent Medical.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyText1">Niall Jones, Head of Listing for Ireland and UK at Euronext, commented on the launch, &ldquo;<em>Our mission is to empower indigenous SMEs by providing them with the tools and skills they need to pursue the right financing options for them to fuel their growth. Part of the programme educates executives about the path and benefits to an IPO, and how equity capital markets can support the growth of their companies, not just at the time of IPO but on an ongoing basis as well</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyText1">Euronext IPOReady supports fast-growing European companies considering a listing on a Euronext market in the coming years, providing executives with the tools and insights they need to achieve a successful IPO. The award-winning programme has now been adopted as the pre-IPO strategic financing programme across the pan-European Euronext network and will be conducted in nine countries simultaneously in 2025. In the past 5 years, Euronext has welcomed 540 IPOs, raising &euro;47bn. Since 2015, IPOready and its Euronext predecessor, TechShare have assisted over 1,080 companies in making more informed decisions about their funding options. Indeed, 29 IPOready alumni have gone public across Europe since 2025, raising a total of &euro;1.4bn upon listing.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">In his address at the launch event on Thursday, Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Peter Burke, said: &ldquo;<em>The IPOready programme is a valuable resource for Irish SMEs, providing them with the tools and knowledge to explore new avenues of growth through equity capital markets. My department is committed to supporting initiatives that empower our indigenous companies to scale and succeed globally. This programme not only enhances the prospects of individual businesses but also strengthens the overall resilience and competitiveness of the Irish economy. I encourage our ambitious indigenous companies to take full advantage of this opportunity as they prepare for future growth</em>."</p>
<p class="BodyText1">IPOready is delivered in partnership with Enterprise Ireland and the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF), building on the success of six previous editions since 2015.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">In his remarks about the partnership with Euronext Dublin, Leo Clancy, CEO, Enterprise Ireland, said:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Enterprise Ireland is committed to helping Irish business go global by supporting Irish owned companies to grow and scale. The IPOready&nbsp; 2025 programme provides an opportunity for businesses who wish to compete on the global stage to learn and gain insights from investors, executives and advisors who have played a part in the success of world-leading Irish companies. We are delighted to support this programme which equips companies looking to achieve scale with the skills to access strategic finance to support their growth journey and advice on taking their company public.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsBBlVUBAVUVUwKBgcCHVYMUVUdUwpXXhpTAQQGBQFTUw4BVwAdWVMFVw9TDFEdBwgEBh0GCQJRGlcEAwcZUARUVwECBlgCUQIFRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">proposal</a>, submitted by the EU Distribution System Operators Entity (EU DSO Entity) and the European Network of Transmission System Operators (ENTSO-E), also suggests amendments to the related existing legal framework.</p>
<p>ACER has already made several amendments to the system operators&rsquo; proposal to ensure it aligns with the existing legal framework, follows the European principle of proportionality (e.g. measures must be appropriate, necessary and not excessive) and maintains legal clarity. ACER is now consulting on its&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsCVwIGVwVQAEwJUFVXHVZfAFQdCwEBURoCUwZSAQMNUw5UDlMdWVMFVw9TDFEdBwgEBh0GCQJRGlcEAwcZUARUVwECBlgCUQIFRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">revised draft</a>&nbsp;to gather stakeholders&rsquo; feedback early in the process.</p>
<p>Based on the input received, ACER will further amend the draft network code and related legal framework before submitting the final recommendation to the European Commission by March 2025.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why is this network code relevant?</span></p>
<p>Demand response is key for integrating the growing share of renewable energy and new electricity loads (e.g. resulting from heat pumps and electric vehicles) in a cost-efficient way.</p>
<p>In developing this draft network code, ACER is contributing to a more cost-efficient and clean energy transition by facilitating access to EU wholesale electricity markets for smaller actors, including consumers.</p>

<div> improvements, authorisations service, intervention, fair complaint resolution, financial crime<br />
Summary: The FCA has shown significant improvements in its authorisations service, increased intervention to stop harm to consumers, improved fair complaint resolution, taken strong action to tackle financial crime, and introduced new rules to protect consumers in the crypto market.<br /><br /> <div>
<p align="left"><span>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has published its&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/annual-reports/annual-report-2023-2024" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Annual Report</a>,</span><span>&nbsp;which shows significant improvements in its authorisations service.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p align="left"><span>Recognising the vital role that the regulator plays in enabling new financial services firms&rsquo; ability to meet regulatory standards to get off the ground, the FCA has improved its authorisation process. Now&nbsp;</span><span>98% of cases,</span><span>&nbsp;including applications by wholesale market firms,</span><span>&nbsp;are assessed within statutory deadlines, up from 89% in Q1 of 2022/23</span><span>.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><span>Overseas wholesale financial firms wishing to operate in the UK can also benefit from pre-application support from the FCA. The regulator has also recently completed the biggest reform to the listing rules in more than three decades. These changes support economic growth by helping firms access the capital they need to grow.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><span>Other highlights include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><strong>Intervening to stop harm to consumers more quickly</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><span>The FCA</span>&nbsp;<span>has continued to improve how it detects problem firms and individuals, which helps earlier intervention. For example, it doubled the cancellation of firm authorisations in 2023 to 1,261 and used its powers to intervene against 34 firms, who caused serious concerns, up 68% on 2022.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><strong>Improved fair complaint resolution and compensation</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><span>The FCA has taken strong action to make sure firms are compensating consumers, promptly and fairly, when things go wrong. This year it intervened with almost 100 lenders to make sure they were supporting borrowers in financial difficulty,&nbsp;<span class="NormalTextRun SCXW120726293 BCX0">and&nbsp;</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW120726293 BCX0">the FCA expects</span>&nbsp;that approximately 270,000 customers will receive close to &pound;60 million in compensation. At the same time, through its work on prevention, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) levy on the industry has fallen to a ten-year low.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><strong>Strong action to tackle financial crime</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><span>Since April 2023, the FCA has charged 21 people with financial crime offences which is the highest number of charges it has made in a single year. In 2023, it secured 9 freezing orders, 6 more than in 2022, and restrained &pound;21.1m in assets of individuals under investigation.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><strong>Protecting consumers in the crypto market</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><span>The FCA has introduced new rules that require cryptoassets promotions to UK consumers to be clear, fair and not misleading. This helps consumers better understand what they are buying, and the risks involved.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><strong>Protecting consumers</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><span>Since 31 July 2023, more than 42,000 firms must make sure they can evidence good outcomes for consumers for any new and existing &lsquo;on sale&rsquo; products and services, and for closed &lsquo;not on sale&rsquo; products since 31 July 2024, in line with the Consumer Duty.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>MarketAxess Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: MKTX), the operator of a leading electronic trading platform for fixed-income securities, today announced trading volume and preliminary variable transaction fees per million (&ldquo;FPM&rdquo;) for August 2024.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><b>Chris Concannon, CEO of MarketAxess, commented:<br /></b>&ldquo;A favorable market environment helped deliver strong year-over-year, and solid month-over-month results in August. We delivered 27% growth in total credit ADV year-over-year, driven by a 34% increase in U.S. high-grade, a 25% increase in emerging markets, a 19% increase in Eurobonds, and a 49% increase in municipal bonds. We also generated record portfolio trading ADV of $988 million. Our leadership position in the global credit institutional e-trading space remains strong, and we are beginning the roll-out of X-Pro to our global client base later this month.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>General Notes Regarding the Data Presented</b></p>
<p>Reported MarketAxess volume in all product categories includes only fully electronic trading volume. MarketAxess trading volumes and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&ldquo;FINRA&rdquo;) Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (&ldquo;TRACE&rdquo;) reported volumes are available on the Company&rsquo;s website at&nbsp;<a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.marketaxess.com%2Fvolume&amp;esheet=54117825&amp;newsitemid=20240904692881&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=investor.marketaxess.com%2Fvolume&amp;index=1&amp;md5=bd7c6f4ffd5409d671d641e97391460d" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">investor.marketaxess.com/volume</a>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>In addition, for periods beginning with January 2024, the Company has made changes to the market volume data used to calculate estimated market share for Municipal and U.S. Government Bonds. For Municipal Bonds, the Company previously used estimates, derived from data issued by the Municipal Securities Rule Making Board (&ldquo;MSRB&rdquo;), including estimates for new issuance, commercial paper and variable-rate trading activity, and excluded these volumes from the estimated market volume data. While the Company still uses estimates, the new methodology for identifying and excluding these volumes from the market volume data is now based on MSRB &ldquo;flags&rdquo; to identify new issuance, commercial paper, and variable-rate volumes. For U.S. Government Bonds, the previous data source for estimated market volumes was the Federal Reserve Bank&rsquo;s Reported Primary Dealer U.S. Treasury Bond Trading Volumes, which was reported on a one-week lag. The new source for U.S. Government Bond trading volumes is FINRA&rsquo;s U.S. Treasury TRACE data. The Company believes that the refined methodology used for Municipal Bonds, and the new data source for U.S. Government Bonds, provides more accurate measures of estimated market volumes and estimated market share. Prior comparable periods have been recast retrospectively for both Municipal and U.S. Government Bonds to conform to the updated presentation of the data. The new estimated market volume data is also available on the Company&rsquo;s website at&nbsp;<a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.marketaxess.com%2Fvolume&amp;esheet=54117825&amp;newsitemid=20240904692881&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=investor.marketaxess.com%2Fvolume&amp;index=2&amp;md5=6647ede5ca999532ece30b53017ea928" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">investor.marketaxess.com/volume</a>&nbsp;.</p>

Summary:
BNP Paribas AM launches Active Beta ETFs integrating ESG, low tracking error, targeting sustainability, with Japan and US focus.<br /><br /> <div>
<p><span><span>BNP Paribas Asset Management (&lsquo;BNPP AM&rsquo;) announces today the launch of the first two equities funds in its innovative Active Beta exchange-traded funds (&lsquo;ETFs&rsquo;) range.&nbsp;<span>BNP Paribas Easy Sustainable Japan UCITS ETF</span></span></span><span><a href="https://mediaroom-en.bnpparibas-am.com/news/bnp-paribas-asset-management-launches-two-esg-active-beta-equity-etfs-5ca3f-0fb7a.html?utm_medium=campaign&amp;utm_source=wiztopic&amp;utm_campaign=BNP+Paribas+Asset+Management+launches+two+ESG++Active+Beta+Equity+ETFs#footnote-full-1" id="footnote-marker-full-1-1">[1]</a></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>and&nbsp;<span>BNP Paribas Easy Sustainable US UCITS ETF</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>are sub-funds of the BNP Paribas Easy Irish ICAV and began listing on 03 September on Euronext Paris and will be listed later this month on Deutsche B&ouml;rse Xetra.</span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The BNP Paribas Easy Active Beta ETF range is an innovative suite combining a traditional indexing approach with an active integration of BNPP AM&rsquo;s proprietary ESG methodology. These ETFs are designed for investors who are seeking a more focused approach to sustainability, one that can be adapted quickly to evolving regulations and label criteria, while keeping a relatively low tracking error.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Key highlights of our Active Beta ETFs:</span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Beta exposure to mainstream benchmarks</span></li>
<li><span>Minimising tracking error</span><span><a href="https://mediaroom-en.bnpparibas-am.com/news/bnp-paribas-asset-management-launches-two-esg-active-beta-equity-etfs-5ca3f-0fb7a.html?utm_medium=campaign&amp;utm_source=wiztopic&amp;utm_campaign=BNP+Paribas+Asset+Management+launches+two+ESG++Active+Beta+Equity+ETFs#footnote-full-2" id="footnote-marker-full-2-1">[2]</a></span><span>&nbsp;versus the investment universe</span></li>

</ul>
<p><span><span><span>Marie-Sophie Pastant, Head of Index &amp; ETF Strategies - Portfolio Management at BNPP AM comments:</span></span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><span>"</span></em><em><span>These two new launches are the natural next step of our Active Beta range. Our aim is to develop a new segment of equity funds aiming to be as close as possible to mainstream benchmarks, with ex ante TE between 1% to 1.5%, while integrating solid ESG features developed by BNPP AM. Those funds will decarbonate by 50% their starting universe.</span></em><em><span>"</span></em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>BNP Paribas Easy Sustainable Japan UCITS ETF</span>&nbsp;is an Article 8 fund according to SFDR regulation, seeking a Sustainable Investment of at least 55% while providing exposure to the Japanese equity market. The Benchmark Index is MSCI Japan Net Total Return Index.</p>
<p><span>BNP Paribas Easy Sustainable US UCITS ETF</span>&nbsp;is an Article 8 fund according to SFDR regulation, seeking a Sustainable Investment of at least 45% while providing exposure to the US equity market. The Benchmark Index S&amp;P 500 Net Total Return Index.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Both funds integrate BNPP AM&rsquo;s ESG approach and integrate PAB exclusions which makes them both eligible to sustainable labels criteria (French SRI label and Toward Sustainability label).</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Lorraine Sereyjol-Garros, Global Head of Development for ETFs &amp; Index Funds at BNPP AM comments</span></span><span>:</span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><em><span>&ldquo;As a leader on sustainable investment, our ambition is to provide our clients with a comprehensive range of ESG &amp; SRI ETFs that cater to the diverse needs of investors across the entire spectrum of sustainable investing. Offering ETFs that combine a recognised ESG approach, high sustainable investment and ambitious decarbonisation target, while providing the benefits of index-based investing, including a reasonable tracking error, will answer the increasing demand from institutional clients and distributors to integrate ESG factors in their portfolio.&rdquo;</span></em>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;<span>BNPP AM manages ETFs and index funds assets totalling EUR 51.9 billion, including thematic and sustainable products</span></span><span><a href="https://mediaroom-en.bnpparibas-am.com/news/bnp-paribas-asset-management-launches-two-esg-active-beta-equity-etfs-5ca3f-0fb7a.html?utm_medium=campaign&amp;utm_source=wiztopic&amp;utm_campaign=BNP+Paribas+Asset+Management+launches+two+ESG++Active+Beta+Equity+ETFs#footnote-full-4" id="footnote-marker-full-4-1">[4]</a></span><span><span>.</span><span>&nbsp;90% of BNPP AM&rsquo;s ETF range is classified as SFDR Article 8 or 9 and more than 70% of the range has a European sustainability label (either ISR5, TSI6, FNG7 or Austria8).</span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<div> performance, usage monitor, cluster-aware, topic view, session filtering
Summary:
Diffusion 6.11 introduces major performance improvement, usage monitoring, cluster-aware enhancements, topic view mapping, and session filtering features. The update aims to enhance developer productivity and operational efficiency. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a class="OWAAutoLink safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.diffusiondata.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">DiffusionData</a></span></span>, the pioneer and leader in real-time data streaming and messaging solutions, today announced the release of Diffusion 6.11. The latest developer-centric enhancements to the framework aim to speed and simplify development, reduce operational costs, and ensure reliable and efficient delivery of real-time data.</p>
<p>Grethe Brown, CEO of DiffusionData, said: &ldquo;Many of the enhancements we&rsquo;ve introduced in 6.11 have been driven by an ongoing dialogue with our Diffusion community. It&rsquo;s important for us to understand the evolving requirements of our clients and address those when introducing improvements to our framework. The enhancements reflect some of the daily challenges faced by developers and are intended to improve operational productivity. &nbsp;&nbsp;The feedback from our amazing customers continues to fuel our innovations in real-time data.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Enhancements in Diffusion 6.11 include:</p>
<p><b>Major Improvement in Distributed Update Performance</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b>In previous releases the performance of updates in a clustered environment was significantly slower than that of a single server. With this release, asynchronous operations are applied to bring cluster performance comparable to a single server.</p>
<p><b>Usage Monitor</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b>In 6.11, a new usage monitoring feature has been introduced. This provides customers with the ability to collect certain usage statistics in files that can then be sent to DiffusionData periodically so that their usage of the framework can be assessed. This allows DiffusionData to have a far better view on how Diffusion is being used and provide customers with feedback on their usage to improve the overall technology experience.</p>
<p><b>Other enhancements in 6.11 include:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Cluster-aware Session Event Listener:</b>&nbsp;a new API has been added to replace the previous session properties listener. This brings the ability to listen for events related to sessions across a cluster of servers, as well as new filtering capabilities.</li>
<li><b>Topic View Scalar Path Mapping Extension:</b>&nbsp;an enhancement to allow topic views to include parent paths when creating views of the topic tree.</li>
<li><b>New &lsquo;Environment&rsquo; Session Property</b>: a new fixed session property has been added to provide additional information about connecting clients, and enable more powerful filtering of sessions.</li>
<li><b>New &lsquo;Matches&rsquo; Comparison for Session Filtering</b>: session filters can now make use of regular expressions for matching sessions.</li>
<li><b>Ability to Turn Delta Compression Off for Update Streams</b>: users can now suppress delta generation in update streams. Disabling delta compression can reduce the CPU workload at the client at the cost of increased bandwidth.</li>
<li><b>Fetching Topic Sizes</b>: it is now possible to fetch the sizes of topics without transferring the topic payload. &nbsp;Sizes are also displayed in the Diffusion Management Console.</li>
<li><b>Diffusion Management Console Improvements</b>: the Diffusion Management Console has had several improvements. These include a new intuitive way to define and manage topic views, and a new structural browser for JSON values.</li>

<div> Collaboration, Solactive, Evolve ETFs, Canada Utility Index, ETF
<br />
The Solactive Canada Utility Index, launched in partnership with Evolve ETFs, offers exposure to stable Canadian utility sectors with potential for long-term growth.
<br /><br />Summary: The index provides exposure to stable Canadian utility sectors, with potential for long-term growth through targeted and diversified investments. <div>
<p><strong>Solactive is pleased to announce the extension of its collaboration with Evolve ETFs with the launch of the Solactive Canada Utility Index. This index provides targeted exposure to essential industry sectors that form the backbone of Canada&rsquo;s economy, including utilities, pipelines, and telecommunications. These sectors are known for their low volatility and ability to generate consistent income, even in turbulent market environments, and are positioned to benefit from potential long-term trends.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.solactive.com/downloads/Guideline-Solactive-SOLCAUT.pdf">Solactive Canada Utility Index</a>, consists of the largest Canadian companies in the extended utility sector and ensures diversified exposure across the portfolio by equally weighting each component. The index first selects the top four companies by free float market capitalization from each of the three key categories: utilities, pipelines, and telecommunications. Subsequently, the ten remaining companies with the highest free-float market capitalization across all sectors are selected. This fully rule-based index is rebalanced quarterly to maintain an optimal mix of established market leaders and evolving players within the Canadian broader utility landscape.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The ETF listed on 4<span>th</span>&nbsp;September on the Toronto Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol &ldquo;UTES&rdquo;.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Timo Pfeiffer, Chief Markets Officer at Solactive, comments:</span>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;We are excited to partner with Evolve ETFs on this launch.

In today&rsquo;s market environment, characterized by economic uncertainty, market volatility, and declining interest rates, we believe utilities can be a valuable addition to client portfolios. UTES will employ our actively managed covered call strategy and modest 25% leverage to provide investors with enhanced, tax-efficient income.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>

<div> Private Debt, European SME Debt Fund III, BNP Paribas Asset Management, Senior Debt, Private Assets<br />
Summary: 
BNP Paribas Asset Management announced the final close of the BNP Paribas European SME Debt Fund III, with EUR 741 million, targeting SMEs and mid-caps in Continental Europe. The fund has won the confidence of around twenty institutional investors and is classified as Article 8 under SFDR. It targets a portfolio of 70 SMEs and Mid-caps that are champions in their respective sectors and has already financed more than 40 companies at this stage. The success of this third senior debt vintage demonstrates the relevance of the model implemented by BNP Paribas Asset Management's private asset platform, offering investors a differentiating product in this growing market. <div>
<p><span><strong>BNP Paribas Asset Management (&lsquo;BNPP AM&rsquo;) announces the final close of the BNP Paribas European SME Debt Fund III (&lsquo;Fund III&rsquo;), with EUR 741 million, above the initial target of EUR 600 million. The&nbsp;</strong><strong>SME Debt Fun</strong><strong>d III</strong><strong>&nbsp;fund finances Small and Medium sized Enterprises (&lsquo;SMEs&rsquo;) and Mid-cap companies in Continental Europe in the form of secured bullet loans. Since its creation in 2016, BNPP AM&rsquo;s private debt activity helped more than 250 companies develop their business with more than EUR 1.7 billion deployed.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>This third vintage has won the confidence of around twenty institutional investors from six different countries, including insurers, pension funds, asset managers and intergovernmental organizations. This success consolidates BNP Paribas Asset Management's position in the dynamic corporate private credit market. This fast-growing market offers investors the opportunity to diversify their asset allocation, with an attractive risk-return profile. It also provides successful companies with an additional opportunity to finance their long-term growth.</span></p>
<p><span>Fund III targets a portfolio of 70 SMEs and Mid-caps that are champions in their respective sectors and has already financed more than 40 companies at this stage. As per the two previous vintages, Fund III has a distinctive positioning in the private debt universe thanks to its very high granularity, combined with a strong selectivity of financing opportunities. This is made possible by the well-established partnership between the fund's management team and BNP Paribas' banking networks, which represent an important but not exclusive part of the identification of the financed companies.</span></p>
<p>Classified as Article 8 under SFDR<sup>1</sup>, Fund III integrates companies&rsquo; environmental and social characteristics in its investment process.</p>
<p><span>Christophe Carrasco, Head of Private Debt at BNPP AM, comments:</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Senior European private credit offers a compelling option for SMEs and mid-caps, as one of the key elements for a company to strengthen its leading position, or to bolster global innovation efforts. As far as investors are concerned, private credit offers an attractive risk-return profile with a significant illiquidity premium over the bond market with counterparties that have dominant positions in their specialised sectors.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>David Bouchoucha, Head of Private Assets at BNPP AM, adds:</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;The success of this third senior debt vintage demonstrates the relevance of the model implemented by our private asset platform. The combination of unique market access thanks to the BNP Paribas Group, with the selectivity of experienced management teams, and a rigorous attention to ESG criteria, makes it possible to offer investors a differentiating product in this growing market.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Fund III is managed by BNPP AM's Private Assets division, created in January 2023. It consists of more than 100 investment professionals and currently manages and advises EUR 40 million in assets.</span></p>

<div> Regulatory Guide 16, ASIC, external administrators, controllers, statutory reports<br />
Summary: ASIC updated guidance for reporting alleged misconduct by external administrators and controllers, focusing on professional judgment and timely reporting.<br /> <div>
<p>ASIC has today released its updated regulatory guidance for external administrators and controllers when reporting and lodging statutory reports about alleged misconduct.</p>
<p>The updates to Regulatory Guide 16&nbsp;<em>External administrators and controllers: Reporting of possible offences and misconduct</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/for-finance-professionals/registered-liquidators/applying-for-and-managing-your-liquidator-registration/rg-16-external-administrators-and-controllers-reporting-of-possible-offences-and-misconduct/" title="RG 16 External administrators - Reporting and lodging">RG 16</a>) follow&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-072mr-asic-consults-on-misconduct-reporting-guidance-for-external-administrators-and-controllers/" title="24-072MR ASIC consults on misconduct reporting guidance for external administrators and controllers">an extensive consultation process</a>&nbsp;that included targeted industry roundtables to seek input into our proposed changes.</p>
<p>ASIC released Consultation Paper 377&nbsp;<em>Guidance for reporting by external administrators and controllers: Updates to RG 16</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/consultations/cp-377-guidance-for-reporting-by-external-administrators-and-controllers-updates-to-rg-16/" title="CP 377 Guidance for reporting by external administrators and controllers: Updates to RG 16">CP 377</a>) in April 2024.</p>
<p>Our responses to the key issues raised by respondents in CP 377 included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a dedicated contact point for external administrators and controllers to raise questions with ASIC in relation to the preparation and lodgement of reports of misconduct. We encourage external administrators and controllers to raise questions through our new dedicated e-mail address &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:ISR&amp;SSRquestions@asic.gov.au">ISRandSSR.Questions@asic.gov.au</a></li>
<li>Retaining ASIC&rsquo;s existing guidance that external administrators and controllers can lodge multiple initial statutory reports to enable flexibility in reporting.</li>
<li>Retaining indicative timeframes given the importance of timely reporting. While we do not require lodgement within these timeframes, we encourage this approach.</li>
<li>Clarifying in the guidance that an external administrator or controller may use their professional judgement to form the view that it is necessary to undertake further inquiries to meet their reporting obligations in the particular circumstances. Our guidance is now focused on the minimum steps required to comply with the reporting obligations, and we have not included prescriptive guidance through checklists or examples for that reason.</li>
</ul>
<p>Report 793&nbsp;<em>Response to submissions on CP 377 Guidance for reporting by external administrators and controllers</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-793-response-to-submissions-on-cp-377-guidance-for-reporting-by-external-administrators-and-controllers/" title="REP 793 Response to submissions on CP 377 Guidance for reporting by external administrators and controllers">REP 793</a>) provides more detail on responses to the submissions received during the consultation process.</p>
<p>ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said, &lsquo;We appreciate the valuable feedback we received during the consultation on RG 16 which has sharpened the updates to our guidance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Our expectation is that external administrators and controllers will exercise their professional judgement in reporting misconduct to ASIC. Our updates to RG 16 are intended to clarify what external administrators and controllers need to report on and when, so that they can apply professional judgement with greater confidence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ms Court added, &lsquo;We are also working on a comprehensive review of our internal processes for ingesting, screening, analysing and, where required, acting on the reports we receive. We will consider the issues raised in the feedback we received during the consultation on RG 16 as part of that review.&rsquo;</p>
<p>ASIC will support members of the profession as they transition to the updated guidance through ongoing industry liaison. We will also continue to monitor whether we require any additional updates to RG 16 in response to law reform, case law or stakeholder feedback.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>RG 16 provides guidance to external administrators and controllers on their obligation to report to ASIC possible offences and misconduct, and for liquidations where the company may be unable to pay its unsecured creditors more than 50 cents in the dollar.</p>
<p>There have been a number of developments that have influenced the need for updates to RG 16. These include the expansion of case law, legislative reforms (including simplified liquidation reporting), and feedback from the inquiry into corporate insolvency in Australia by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services (the Committee).</p>
<p>In particular, the Committee recommended that until a comprehensive review of the current statutory reporting obligations can occur, ASIC should consider whether any timely changes can be made to the reporting thresholds and how it responds to insolvency practitioner reports.</p>

<div> enforce, CoFI, supervision, insurance, regulatory<br />
Summary:<br />
Jane Brown, Head of Insurance at FMA, discussed recent regulatory investigations, enforcement cases, the CoFI regime, and FMA's supervision approach. <div>
<p>Tēnā koutou katoa,</p>
<p>Ko Kōtirana te whakapaparanga mai,</p>
<p>Ko Manawatū te whenua tupu,</p>
<p>Ko Kiwitea te kāinga,</p>
<p>Kei Te Whanganui-a-Tara au e noho ana,</p>
<p>Ko Jane taku ingoa,</p>
<p>Tēnā tātou katoa.</p>
<p>Thank you for inviting me here. The title of my segment today is regulatory investigations. It&rsquo;s a serious topic and I will have to choose my words carefully. My aim in this speech is to apply more of a supervisory lens to give an overview of the last few years, and how the FMA and the insurance sector can best learn from recent enforcement cases and work together under the CoFI regulatory regime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those of you who don&rsquo;t know me, I&rsquo;m Jane Brown, Head of Insurance at the Financial Markets Authority. Before joining the FMA, I was the General Counsel at Te Kāhui Inihua o Aotearoa / The Insurance Council of New Zealand for six years. In my current role, I have built up the FMA&rsquo;s insurance team both in terms of numbers and understanding of the sector that we regulate ahead of CoFI coming into force. And because I take every opportunity I have to do so, I will say that I am very fortunate to have a team that is eager to engage with and understand the sector at both an operational, and also a strategic level.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s conference theme is &ldquo;regeneration&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a fitting theme for the city we are in given all that it and its people have been through. The FMA and the insurance sector are also on a regeneration journey of sorts, as we prepare for a new way of regulating the conduct of financial service providers. Additionally, there is an element of regeneration in terms of the FMA and the insurance sector&rsquo;s relationship &ndash; but more on that later.</p>
<h3>Recent cases</h3>
<p>The FMA and Reserve Bank of New Zealand&rsquo;s joint Conduct and Culture review of banks and life insurers in 2019, and the FMA&rsquo;s review of fire and general insurers in 2021, uncovered some examples of poor practices negatively impacting customers and unfair treatment. Now, no one at the FMA will talk about ongoing investigations, no matter who is standing on the stage, and my focus is on the supervision of insurers, so what I want to do here instead is look at what we as regulator, and you as regulated firms or representatives of regulated firms, can learn from recent cases.</p>
<p>In eight cases, the FMA&rsquo;s Enforcement team took civil proceedings under the Fair Dealing provisions within the Financial Markets Conduct Act. They stemmed from false or misleading statements in marketing material for financial products, and in many of the cases with insurance companies, were for failing to apply multi policy discounts to customers who were entitled to them. The FMA was particularly concerned by the length of time these failures went unchecked. Some cases stretched back decades, resulting in significant breaches, customer harm, and millions of overcharged premiums.</p>
<p>For the FMA this work was time and resource intensive, stretching over multiple years, in part due to the complexity and breadth of each issue.</p>
<p>In the FMA&rsquo;s view, and that of the Courts, the relationship between insurers and their customers is one of trust. Customers should rightfully expect to be treated fairly by their insurer and that agreements between the two parties will be honoured. The deficiencies in IT systems and lack of oversight by the insurers administering the products broke that trust.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t already, I encourage all of you to read the judgments that have come out of the proceedings we have taken, something I&rsquo;m also working my way through. They provide incredibly useful insights into the Court&rsquo;s view of bad conduct and what firms should be thinking about when considering what fair treatment looks like.</p>
<p>These issues were often associated with more than one product or one aspect of business. In these situations, the FMA expects firms to test other parts of their business, or other products, to ensure similar problems haven&rsquo;t arisen.</p>
<p>The FMA has also shown it is willing to use alternative regulatory tools available to it. In one case, the FMA chose to issue a warning to one provider for failings similar to the eight proceedings. This case was a good example of the FMA&rsquo;s action being proportionate to the seriousness of the offending, number of customers affected, and the remedial work undertaken by the provider.</p>
<h3>Self-Reporting</h3>
<p>A key issue that the response to the Conduct and Culture work has flushed out is self-reporting.</p>
<p>Among our minimum expectations for those we supervise, and for good conduct risk management, is that issues and potential breaches should be self-reported to the FMA. This is a sign that entities take their legal and licensing obligations seriously - and by informing us, they will endeavour to fix the issues quickly.</p>
<p>When the self-reported issues have the potential to reveal significant breaches or involve risks and harms to customers, we may investigate further and it can result in us using our regulatory or enforcement tools and remedies.</p>
<p>It is also worth reminding you of our view of what best practice &ldquo;self-reporting&rdquo; looks like. If there is an issue a firm discovers that requires remediation for customers, or shows that systems or processes are not delivering promised outcomes, that&rsquo;s not good news. But it is here where firms start to make the choices that matter. The right way or the wrong way. The right way involves promptly informing your board, bringing the issue to the FMA, and ensuring timely remediation and communication with customers.</p>
<p>Waiting until firms think the problems have fully bottomed out, before making first contact with the FMA, or your customers may be tempting. Instead, we urge firms to prioritise stopping the harm as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The choices an entity makes after discovering the problem will be relevant to the FMA&rsquo;s enforcement response and will often influence our view of the entity&rsquo;s overall conduct. However, self-reporting cannot provide immunity from potential action and even litigation, especially if the issues are significant, systemic or have led to customer harm.</p>
<p>The nature of the underlying misconduct itself will always be the driving factor in assessing the appropriate response. The more serious the misconduct &ndash; to consumers or to the market &ndash; the more likely it is we will take strong enforcement action, irrespective of how it was reported to us. And that makes sense, not just for the FMA, but for any law enforcement agency. The FMA has said it before &ndash; a confession does not absolve responsibility. No one thinks poor conduct or breaches of the law should go without accountability.</p>
<h3>CoFI</h3>
<p>Many of you will be aware of this recent history. But there is a key point I want to raise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the period before the Conduct of Financial Institutions regime comes into force. The only tools the FMA has to deal with the historic issues I&rsquo;ve set out is its fair dealing powers under the FMC Act. The FMA hasn&rsquo;t licensed insurers for conduct, there&rsquo;s no other tools for us to use other than investigations or enforcement. What CoFI does is provide us with a licensing regime, and a whole heap of tools such as monitoring, supervision, direction orders, stop orders, and the broader range of soft tools we have at our disposal, like guidance, like media interviews, like this speech.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would now like to turn to what the FMA&rsquo;s supervision approach will look like under CoFI. The Conduct of Financial Institutions regime (CoFI) introduces a new regulatory regime to ensure registered banks, licensed non-bank deposit takers, and in your case, licensed insurers, comply with the fair conduct principle when providing relevant services to consumers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fair conduct principle is the overarching principle of CoFI that a financial institution must treat consumers fairly. It is important that consumers get the financial products and services they need throughout their life, when they need them, and have trust and confidence that those products and services will perform as expected and meet customers' needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CoFI supports a greater focus on good conduct risk management and customer outcomes, proactively analysing how products are performing for customers (not just the business), communicating clearly and regularly with customers and acting quickly if something is not working as it should be. An outcomes focus&nbsp;requires thinking about and implementing good effective practice and the results this will achieve, not just complying with prescriptive rules set by law. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA sees this as a continual journey: good conduct and treating customers fairly needs to be ongoing and ever-evolving rather than being a one-off project. Embedding good practice now will smooth the transition to the new conduct regime &ndash; a good conduct programme is as much about change management and cultural change as it is about compliance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, to supervision. CoFI will allow the FMA to evolve into a more fully fledged conduct regulator with a range of proactive tools - as well as litigation where necessary - to influence conduct and consumer outcomes into the future. Fair dealing powers can only be reactive. They exist to correct behaviour where things have gone wrong. These are necessary, but not sufficient, for either preventing poor conduct outcomes or encouraging good outcomes.</p>
<p>Under CoFI we will be focusing more on the outcomes resulting from treatment of consumers rather than just on the methods financial institutions have chosen to comply with CoFI obligations. We believe that financial institutions know their businesses best and are best placed to determine the most effective actions to achieve CoFI obligations and objectives.</p>
<h3>And how do we assess conduct?</h3>
<ul>
<li>By running monitoring reviews to assess how firms are complying with obligations and demonstrating they are serving the needs of customers</li>
<li>Undertaking &lsquo;thematic reviews&rsquo; of the sector to understand how different firms conduct themselves on a particular topic of interest</li>
<li>Acting on information (such as complaints) from customers and market participants themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p>When investigations and action are required, we will still take an approach proportionate to the misconduct to achieve an appropriate market outcome. We are also committed to taking strong action and holding individuals and entities accountable when they break the law and fail to meet the standards that are expected of them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you or your clients are all well into the application process for your CoFI licence. With a little over six months until the regime gets underway, the FMA strongly encourages all firms that require a CoFI licence to get their application in before the end of 2024, to ensure a smooth transition into the regime that begins on 31 March 2025.</p>
<p>The FMA has received several applications so far, and approved more than half a dozen, but that&rsquo;s fewer than we would have expected by now given how close we are to go time. We are currently engaging closely with a wide variety of firms who need a licence and are proactively engaging with smaller firms in particular, such as non-bank deposit takers and Credit Unions.</p>
<p>Some firms have told us that they are likely to seek an exemption to requiring a fair conduct programme. There are also some firms who have indicated to us that they are likely to seek an exemption from the regime as a whole. We would really encourage those firms to have a Plan B, in terms of getting a CoFI licence. The law is very clear about what is expected. A licence application takes around 60 working days for the FMA to process. If a firm is not licensed by 31 March 2025, they will not be able to offer financial services for their retail customers. FMA staff are here to help and support firms in getting ready for CoFI, and we encourage firms to reach out if they have any questions. We are committed to an open and educative approach, so all financial markets participants&nbsp;have clear and well-understood responsibilities.</p>
<p>One of the other ways our regulatory approach is developing is in the ways we are thinking about the costs and benefits of our regulatory approach. Where it&rsquo;s appropriate, and where we are able, we&rsquo;ll look to remove unnecessary burden, and we always remain alert to how our actions can impact firms.</p>
<h3>Concluding statement</h3>
<p>So, in short, the FMA has been busy these past few years when it comes to its regulatory investigations. It has come at a time of significant change for both the FMA and the sector. We are moving from a reactive, to proactive supervisory approach of financial institutions under CoFI.</p>
<p>Our work in this space will continue and change as we embed the CoFI regime in our day-to-day operations. We won&rsquo;t be on this journey alone, we want to take you there with us, well hopefully not down the investigations route, but I hope you get my point.</p>
<p>The FMA, along with its Council of Financial Regulators partners, recently set its vision for New Zealand&rsquo;s insurance sector. We want an insurance sector that is forward-looking, fair, stable competitive and efficient, promoting informed and confident participation by consumers and businesses. We aim to do this by working with you all as part of a co-ordinated system of prudential and conduct regulators. CoFR will continue to work closely with you all to ensure that this vision is achieved.</p>
<p>I said this in my first speech as an FMA employee earlier this year but it&rsquo;s worth reiterating. We all want the same end result. That is for businesses to grow successfully and support their customers by treating them fairly and putting their interests at the heart of their decision-making. For those professionals that help industry with financial services regulation, we understand and support the work you do. We know that keeping an open dialogue with all our stakeholders will be critical to our success in both the short-term, delivering the up-coming changes, but also the long-term, in order to foster the fairest financial sector in the world.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Broker-Dealer Nationwide Planning And Two Affiliated Investment Advisers With Violating Whistleblower Protection Rule - NJ-Based Firms Impeded Clients From Voluntarily Reporting Information To The SEC</title>

<div> SEC, charges, settlement, violations, whistleblower
Summary:
SEC announces charges against three affiliated registrants for impeding clients from reporting violations. Firms to pay $240,000 in penalties. Violations of whistleblower protection rule.<br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against three affiliated registrants, Commission-registered broker-dealer Nationwide Planning Associates, Inc. and investment adviser NPA Asset Management, LLC, and state-registered investment adviser Blue Point Strategic Wealth Management, LLC, for impeding brokerage customers and advisory clients from reporting securities law violations to the SEC. The firms agreed to pay combined civil penalties of $240,000 to settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, from May 2021 through February 2024, Nationwide, NPA, and Blue Point collectively asked 11 retail clients to sign confidentiality agreements in connection with payments made by the entities to the clients&rsquo; investment accounts. The payments were intended to compensate the clients for losses caused by the firms&rsquo; alleged breaches of federal or state securities laws. The order finds that the agreements contained provisions that impeded clients from reporting potential securities law violations to the SEC by permitting communications only where the SEC first initiated an inquiry. As described in the order, some of the agreements further required the clients to represent that they had not reported the underlying dispute to the SEC or to another securities regulator and would forever refrain from such reporting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pure and simple, investors need to be able to report complaints or evidence of wrongdoing to the SEC without impediment,&rdquo; said Corey Schuster, Co-Chief of the Enforcement Division&rsquo;s Asset Management Unit.&nbsp; &ldquo;We will continue to hold firms accountable for putting roadblocks between us and their investors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that Nationwide, NPA, and Blue Point each violated Rule 21F-17(a) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, a whistleblower protection rule that prohibits taking any action to impede an individual from communicating directly with SEC staff about possible securities law violations. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, Nationwide, NPA, and Blue Point each agreed to be censured and to cease and desist from violating the whistleblower protection rule. They further agreed to a combined penalty, which was apportioned according to their relative size and financial condition, with NPA agreeing to pay $160,000, Nationwide $70,000, and Blue Point $10,000.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Chantal Russell of the SEC&rsquo;s Home Office and Marilyn Ampolsk of the Asset Management Unit, with assistance from Deborah Russell, and was supervised by Virginia Rosado Desilets, Mr. Schuster, and Andrew Dean of the Asset Management Unit.</p>

<title>IMF: Financial And Regulatory Reform Agenda Contributed To Accelerating Saudi Economy's Growth</title>

<div> International Monetary Fund, Saudi Arabia, economic reforms, Vision 2030, non-oil sector<br />
Summary:<br />
IMF praises Saudi Arabia's economic reforms, Vision 2030 progress, diversification, women's labor participation, non-oil sector growth, financial resilience, environmental reforms. <div>
<div class="content" id="ReleaseContent">
<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) issued a positive report on the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia following the conclusion of the Article IV consultations with Saudi Arabia. The IMF report confirmed that Saudi Arabia's financial and regulatory reform agenda contributed to accelerating the Saudi economy's growth, containing inflation, and reducing the unemployment rate to its lowest levels ever. The IMF praised the ongoing economic transformation and efforts to diversify the economy under the Saudi Vision 2030.</p>
<p>The IMF Article IV Consultation report commended the macroeconomic policies and transformational changes implemented by the Kingdom, which contributed to enhancing the growth of non-oil activities. The report also noted that Saudi reforms led to rising employment, which now exceeds pre-Covid figures, and that the rate of women's participation in the labor market rose to more than 35%, exceeding the Saudi Vision 2030 target of 30%.</p>
<p>The IMF welcomed Saudi Arabia's measures of conducting the long-term financing planning that supports the implementation of the initiatives, programs, and projects of Vision 2030; while mitigating the risks of overheating. The report also stressed that the Kingdom's fiscal space is strong, and that sovereign debt risks are low, adding that the abundance of financial reserves in Saudi Arabia has limited the impact of global and regional challenges.</p>
<p>The IMF report stressed that the ongoing reforms in the Kingdom&mdash;including ensuring the effective implementation of regulations, streamlining fees, enhancing human capital, increasing the participation of Saudi women in the labor market, facilitating access to land and financing, and improving governance&mdash;have contributed to enhancing private sector growth and attracting more foreign direct investment, in addition to the significant progress in the field of digital transformation and artificial intelligence that support these efforts.</p>
<p>The IMF Executive Directors commended Saudi's leadership role in multilateral fora, including its chairmanship of the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) in the IMF, contributing to efforts to address global challenges.</p>
<p>The report also noted the increased activity in the services sector&mdash;including transportation, trade, tourism and finance&mdash;as the growth in consumption that reached 5.7%.</p>
<p>The IMF said that foreign investment license applications reached record levels in 2023, as they approximately doubled from 2022, including the 330 companies applying for licenses to establish their regional headquarters in the Kingdom.</p>
<p>The report reviewed the banking sector developments in the Kingdom, stressing its strong levels of solvency and liquidity, and its flexibility to shocks. The IMF noted that the banking sector is on strong footing, and also noted the efficiency of banking mediation, according to indicators of profitability, infrastructure, and competitiveness.</p>
<p>The IMF report also noted the rise in the Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul) index of 14.2% in 2023, surpassing the Morgan Stanley Emerging Markets Index of 7%, while noting the progress in the technical environment enabling investment, and the licensing of three digital banks. The IMF stressed their contribution to enhancing financial inclusion and competitiveness as these banks are characterized by flexibility and innovation.</p>
<p>The IMF noted the Kingdom's containment of risks resulting from the rapid growth of real estate lending, through diverse government support, the strength of banks, full recourse mortgages, and other supportive measures. It also highlighted improvements in automating the national assessment matrix for money laundering and terrorist financing risks, and enhancing the accuracy of data analysis related to risks received from reporting entities, including fintech companies.</p>
<p>The IMF report noted that the increase in non-oil revenues reflects the effectiveness of existing reforms, which directly contributed to enhancing compliance, praising the alignment of customs procedures with international best practices.</p>
<p>The IMF expected the non-oil sector (which includes government activities) to grow by 3.5% in 2024, supported by strong domestic demand. The IMF also stated that it is probable the inflation rate in the Kingdom remains stable at around 2% over the medium term, supported by the Saudi Riyals peg to the US dollar, and local policies consistent with Saudi Vision 2030.</p>
<p>The IMF confirmed that the Kingdom has one of the lowest carbon intensity levels among all major producers, due to ongoing environmental reforms and the Kingdom's efforts to achieve net zero by 2060. The report noted the Kingdom's success in securing a 30-year purchase agreement for the green hydrogen project in NEOM, to achieve its efforts to utilize renewable energy sources.</p>
<p>In order to sequester approximately 44 million tons annually by 2035, the IMF noted that the Saudi government intends to build one of the largest carbon capture and storage plants in the world, which will be operational by 2027, with a capacity of 9 million tons of carbon dioxide annually. The IMF noted the Kingdom's current efforts to sequester 1.3 million tons of carbon annually through the SABIC Plant and Uthmaniyah Gas Plant Department.</p>

<title>FINRA Campaign Urges New Investors To Take Key Steps Before Trading - ‘Get Your Head In The Trade’ By Setting Goals, Knowing Your Risk Tolerance, And Understanding How Investments Can Make Or Lose Money</title>

<div> campaign, new investors, social media, risks, FINRA <br />
Summary: FINRA launches online campaign to educate new investors about risks and rewards, targeting social media users and promoting informed decision-making. <br /> <div>
<p>FINRA has launched an online advertising campaign,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/tradesmart">Get Your Head in the Trade</a>, encouraging new investors to understand investment risks and rewards as well as their own financial goals and risk tolerance before making an investment decision. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Millions of investors enter the market each year, about half of them are self-directed, and many are using social media as a primary source of information. FINRA is expanding our outreach to meet investors where they are and provide resources to help them make informed investment decisions,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/about/governance/executives#board">Marcia Asquith, Executive Vice President, Board and External Relations at FINRA</a>.</p>
<p>The campaign will run for three months on various platforms, including Instagram, YouTube, Spotify and Yahoo! Finance. The ads link to a new web page,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/tradesmart">FINRA.org/tradesmart</a>, designed to equip new investors with knowledge, skills and tools.</p>
<p>There are two video ads in the campaign:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/M4r9ZPiQ_Z4" target="_blank">"Meghan Gets a Stock Alert&rdquo;</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/Gk_aywg9Zs4" target="_blank">&ldquo;Meghan Checks an AI Pick&rdquo;</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one of several social media posts in the campaign:<br /><br /><img alt="Am I trading under the finfluence?" src="https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/2024-09/head_in_game.png" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />According to data from the FINRA Investor Education Foundation&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finrafoundation.org/sites/finrafoundation/files/NFCS-Investor-Report-Changing-Landscape.pdf" target="_blank">National Financial Capability Study</a>, investors who are new, younger or use social media for investing information are more likely than more experienced investors to engage in riskier behaviors. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over half of new investors invest in crypto assets, nearly one-third trade options, and about one-in-five purchase securities on margin.</li>
<li>Holding microcap or penny stocks in one&rsquo;s investment portfolio was associated with using social media for investment information.&nbsp;</li>
<li>About 26 percent of social media users traded more than 10 times a month compared with about 17 percent of non-social media users.</li>
</ul>
<p>The campaign is the latest in a series of FINRA initiatives begun in 2021 recognizing the growing number of new, self-directed investors in the market. These efforts include a new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/_finra/" target="_blank">Instagram channel</a>; an ongoing series of discussions at college campuses around the screening of Optimist&rsquo;s award-winning documentary,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97-M2w05ixI" target="_blank">This is Not Financial Advice</a>&nbsp;and other initiatives to be announced.</p>

<title>New Challenge Seeks To Tackle Online Crypto Investment Fraud With Innovation - Partnership Between Alberta Securities Commission, Edmonton Police Foundation And Edmonton Police Service Welcomes Proposals To Combat Rising Scams</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> partnership, crypto investment fraud, challenge, protection, technology <br />
The Alberta Securities Commission has partnered with the Edmonton Police Foundation to launch a challenge to address online crypto investment fraud.<br /><br />Summary: The partnership aims to combat crypto investment fraud and protect Alberta investors through innovative solutions and collaboration. <div>
<p>The Alberta Securities Commission (ASC) has partnered with the Edmonton Police Foundation (EPF) and the Edmonton Police Service (EPS) to launch the ScamShield: Investor Protection Challenge to seek new and innovative solutions to address the growing threat of online crypto investment fraud.<br /><br />As part of EPF&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://edmontonpolicefoundation.com/community/csa/">Community Solutions Accelerator (CSA)</a>, the challenge is designed to complement the work already being done by the ASC and police. With a prize pool of up to $130,000, this challenge calls for innovative solutions to enhance investor protection and strengthen Alberta&rsquo;s capital market.<br /><br />The ASC estimates that more than 60 per cent of the $309 million of investment fraud reported to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre in 2023 was tied to crypto investment frauds. In Edmonton alone, there were more than 80 victims with combined losses of over $7,000,000 last year. The true amount is likely higher because these crimes are vastly underreported. Those that do report provide valuable information on how scams are growing and evolving. This helps inform law enforcement's approach to addressing these scams.<br /><br />&ldquo;Anyone can be the victim of a scam and the impact can be devastating,&rdquo; said Cynthia Campbell, Director of Enforcement at the ASC. &ldquo;We are partnering with the EPF and EPS and hoping to engage more disciplines so that together we can find new ways to address this significant issue, protect more Alberta investors, and strengthen our capital market.&rdquo;<br /><br />Many victims do not consider themselves investors but get lured into a scam believing it can help solve their financial troubles. Fraudsters leverage technology and psychological manipulation to deceive investors through social media deepfake scams, romance scams, emotional manipulation and other online tactics.&nbsp;<br /><br />Preventing online crypto investment fraud requires a multi-pronged approach. This challenge provides an opportunity for those in academia, technology, and innovation to work together with enforcement partners to propose new and novel ways to stop further victimization locally and potentially on a national scale.&nbsp;<br /><br />&ldquo;Online crypto investment fraud has become a preferred technique for scammers, taking advantage of the general public&rsquo;s lack of experience with crypto as a high-risk investment vehicle, and the inherent challenges in tracing cryptocurrency transactions,&rdquo; said Deputy Chief Devin Laforce with the EPS Investigations and Support Services Bureau. &ldquo;As technological developments create new opportunities, criminals continually refine their methods, exploiting the digital economy in increasingly creative ways. Police continue to investigate and pursue these criminals to the fullest extent of the law, but the pervasiveness of their tactics makes this an issue we cannot tackle alone.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;The Edmonton Police Foundation recognizes the importance of collaboration in combatting complex crime issues,&rdquo; said Ashif Mawji, board member of EPF. &ldquo;By working hand in hand with the EPS and ASC, we can support law enforcement efforts, provide additional resources, and foster innovation to address emerging threats effectively.&rdquo;<br /><br />Officially launching today, challenge submissions will be accepted until November 4, 2024. More information on eligibility and evaluation criteria can be found online at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.herox.com/scamshield" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">www.herox.com/scamshield</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />EPS and the EPF were the first to bring the CSA approach to policing in North America in 2020. The CSA leverages expertise, data, technology, and support from multiple sources to work collectively on challenges that have been identified by the community, social agencies, healthcare, and law enforcement.<br /><br />The ASC is the regulatory agency responsible for administering the province's securities laws. It is entrusted with fostering a fair and efficient capital market in Alberta and with protecting investors. As a member of the Canadian Securities Administrators, the ASC works to improve, coordinate and harmonize the regulation of Canada's capital markets.</p>

<div> DeFi, Uniswap Protocol, CFTC, Leveraged Tokens, Ethereum blockchain
Summary: Commissioner dissents in DeFi enforcement action, citing lack of evidence and regulatory overreach, advocates for balanced approach to innovation. <br /><br /> <div>
<p><span><span><span><span>I respectfully dissent on&nbsp;<i>In re Universal Navigation Inc.</i>, a decentralized finance (DeFi) enforcement action involving the Uniswap Protocol</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;on the Ethereum blockchain, because there is no evidence in the administrative record that describes the specific terms and/or characteristics of the &ldquo;Leveraged Tokens&rdquo; as characterized in the settlement order. Without such information, it is not possible to perform an appropriate product legal analysis of the Leveraged Tokens to determine whether they are a CFTC-jurisdictional product, and, therefore, whether the CFTC has the authority to bring this enforcement action in the first place and whether a violation of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) or CFTC regulations has actually occurred.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>This case is about whether there were leveraged, margined, or financed commodity transactions by persons that are not eligible contract participants (ECPs) and there was no actual delivery of the commodity within 28 days. If so, then that transaction is required to be executed on a futures exchange. But the CFTC&rsquo;s novel approach today is legally simplistic and conveniently cuts corners to create a pretext for enforcement.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>For example, I am puzzled how we can charge the Respondent based upon no evidence beyond the word &ldquo;leveraged&rdquo; appearing in the names of these tokens. Consequently, applying the logic of the CFTC&rsquo;s legal argument, it seems that any commercial transaction to purchase a cow, a bushel of oats, or a barrel of oil that involves the word &ldquo;financed&rdquo; and is delivered&nbsp;in 30 days&nbsp;is a violation of Section 4(a) of the CEA pursuant to Section 2(c)(2)(D) and needs to be executed on a futures exchange.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;I am skeptical that the CFTC would try to enforce these statutory provisions outside of DeFi&mdash;what if the delivery of financed cows was supposed to be within 28 days, but the train was delayed and arrived in 29 days? According to the CFTC&rsquo;s legal argument in today&rsquo;s order, those financed cows in the cash market would have to be sold on a futures exchange, not at a cattle stockyard. Obviously, if the CFTC were to broadly apply this strict interpretation of the law, it would have the absurd result of bringing the U.S. economy and global commodity markets to a halt. It is no surprise that the legislative history does not support the CFTC&rsquo;s novel approach in today&rsquo;s order.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Further, as I have stated before, I believe it is a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) for the Commission to establish such sweeping interpretations in an administrative settlement order, rather than engage in notice-and-comment rulemaking, particularly when such interpretations impact a broad swath of the economy. As I have previously stated, &ldquo;Major questions are best addressed through a transparent process that engages the public to develop appropriate policy with expert input&mdash;through notice-and-comment rulemaking pursuant to the APA. Regulatory clarity comes from being out in the open, not in the dark.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>I am concerned that the Commission&rsquo;s ever-expanding jurisdictional overreach continues to perpetuate a lack of regulatory clarity not only regarding digital assets, but more significantly, for our cash commodity markets where every day, a farmer, rancher, or producer needs to use credit&mdash;financing&mdash;to grow and produce the food on our dinner tables. Therefore, I must dissent on the basis that this administrative proceeding is both legally unsupported under the CEA and is a violation of the APA, in addition to the serious public policy concerns that this settlement order will create further regulatory uncertainty, put small cash market businesses in jeopardy of violating the law, and stifle American innovation.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>This DeFi case may very well be a regulatory allergic reaction to new technology. But this reaction is not realistic or sustainable. We live in an age of technological transformation that impacts every aspect of our day-to-day lives&mdash;from the Now Economy to the Gig Economy and the Creator Economy. This era of human invention and productivity is characterized by increasingly direct connections among ordinary people and the empowerment of the individual with an app as the center of the overall Digital Economy. The world has changed from B2B to B2C to C2C,</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;and there is no turning back the clock.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Emerging technologies like the blockchain and decentralized protocols that enable the direct peer-to-peer connection that underpins the consumer-driven shifts already underway in sectors such as retail, entertainment, and financial services, have the potential to write a brand-new chapter in our Nation&rsquo;s rich history of ingenuity and opportunity&mdash;the embodiment of the American Dream. With technology, anyone with a big idea and access to capital can start a business. This inclusion in the New Economy can lift people and families up and change their circumstances. When opportunity knocks, it makes no sense to slam shut the door.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>It is imperative that regulators fully understand and holistically address these significant shifts in market structure through a carefully considered and forward-looking approach that appropriately balances robust protections and guardrails while enabling innovations and technological advancements that promote economic growth and access to markets. I continue to urge that the Commission consider all the tools besides enforcement actions that we can use to develop policy, like my previous suggestions for public roundtables,</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;time-limited pilot programs,</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;and considering the recommendations and reports from the CFTC&rsquo;s advisory committees,</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;including the Global Markets Advisory Committee (GMAC) that I sponsor. Commissioner Mersinger has also previously shared her views on the Commission&rsquo;s approach to DeFi.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Undoubtedly, there can be fraud in DeFi markets, as in any marketplace. I believe the CFTC can and should vigorously pursue fraud and manipulation in our markets and bring bad actors to justice. But that is not what this case is about. It is regretful that the Commission&rsquo;s action today is instead a misguided and rushed attempt to beat the SEC to the punch and claim jurisdiction over DeFi.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;The Uniswap Protocol is a &ldquo;suite of persistent, non-upgradable smart contracts that together create an automated market maker, a protocol that facilitates peer-to-peer market making and swapping of ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain,&rdquo;&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.uniswap.org/concepts/overview">https://docs.uniswap.org/concepts/overview</a>. Automated market makers (AMM) are common in trading and markets, and both U.S. and non-U.S. authorities have regulatory frameworks for the use of AMMs to mitigate risks and ensure market integrity. I have repeatedly stated that the Commission should examine existing regulations applicable to the use of AMMs and algorithmic trading, and consider whether those regulations apply to market operators and market participants that utilize DeFi protocols. To illustrate this point, regulators do not bring enforcement actions against algorithms&mdash;regulators bring enforcement actions against those who engage in trading activity in violation of the law, whether algorithms were involved or not. It is the trading activity, not the technology, that matters.</span></span></span></span></p>

Under the CEA, the definition of &ldquo;retail&rdquo; is broad and means persons who are non-ECPs. Accordingly, &ldquo;retail&rdquo; encompasses not only individuals, but many small businesses like family farms or small growers, producers, and merchants&mdash;commercial end-users that are the bedrock of the U.S. agricultural economy.</span></span></span></span></p>

<div> The Music Man, 1957, artificial intelligence, Securities and Exchange Commission, disclosures<br />
Summary: The 1957 musical The Music Man is used to illustrate the importance of truthful disclosures about artificial intelligence in the financial markets. <div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>This video can be viewed at the below&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzKEQfG5OZk">link</a>.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-office-hours-ai-washing-090424#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;  




</p>
<p>What might a 1957 Tony Award winning musical,&nbsp;<i>The Music Man</i>, have to do with artificial intelligence and the Securities and Exchange Commission?</p>
<p>Well, if you guessed it was that the musical came out the same year that I was born, that's not it. It's something else.</p>
<p><i>The Music Man</i>&nbsp;is a story about a Professor Harold Hill, a traveling salesman who cons the town of River City, Iowa into purchasing musical instruments for their children.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we've seen time and again a similar story in the financial markets.</p>
<p>When new technologies come along they can create buzz. And that buzz is used, possibly, to make false claims to investors, similar to Professor Hill. Yet, embedded in our securities laws is a basic bargain based on truthfulness. Investors get to decide in what they invest as long as there is full, fair, and truthful disclosure.</p>
<p>Well, as we've seen an increase in the disclosures around artificial intelligence by SEC registrants, public companies as you know them, it's important that companies making these disclosures remember that the basics of the securities laws still apply.</p>
<p>You see, any claims about prospects should have a reasonable basis and investors should be told that basis. And when disclosing material risk about artificial intelligence and a company may face multiple risks, including operational, legal, competitive, investors benefit from disclosures that are particular to the company, not just boilerplate language.</p>
<p>Companies should ask themselves some basic questions, such as if we're discussing artificial intelligence in our earnings calls or having extensive discussions with our board of directors, maybe this information is potentially material to our business and to investors. If so, disclosure may be required under the securities laws.</p>
<p>Further, companies may be required to define for investors what they mean when referring to AI. How and where is it being used at the company? Is it being developed by the company or supplied by others?</p>
<p>Investment advisers, broker dealers also should not mislead the public by saying they're using AI when they're not, nor say that they're using it in a particular way and not do so.</p>
<p>Such AI washing, whether it's by companies raising money or by financial intermediaries like investment advisers and broker dealers, may violate the securities laws.</p>
<p>So if you are AI washing, as Professor Hill sang, &ldquo;Ya Got Trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Dissenting Statement Of CFTC Commissioner Summer K. Mersinger Regarding Settlement With Uniswap Labs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> enforcement, DeFi, regulation, CFTC, innovation
<br />
Summary: The dissenting statement criticizes the CFTC's enforcement approach to DeFi, arguing for rulemaking, cost of compliance, and hindering innovation.<br /><br /> <div>
<p>Today, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (&ldquo;CFTC&rdquo; or &ldquo;Commission&rdquo;) once again swings its proverbial enforcement &ldquo;hammer&rdquo; against another DeFi protocol.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that the Commodity Exchange Act (&ldquo;CEA&rdquo;) and CFTC rules were written for traditional, centralized market infrastructure providers and intermediaries, it was my hope that one day soon the Commission would consider rulemaking, or at the very least guidance, making clear how DeFi protocols could comply with them.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp; Unfortunately, today is not that day.</p>
<p>Regulation Through Enforcement<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3">[3]</a></p>
<p>This case has all the hallmarks of what we have come to know as regulation through enforcement: &nbsp;A settlement with a&nbsp;<i>de minimis</i>&nbsp;penalty that bears little relationship to the conduct alleged, sweeping statements about the broader industry that are not germane to the case at hand, and legal theories that have not been tested in court.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Using our enforcement authorities against DeFi protocols instead of providing clarity through notice-and-comment rulemaking risks driving responsible DeFi developers overseas to create businesses, jobs, and economic activity away from the United States&mdash;leaving behind the bad actors and criminals who are only interested in taking advantage of American citizens.</p>
<p>Additionally, if we continue with this enforcement-first approach, one or several DeFi protocols we target may choose to litigate rather than settle out of court.&nbsp; Facing litigation in these cases will not only come at the cost of expending substantial government (and private sector) resources,<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5">[5]</a>&nbsp;but also risks a morass of court cases yielding mixed results and conflicting conclusions.</p>
<p>The CFTC is not the only agency struggling with an increase in regulation through enforcement, but it is my hope that we will stop using what is often a short-sighted tactic.&nbsp; Wielding the hammer of enforcement against these DeFi protocols may result in some short-term &ldquo;wins,&rdquo; but in the long-term, without more, it will only create problems.</p>
<p>The Cost of Doing the Right Thing</p>
<p>In addition, I fear this settlement creates a distorted precedent for future Commission actions&mdash;penalizing efforts to comply with the law.</p>
<p>Uniswap created, offered, and maintained a protocol that allowed for trading of leveraged tokens by third parties, all facts that support the charges in this settlement.&nbsp; But, Uniswap also took proactive measures, attempting to block trading of leveraged tokens.&nbsp; In fact, Uniswap blocked the particular tokens at issue in this settlement after the Commission&rsquo;s settlement in a previous &ldquo;DeFi Sweep&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6">[6]</a>&nbsp;involving those same tokens.</p>
<p>Rather than applauding Uniswap for being attentive to our enforcement efforts and initiating steps to respond to our approach in policing the DeFi space, we brought charges against Uniswap covering the time period before those particular tokens were blocked from its platform.&nbsp; For those in the DeFi community trying to comply with the CEA and CFTC regulations, the only take-away this settlement offers is the approximate cost the Commission assigns to an attempt by DeFi to do the right thing.</p>
<p>Misaligned Priorities</p>
<p>The decision to devote resources to this case also raises concerns about the Commission&rsquo;s enforcement priorities.&nbsp; Uniswap did not act as a liquidity provider, extend credit, actively trade leveraged tokens, or collect trading fees on transactions in the leveraged tokens at issue.&nbsp; Additionally, no harm to the market or to customers has been alleged in this matter.&nbsp; For every case we bring against a DeFi protocol where there are no allegations of fraud or complaints of customers losing money, we risk taking resources from a case where innocent victims suffer actual financial harm at the hands of a real fraudster.</p>
<p>In his recent testimony to Congress regarding the CFTC&rsquo;s budget, Chairman Behnam discussed the need to prioritize agency resources due to growing fraud targeting retail traders in digital asset markets:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nowhere have we been more active than in the digital asset space&hellip;&hellip;.&nbsp; With many agency resources which are not considered in our budget appropriation being allocated to an unregulated market, I fear the current trajectory is unsustainable. Namely, we will continue to see rampant fraud and manipulation in the digital asset market that will hurt American customers, and possibly infect the traditional financial markets.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7">[7]</a></p>
<p>I share the Chairman&rsquo;s concern that &ldquo;the current trajectory is unsustainable,&rdquo; and this concern is heightened when we use our enforcement resources to investigate DeFi activity where there is no documented harm or no significant profit to the DeFi protocol stemming from the activity at issue, as well as where we see proactive steps toward compliance.</p>
<p>We are currently in the midst of an epidemic of financial fraud. &nbsp;Fraud known as &ldquo;Pig Butchering&rdquo; alone may account for up to $75 billion in losses to victims and is a huge source of funding for trans-national criminal syndicates.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8">[8]</a>&nbsp; I commend the Commission for providing customer alerts on Pig Butchering and other online frauds and scams, for bringing its first case involving Pig Butchering in December 2023, and especially for recently hosting the first interagency conference to combat Pig Butchering.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9">[9]</a>&nbsp; But we must do more to fight this fraud&mdash;and critically, that means using our finite resources wisely.</p>
<p>No Room for Innovation</p>
<p>The concept of platform liability is complex.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10">[10]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;While there may be some instances where a platform could be liable for conduct occurring by using its protocol, the broad extension of such liability absent aggravating facts is disturbing.</p>
<p>Through this settlement, the Commission appears to be taking the position that any DeFi platform could be liable for any and all conduct occurring on its protocol.&nbsp; The practical effect of this approach is to severely chill the launching of any DeFi protocol within the United States and to significantly increase the odds that all DeFi innovation and economic activity will occur elsewhere. &nbsp;This theory of liability also raises a broader question about whether the Commission is fulfilling its responsibility under the CEA to promote &ldquo;responsible innovation&rdquo; (not stifle it), which Congress included as a central tenet of the CFTC&rsquo;s mission.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11">[11]</a></p>
<p>The word &ldquo;responsible&rdquo; in front of the word &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; in Congress&rsquo; statement of the CFTC&rsquo;s mission was deliberate, because we all know that innovation can just as easily be used by&nbsp;criminals.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12">[12]</a>&nbsp; For example, in the 1930s, new faster cars allowed criminals to escape from crime scenes and to engage in crime sprees across multiple states.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13">[13]</a>&nbsp; To stem this tide of crime in the so-called &ldquo;Public Enemy Era,&rdquo; Congress, the Department of Justice, and the FBI chose to meet this threat by passing new laws, adopting regulations, and stepping up law enforcement capabilities,<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14">[14]</a>&nbsp;that targeted the criminals, not the invention they used in committing their crimes.</p>
<p>But, imagine if J. Edgar Hoover had charged Henry Ford with liability for the crimes of John Dillinger and Bonny and Clyde because the Ford V8 was central to their ability to commit crimes.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15">[15]</a>&nbsp; This result is the natural endpoint of the Commission&rsquo;s logic that is at play in this settlement.</p>
<p>Continuing to bring and settle these cases with DeFi platforms is not in line with the CFTC&rsquo;s objectives and vision.&nbsp; This settlement and the Commission&rsquo;s earlier &ldquo;DeFi Sweep&rdquo; settlements raise transparency questions and concerns around the CFTC&rsquo;s commitment to its stated goals.&nbsp; Our 2022-2026 Strategic Plan acknowledged that &ldquo;innovations such as DeFi require extensive stakeholder engagement,&rdquo; and specifically called out DeFi as an area to &ldquo;[i]ncrease stakeholder engagement and leverage principles-based regulation.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16">[16]</a></p>
<p>Again, I quote Chairman Behnam&rsquo;s recent testimony:</p>
<p>Today, technology is driving change in the financial markets, and the CFTC must keep pace in order to fulfill its mission and Congressional mandate. Our work centers on customer protection and market resiliency, while supporting continued growth and innovation that will take the agency into the next 50 years.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17">[17]</a></p>
<p>Enforcement actions like this undercut the credibility of our Strategic Plan and are contrary both to our statutory mission to promote responsible innovation and to our own publicly-stated Core Value of &ldquo;transparency to market participants about our rules and processes.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18">[18]</a></p>
<p>A Better Way Forward</p>
<p>Unlike the broader regulatory uncertainty within the crypto markets, the CFTC has exclusive regulatory jurisdiction over DeFi protocols involved in derivatives transactions.&nbsp; This enables the Commission to issue regulations that promote responsible innovation &ndash; while achieving our other statutory and regulatory objectives&mdash;by finding a way for protocols that want to comply with the law and to operate within a regulated, environment to be able to do so.</p>
<p>Notice-and-comment rulemaking would provide the DeFi community, consumer advocates, industry representatives, and the American public with the opportunity to engage with the Commission and utilize their expertise and experience to suggest how DeFi could properly be regulated while remaining true to our obligations under the CEA.</p>
<p>Regulation through enforcement is at best a band-aid.&nbsp; At some point, the Commission must engage in a rulemaking process around DeFi and consider our role in promoting responsible innovation for the future of the U.S. derivatives markets.</p>
<p>For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>

<title>CFTC Issues Order Against Uniswap Labs For Offering Illegal Digital Asset Derivatives Trading</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-issues-order-against-uniswap-labs-for-offering-illegal-digital-asset-deriva/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-issues-order-against-uniswap-labs-for-offering-illegal-digital-asset-deriva/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, as part of its continuing enforcement focus in the digital asset decentralized finance (DeFi) space, today issued an order filing and settling charges against&nbsp;Universal Navigation Inc. d/b/a Uniswap Labs, a Delaware company based in New York. The order finds Uniswap Labs illegally offered leveraged or margined retail commodity transactions in digital assets via a decentralized digital asset trading protocol.&nbsp;The order requires Uniswap Labs to pay a $175,000 civil monetary penalty and to cease and desist from violating the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), as charged.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s action demonstrates once again the Division of Enforcement will vigorously enforce the CEA as digital asset platforms and DeFi ecosystems evolve&rdquo; said Director of Enforcement Ian McGinley. &ldquo;DeFi operators must be vigilant to ensure that transactions comply with the law.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Case Background&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uniswap Labs contributed to the development, and deployed versions, of a blockchain-based digital asset protocol that offered to non-Eligible Contract Participants and institutional users in the United States and abroad the ability to trade digital assets through use of the Ethereum blockchain. The protocol allows users to create and trade with liquidity pools, which consist of a matched pair of digital assets that are valued against each other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to facilitate access to the protocol, Uniswap Labs developed and maintained a web interface that it made available to users. Through&nbsp;the interface, users could trade in hundreds of liquidity pools on the protocol.&nbsp;Among the digital assets traded on the protocol and through the interface were a limited number of leveraged tokens, which provided users leveraged exposure to digital assets such as Ether and Bitcoin.&nbsp;The order finds these leveraged tokens are leveraged or margined commodity transactions that did not result in actual delivery within 28 days and therefore can be offered to non-Eligible Contract Participants only on a board of trade that has been designated or registered by the CFTC as a contract market, which Uniswap Labs was not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As stated in the order, the CFTC recognizes Uniswap Labs&rsquo; substantial cooperation with the Division of Enforcement&rsquo;s investigation of this matter in the form of a reduced civil monetary penalty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this matter are Devin Cain, K. Brent Tomer, Lenel Hickson, Jr., and Manal M. Sultan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* * * * * * *&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CFTC strongly urges the public to verify a company&rsquo;s registration with the CFTC before committing funds. &nbsp;If unregistered, a customer should be wary of providing funds to that company. A company&rsquo;s registration status can be found using&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nfa.futures.org/basicnet">NFA BASIC</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;More information can be found at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/check">cftc.gov/check</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Customers and other individuals can report suspicious activities or information, such as possible violations of commodity trading laws, to the Division of Enforcement via a toll-free hotline 866-FON-CFTC (866-366-2382),&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cftc.gov/ConsumerProtection/FileaTiporComplaint/index.htm">file a tip or complaint</a>&nbsp;online, or contact the CFTC Whistleblower Office at whistleblower.gov. Whistleblowers are eligible to receive between 10 and 30 percent of the monetary sanctions collected paid from the CFTC Customer Protection Fund financed through monetary sanctions paid to the CFTC by violators of the CEA.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<title>FESE Response To The ESMA Consultation On CTP And DRSPS</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>FESE wishes to thank ESMA for its work on the challenging task of developing draft technical standards related to CTPs. FESE welcomes many of the proposals and has leveraged the expertise of its members as future data contributors to provide thoughtful feedback on certain elements that could be refined. These include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The proposed minimum latency requirements for data submission should be finetuned, as these may not always be technically feasible for all participants.</li>
<li>We discourage the use of JSON for data transmission. Instead, we suggest leveraging existing formats and protocols, and if a new protocol is defined, it should be uniform across all asset classes.</li>
<li>The input data for the CTP should be limited to what is necessary for the CTP to be operational; therefore, we have concerns about an automatic link with RTS 2 for the bonds tape.</li>
<li>The CTP should not be expected to enhance the quality of the data provided in terms of specific content; this responsibility should rest with the data contributors, who have systems and controls in place to ensure data quality.</li>
<li>A dedicated RCB framework is needed for the CTP, which takes into account the underlying costs incurred by data providers for the production and transmission of data.</li>
<li>The potential provision of value-added services by the CTP would present issues from a competition standpoint vis-&agrave;-vis data providers and data vendors.</li>

<p>Eurex, Europe&rsquo;s leading derivatives exchange, reported a 16 percent increase in total trading volume, reaching 154.6 million contracts in August, compared to 133.4 million contracts in the same month last year. Interest rate derivatives continued to show significant growth, rising by 24 percent from 54.9 million to 68.2 million contracts. Equity derivatives grew by 22 percent, totaling 20.8 million contracts, while index derivatives saw a 5 percent increase, from 61.4 to 64.6 million traded contracts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In OTC Clearing, the notional outstanding volumes experienced an 11 percent growth in August, reaching EUR 36,321 billion compared to EUR 32,699 billion in the same month of the previous year. The notional outstanding in overnight index swaps increased by 42 percent to EUR 3,933 billion, while the notional outstanding volumes in interest rate swaps rose by 11 percent, reaching EUR 15,474 billion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eurex Repo, Eurex's leading electronic market for secured funding and financing, had to face a 36 percent decrease in volume compared to August 2023 due to the current market environment and further expected ECB rate changes. Nevertheless, the average daily volume was still at a significant level of EUR 233.7 billion in August. Comparing the daily term adjusted repo volume year to date, volume is robust with +1.8 percent compared to Jan-Aug 2023. GC Pooling volumes also demonstrated strong market engagement, achieving EUR 125.8 billion in August.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<title>ICE Mortgage Monitor: Rate Drops Make August Most Affordable Month Since February, As Home Price Growth Cools To 12-Month Low</title>

<div> mortgage rates, home affordability, purchase demand, home prices, inventory levels
Summary:
Declining mortgage rates improve home affordability, boosting purchase demand. Home prices cool in some areas due to rising inventory levels. <div>
<div class="bw-subheadline-wrapper">
<ul>
<li>Declining mortgage rates have brought home affordability to its best level since February and boosted refinance incentive for many recent-vintage mortgages</li>
<li>With 30-year conforming rates down 60 bps from just over 7% in May, the principal and interest payment on the average-priced home purchase is $145 less per month than just three months ago</li>
<li>The share of income needed to make payments on that home (34.3%) is still 10 pp above its 30-year average and ICE Market Trends data shows recent record highs in down payments and credit scores</li>
<li>Spurred by rate declines, purchase loan demand had two of its best weeks since March, but remains noticeably below the levels seen earlier this year and in 2023 when rates were at comparable levels</li>
<li>The ICE Home Price Index for July showed the annual rate of home price growth slipping to +3.6% from +4.1% in June, marking the slowest pace in 12 months on rising inventory and still-soft demand</li>
<li>While prices were up +0.19% from June at the national level, they fell by -0.25% or more across each of Florida&rsquo;s nine largest metros which, along with Austin, saw the largest single-month declines in July</li>
<li>In the Midwest and Northeast, inventory shortages persist, and prices continued to push higher in July</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today released its September 2024&nbsp;<a href="https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com/resources/data-reports" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">ICE Mortgage Monitor Report</a>&nbsp;, based on the company&rsquo;s robust mortgage, real estate and public records data sets.</p>
<p>August&rsquo;s mortgage interest rate declines have brought home affordability to its best point in six months. And while purchase mortgage demand has seen a couple of its best weeks since mid-March in response, the rise was muted in comparison to early 2023 and 2024 when rates fell to similar levels. As Andy Walden, ICE Vice President of Research and Analysis, explains, that may actually be good news for the Fed&rsquo;s goal of lowering rates without overheating the market.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Recent easing in mortgage rates brought some much-sought relief to prospective homebuyers,&rdquo; said Walden. &ldquo;Along with a general cooling in home price growth, rates falling below 6.5% made August the most affordable month for housing since February. When it comes to affordability, as always, context is important: it still takes 10 percentage points more of the median income to buy the average house than it has on average over the last 30 years. Our own ICE Market Trends data shows that prospective homebuyers are also facing record high down payments and credit scores among recent purchase mortgages. Affordability is still very much a challenge and that is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, but August&rsquo;s improvement is certainly welcome progress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three of the nation&rsquo;s 100 largest markets are back to their own long-run average affordability levels (Birmingham, Ala.; Des Moines, Iowa; and McAllen, Texas). Cleveland, Toledo, Memphis and Baton Rouge are all within one percentage point (pp) of their respective benchmarks. Another 22 markets are within 5 pp of their benchmarks. In more than half of all major markets, however, it still takes at least 10 pp more of local median income to make the monthly payment on the average home purchase, when compared to their own long run averages. Payment-to-income ratios in some California markets are currently 20 pp higher, or more, than traditionally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even as affordability challenges persist,&rdquo; Walden continued, &ldquo;purchase demand perked up on August&rsquo;s rate drops, hinting at a population of prospective homebuyers poised and ready to act as soon as market movements tip the affordability math in their favor. August&rsquo;s demand remains muted from earlier this year and last, when interest rates were at comparable levels, but that may well turn out to be a good thing on balance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Growing inventory and continuing soft demand led home prices to cool further in July, bringing the annual growth rate down to +3.6% in July from +4.1% in June. Adjusted for seasonality, prices were up +0.19% in the month, equivalent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) of +2.3%. The spread between single-family home and condominium prices continued to widen, with the former up 3.7% year-over-year in July, as compared to +2.3% for condos across the country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The market today is in a good position from the perspective of the Fed and its mission,&rdquo; Walden added. &ldquo;Slower home growth is a positive sign in the Fed&rsquo;s fight against inflation and increased &ndash; but still mild &ndash; demand is good for the market and Fed alike. And of course, in some slightly good news for homebuyers, affordability has improved measurably from recent historic peaks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, recent inventory gains come much more from softer demand than from an increased willingness among homeowners to list their homes for sale. This makes supply &ndash; and its follow-on effect on home prices &ndash; sensitive to rate changes, making demand worth watching closely. Without a meaningful return in new listing volumes, the market is reliant on weak demand to allow inventory to grow, limiting the prospect of stronger sales activity without a corresponding risk of inventory drawdowns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rising inventory levels are resulting in softer home prices across the state of Florida. While prices rose an adjusted +0.19% nationally in July, they fell across each of Florida&rsquo;s nine largest markets by -0.25% or more. Cape Coral saw the largest decline, with prices there falling by a full percentage point in the month. It was followed by North Port, which saw a -0.9% single-month decline, and prices are now 7% and 6% off their respective recent peaks. Prices fell by 0.3% or more in Jacksonville, Deltona, Tampa, Palm Bay, Lakeland, Orlando and Miami.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florida is not alone,&rdquo; Walden added. &ldquo;Other areas where inventory has returned to or exceeded pre-pandemic norms also saw prices edge lower in July. Places like Austin, San Antonio, Memphis, New Orleans and San Francisco. On the other side of that coin, inventory shortages persist in many parts of the Midwest and Northeast, where prices continue to push higher. Just look at Cleveland, Providence, Richmond and Chicago, which &ndash; along with Seattle &ndash; made up the top five performing metros in July from a home price growth perspective.&rdquo;</p>

<p>FIA, the leading global trade organisation for the futures, options and centrally cleared derivatives markets, has<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://email.fia.org/c/12ga8OU1rYJ9FSD8NYG25GqOo84pkF">published a paper</a>&nbsp;outlining its views on how to support the progress of the European Union&rsquo;s&nbsp;Capital Markets Union (CMU).</p>
<div>
<p>FIA&rsquo;s paper &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="https://email.fia.org/c/12ga8PnG22BR4fmLfttIaQpPOWnd7y">Capital Markets Union at a critical juncture</a>&nbsp;&ndash; sets out the role that derivatives play in effective capital markets. Specifically, FIA believes that centrally cleared derivatives are a key ingredient to building a strong CMU.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>&ldquo;As the EU aims to increase investor interest in its markets, it has many options in designing a system that protects its citizens, ensures market liquidity and attracts investors. The ideas shared in this paper, on behalf of the cleared derivatives markets, will help lay the groundwork for fit-for-purpose regulation, open and resilient markets, fair competition and opportunities for innovation. "These adjustments will make EU capital markets more attractive to domestic and international investors and help to boost growth",&nbsp;said Walt Lukken, President and CEO of FIA.<br /><br />The recommendations in FIA&rsquo;s paper support the objectives aligned with delivering a successful CMU:&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Promoting an open, competitive, pragmatic, predictable, safe, well-regulated and fair marketplace for domestic and international financial institutions alike&nbsp;</li>
<li>Increasing transparency, public stakeholder engagement and certainty to ease the often complex and lengthy legislative process in the EU&nbsp;</li>
<li>Establishing a fit-for-purpose regulatory environment that benefits both regulated financial institutions and their customers&nbsp;</li>
<li>Facilitating client choice on where to clear and protecting the international competitiveness of EU market participants&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<div>
<div>
<p>FIA believes these objectives can be met largely through fine-tuning existing regulations, rather than overhauling them, and by international dialogue with peer regulators and global standard setters to avoid a patchwork of regulations that increases costs for all involved and disincentives investment. FIA has identified some specific steps that EU policymakers could undertake to help achieve these objectives, including:&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Establish clear definitions of scope in EU legislation (Level 1) and early clarifications on territorial and personal scope&nbsp;</li>
<li>Allow sufficient time for implementation of requirements before carrying out regulatory and legislative reviews and align compliance dates of Level 1 and Level 2 requirements&nbsp;</li>
<li>Conduct public engagement/consultation with industry and independent experts on important Level 3 rules before publishing them&nbsp;</li>
<li>Provide meaningful cost-benefit analysis before proposing new requirements and add a competitiveness test as part of important policy proposals&nbsp;</li>
<li>Optimise further CCP equivalence reviews and improve transparency&nbsp;</li>
<li>Establish appropriate capital requirements and reduce other restrictive measures to alleviate clearing capacity for intermediaries&nbsp;</li>
<li>Scrutinise the active account requirements under EMIR 3.0 that could, if not properly calibrated, adversely impact the competitiveness of EU firms&nbsp;</li>
<li>Ensure the IFR regime for investment firms is proportionate to the risks these firms bring to their counterparties, themselves and the market as a whole&nbsp;</li>
<li>Ensure globally consistent margin requirements to enable clearing margin transparency&nbsp;</li>
<li>Harmonise certain aspects of non-bank insolvency laws in the EU.&nbsp;</li>

<title>DataLend: August 2024 Securities Lending Revenue Down 12% YoY To $831 Million - ‘Specials’ Slump As Equity Cash Markets Continue Strong Run</title>

<div> revenue, securities finance industry, equity, global, lending
Summary:
Global securities finance industry revenue decreased, U.S. equity revenue declined, Taiwanese stocks increased, sovereign debt lending warmed, corporate debt cooled. Sirius XM Holdings Inc., Cassava Sciences Inc., Beyond Meat Inc., Tempus AI Inc., and Enbridge Inc. were the top earning securities. <br /><br /> <div>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The global securities finance industry generated $831 million in revenue for lenders in August 2024, according to DataLend, the market data service of fintech EquiLend. The figure represents a 12% decrease from the $945 million generated in August 2023.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Global broker-to-broker activity, where broker-dealers lend and borrow securities from each other, totaled an additional $221 million in revenue in August, down 8% year-over-year.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The equity trends observed in July largely held true for August with U.S. equity lending revenue declining 23% year-over-year. Average fees remained well below their 2023 levels with the U.S. posting a 28% dip in borrow cost from the same period last year. Declining fees have been indicative of fewer securities trading &ldquo;special&rdquo; as market indexes continue to rise. In August, revenue generated from specials was down 30% compared to August 2023.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Though equity revenues declined across global regions, Taiwanese stocks remained a bright spot in APAC, generating the second most revenue globally and a 44% increase year-over-year. In EMEA, the UK and France continued to perform well versus 2023, with revenue increases of 39% and 62% respectively.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Even with central bank rate cuts likely on the horizon in the U.S., sovereign debt lending continued to warm in August with a month-over-month average fee increase of 22% for U.S. treasuries. Lending revenue for U.S. government debt climbed 18% year-over-year.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Corporate debt continued to cool off with a 20% decline in global revenue year-over-year. The dip was largely driven by a 32% decline in U.S. investment-grade corporate lending revenue.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The top five earning securities in August were</span><span>&nbsp;Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (SIRI US), Cassava Sciences Inc. (SAVA US), Beyond Meat Inc. (BYND US),&nbsp;</span><span>Tempus AI Inc. (TEM US)</span><span>&nbsp;and Enbridge Inc. (ENB US)</span><span>. The five securities in total generated $109 million in revenue for the month.</span></p>

<title>LME Progresses Market Structure Evolution To Enhance Liquidity</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: LME, market structure, transparency, liquidity, block rules <br />
Summary: The LME is modernizing market structure to increase transparency and liquidity. It will introduce block rules and a liquidity provider program.<br /><br />Summary: LME will protect daily prompt dates, introduce block rules, and a liquidity provider program to enhance market transparency and liquidity. <div>
<ul>
<li>LME market structure modernised to boost transparency and increase price competition, for the benefit of all market participants</li>
<li>Protection of daily prompt date structure and Cash price, which are crucial for physical market trading</li>
<li>Introduction of industry-standard block rules with liquidity provider programme to support on-screen liquidity</li>
<li>Crossing rules and increased market data transparency for inter-office trades</li>
<li>Corresponding rules for OTC lookalike trades to ensure level playing field with on-exchange market</li>
</ul>
<p>The London Metal Exchange (LME) has today issued a white paper setting out a package of measures designed to modernise the LME&rsquo;s market structure, boost transparency and increase price competition, while protecting the unique features of its market that serve the physical metal communities.</p>
<p>Matthew Chamberlain, LME CEO, commented: &ldquo;The package of liquidity-enhancing measures we&rsquo;re announcing today marks the next phase of our market structure evolution and is vital for the long-term health and development of LME markets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our daily date system is one of our greatest assets, helping to ensure that our global reference prices are underpinned by real world supply and demand. These future-focused measures &ndash; which align with the global regulatory direction of travel &ndash; seek to grow participation in our markets, and make our prices as representative and accessible as possible, while continuing to support physical market trading practices.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Key measures</b></p>
<p>To increase accessible liquidity on the LME&rsquo;s electronic market (LMEselect) &ndash; particularly on the monthly dates, where many market participants wish to have exposure &ndash; the LME will introduce industry-standard block limit rules. This means that small-sized trades involving liquid dates (each monthly date out to one year) and for the most liquid metals (aluminium, copper, zinc, nickel and lead) will have to be executed on-screen. Crucially, to ensure that key physical market trading practices remain unaffected by the new rules, the block thresholds will not apply to daily prompt dates, so member provision of bespoke averaging for physical clients will not be impacted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These rules also support members in continuing to agree small trades bilaterally with their clients, provided that liquidity is shown on LMEselect for visibility.</p>
<p>Jamie Turner, LME Head of Trading and COO, commented: &ldquo;Introducing block rules is about increasing price transparency, which will lead to greater price competition and participation. This change will allow traders to maximise access to liquidity in the central venue, either directly or through a member desk or platform. While block rules are standard in most peer markets, we recognise that this will have an impact on members&rsquo; business models, and we are committed to working closely with them in a series of working groups over the next 12 months to navigate the implementation details.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To support the implementation of block rules, the LME will also introduce a liquidity provider programme to encourage on-screen trading in certain liquid instruments at the front end of the curve. Additionally, to further increase transparency, the LME will ensure that all trades (in the liquid dates) agreed in the interoffice market &ndash; regardless of their size &ndash; are booked into LME systems and published on external market data feeds.</p>
<p>On 19 August, the LME made its new trading platform available in the production environment for member testing, as one of the key steps prior to launch. This system, LMEselect v10, provides a deterministic and low latency system that offers improved functionality for electronic traders, such as the ability to enter &ldquo;good-till-cancelled&rdquo; (GTC) or &ldquo;persistent&rdquo; order types. Additional functionality will also be rolled out to further support this package of measures, such as recalibrated tick sizes to encourage positive trading behaviours from systematic traders.</p>
<p>To ensure a level playing field and consistent transparency between exchange-traded and OTC markets, the LME intends to apply similar block rule requirements to OTC contracts that reference LME prices and closely align to monthly exchange contracts (or the spreads between these). This will mitigate the risk of volume being incentivised away from the transparent central liquidity pool.</p>
<p>The measures announced in the white paper will be formally consulted on where appropriate over the next 12 months, with the aim of implementing the package of measures in the second half of 2025.</p>

<title>New Broadridge Whitepaper Highlights Operational Resilience And DORA Compliance Challenges Facing Global Financial Services - EU Regulatory Deadline Requires A Prompt Industry Response; Globally, Operational Resiliency Shortfalls Can Be Addressed And Scaled Via Mutualized Services</title>

<div> Fintech, operational resilience, DORA, regulations, global
<br />
Operational resilience is a critical priority for financial firms due to tightening regulations worldwide, requiring extensive system reviews and compliance preparations.
<br /><br />Summary: 
Global regulations prioritize operational resilience, necessitating extensive compliance preparations, including system reviews and cybersecurity focus, with potential enforcement actions for noncompliance. <div>
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="http://www.broadridge.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.</a>&nbsp;(NYSE: BR), a global Fintech leader, released a new whitepaper focused on the imperative need for financial services firms to enhance their operational resilience in reaction to the European Union&rsquo;s Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) and other global regulations. This comprehensive whitepaper, titled&nbsp;<i>'Building Resilience Across Borders: A holistic approach to global operational resilience and navigating the regulatory maze</i>,' highlights the extensive regulatory expectations and the strategic preparations necessary for compliance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now more than ever, operational resiliency is a critical priority for financial firms around the world, driven by a fundamental need to strengthen trust and security in response to the growing risk of cyberattacks and disruptions,&rdquo; said Mike Sleightholme, President of Broadridge International. &ldquo;The broad and in-depth scope of DORA mandates a significant transformation in risk management frameworks, policies and governance structures relating to both inhouse and third-party systems, posing urgent challenges that the industry needs to address ahead of the January 17, 2025 deadline.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Regulators are emphasizing and prioritizing operational resilience, yet there is a growing sense that many firms remain far from ready, exposing themselves not only to operational resiliency risk but also to regulatory compliance risk,&rdquo; said Virginie O&rsquo;Shea, Founder of Firebrand Research, who worked with Broadridge to develop the whitepaper. &ldquo;Firms must act now to mobilize their DORA action plans, including a detailed assessment of their critical systems and services, and an impact analysis to ensure they can deliver a compliant operating model and meet recovery and reporting objectives aligned to DORA&rsquo;s requirements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Key findings from the whitepaper include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Worldwide regulatory priority</b>: Besides the EU, regions such as the US, Canada, the UK, South Africa, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia are also tightening their operational resilience regulations.</li>
<li><b>Global scope and impact of DORA</b>&nbsp;mandates significant changes to operational risk management and resilience across nearly all areas of financial services, impacting firms operating in the EU irrespective of where their headquarters and third-party suppliers are located.</li>
<li><b>Clock is ticking</b>, firms must begin their DORA compliance preparations now, as the January 2025 enforcement date necessitates extensive system reviews and data reporting readiness. Firms must focus resources on mobilising their action plan, potentially leveraging mutualized shared services.</li>
<li><b>Watch out for regulatory enforcement</b>, noncompliance with operational resilience mandates is likely to result in stringent enforcement actions. Firms need to start prioritizing cybersecurity and risk reduction today.</li>
<li><b>Increased regulatory focus on third-party service providers</b>&nbsp;and internal IT systems highlights the need for thorough operational reviews and compliance assurance.</li>

<div> encourages, account providers, vulnerable consumers, financial inclusion, access
<br />
The FCA report urges account providers to support those without bank accounts, increase awareness of basic accounts, and review account denials and closures.
<br /><br />Summary: The FCA encourages account providers to support vulnerable consumers, increase awareness of basic accounts, and review account denials and closures. <div>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>In a new report, the FCA encourages account providers to do more to support those who want a bank account but don&rsquo;t have one.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p><span>The FCA has recognised that banks, building societies and payment firms are trying to support customers to access accounts and is encouraging them to build on examples of existing good practice, such as working with homeless charities to tailor their support to the needs of customers in vulnerable circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span>Banks and other account providers have been urged to increase awareness of basic bank accounts, which allow people to make and receive payments but without the availability of an overdraft. The FCA found that several providers could make it easier to apply for one.</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA has asked account providers to review their overall approach to account denials and closures &ndash; and particularly to ensure that vulnerable consumers aren&rsquo;t losing out. Providers should also ensure people aren&rsquo;t denied access just because they can&rsquo;t produce standard forms of ID, and make it clear which alternative forms of ID are acceptable.</span></p>
<p><span>Where accounts are closed or denied, the regulator has reminded providers that they should act in line with their obligations under the Consumer Duty, including communicating in a way that is clear and helpful for customers.</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA has also published independent, qualitative research on the experiences of some of the most financially excluded consumers when accessing and using financial products and services. This will help industry and consumer groups understand how the right support can help these consumers effectively access services.</span></p>
<p><span>Sheldon Mills, Executive Director of Consumers and Competition at the FCA, said:</span></p>
<p><span>'We&rsquo;ve seen examples of really good practice &ndash; with account providers helping people access a product vital for financial inclusion &ndash; but also areas where there is room for improvement. By sharing both, we want to achieve more consistent outcomes, with people being aware of what accounts there are that might be right for them, more support for the vulnerable and people not being denied access without good reason.'</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA&rsquo;s report also highlighted issues other organisations have experienced accessing accounts &ndash; including pawnbrokers, charities and in the adult entertainment sector. It has set out an expectation that firms should have a clear, properly considered definition of reputational risk. However, it has a limited remit to act for business and charity customers.</span></p>
<p><span>In 2023, the FCA said that it had not found evidence of accounts being closed due to lawfully expressed political opinions. The new report confirms it has not found any further evidence to suggest that this is happening. However, it has asked senior leaders in firms to sign an attestation taking personal responsibility for ensuring rules have been complied with and that they are confident of their compliance going forward.&nbsp;</span></p>

<div> enforcement, regulation, guidance, financial services, consumer resilience <br />
Summary:<br />Effective regulation and enforcement, guidance for financial services, ensuring consumer resilience, supporting market growth, and fairness in financial services. <div>
<p>Tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou katoa</p>
<p>Ko Samantha Barrass toku ingoa</p>
<p>Ko taku mahi ki Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko</p>
<p>Ko te Mana Whakahaere</p>
<p>Tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā tātou katoa.</p>
<p>Many thanks for inviting me to speak to you today. The relationship between the FMA and the FSC has been very strong over many years, and ensuring this continues is vital for me, the FMA Board and my leadership team.</p>
<p>This year's conference theme is "consumer resilience and prosperity". Maintaining resilience through these times while also taking long-term decisions to secure future prosperity is essential to the financial wellbeing of all New Zealanders.</p>
<p>Consumer Resilience and Prosperity is an important theme for the FMA, and for me. That is because, once responsibility for the CCCFA is transferred to us, we will have a role in overseeing the financial products that touch most New Zealanders&rsquo; lives.</p>
<p>Whether it is securing a loan for a car, getting professional financial advice, buying your first home and insuring it, insuring yourself and your livelihood, or saving and investing for your retirement and other financial goals, the FMA will have a key role in making sure New Zealanders have trust and confidence in the financial services sector.</p>
<h3>Regulatory burden</h3>
<p>During this period of regulatory change, it&rsquo;s important the FMA&rsquo;s regulatory approach is clear and understood.</p>
<p>I want to take a moment to step back and explain my personal philosophy of regulation, which is such a great match with the FMA.</p>
<p>This year marks the fortieth anniversary of the fourth Labour Government and a period of significant economic and regulatory reform. Growing up in the 80s in Christchurch, for me, regulation was deeply discredited. I associated it with driving an over-controlled economy including poor services (such as 3 months to get a phone line), and unrealistic controls on prices - the NZ Dollar, rents and interest rates, to name a few. An idealistic economics student, and huge supporter of the role of markets to drive growth and prosperity, I was sceptical about regulation and felt we always needed to be clear that regulation was a necessary intervention to support growth and the long-term prospects of New Zealanders.</p>
<p>It became so much of a driving passion for me that, forty years later, I&rsquo;m here talking to you as the Chief Executive of a regulator. Not many people grow up wanting to be a regulator, but there you go.</p>
<p>The FMA and I are incredibly focused on regulation that genuinely matters and delivers for New Zealanders. The underlying philosophy remains &ndash; we cannot simply regulate for the sake of regulating. Regulation needs to pass the &lsquo;so what&rsquo; test, as well as enabling innovation. By keeping an eye on unnecessary regulatory burden, we can ensure our regulatory approach is achieving the outcomes we, and New Zealanders, expect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s why, for example, we have provided the Government with a list of proposals where both our time, and yours, can be used more valuably - while still ensuring consumers and investors are protected. We have also valued you proactively highlighting to us further changes that the FMA and the Minister should consider.</p>
<p>We are further demonstrating this as we consider a class exemption for green, social, sustainability and sustainability-linked bonds, which offer investors an additional non-financial benefit. The sector has told us that there should be a more efficient route to market for these bonds.</p>
<p>This has the potential to avoid unnecessary compliance costs, as well as incentivise the development of this market.&nbsp; When we hear fair arguments like these, we are prepared to reflect on them and consider changes accordingly.</p>
<h3>Guidance</h3>
<p>Guidance from the FMA can be an efficient approach to supporting the sector meet regulatory expectations as the New Zealand financial sector continues to grow and develop. Our liquidity risk management guidance released this year aims to ensure fund managers have adequate systems, controls and tools in place to manage liquidity, against the full range of assets and business models. It is frustrating to hear this guidance being used as a justification for why firms aren&rsquo;t investing in private or less liquid assets. Having appropriate systems and controls to manage liquidity, enables investment in these types of assets. It means the frameworks and tools are in place to identify and manage the risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Guidance raises awareness, promotes discussion and endeavours to lift standards across a sector. We do not expect firms to simply leave this guidance to their legal and compliance departments. The audience for this guidance, and in fact any guidance we publish, should be senior leaders within your organisations, so they can take a strategic view of what is needed. We are not looking for tick box compliance to our guidance. Our guidance is just that, a guide to help inform how you work. We look forward to continuing our discussion on the guidance with the sector in the months ahead, including at an FSC hosted event next month.</p>
<p>With so much focus on unnecessary regulatory burden, I do want to emphasise that the important point here is on the word &lsquo;unnecessary&rsquo;. We cannot and must not forget the crystalised harm or risk of harm, un-prevented by market forces, that created the need for regulation in the first place. The finance company collapses, and the risks and harm exposed, unmitigated by market forces, created a powerful argument for regulation to support Mum and Dad investors and quality capital markets in New Zealand. The FMA was created out of those ashes, the outcomes sought through the FMCA remain current. We are determined to champion them.</p>
<p>But does it mean that we should always be alive to how we can deliver those outcomes better? Absolutely, and that is why we are leaning into taking an outcomes-focused approach to our work.</p>
<h3>Outcomes focused approach</h3>
<p>We want to ensure the FMA&rsquo;s focus is not just on compliance but on what we are trying to achieve. That is the ultimate way in which we will deliver well focused regulation, keep costs down and make sure we are not unnecessarily cutting across innovation.</p>
<p>The industry response to our consultation on outcomes focused regulation shows we need to take our time to step back, take stock, and pause to consider the right way forward. One of the things the FSC told us in its feedback was that they were worried we were introducing new rules. To be clear, we are not setting out new rules. It is about the FMA, ensuring we remain an effective modern, forward-looking regulator and communicating what we believe that looks like.</p>
<p>We will have more to say in due course, but I hope the philosophy of regulation I set out at the beginning, which is front and centre of my leadership at the FMA, gives you a flavour of how we intend to approach our role.</p>
<h3>Recent enforcement action</h3>
<p>No doubt you will have seen in the news some of the recent enforcement action we have taken. That reflects months, often years of work from our teams, and I want to acknowledge their mahi.</p>
<p>Enforcement is a bottom line for any regulator. It is the bare minimum any regulator needs to do to ensure credibility and create a credible deterrent that encourages compliance. But enforcement is sometimes rightly characterised as the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff. Something has to have gone wrong or be at a real risk of going wrong! Ideally, the bulk of regulatory activity is focused on making sure harm is prevented.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s in our supervision work that we mainly want to be experienced. Sometimes with pointy elbows, but mainly collaboratively, educative and engaged.</p>
<p>As we strive to be the best engagement-led regulator we can be, we know that building strong relationships with firms early can often mean the harm to consumers and investors is prevented in the first place.</p>
<p>Strong regulator-firm relationships benefit all New Zealanders. As we and the industry have acknowledged in the past, this requires the FMA to be properly resourced. Our view remains the same as it has in recent years; that an engagement led approach from a regulator, that can retain good staff and institutional knowledge, offers the right regulation for New Zealand. It delivers a meaningful, proactive supervision approach, supporting firms and customers alike.</p>
<h3>Financial services reforms</h3>
<p>I know you will all be eagerly awaiting ministerial decisions on the financial services reform consultation from earlier in the year.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m sure the Minister will have more to say on this when he speaks to you this evening, I do want to give you a sense of where we are from a practical perspective. The Commerce Commission and the FMA are working very closely on the transfer of credit functions, with several joint activities underway. As part of this, you will also start to see the FMA in some of the Commission&rsquo;s stakeholder engagement activities. Both regulators are very committed to a seamless transfer of responsibilities and await legislation to be passed by Parliament to give effect to this. Until then, the Commerce Commission is still the regulator of the CCCFA, and lenders should continue to engage with the Commission as normal.</p>
<p>Turning to the new CoFI regime, we have been and are continuing to engage with firms ahead of the end of the licensing window in March next year. Firms should now have either made their licence application or be in the final stages of seeking their Board approvals prior to submitting their application. We know which firms are potentially behind where they want to be and have reached out to offer assistance and support as needed. This is the approach the FMA has taken over several years, through the introduction of several different regimes. We know it is one that you and your peers support.</p>
<p>Minister Bayly has signalled a priority of his is to streamline capital market settings to allow businesses greater access to capital to support productivity and growth. We are committed to working with the Minister, MBIE and industry to explore how we might better support these markets to develop.&nbsp; A key focus for the Minister is facilitating investment in private assets. A first step is industry engagement, and several roundtables took place last week. As work on this ministerial priority continues, I want to thank those who have provided support already on the shape of this work programme.</p>
<h3>Regulation as an enabler of markets, not a barrier</h3>
<p>As a regulator, we know we have a role ensuring markets work well for consumers and investors, while also enabling economic growth. There is a natural tension between encouraging competition, financial stability and ensuring consumers are sold products that deliver value and do what they say on the tin. This tension is why the Council of Financial Regulators exists, and why it&rsquo;s work is so important.</p>
<p>The FMA will be looking to do what it can in the months ahead to respond to the Commerce Commission&rsquo;s report, particularly around the recommendation on transparency in mortgage advice. The Minister and the Commerce Commission have clearly expressed concerns about practices in this space. We will be looking to work with financial advice providers and firms across the mortgage spectrum to consider how to tackle this issue. As the CoFI regime settles in from early next year, there will also be opportunities for us to use our supervisory engagement with banks to look at the issues raised in the market study from this angle.</p>
<h3>Concluding remarks&nbsp;</h3>
<p>As I turn back to this year&rsquo;s conference theme, a financial sector that is grounded in fairness is essential to consumer resilience. At the FMA, fairness isn&rsquo;t just a word to us. It&rsquo;s central to why we exist. That&rsquo;s why two months ago we released a research paper where we sought to understand what New Zealanders perceived as fair and unfair in the financial services they use.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the research found that the majority of New Zealanders generally agree on what constitutes fairness in financial services.</p>
<p>In one scenario, 86 percent of respondents believed it was unfair that a bank took over a year to repay a client who had been overcharged fees. At the other end of the spectrum, 62 percent believed it was fair that one client&rsquo;s investment fund had lower fees than his mother&rsquo;s because his fund manager spent less time researching markets and making changes to his investment. The release of the research has also seen the FMA hold roundtables with firms to discuss our findings. This is the first time we&rsquo;ve adopted a roundtable approach to discussing findings, and it won&rsquo;t be the last. We are looking at new, broader ways of engaging with the market to ensure we meet our aims as an &lsquo;engagement led&rsquo; regulator.</p>
<p>As the conduct regulator for New Zealand&rsquo;s financial markets, our vision is more New Zealanders than ever believing that the financial services sector is working well for them. While we play an important role in achieving this vision, we cannot do it alone. Our vision is closely aligned with that of the FSC itself, whose vision is to grow the financial confidence and wellbeing of New Zealanders. I look forward to working alongside you to ensure we foster a vibrant and trusted financial sector into the future.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority Cancels Integrity Advisers Insurance Limited’s Financial Advice Provider Licence</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> cancelled, Integrity Advisers Insurance Limited, misconduct, FAP licence, clients<br />
Summary: The FMA cancelled Integrity's FAP licence due to serious misconduct, including pressuring clients to retain insurance policies and making false threats. Clients can seek help through Financial Ombudsman service. <br /> <div>
<p>The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; has cancelled Integrity Advisers Insurance Limited&rsquo;s (Integrity) Financial Advice Provider (FAP) licence for engaging in serious misconduct.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Integrity is a Christchurch-based financial service provider that held a full FAP licence, providing financial advice to approximately 500 retail customers, many of whom are from the Filipino community. Integrity&rsquo;s sole director and shareholder is Mr Yuriy Bazhak who was a financial adviser at Integrity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following an investigation, the FMA found that Integrity breached its market services licensee obligations by failing to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>give priority to client&rsquo;s interests&nbsp;</li>
<li>comply with the Code of Professional Conduct for Financial Advice Services&nbsp;</li>
<li>treat customers fairly&nbsp;</li>
<li>act with integrity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The breaches relate to Integrity&rsquo;s treatment of clients who wanted to cancel their respective insurance policy between September 2022 and June 2023 (affected clients).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If affected clients cancelled their insurance policies, Integrity had to surrender the commission (also known as a clawback charge) it received to the relevant insurance provider. While Integrity did disclose the potential recovery of fees to clients at the start of the engagement, the FMA found Integrity unfairly pressured affected clients to retain their respective policy by issuing them with an invoice which gave them only seven days to reinstate their insurance policy or pay a fee. The fee Integrity charged affected clients was greater than was permitted by Integrity&rsquo;s fees policy, and in some cases equal to the commission Integrity lost.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Integrity told some affected clients that failure to pay the fee would result in Integrity reporting them to Immigration New Zealand, which Integrity said may result in an affected client&rsquo;s visa being cancelled or deportation. Integrity did not make any report to Immigration New Zealand but seriously misled an affected client when it told him that it had made a report. The FMA found that Integrity also tried to mislead the FMA by altering an invoice before providing it to the FMA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Integrity denied significant misconduct. It said invoicing errors were inadvertent or not material, and it denied misleading clients or the FMA.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA is satisfied that Integrity would be likely to breach its market services licensee obligations in the future. The FMA is also satisfied that Integrity&rsquo;s director, Mr Bazhak is no longer a fit and proper person to hold a position as a director or senior manager of a financial advice provider.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FMA Director of Specialist Supervision and Response, Peter Taylor, said: &ldquo;Contrary to its name, this firm lacked any integrity with its clients. Mr Bazhak not only risked causing serious harm to his clients but preyed on their vulnerability through the threat of involving Immigration New Zealand. Actions such as these undermine both the integrity and reputation of the financial advice profession.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cancelling Integrity&rsquo;s licence is one of the strongest tools the FMA can use against a FAP and sends a clear message that this sort of conduct is not acceptable.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Provisions have been made for the care of Integrity&rsquo;s clients, who will be contacted by their new licenced financial advice provider or their insurer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Where clients can get help&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Integrity&rsquo;s clients can complain to Financial Services Complaints Limited&rsquo;s Financial Ombudsman service, which is a disputes resolution service free to consumers. For clients who believe they have been affected and have concerns, we recommend they contact:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial Services Complaints Limited,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fscl.org.nz/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="link to Financial Services Complaints Limited">fscl.org.nz</a>, or&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>their insurer or new adviser to discuss whether to complain to Financial Services Complaints Limited.&nbsp;</li>

<title>SEC Charges Six Credit Rating Agencies With Significant Recordkeeping Failures - Firms Admit To Wrongdoing And Agree To Pay Penalties Totaling More Than $49 Million To Settle SEC Charges</title>

<div> SEC, charges, credit rating agencies, recordkeeping provisions, civil penalties
<br />
The SEC charged six credit rating agencies for failing to maintain and preserve electronic communications, leading to civil penalties and requirements for compliance improvements.
<br /><br />Summary: 
The SEC charged six credit rating agencies for recordkeeping violations, leading to civil penalties and requirements for compliance improvements. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against six nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, or NRSROs, for significant failures by the firms and their personnel to maintain and preserve electronic communications. The firms admitted the facts set forth in their respective SEC orders; acknowledged that their conduct violated recordkeeping provisions of the federal securities laws; agreed to pay combined civil penalties of more than $49 million, as detailed below; and have begun implementing improvements to their compliance policies and procedures to address these violations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Moody&rsquo;s Investors Service, Inc. agreed to pay a $20 million civil penalty;</li>
<li>S&amp;P Global Ratings agreed to pay a $20 million civil penalty;</li>
<li>Fitch Ratings, Inc. agreed to pay an $8 million civil penalty;</li>
<li>HR Ratings de M&eacute;xico, S.A. de C.V. agreed to pay a $250,000 civil penalty;</li>
<li>A.M. Best Rating Services, Inc. agreed to pay a $1 million civil penalty; and</li>
<li>Demotech, Inc. agreed to pay a $100,000 civil penalty.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the credit rating agencies, with the exception of A.M. Best and Demotech, is also required to retain a compliance consultant. A.M. Best and Demotech engaged in significant efforts to comply with the recordkeeping requirements relatively early as registered credit rating agencies and otherwise cooperated with the SEC&rsquo;s investigations, and, as a result, they will not be required to retain a compliance consultant under the terms of their settlements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have seen repeatedly that failures to maintain and preserve required records can hinder the staff&rsquo;s ability to ensure that firms are complying with their obligations and the Commission&rsquo;s ability to hold accountable those that fall short of those obligations, often at the expense of investors,&rdquo; said Sanjay Wadhwa, Deputy Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;In today&rsquo;s actions, the Commission once again makes clear that there are tangible benefits to firms that make significant efforts to comply and otherwise cooperate with the staff&rsquo;s investigations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each of the six firms was charged with violating Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17g-2(b)(7) thereunder. In addition to significant financial penalties, each credit rating agency was ordered to cease and desist from future violations of these provisions and was censured. The four firms ordered to retain compliance consultants have agreed to, among other things, conduct comprehensive reviews of their policies and procedures relating to the retention of electronic communications found on their personnel&rsquo;s personal devices and their respective frameworks for addressing non-compliance by their personnel with those policies and procedures.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigations into Moody&rsquo;s Investors Service, Inc., S&amp;P Global Ratings, A.M. Best Rating Services, Inc., HR Ratings de M&eacute;xico, S.A. de C.V., and Demotech, Inc. were conducted by Wesley W. Wintermyer and Michael S. DiBattista and were supervised by Judith Weinstock and Sheldon L. Pollock, all of the New York Regional Office. The SEC&rsquo;s investigation into Fitch Ratings, Inc. was conducted by Joseph P. Ceglio and Mr. Wintermyer and was supervised by Ms. Weinstock, Joshua I. Brodsky, Osman E. Nawaz, and Mr. Pollock, all of the New York Regional Office.<span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span>SEC staff from the Office of Credit Ratings assisted with the investigation.</p>

<title>Federal Court Orders Oregon Man To Pay Over $209 Million In Monetary Sanctions For Commodity Pool Ponzi Schemes - CFTC Also Recovers $18 Million Stolen From Court-Appointed Receiver</title>

<div> fraud, Ponzi scheme, CFTC, misappropriation, digital assets
Summary:<br />Judge orders $209 million judgment against Sam Ikkurty and Jafia, LLC for Ponzi scheme involving crypto and carbon investments. Millions in stolen digital assets recovered.<br />Summary: <div>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced Judge Mary Rowland of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered an order of final judgment against&nbsp;Sam Ikkurty&nbsp;of Oregon and&nbsp;Jafia, LLC, Ikkurty Capital, LLC d/b/a Rose City Income Fund I LP, Rose City Income Fund II,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Seneca Ventures, LLC&nbsp;imposing a judgment totaling $209,614,892.</p>
<p>This order follows Judge Rowland&rsquo;s prior order granting summary judgment in favor of the CFTC on all counts of the CFTC&rsquo;s solicitation fraud and misappropriation complaint. [See CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8931-24">8931-24</a>] The CFTC also recovered more than $18 million in digital assets that had been stolen from the court-appointed receiver.</p>
<p>The court&rsquo;s order of final judgment and permanent injunction requires the defendants to pay&nbsp;$83,757,249&nbsp;in restitution to customers of the so-called income fund; $36,967,285 in disgorgement of unlawful gains (offset by any amounts paid in restitution); and a $110,901,855 civil monetary penalty. The order also orders Ikkurty to pay an outstanding $14,071,000 contempt fine, following the court&rsquo;s finding he unlawfully transferred digital assets from the Receivership Estate while this lawsuit was pending and violated a court order, as well as ordering Ikkurty to repay $884,788 in professional expenses advanced from the Receivership Estate to fund his defense. The order also permanently bans Ikkurty and Jafia from registering with the CFTC; trading any digital assets or other commodity interests; soliciting or accepting any funds for the purpose of purchasing digital assets or commodity interests; and engaging in conduct that violates the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The defendants portrayed their programs as cutting-edge crypto and carbon investments when in reality they were plain, old-fashioned Ponzi schemes,&rdquo; said Director of Enforcement Ian McGinley. &ldquo;CFTC staff not only shut down the defendants&rsquo; fraudulent schemes and obtained a money judgment of over $200 million, they also recovered more than $18 million in stolen digital assets that may otherwise have been lost forever. This is an outstanding result for the CFTC and for the victims of defendants&rsquo; fraud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Case Background</p>
<p>As described in the summary judgment order, the defendants&rsquo; fraudulent scheme centered on Ikkurty&rsquo;s misrepresentations to participants about the nature of his &ldquo;crypto hedge funds&rdquo; and the supposed &ldquo;net profits&rdquo; they would earn. In reality, Ikkurty did not return any net profits to participants, and instead &ldquo;ran something akin to a Ponzi scheme.&rdquo; Ikkurty also misstated his fund&rsquo;s historical performance and omitted the fact the fund fell in value by 98.99% in only a few months. The order also found Ikkurty invested in unstable digital asset commodities contrary to his promises to participants, and his purported crypto expertise was a sham because his actual experience with digital assets consisted solely of losing his personal Bitcoins to a hack. The court soundly rejected Ikkurty&rsquo;s claim that his misrepresentations about historical performance were inadvertent and his arguments that his false statements were not material.</p>
<p>Notably, in addition to the misrepresentations, the summary judgment order also found the defendants misappropriated funds through a carbon offset program, which the order described as &ldquo;a classic Ponzi scheme.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During this lawsuit, millions of dollars in digital assets recovered from Ikkurty and held by the court-appointed receiver to compensate victims were stolen in a hack. The court held Ikkurty, who had fled to India, in contempt for stealing and refusing to return these assets. However, the CFTC found the assets and on August 27 caused them to be returned to the receiver to give to victims in accordance with the court&rsquo;s order. The recovered assets are currently valued at approximately $18 million.</p>
<p>The CFTC cautions that orders requiring repayment of funds to victims may not always result in the recovery of lost money because the wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets.</p>
<p>* * * * * * *</p>
<p>The CFTC thanks the Federal Bureau of Investigation for its assistance in this matter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this matter are Candy Haan, Heather Dasso, Doug Snodgrass, Joseph Patrick, Elizabeth Streit, Scott Williamson, and Robert Howell, and former staff member David Terrell.</p>

<div> Settled charges, ClearPath Capital Partners, SEC, liability disclaimers, private funds <br />
ClearPath Capital Partners settled charges with SEC for safekeeping non-compliance and impermissible liability disclaimers in advisory and private fund agreements. $65,000 penalty. <br />
Summary: <br />
- Settled charges with SEC
- Safekeeping non-compliance
- Impermissible liability disclaimers
- Advisory and private fund agreements
- $65,000 penalty <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against ClearPath Capital Partners LLC for failing to comply with requirements related to the safekeeping of client assets and for its use of impermissible liability disclaimers in its advisory and private fund agreements.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, ClearPath failed to timely distribute annual audited financial statements to investors in certain private funds that it advised. In addition, in its advisory agreements and certain private fund partnership and operating agreements, ClearPath included liability disclaimers, commonly referred to as hedge clauses, that could lead a client to incorrectly believe that the client had waived non-waivable causes of action against the adviser. Certain of the liability disclaimers also contained misleading statements regarding ClearPath&rsquo;s otherwise unwaivable fiduciary duty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The SEC remains focused on the custody rule, which is vital to investor protection,&rdquo; said Andrew Dean, Co-Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division&rsquo;s Asset Management Unit. &ldquo;In addition, all advisers, including private fund advisers, should be mindful about including hedge clauses in agreements. Even for private fund advisers, in certain circumstances, such clauses could be misleading.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC's order finds that ClearPath violated sections 206(2) and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rules 206(4)-2 and 206(4)-7 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, ClearPath agreed to a censure, to cease and desist from further violations of the charged provisions, and to pay a $65,000 civil penalty.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Steven Varholik of the Asset Management Unit in the San Francisco Regional Office, with assistance from Carol Lee, Kathleen Purcell, Thu Ta, and Bradley Cline of the Division of Examinations. The investigation was supervised by Jeremy Pendrey, Mr. Dean, and Corey Schuster.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Creative Legal Fundings CEO Maria Dickerson With Operating Multimillion Dollar Ponzi Scheme That Targeted Filipino-American Community</title>

<div> charged, fraudulent, securities, investors, lawsuit <br />
Summary: The SEC charged Maria Dulce Pino Dickerson and her companies with defrauding investors of $7 million through a fraudulent securities offering targeting the Filipino-American community. <br /> <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Maria Dulce Pino Dickerson and her companies Creative Legal Fundings in CA and The Ubiquity Group LLC with raising approximately $7 million from more than 130 investors through a fraudulent securities offering targeting members of the Filipino-American community across the United States.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, from approximately March 2021 through May 2023, Sacramento, California resident Dickerson convinced investors to acquire interests in Creative Legal Fundings by falsely claiming that she would use their investments to make loans to personal injury attorneys to fund their lawsuits. In exchange, Dickerson allegedly claimed, Creative Legal Fundings would receive a portion of any eventual settlements or recoveries. According to the complaint, Dickerson promised investors guaranteed high returns of 10 to 17.5 percent per month. In reality, the complaint alleges, Creative Legal Fundings did not make any loans, conduct any other business, or generate any returns. Instead, Dickerson allegedly spent at least $2.5 million in investor funds on personal real estate, gambling, travel and designer goods purchases. The complaint also alleges that Dickerson made Ponzi-like payments to earlier investors using funds from new investors in an attempt to keep the scheme going. The complaint further alleges that, after Dickerson ran out of money to pay Creative Legal Fundings&rsquo; investors in around May 2023, she shuttered that company, opened The Ubiquity Group, and tried to raise additional funds using similar misrepresentations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As alleged, Creative Legal Fundings' operations were neither creative, nor legal. This was nothing more than fraud perpetrated against retail investors, many of whom were members of the Filipino-American community,&rdquo; said Monique C. Winkler, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s San Francisco Regional Office.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California, charges Dickerson, Creative Legal Fundings, and The Ubiquity Group with violating the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, including conduct-based injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The SEC also seeks an officer-and-director bar against Dickerson.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was part of the San Francisco Regional Office and Los Angeles Regional Office&rsquo;s task force focused on affinity frauds, the Western Alliance to Protect Targeted Communities. The SEC&rsquo;s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-alerts/investor-alert-have-something-common-someone-selling-investment-it-may-make-you-target-fraud">Investor Alert</a>&nbsp;with tips on how investors can identify and avoid affinity frauds.</p>
<p>In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Eastern District of California today announced criminal charges against Dickerson.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Duncan C. Simpson LaGoy and Michael Foley and supervised by David Zhou and Jason H. Lee of the San Francisco Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Robin Andrews and Mr. Simpson LaGoy.</p>

<div> charges, Galois Capital Management, crypto assets, Investment Advisers Act, civil penalty
Summary:
SEC charges Galois Capital Management for violating custody rule and misleading investors. Ordered to pay $225,000 civil penalty. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against Florida-based Galois Capital Management LLC, a former registered investment adviser for a private fund that primarily invested in crypto assets, for failing to comply with requirements related to the safeguarding of client assets, including crypto assets being offered and sold as securities. The Commission also found that Galois misled fund investors about the notice period required for redemptions. To settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges, Galois agreed to pay a civil penalty of $225,000, which will be distributed to its fund&rsquo;s harmed investors.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order found that, beginning in July 2022, Galois Capital failed to ensure that certain crypto assets held by the private fund that it advised were maintained with a qualified custodian, a violation of the Investment Advisers Act&rsquo;s Custody Rule. According to the order, Galois Capital held certain crypto assets in online trading accounts on crypto asset trading platforms, including FTX Trading Ltd., that were not qualified custodians. Approximately half of the fund&rsquo;s assets under management from early to mid-November 2022 were lost in connection with the collapse of FTX. The SEC&rsquo;s order also found that Galois Capital misled certain investors by representing to them that redemptions required at least five business days&rsquo; notice before month end while allowing other investors to redeem with fewer days&rsquo; notice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By failing to comply with Custody Rule provisions, Galois Capital exposed investors to risks that fund assets, including crypto assets, could be lost, misused, or misappropriated,&rdquo; said Corey Schuster, Co-Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division&rsquo;s Asset Management Unit. &ldquo;We will continue to hold accountable advisers who violate their core investor protection obligations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order found that Galois Capital violated the Investment Advisers Act. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, Galois Capital consented to the entry of an order requiring it to cease and desist from further violations of the Advisers Act, censuring it, and imposing the civil penalty discussed above.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Annie Hancock and Rory Alex and supervised by Colin Forbes, Brent Wilner, Mr. Schuster, and Andrew Dean, all of the Division of Enforcement's Asset Management Unit. The team was assisted by Kelly Kibbie, Neil Lombardo, and Janet Grossnickle of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Investment Management.</p>

<div> survey, farm income, farmland values, financial conditions, commodity prices
<br />
The August farm survey showed decreased farm income expectations, lower farmland values, and weakened financial conditions, leading to decreased investment optimism and concern over commodity prices.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The August&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4243260-1&amp;h=1915940469&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fageconomybarometer%2F&amp;a=Purdue+University%2FCME+Group+Ag+Economy+Barometer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="xn-org">Purdue University</span>/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer</a>&nbsp;dropped 13 points from July to a reading of 100, echoing levels seen from fall 2015 to winter 2016 during the early stages of a significant downturn in the U.S. farm economy. The Index of Current Conditions also dropped 17 points to 83, while the Index of Future Expectations decreased by 11 points to 108. Weakening farm income prospects weighed on farmers' sentiment as the outlook for a bountiful fall harvest was more than offset by declining crop prices. This month's survey was conducted from&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">Aug. 12-16, 2024</span>.</p>
<p>"Weakness in the barometer and related indices provide a signal that farmers are concerned about the possibility of extended weakness in farm incomes, similar to what took place from 2015 to 2019,"&nbsp;said&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4243260-1&amp;h=2802801166&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fageconomybarometer%2Fteam%2Fjim-mintert%2F&amp;a=James+Mintert" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="xn-person">James Mintert</span></a>, the barometer's principal investigator and director of&nbsp;<span class="xn-org">Purdue University's</span>&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4243260-1&amp;h=3861785331&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fhome%2F&amp;a=Center+for+Commercial+Agriculture" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Center for Commercial Agriculture</a>.</p>
<p>August's survey results indicate a shift among farmers' primary concerns, with 30% of respondents identifying lower commodity prices as their primary concern, compared to 33% who cited high input costs. Last year at this time only 20% pointed to weak commodity prices as a top concern.</p>
<p>However, concerns about rising interest rates have lessened, with only 17% of farmers mentioning this issue, down from 24% last year. Looking ahead, 68% of respondents expect interest rates to decrease in the coming year, while just 19% anticipate an increase.</p>
<p>The Farm Financial Performance Index dropped 9 points from July's survey and 14 points from a year ago, reaching its lowest level since&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">July 2020</span>, when there was widespread uncertainty from COVID-related lockdowns. The decline in financial performance reflects ongoing concerns about weak financial conditions. In turn, weakening financial conditions led many farmers to say that now is not a good time to invest, resulting in the Farm Capital Investment Index falling 7 points to 31, matching its all-time low.</p>
<p>"Farmers have also become less optimistic about farmland values this summer than in recent years," said Mintert. "The percentage of farmers who think farmland values could decline within the upcoming year has been rising, which is consistent with the weak outlook for financial conditions. The weak capital investment index reading suggests farmers are going to pull back on capital expenditures."</p>
<p>Respondents' outlook on farmland values faded in August, with the Short-Term Farmland Value Expectations Index dropping 13 points to 105. This marks a 21-point decline from a year ago and a 41-point drop from three years ago, when the index was at its peak. The decrease is attributable to a rise in the percentage of producers expecting farmland values to decline over the next year, increasing from 13% in July to 24% in August. The Long-Term Farmland Value Index also fell, dropping 4 points to 142.</p>
<p>Despite concerns about weakening farm income, a majority of respondents expect farmland cash rental rates for the 2025 crop year to remain stable. According to this month's survey, 70% of U.S. crop farmers anticipate that rental rates will stay the same, while only 16% expect a decline in lease rates.</p>

<div> Index, Small Business, Sales, Transactions, Growth
<br />
Small business sales and transactions showed year-over-year growth but declined month-over-month. Retail and restaurants saw positive trends.
<br /><br />Summary: 
Small business sales and transactions showed year-over-year growth but declined month-over-month. Retail and restaurants saw positive trends. <div>
<ul>
<li><i>Fiserv Small Business Index is unchanged at 141</i></li>
<li><i style="font-family: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">Small business sales grew 1.6% year over year, and declined 0.3% month over month; transactions grew 5.7% year over year, and 1.3% month over month</i></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.fiserv.com/" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Fiserv, Inc.</a>&nbsp;(NYSE: FI), a leading global provider of payments and financial services technology, has published the Fiserv Small Business Index for August 2024. The Fiserv Small Business Index is an indicator of the pace and mix of consumer spending at small businesses in the United States at national, state and industry levels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the beginning of each month, the Fiserv Small Business Index provides first-to-market insight into consumer spending at small businesses,&rdquo; said Jennifer LaClair, Head of Merchant Solutions at Fiserv. &ldquo;This monthly view of consumer spending has become an important economic indicator, providing a timely understanding of small business performance so we can better serve clients and partners across the small business ecosystem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nationally, the seasonally adjusted&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fiserv.com/en/fiserv-small-business-index.html" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Fiserv Small Business Index</a>&nbsp;in August was 141, unchanged from July. On a year-over-year basis, both small business sales (+1.6%) and total transactions (+5.7%) grew compared to August 2023, pointing to healthy consumer foot traffic. Month-over-month sales declined slightly (-0.3%) compared to July despite transactions growing (+1.3%). Transaction growth outpacing total sales can partly be attributed to recent declines in inflation, including July 2024 marking the lowest inflation rate since early 2021.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consumers made notable shifts to their spending patterns in August, resulting in restaurant and retail &ndash; including grocery, gas stations, and clothing &ndash; all trending upward in the month,&rdquo; said Prasanna Dhore, Chief Data Officer at Fiserv. &ldquo;Meanwhile, many service-based businesses, including specialty trade contractors and professional services, saw growth rates slow.&rdquo;</p>
<h4><span>Retail Growth Continues</span></h4>
<p>The Small Business Retail Index rose one point in August to 147. Year-over-year sales (+3.0%) and transactions (+7.3%) grew significantly as average ticket sizes saw a noticeable decline (-4.3%) compared to 2023. Back-to-school shopping, favorable pricing trends and a recently reported rise in consumer confidence contributed to this growth. Year over year, the fastest growing retail categories were General Merchandise (+8.8%), Food and Beverage Stores (+7.9%) and Sporting Goods (+5.6%).</p>
<p>Following the yearly trend, month-over-month retail sales (+1.0%) and transactions (+1.5%) both grew as average ticket sizes declined (-0.5%). Monthly growth highlighted a different mix of consumer priorities, with Clothing (+2.1%), Food and Beverage (+1.9%) and Furniture (+1.3%) seeing the most growth compared to July.</p>
<h4><span>Restaurants Reverse Trend</span></h4>
<p>Food Services and Drinking Places, which includes restaurants,<span>&nbsp;</span>indexed at 126 in August, a 3-point gain compared to July. The upward swing in spend marked a notable turnaround compared to July&rsquo;s index, when spend slowed on both an annual and monthly basis. Gains were widespread across the U.S., with nearly every state in the country seeing increased restaurant patronage in August.</p>
<p>Year over year, restaurants saw strong growth in both total sales (+4.9%) and foot traffic (+4.2%); average ticket size grew slightly (+0.7%). Month-over-month restaurant sales (+2.7%) and transactions (+1.1%) increased compared to July, reversing a streak of two consecutive months of slowing restaurant sales and foot traffic. Average ticket size also grew (+1.5%) month over month.</p>
<h4><span>Other Industry Movers</span></h4>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li>Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services continues seeing significant growth in sales (+9.6%) and transactions (+8.5%) year over year, despite sales (-1.0%) and transactions (-2.8%) slowing slightly compared to July. Demand for a wide variety of professional services was healthy in August, with veterinary, legal, advertising and general business services among the strongest.</li>
<li>Specialty Trade Contractor sales (-0.9%) declined year over year while transactions grew (+1.5%). Month-over-month sales (-2.2%) also slowed while transactions remained steady (+0.2%). Demand for HVAC and plumbing services saw the biggest decline compared to August 2023, while electricians, roofers and concrete contractors had modest gains.</li>
<li>Additional year-over-year sales growth categories included Amusement/Gambling/Recreation (+14.1%), Web Search, Libraries and Information Services (+12.7%), and Food Manufacturing (+12.8%); the sharpest annual sales declines were in Real Estate (-15.2%), Hospitals (-7.7%) and Educational Services (-6.8%).</li>
<li>Truck Transportation (+4.4%), Food Manufacturing, (+3.9%), and Performing Arts Spectator Sports and Related Industries (+3.1%) sales all saw month-over-month growth; Educational Services (-5.5%), Insurance (-4.3%) and Ambulatory Healthcare (-3.4%) sales saw the largest month-over-month declines.</li>

<br />
ShipFinex and Tokeny join forces to democratize maritime investments, ensuring regulatory compliance, and accelerating the growth of tokenized maritime assets. <br />Summary: <div>
<div class="wpb_text_column ">
<div class="wpb_wrapper">
<p><a href="https://www.shipfinex.com/">ShipFinex</a>, a leading innovator in maritime finance, and&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, the pioneering onchain finance operating system for tokenized securities, are proud to announce a strategic partnership aimed at transforming the way maritime assets are tokenized and managed.</p>
<p>This collaboration brings together two industry pioneers with a shared vision of enhancing transparency, security, and compliance in the tokenization of maritime assets.

</div>
</div>
<div class="wpb_text_column ">
<div class="wpb_wrapper">
<h5><b>Elevating Maritime Finance</b></h5>
<p>Shipping and Maritime Finance have been an exclusive asset class/sector due to limited access in public equity markets and significant initial capital requirements to invest in assets, making it challenging for many to participate despite the Shipping market consistently outperforming many other asset classes.</p>
<p>ShipFinex and Tokeny are committed to democratizing access to maritime investments. Through this partnership, ShipFinex will leverage Tokeny&rsquo;s cutting-edge technology to ensure that all tokenized maritime assets on its platform meet the highest standards of regulatory compliance and security, using the ERC-3643 standard. This integration not only enhances investor confidence but also positions both companies as leaders in the digital transformation of maritime finance.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="wpb_text_column ">
<div class="wpb_wrapper">
<h5><b>Strategic Alignment</b></h5>
<p>The partnership between ShipFinex and Tokeny is a strategic alignment that amplifies the strengths of both companies. ShipFinex&rsquo;s expertise in maritime finance, combined with Tokeny&rsquo;s proven track record in tokenized securities infrastructure, creates a powerful synergy that is expected to accelerate the growth and adoption of tokenized maritime assets globally.</p>
<p>Following ShipFinex&rsquo;s recent announcement of receiving initial approval from VARA in the UAE, this partnership underscores the company&rsquo;s commitment to adopting world-class solutions to enhance its platform&rsquo;s security and compliance. This collaboration highlights robust infrastructure and innovative regulated approach underpinning ShipFinex&rsquo;s operations.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="wpb_text_column ">
<div class="wpb_wrapper">
<h5><b>Looking Ahead</b></h5>
<p>This strategic partnership sets the stage for future growth and expansion, as both ShipFinex and Tokeny continue to innovate and lead in their respective fields. The integration of their capabilities will facilitate the broader adoption of tokenized maritime assets, offering investors a secure and efficient marketplace.</p>

<title>Companies, Banks And The Public Sector Raise Their Stakes In The Spanish Stock Market, Of Which International Investors Own 49%</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> investors, Spanish stock market, public sector, international, households <br />
<br />
Public sector, non-financial companies, banks, and international investors increased their share ownership in the Spanish stock market. Household ownership also rose. International investors continue to hold nearly half of the market. <br />
Non-financial companies and banks also saw increased ownership in the Spanish stock market, while international investors continue to hold nearly half of its capitalization. Spanish households also increased their share ownership. Public sector investment is at a 26-year high. <br /> <div>
<ul>
<li><span>Public sector investment in the Spanish stock market is at a 26-year high of 3.3%</span></li>
<li><span>The Spanish stock market is 49% controlled by international investors, a drop of one percentage point from last year's all-time high</span></li>
<li><span>In contrast, the share of Spanish households increases by two tenths of a percentage point compared to the 2023 data, to 16.4%</span></li>
<li><span>The share of non-financial companies in the ownership of Spanish shares rises to 21.9%, a twelve-year high, and that of banks rebounds by four tenths of a percentage point.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Non-financial companies, banks and the public sector increased their share ownership in the Spanish stock market at the end of 2023, with international investors continuing to control nearly half of its capitalization. This is reflected in the Report on the Ownership of Listed Spanish Shares published today by BME's Research Department.</p>
<p>As the report points out, public sector participation in the stock market reached its highest level (16.6%) in 1992, when the privatisation process of a large number of public companies began, which reduced it to residual levels (0.6%). However, this dynamic has been reversing in the last decade following public aid to some banks and the maintenance and revaluation of significant stakes in listed companies, to reach the current figures, which place its weight at 3.3%, valued at around 23,000 million euros. The data in the report refer to the end of 2023, so they do not yet include the successive acquisitions of Telef&oacute;nica shares up to at least 10% of the capital made as early as 2024.</p>
<p>Another relevant fact is the large presence of non-resident investors in the Spanish stock market, with 49% of capitalization, a fall of 1.3 percentage points compared to last year. Once again this year, the comparative figure for international investor participation in unlisted and listed companies stands out. In the former, foreign investors hold an average of 25% compared to 48.7% in listed companies, which shows that being listed on the stock market is attractive to international investors.</p>
<p>In this category, sovereign wealth funds such as the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund, which at the end of 2023 had a stake of close to 12.5 billion euros in the Spanish stock market, the QIA sovereign wealth fund (7.1 billion), the Japanese GPIF (close to 3.2 billion) and the Singapore sovereign wealth fund, GIC (1.6 billion), are gaining increasing weight. As for the large international fund managers, BlackRock, which has 30.6 billion euros in Spanish listed companies, Vanguard Group with more than 21.8 billion, and Fidelity with almost 9.5 billion stand out, among others.</p>
<p>The report stresses that the high participation of international investors in the Spanish stock market further emphasizes the importance of promoting stock market listings so that more companies can benefit from the advantages of financial markets, such as global investment flows. This is highlighted in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bolsasymercados.es/docs/BME/docsSubidos/Estudios-Articulos/BME-Whitepaper.pdf">White Paper on fostering the competitiveness of Spanish capital markets</a>, published by BME in January and which has been received with broad consensus in the sector.</p>
<p>In the case of households, the report reveals that their shareholding in the Spanish stock market increased by two tenths in 2023 to 16.4%. Some 12.5% of Spanish households own shares in listed companies, which amounts to 2.4 million families, according to figures from the latest Household Financial Survey, compiled by the Bank of Spain. Although the accumulated financial assets in the hands of Spanish households reached 2.83 trillion euros, 5.8% more than in 2022 and a growth of 40% compared to a decade ago, it continues to maintain a high concentration in bank deposits.</p>
<p>Finally, non-financial companies control 21.9% of the Spanish stock market, nine tenths more than a year ago and a nine-year high; banks and savings banks reach a 3.5% share after a rebound of 4 tenths and Collective Investment Institutions, insurance and other non-banking financial institutions control 5.9% of total listed shares, the same percentage as a year ago.</p>
<p>You can find the report at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bolsasymercados.es/docs/BME/docsSubidos/Estudios-Articulos/BME-Report-Ownership-Listed-Spanish-Stock-2023.pdf?v=0ZqCLg!!">the following link</a>.</p>

<div> platform, data, Tradeverse, harmonization, AI 
<br />
Summary: Tradeverse, a data platform by Broadridge, harmonizes multi-asset class data, ensures data integrity, and enables AI initiatives for trading firms. It enhances efficiency and productivity. <div>
<p>The launch of Tradeverse, a new data platform by global Fintech leader&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.broadridge.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Broadridge Financial Solutions</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span>Inc. (NYSE: BR), will help trading firms eliminate data silos, unleash the potential of their data across the enterprise and better manage costs, reconciliation, and the data quality and lineage challenges of firms typical complex platform ecosystems.</p>
<p>Tradeverse consolidates real-time, multi-asset class data from multiple vendor applications and platforms from orders and executions through settlement into a unified, harmonized data platform. It reduces errors, simplifies access with a common data ontology across front, middle and back office and incorporates robust security to protect sensitive information and maintain data integrity. The clear data structure unlocks insights for all key functions &ndash; trading desks, operations, risk, finance, and regulatory - by providing a trusted and transparent data source.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;A Tradeverse implementation we&rsquo;ve recently completed with a global bank is proving the power of harmonizing trade data&rdquo;&nbsp;</i>said&nbsp;<b>Hugh Daly, Head of Data and AI, Capital Markets, Broadridge</b>.&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;The solution delivers efficiencies for their regulatory reporting and compliance teams, allowing direct access to the data for business users initiating complex searches using natural language.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Many enterprise data warehouse projects fail to deliver the expected benefits due to the complexity arising from disparate representations of the source data. Tradeverse is focused on ensuring true data harmonization. The application of business logic and constraint of the data ontology is critical to that. This leads to seamless access to high quality data, which ultimately accelerates time-to-value for multiple AI initiatives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In another use case, the Securities Operations team of a top ten capital markets firm is using Tradeverse&rsquo;s harmonized data platform coupled with Broadridge&rsquo;s Generative AI tool for Operations (<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.broadridge.com/financial-services/capital-markets/transform-trade-life-cycle/opsgpt" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OpsGPT</a>) to empower users.&nbsp; This is allowing the teams to identify and implement productivity gains such as settlement fails analysis that were previously incredibly hard to capture in a fragmented ecosystem.</p>
<p>Tradeverse will be the cornerstone of a number of innovative value-add business solutions that Broadridge will bring to market in the coming months.</p>

<div> Singapore, Asia, finance, regulations, growth
Summary:
Collaboration, Rapid Response, Alliance, Flexibility, Technology are key to upholding market integrity in Asia's growing financial landscape. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Wilson and Kyle, for inviting me to speak at this event. It's a pleasure to be back in Singapore where I began the Asian phase of my career almost exactly 25 years ago in September 1999. Somewhat distressingly, I am told kids today refer to this as the late 1900s.</p>
<p>Also, congratulations to the Singaporeans on your country&rsquo;s 59th anniversary. I&rsquo;m sure you all share my gratification in seeing the economic miracle the city-state has achieved, and that also epitomises the impressive progress of Asia as a whole in the past decades. Indeed, both Singapore and Hong Kong have grown together as closer partners and also as leading financial hubs in the region. Core to our success is a shared belief in the rule of law, which translates into a robust regulatory framework and a market of integrity in finance. These elements are vital to sustaining Asia&rsquo;s remarkable growth and attracting investments much needed to power an even brighter future for Asia.</p>
<p>This year also marks the 35th anniversary of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC). Under our four strategic priorities for 2024-2026, we commit ourselves to bolstering market resilience, global competitiveness, financial innovation, and operational efficiency. For the Enforcement Division which I lead, our primary goal to uphold market integrity is certainly critical to a resilient and competitive market.</p>
<p>Achieving this goal is increasingly challenging. Technological advancements and global connectivity mean we are facing far more sophisticated financial crimes and have to swiftly adapt. In this context, I&rsquo;ll share with you how we &ldquo;CRAFT&rdquo; our strategies through: Collaboration, Rapid Response, Alliance, Flexibility and Technology.</p>

<div> collaboration, financial literacy, SET, NSF, SLF
<br /><br />Summary: 
The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) renews collaboration with NSF and SLF to promote financial literacy and planning for various target groups. <div>
<p>The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) has renewed a Memorandum of Understanding with the National Savings Fund (NSF) and the Student Loan Fund (SLF), marking the 7th consecutive year of collaboration to promote financial planning knowledge. This initiative aims to enhance learning in the digital era, helping Thais achieve financial well-being across various target groups. The financial literacy content, available both online and offline, is expected to reach over 2.5 million members of NSF and SLF nationwide annually.</p>
<p><b>SET Senior Executive Vice President Soraphol Tulayasathien</b> highlighted that Thailand is currently facing various financial challenges, including rising household debt levels and the transition to a super-aged society. Most Thais are encountering the problem of aging before achieving financial stability, leaving them with insufficient funds to live during retirement. SET is accelerating its efforts to promote financial literacy, a crucial skill for building financial security for all ages. This aligns with SET's strategic plan and its 50th-anniversary concept of &ldquo;Make it Work for Every Future." SET has modernized financial and investment knowledge resources, including the SET e-Learning platform, which offers diverse courses tailored to individual needs in line with new learning paradigms. In collaboration with partners, SET aims to deliver this knowledge to various target groups, ultimately improving Thai people&rsquo;s long-term financial stability and quality of life.</p>
<p>SET has recently renewed the MOU with NSF and SLF to promote financial literacy, marking the 7th consecutive year of this collaboration. This four-year MOU aims to expand financial knowledge to people from all walks of life, including students, working professionals, informal workers, freelancers, and the general public. The initiative seeks to foster financial literacy, enabling individuals to manage debt effectively, design appropriate savings plans, and ensure adequate pensions for retirement.</p>
<p><b>NSF Secretary-General Jaruluk Ruangsuwan</b> emphasized that NSF is driving the promotion of financial and investment literacy, as well as fostering social sustainability by establishing basic pension security for the future. NSF also advances learning in the new digital era, enabling Thai people to achieve financial well-being. This aligns with NSF's vision of building a foundation for savings and driving comprehensive pension schemes for the public sector. At present, NSF has 2.6 million members<b>.</b></p>
<p>The collaboration between SET and NSF, which began in 2018, has successfully enhanced public understanding of financial planning, strengthened financial stability, and created healthy financial practices, ensuring quality retirement through savings with NSF. Building on this success, SET and NSF have renewed the MOU to continue joint efforts in promoting financial planning for Thais and enhancing understanding of financial management, particularly retirement planning, to ensure sustainability and efficiency moving forward."</p>
<p><b>SLF Manager Chainarong Kajchapanan</b> said that SLF is dedicated to promoting knowledge and various skills to increase educational opportunities for Thai youth, especially in financial literacy essential for everyone. This initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance and value of student loans and foster responsibility in loan repayment.</p>
<p>SLF and SET have maintained a strong partnership for seven years since 2018. Currently, there are 71 SET e-Learning courses provided to SLF targets covering financial planning, investment, and entrepreneurship. These courses are available free of charge, allowing loan borrowers to accumulate public service hours as required by the Fund. The program has seen remarkable success, with a cumulative enrollment of over 10 million, showing significant year-on-year growth.</p>
<p>The Fund expects all borrowers to gain financial knowledge to manage their income, assets, and liabilities appropriately. This knowledge will be beneficial in preparing for and creating additional opportunities for their future. Moreover, it will enable them to repay their loans on schedule, ensuring a revolving fund that can continue to provide educational opportunities for future generations.</p>
<p>This collaboration between the two organizations builds upon previous successes by strengthening financial literacy among Thai youth. This initiative is crucial in developing a capable workforce that will play a vital role in the country's future development.</p>
<p class="p1">SET has been determined to drive financial and investment knowledge for the public for over two decades, collaborating with both public and private sector partners. Initiatives include the "Happy Money, Happy Young Old" project, the "Happy Money, Financial Mentor" program, and various online resources such as articles, video clips, and infographics. Moreover, SET e-Learning courses cover financial planning, debt management, retirement planning, and investment.

Summary:<br />
The Capacity Allocation Mechanisms Network Code (CAM NC) is being revised to address the evolving gas market and decarbonisation goals in Europe. ACER will hold a final public consultation and make recommendations to the Commission for the updated text of the network code. <div>
<p>The Capacity Allocation Mechanisms Network Code (<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsFBFcGBVlTUEwPVwIBHVZbDQYdClgDBBoCXQJUAwEFA1BQUlAdWFdWB10ABgcdV10AVx0GCAJfGgxWAwAZBQ0AAwlQVVAHU1NXRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CAM NC</a>) harmonises how Transmission System Operators (TSOs) offer and allocate available gas transmission pipeline capacity to network users. With Europe&rsquo;s decarbonisation goals and the evolving gas market, the network code, last amended in 2017, now needs to be updated.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The revision process</span></p>

<div> Exchange, Cboe BIDS VWAP-X, liquidity, European equities, participants
Summary:<br /> Cboe Europe announces BIDS VWAP-X service with support from major participants, offering trajectory crossing for European equities. Scheduled to launch October 21. <div>
<p>Cboe Europe, the largest pan-European stock exchange<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;and a division of Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe: CBOE), today announces that it has secured the support of a broad range of participants for Cboe BIDS VWAP-X, its new trading service allowing participants to source and match liquidity at a forward benchmark price. This service is scheduled to launch on October 21, subject to regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>Early adopters of the Cboe BIDS VWAP-X service include Bernstein, BNP Paribas, BMO Capital Markets, Instinet Europe, Jefferies, KCx and Virtu Financial.</p>
<p>Natan Tiefenbrun, President, North American and European Equities, Cboe Global Markets, said: "We are delighted to have secured such a strong group of initial Participants to support Cboe BIDS VWAP-X and are in active discussions with numerous others who are looking to utilise this service at the earliest opportunity.

<p>Brian Gallagher, Head of Equity Execution, BNP Paribas, said: "We support innovation in the European market, and we will embrace it when it complements BNP Paribas's liquidity access and enriches our clients' execution experience".</p>
<p>Salvador Rodriguez, EMEA Head of Global Execution Services, Instinet Europe Limited, said: "Benchmark Crossing offers an encouraging innovation in Equity Market Structure in EMEA that should improve the ability for algos to find high quality counterpart liquidity. The approach and implementation should allow for agency algos to trade versus multiple benchmarks at a fair price with a good balance of simplicity, as well as allowing more complex control features based on differing client interaction requirements."</p>
<p>Ben Springett, Head of Electronic and Program Trading, EMEA, Jefferies, said: "Jefferies welcome this innovation enabling us to provide incremental liquidity opportunities to our client base. VWAP crossing mechanisms can unlock liquidity that otherwise wouldn't necessarily meet on a multilateral venue, utilising a mechanism that we have seen prove beneficial for algo performance on a range of benchmarks."</p>
<p>Chris McConville, Global Head of Execution Services and Trading at KCx, said: "KCx welcomes this innovation to the European market. We believe trajectory crossing is a positive disruption to the marketplace and could provide incremental liquidity to our client base."</p>
<p>James Osborne, Global Head of Algorithmic Development, Virtu Financial, said: "Trajectory crossing is more than just a useful feature for VWAP algorithms - it's a unique matching mechanism that can benefit many trading algorithms when utilised in conjunction with target benchmarks. Many of Virtu's US algorithms already leverage elements of trajectory crossing to enhance performance and we look forward to extending the same benefits to our European algorithms with the launch of Cboe BIDS VWAP-X."</p>
<p>As previously announced, Cboe BIDS VWAP-X is a first-of-its-kind, exchange-operated trajectory crossing service for European equities, which allows participants to source and match liquidity at a forward benchmark price. It is being provided as a service of Cboe BIDS Europe, the region's largest block trading platform<sup>2</sup>, utilising BIDS' proven conditional trade negotiation and execution workflow to match orders based on a standard, exchange-regulated volume weighted average price (VWAP) methodology.</p>
<p>Cboe BIDS VWAP-X will allow market participants to submit conditional VWAP indications of interest (IOIs) into the service. Once a potential match is found, firms will be invited to firm-up their IOIs, and after eligible order quantities are matched a standard matching cycle will take place to calculate the interval-VWAP trade price. Trades will be reported as off-book, on-exchange executions in real-time, allowing them to be centrally cleared through Cboe Europe's interoperable clearing model.</p>
<p>The service will benefit from BIDS' established protections against information leakage surrounding IOIs, including disclosure and interactions controlled by customisable tools and counterparty score-carding and filtering based on past trading behaviour.</p>
<p>At launch, the service will be accessible by sell side participants through FIX connectivity. Customer testing is already underway ahead of a planned launch on October 21, subject to regulatory approvals.</p>

<div> workshop, audit quality, financial reporting, enforcement, surveillance 
Summary: The AARG and FSSG workshop focused on audit quality, financial reporting compliance, enforcement, and surveillance strategies with ASEAN regulators and industry leaders. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The ASEAN Audit Regulators Group (AARG) and Financial Statements Surveillance Group (FSSG) recently held a workshop hosted by the Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) to strengthen audit quality and financial reporting compliance in the region.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The event brought together regulators and industry leaders from Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines.</p>
<p>As part of ongoing efforts by ASEAN members of the International Forum of Independent Audit Regulators (IFIAR), the workshop served as a platform for collaboration and knowledge sharing.</p>
<p>Participants discussed key regulatory issues including the implementation of the new International Standard on Quality Management (ISQM) requirements affecting audit firms and approaches to ISQM 1 reviews across ASEAN.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A unique aspect of the workshop was the focus on enforcement and communication strategies, building on efforts to drive impactful enforcement of audit regulations. The AARG also had discussions with the regional leadership of three global network audit firms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FSSG workshop addressed the importance of consistency in financial reporting. This is a common challenge for regulators in today&rsquo;s globalised financial markets as consistent reporting helps to ensure more accurate assessments of the financial statements. Consistent financial reporting also eases comparability within a company over time and across different companies, industries, and jurisdictions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The workshop further explored effective surveillance strategies and approaches, including greater technology integration.</p>
<p>The audit and surveillance regulators reaffirmed the importance of compliance with financial reporting regulations in promoting market integrity and enhancing investor protection.</p>

<div> published, licensing, professionals, guides, requirements
<br />
The SFC published new guides for licensing professionals, updated guides for Mainland practitioners, and plans to organize workshops for industry understanding.
<br /><br />Summary: <br />The SFC published new licensing guides, updated guides for Mainland practitioners, and plans to organize industry workshops. <div>
<p>The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) today published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/Regulatory-functions/Intermediaries/Licensing/Quick-licensing-guide" target="_blank">two new quick reference guides</a>&nbsp;to assist visiting and returning professionals in understanding the SFC's pragmatic licensing regime, complementing the five popular quick reference guides published in 2023 (Note 1).</p>
<p>Illustrating with case studies, the two new guides offer useful information about licensing options and processes as well as various conditions for examination exemptions, in order to facilitate a smooth and compliant transition to the Hong Kong financial markets for these professionals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We see a growing trend of financial talents coming to Hong Kong and we offer a pragmatic licensing regime to accommodate such demand,&rdquo; said Dr Eric Yip, the SFC&rsquo;s Executive Director of Intermediaries. &ldquo;While the first series was very well received, these new handy guides should help industry practitioners and potential applicants better grasp the essence of the SFC&rsquo;s expectations and licensing requirements with an aim to continuously strengthen Hong Kong&rsquo;s pool of financial talents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SFC plans to organise workshops later this year to help the industry better understand its licensing policies and recent initiatives.</p>
<p>Additionally, the SFC has updated the Chinese version of the quick reference guide for Mainland practitioners (Note 2) and released a new English version.</p>
<p>These quick reference guides can be accessed on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/Regulatory-functions/Intermediaries/Licensing/Quick-licensing-guide" target="_blank">the SFC website</a>, and prospective licence applicants are encouraged to contact the SFC at licensing@sfc.hk for further assistance.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>The SFC published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/Regulatory-functions/Intermediaries/Licensing/Quick-licensing-guide" target="_blank">quick reference guides</a>&nbsp;to licensing and competence requirements for family offices, private equity firms, hedge fund managers and overseas and Mainland practitioners in March 2023. More than 32,000 copies of quick reference guides have been distributed, downloaded or viewed since then.</li>
<li>The Chinese version of the SFC&rsquo;s quick reference guide to competence requirements for Mainland practitioners was first published in March 2023.</li>

<div> Amendments, Liquidity Provider, Qatar Stock Exchange, Market Efficiency, Dividend Distribution
Summary:<br />
QSE introduces new criteria for liquidity providers, aiming to boost liquidity, market efficiency, and investor confidence. Additionally, dividend regulations enhance market attractiveness. 
Summary: <div>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>On the occasion of the commencement of the new amendments to the Liquidity Provider (LP) Scheme, particularly concerning the performance evaluation criteria for liquidity providers, Qatar Stock Exchange (QSE) announces the inclusion of all these amendments and new criteria in the standardized and approved contracts for this activity, effective from today, Sunday, September 1, 2024. These criteria will be reviewed on a semi-annual basis to ensure their alignment with international best practices and market needs.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>These amendments are part of a package of incentives offered by Qatar Stock Exchange to develop the liquidity provider activity in the Qatari market, contributing to increased liquidity and trading, attracting more investors, and enhancing the competitiveness of the Qatari market. This development is part of the ongoing efforts of the Qatar Financial Markets Authority and Qatar Stock Exchange to improve market efficiency and increase its appeal to both local and international investors, thereby contributing to the sustainable growth of the Qatari market.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>It is worth noting that a liquidity provider is a licensed financial services company authorized to engage in liquidity provision activities, which enhance the liquidity of listed securities by continuously offering buy or sell prices for a specific security, in accordance with the terms and conditions outlined in the agreement between the liquidity provider and the listed company.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The introduction of the revised Liquidity Provider scheme is set to significantly lower liquidity costs and provide more depth in the order book, ensuring a more efficient, stable and transparent trading environment.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>As part of the aforementioned incentive package, the Qatar Financial Markets Authority recently introduced regulations for dividend distribution for listed joint-stock companies, allowing them to distribute interim dividends. In light of this step, some listed companies distributed semi-annual dividends in 2024. This important step enhances the attractiveness of the Qatari market by providing shareholders with more frequent returns on their investments, thereby increasing investor confidence and boosting trading activity in the market.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Interim dividends provide a steady return on investment before the company&rsquo;s final year-end dividend, offering investors regular income and a more predictable cash flow. This approach not only boosts investor confidence but also encourages long-term commitment to the market, fostering greater market participation and liquidity.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>QSE is continuously working on developing investment tools by launching various initiatives that align with market needs and international best practices. As part of its strategy, the exchange is committed to enhancing market efficiency, transparency, accessibility, and ensuring a better trading experience for all market participants.</span></span></span></p>

Also, proposed Rule 12800(g)(1)(B) would provide that such would not apply to arbitrations in which the customer requests no hearing or an Option Two special proceeding, unless the customer requests that the Document Production Lists apply to all parties.</span><br /><br /><span>Please refer to the following Regulatory Circulars for more information on the amendments:</span></p>
