<div> charged, aiding and abetting, SEC, fraud, audit<br>
Summary: The SEC charged Olayinka Oyebola and his accounting firm with aiding and abetting fraud by providing fake audit reports. They face civil penalties and injunctions.<br><br> <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Olayinka Oyebola and his Public Company Accounting Oversight Board-registered accounting firm, Olayinka Oyebola &amp; Co. (Chartered Accountants), with aiding and abetting&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023-254">a massive securities fraud</a>&nbsp;perpetrated by Mmobuosi Odogwu Banye, also known as Dozy Mmobuosi, and three related U.S. companies that Mmobuosi controlled (the Tingo entities). The SEC recently&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-26086">obtained a $250 million final judgment</a>&nbsp;against Mmobuosi and the Tingo entities.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint alleges that Oyebola and his firm deliberately failed to take action upon learning that businessman Mmobuosi and the Tingo entities created multiple fake audit reports bearing Oyebola&rsquo;s signature and included them in SEC filings as though they were issued by Oyebola&rsquo;s firm. Oyebola allegedly made material misstatements to the then-auditor of one of the Tingo entities, and Oyebola and the firm helped Mmobuosi conceal that the audit reports were fake, resulting in the auditor, investors, and regulators relying upon the misstatements and fake audit reports to their detriment. According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Oyebola and his firm&rsquo;s assistance enabled Mmobuosi and the Tingo entities to carry out a multi-year scheme to inflate financial performance metrics and defraud investors worldwide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As alleged, Oyebola and his firm violated the public trust and abdicated their responsibilities as public company accountants and auditors by helping Mmobuosi and the Tingo entities effectuate and conceal their fraud,&rdquo; said Antonia M. Apps, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s New York Regional Office. &ldquo;We will not hesitate to hold gatekeepers to the public markets accountable when they facilitate fiction rather than truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Oyebola and his firm with aiding and abetting violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by Mmobuosi and the three Tingo entities. The SEC also charged Oyebola with aiding and abetting Mmobuosi&rsquo;s violation of lying to auditors. The complaint seeks civil penalties as well as permanent injunctive relief, including an order permanently barring Oyebola and his firm from acting as auditors or accountants for U.S. public companies or otherwise providing substantial assistance in the preparation of financial statements filed with the SEC.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s ongoing investigation is being conducted by Michael DiBattista, Christopher Mele, Jeremy Brandt, Gerald Gross, and Rebecca Reilly under the supervision of Tejal D. Shah. It is being litigated by David Zetlin-Jones and Mr.&nbsp;DiBattista under the supervision of Alexander Vasilescu, all of the New York Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Israel Securities Authority.</p>

<title>MNI Indicators: Chicago Business Barometer™ - Augmented To 46.6 In September - September 2024 Report</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/mni-indicators-chicago-business-barometer-augmented-to-466-in-september-s/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Employment, Order Backlogs, Supplier Deliveries, Prices Paid, New Orders
<br>
Summary: Prices Paid increased significantly. Order Backlogs and Employment improved, while Supplier Deliveries, New Orders, and Production weakened. Inventory dipped. <div>
<p>The Chicago Business Barometer&trade;, produced  with MNI, rose slightly by 0.5 points to 46.6 in  September. The Barometer has now been in a tight  range between 45.3-47.4 for four consecutive  months. The Barometer has remained in  contractionary territory for 24 of the past 25  months.</p>
<p>The marginal rise was due to two of the five  subcomponents improving significantly: Order  Backlogs and Employment. Meanwhile, reductions  in Supplier Deliveries, New Orders, and Production  restricted the upward move.</p>
<p>Order Backlogs increased 5.3 points, although it  still remains below the 2024 high in June. This was  due to the highest proportion of respondents  reporting unchanged backlogs since February.</p>
<p>Employment rose 5.0 points, after two  consecutive months of decline, with hiring in  concentrated skills.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Supplier Deliveries fell 4.9 points,  after four successive months of increases. A  reading above 50 may not be reflecting demand  changes, instead possibly pointing to delays in  supply chains.</p>
<p>New Orders and Production both weakened 1.1  points.</p>
<p>Prices Paid remain elevated for the second  consecutive month, rising by 8.3 points, making it  the highest since August 2023 and significantly  above the year-to-date average of 64.6. This was  due to nearly half of respondents reporting higher  prices paid.</p>
<p>Finally, Inventories dipped 3.6 points.</p>
<p>The survey ran from 1 st September to 17th September.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p><span>The&nbsp;<span><span>Amman Stock Exchange (ASE</span></span>) has conducted the periodic quarterly review of the ASE indices constituents in purpose of ensuring that these indices reflect the market performance and the trading activity of the listed companies. By this rebalancing, the activity of listed companies in regard to trading during the last quarter has been reviewed. After that, the ASE has conducted its screening process for all listed companies based on the criteria used by the ASE represented by full market capitalization of the companies and the number of trading days during last quarter.</span></p>
<p><span>As a result of this review, 2 companies have been excluded from the general index sample ASEGI and other 12 companies have been added. The companies that have been excluded from the index sample were: Aldaman for Investments, and Union Investment Corporation.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The companies that have been added to the index sample were: Middle East Insurance, Gulf Insurance Group - Jordan,</span></span>&nbsp;<span><span>Jordan Hotels &amp; Tourism,</span></span>&nbsp;<span><span>Zara Investement Holding, Petra Education Company, Methaq Real Estate Investment,</span></span>&nbsp;<span><span>Jordan International Investment Co., Afaq Holding for Investment &amp; Real Estate Development Co. P.L.C,</span></span>&nbsp;<span><span>Tuhama for Financial Investments, Ibn Alhaytham Hospital Company, National Aluminium Industrial, and Jordan Vegetable Oil Industries.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span>As part of the process, the ASE calculated the free float for all listed companies on the ASE based on the data received from the Securities Depository Center. This review also includes the reduction of the weights for some companies to maintain the 10% cap that applied to index constitutes.</span></p>
<p><span>Regarding the general index ASEGI, the full market capitalization of the index constituents represents 93.0% of the total market capitalization of the companies listed on the ASE. The free float market capitalization of the index constitutes represents 95.2% of the total free float market capitalization of the listed companies on the ASE.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>As for the</span></span></span>&nbsp;<span><span><span>ASE20 and&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>ASETR indices</span></span></span>&nbsp;<span><span><span>the full market capitalization of the index constituents represents 84.1% of the total market capitalization of the companies listed on the ASE, while the free float market capitalization of these companies represents 86.4% of the total free float market capitalization of the ASE</span></span></span>&nbsp;<span><span><span>listed companies.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span>In light of the above, the index constituents will be modified on the 1st of October 2024. Interested parties can access to the constituents of the index with the new weights through the following link:</span></p>

<div> meeting, FOMC, inflation, economy, monetary policy
Summary: The speaker dissented on a recent FOMC decision, preferring a smaller interest rate cut due to concerns about inflation and the economy. He also expressed caution about the risks to the economic outlook and emphasized the need to maintain a balanced approach to monetary policy.<br /><br /> <div>
<p>Good morning. I would like to thank the Georgia Bankers Association for the invitation to join you today for your annual conference.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240930a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;I appreciate the opportunity to share my views on the U.S. economy and monetary policy before we engage on community banking issues and other matters affecting the banking industry.</p>
<p>In light of last week's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, I will begin my remarks by providing some perspective on my vote and will then share my current views on the economy and monetary policy.</p>
<p><strong>Update on the Most Recent FOMC Meeting</strong><br />In order to address high inflation, for more than two years, the FOMC increased and held the federal funds rate at a restrictive level. At our September meeting, the FOMC voted to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point to 4-3/4 to 5 percent and to continue reducing the Federal Reserve's securities holdings.</p>
<p>As the post-meeting statement noted, I dissented from the FOMC's decision, preferring instead to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 5 to 5‑1/4 percent. Last Friday, once our FOMC participant communications blackout period concluded, the Board of Governors released my statement explaining the decision to depart from the majority of the voting members. I agreed with the Committee's assessment that, given the progress we have seen since the middle of 2023 on both lowering inflation and cooling the labor market, it was appropriate to reflect this progress by recalibrating the level of the federal funds rate and begin the process of moving toward a more neutral stance of policy. As my statement notes, I preferred a smaller initial cut in the policy rate while the U.S. economy remains strong and inflation remains a concern, despite recent progress.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Conditions and Outlook</strong><br />In recent months, we have seen some further progress on slowing the pace of inflation, with monthly readings lower than the elevated pace seen in the first three months of the year. The 12-month measure of core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation, which provides a broader perspective than the more volatile higher-frequency readings, has moved down since April, although it came in at 2.7 percent in August, again remaining well above our 2 percent goal. The persistently high core inflation largely reflects pressures on housing prices, perhaps due in part to low inventories of affordable housing. The progress in lowering inflation since April is a welcome development, but core inflation is still uncomfortably above the Committee's 2 percent goal.</p>
<p>Prices remain much higher than before the pandemic, which continues to weigh on consumer sentiment. Higher prices have an outsized effect on lower- and moderate-income households, as these households devote a significantly larger share of income to food, energy, and housing. Prices for these spending categories have far outpaced overall inflation over the past few years.</p>
<p>Economic growth moderated earlier this year after coming in stronger last year. Private domestic final purchases (PDFP) growth has been solid and slowed much less than gross domestic product (GDP), as the slowdown in GDP growth was partly driven by volatile categories including net exports, suggesting that underlying economic growth was stronger than GDP indicated. PDFP has continued to increase at a solid pace so far in the third quarter, despite some further weakening in housing activity, as retail sales have shown further robust gains in July and August.</p>
<p>Although personal consumption has remained resilient, consumers appear to be pulling back on discretionary items and expenses, as evidenced in part by a decline in restaurant spending since late last year. Low- and moderate-income consumers no longer have extra savings to support this type of spending, and we have seen loan delinquency rates normalize from historically low levels during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The most recent labor market report shows that payroll employment gains have slowed appreciably to a pace moderately above 100,000 per month over the three months ending in August. The unemployment rate edged down to 4.2 percent in August from 4.3 percent in July. While unemployment is notably higher than a year ago, it is still at a historically low level and below my and the Congressional Budget Office's estimates of full employment.</p>
<p>The labor market has loosened from the extremely tight conditions of the past few years. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has declined further to a touch below the historically elevated pre-pandemic level&mdash;a sign that the number of available workers and the number of available jobs have come into better balance. But there are still more available jobs than available workers, a condition that before 2018 has only occurred twice for a prolonged period since World War II, further signaling ongoing labor market strength despite the reported data.</p>
<p>Although wage growth has slowed further in recent months, it remains indicative of a tight labor market. At just under 4 percent, as measured by both the employment cost index and average hourly earnings, wage gains are still above the pace consistent with our inflation goal given trend productivity growth.</p>
<p>The rise in the unemployment rate this year largely reflects weaker hiring, as job seekers entering or re-entering the labor force are taking longer to find work, while layoffs remain low. In addition to some cooling in labor demand, there are other factors likely contributing the increased unemployment. A mismatch between the skills of the new workers and available jobs could further raise unemployment, suggesting that higher unemployment has been partly driven by the stronger supply of workers. It is also likely that some temporary factors contributed to the recent rise in the unemployment rate, as unemployment among working age teenagers sharply increased in August.</p>
<p><strong>Preference for a More Measured Recalibration of Policy</strong><br />The U.S. economy remains strong and core inflation remains uncomfortably above our 2 percent target. In light of these economic conditions, a few further considerations supported the case for a more measured approach in beginning the process to recalibrate our policy stance to remove restriction and move toward a more neutral setting.</p>
<p>First, I was concerned that reducing the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point could be interpreted as a signal that the Committee sees some fragility or greater downside risks to the economy. In the current economic environment, with no clear signs of material weakening or fragility, in my view, beginning the rate-cutting cycle with a 1/4 percentage point move would have better reinforced the strength in economic conditions, while also confidently recognizing progress toward our goals. In my mind, a more measured approach would have avoided the risk of unintentionally signaling concerns about underlying economic conditions.</p>
<p>Second, I was also concerned that reducing the policy rate by 1/2 percentage point could have led market participants to expect that the Committee would lower the target range by that same pace at future meetings until the policy rate approaches a neutral level. If this expectation had materialized, we could have seen an unwarranted decline in longer-term interest rates and broader financial conditions could become overly accommodative. This outcome could work against the Committee's goal of returning inflation to our 2 percent target.</p>
<p>I am pleased that Chair Powell directly addressed both of these concerns during the press conference following last week's FOMC meeting.</p>
<p>Third, there continues to be a considerable amount of pent-up demand and cash on the sidelines ready to be deployed as the path of interest rates moves down. Bringing the policy rate down too quickly carries the risk of unleashing that pent-up demand. A more measured approach would also avoid unnecessarily stoking demand and potentially reigniting inflationary pressures.</p>
<p>Finally, in dialing back our restrictive stance of policy, we also need to be mindful of what the end point is likely to be. My estimate of the neutral rate is much higher than it was before the pandemic. Therefore, I think we are much closer to neutral than would have been the case under pre-pandemic conditions, and I did not see the peak stance of policy as restrictive to the same extent that my colleagues may have. With a higher estimate of neutral, for any given pace of rate reductions, we would arrive at our destination sooner.</p>
<p><strong>Ongoing Risks to the Outlook</strong><br />Turning to the risks to achieving our dual mandate, I continue to see greater risks to price stability, especially while the labor market continues to be near estimates of full employment. Although the labor market data have been showing signs of cooling in recent months, still-elevated wage growth, solid consumer spending, and resilient GDP growth are not consistent with a material economic weakening or fragility. My contacts also continue to mention that they are not planning layoffs and continue to have difficulty hiring. Therefore, I am taking less signal from the recent labor market data until there are clear trends indicating that both spending growth and the labor market have materially weakened. I suspect the recent immigration flows have and will continue to affect labor markets in ways that we do not yet fully understand and cannot yet accurately measure. In light of the dissonance created by conflicting economic signals, measurement challenges, and data revisions, I remain cautious about taking signal from only a limited set of real-time data releases.</p>
<p>In my view, the upside risks to inflation remain prominent. Global supply chains continue to be susceptible to labor strikes and increased geopolitical tensions, which could result in inflationary effects on food, energy, and other commodity markets. Expansionary fiscal spending could also lead to inflationary risks, as could an increased demand for housing given the long-standing limited supply, especially of affordable housing. While it has not been my baseline outlook, I cannot rule out the risk that progress on inflation could continue to stall.</p>
<p>Although it is important to recognize that there has been meaningful progress on lowering inflation, while core inflation remains around or above 2.5 percent, I see the risk that the Committee's larger policy action could be interpreted as a premature declaration of victory on our price-stability mandate. Accomplishing our mission of returning to low and stable inflation at our 2 percent goal is necessary to foster a strong labor market and an economy that works for everyone in the longer term.</p>
<p>In light of these considerations, I believe that, by moving at a measured pace toward a more neutral policy stance, we will be better positioned to achieve further progress in bringing inflation down to our 2 percent target, while closely watching the evolution of labor market conditions.</p>
<p><strong>The Path Forward</strong><br />Despite my dissent at the recent FOMC meeting, I respect and appreciate that my FOMC colleagues preferred to begin the reduction in the federal funds rate with a larger initial cut in the target range for the policy rate. I remain committed to working together with my colleagues to ensure that monetary policy is appropriately positioned to achieve our goals of attaining maximum employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent target.</p>
<p>I will continue to monitor the incoming data and information as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy, and I will remain cautious in my approach to adjusting the stance of policy going forward. It is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. My colleagues and I will make our decisions at each FOMC meeting based on the incoming data and the implications for and risks to the outlook guided by the Fed's dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. We need to ensure that the public understands clearly how current and expected deviations of inflation and employment from our mandated goals inform our policy decisions.</p>
<p>By the time of our next meeting in November, we will have received updated reports on inflation, employment, and economic activity. We may also have a better understanding of how developments in longer-term interest rates and broader financial conditions might influence the economic outlook.</p>
<p>During the intermeeting period, I will continue to visit with a broad range of contacts to discuss economic conditions as I assess the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance. As I noted earlier, I continue to view inflation as a concern. In light of the upside risks that I just described, it remains necessary to pay close attention to the price-stability side of our mandate while being attentive to the risks of a material weakening in the labor market. My view continues to be that restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment over the longer run. However, should the data evolve in a way that points to a material weakening in the labor market, I would support taking action and adjust monetary policy as needed while taking into account our inflation mandate.</p>
<p><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong><br />In closing, thank you again for welcoming me here today. It is a pleasure to join you and to have the opportunity to discuss my views on the economy and monetary policy. And given the recent FOMC meeting decision and my dissent, I appreciate being able to provide a more detailed explanation of the reasoning that led me to dissent in favor of a smaller reduction in the policy rate at last week's FOMC meeting.</p>
<p>I look forward to answering your questions and to engaging with your members on bank regulatory and supervisory matters.</p>

<div> Georgia Bankers Association, FOMC meeting, monetary policy, U.S. economy, inflation
Summary:
Federal Reserve discussed recent FOMC meeting, current economy, and inflation. Dissented on rate cut, highlighted risks, discussing the path forward. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Good morning. I would like to thank the Georgia Bankers Association for the invitation to join you today for your annual conference.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240930a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;I appreciate the opportunity to share my views on the U.S. economy and monetary policy before we engage on community banking issues and other matters affecting the banking industry.</p>
<p>In light of last week's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, I will begin my remarks by providing some perspective on my vote and will then share my current views on the economy and monetary policy.</p>
<p><strong>Update on the Most Recent FOMC Meeting</strong><br />In order to address high inflation, for more than two years, the FOMC increased and held the federal funds rate at a restrictive level. At our September meeting, the FOMC voted to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point to 4-3/4 to 5 percent and to continue reducing the Federal Reserve's securities holdings.</p>
<p>As the post-meeting statement noted, I dissented from the FOMC's decision, preferring instead to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 5 to 5‑1/4 percent. Last Friday, once our FOMC participant communications blackout period concluded, the Board of Governors released my statement explaining the decision to depart from the majority of the voting members. I agreed with the Committee's assessment that, given the progress we have seen since the middle of 2023 on both lowering inflation and cooling the labor market, it was appropriate to reflect this progress by recalibrating the level of the federal funds rate and begin the process of moving toward a more neutral stance of policy. As my statement notes, I preferred a smaller initial cut in the policy rate while the U.S. economy remains strong and inflation remains a concern, despite recent progress.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Conditions and Outlook</strong><br />In recent months, we have seen some further progress on slowing the pace of inflation, with monthly readings lower than the elevated pace seen in the first three months of the year. The 12-month measure of core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation, which provides a broader perspective than the more volatile higher-frequency readings, has moved down since April, although it came in at 2.7 percent in August, again remaining well above our 2 percent goal. The persistently high core inflation largely reflects pressures on housing prices, perhaps due in part to low inventories of affordable housing. The progress in lowering inflation since April is a welcome development, but core inflation is still uncomfortably above the Committee's 2 percent goal.</p>
<p>Prices remain much higher than before the pandemic, which continues to weigh on consumer sentiment. Higher prices have an outsized effect on lower- and moderate-income households, as these households devote a significantly larger share of income to food, energy, and housing. Prices for these spending categories have far outpaced overall inflation over the past few years.</p>
<p>Economic growth moderated earlier this year after coming in stronger last year. Private domestic final purchases (PDFP) growth has been solid and slowed much less than gross domestic product (GDP), as the slowdown in GDP growth was partly driven by volatile categories including net exports, suggesting that underlying economic growth was stronger than GDP indicated. PDFP has continued to increase at a solid pace so far in the third quarter, despite some further weakening in housing activity, as retail sales have shown further robust gains in July and August.</p>
<p>Although personal consumption has remained resilient, consumers appear to be pulling back on discretionary items and expenses, as evidenced in part by a decline in restaurant spending since late last year. Low- and moderate-income consumers no longer have extra savings to support this type of spending, and we have seen loan delinquency rates normalize from historically low levels during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The most recent labor market report shows that payroll employment gains have slowed appreciably to a pace moderately above 100,000 per month over the three months ending in August. The unemployment rate edged down to 4.2 percent in August from 4.3 percent in July. While unemployment is notably higher than a year ago, it is still at a historically low level and below my and the Congressional Budget Office's estimates of full employment.</p>
<p>The labor market has loosened from the extremely tight conditions of the past few years. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has declined further to a touch below the historically elevated pre-pandemic level&mdash;a sign that the number of available workers and the number of available jobs have come into better balance. But there are still more available jobs than available workers, a condition that before 2018 has only occurred twice for a prolonged period since World War II, further signaling ongoing labor market strength despite the reported data.</p>
<p>Although wage growth has slowed further in recent months, it remains indicative of a tight labor market. At just under 4 percent, as measured by both the employment cost index and average hourly earnings, wage gains are still above the pace consistent with our inflation goal given trend productivity growth.</p>
<p>The rise in the unemployment rate this year largely reflects weaker hiring, as job seekers entering or re-entering the labor force are taking longer to find work, while layoffs remain low. In addition to some cooling in labor demand, there are other factors likely contributing the increased unemployment. A mismatch between the skills of the new workers and available jobs could further raise unemployment, suggesting that higher unemployment has been partly driven by the stronger supply of workers. It is also likely that some temporary factors contributed to the recent rise in the unemployment rate, as unemployment among working age teenagers sharply increased in August.</p>
<p><strong>Preference for a More Measured Recalibration of Policy</strong><br />The U.S. economy remains strong and core inflation remains uncomfortably above our 2 percent target. In light of these economic conditions, a few further considerations supported the case for a more measured approach in beginning the process to recalibrate our policy stance to remove restriction and move toward a more neutral setting.</p>
<p>First, I was concerned that reducing the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point could be interpreted as a signal that the Committee sees some fragility or greater downside risks to the economy. In the current economic environment, with no clear signs of material weakening or fragility, in my view, beginning the rate-cutting cycle with a 1/4 percentage point move would have better reinforced the strength in economic conditions, while also confidently recognizing progress toward our goals. In my mind, a more measured approach would have avoided the risk of unintentionally signaling concerns about underlying economic conditions.</p>
<p>Second, I was also concerned that reducing the policy rate by 1/2 percentage point could have led market participants to expect that the Committee would lower the target range by that same pace at future meetings until the policy rate approaches a neutral level. If this expectation had materialized, we could have seen an unwarranted decline in longer-term interest rates and broader financial conditions could become overly accommodative. This outcome could work against the Committee's goal of returning inflation to our 2 percent target.</p>
<p>I am pleased that Chair Powell directly addressed both of these concerns during the press conference following last week's FOMC meeting.</p>
<p>Third, there continues to be a considerable amount of pent-up demand and cash on the sidelines ready to be deployed as the path of interest rates moves down. Bringing the policy rate down too quickly carries the risk of unleashing that pent-up demand. A more measured approach would also avoid unnecessarily stoking demand and potentially reigniting inflationary pressures.</p>
<p>Finally, in dialing back our restrictive stance of policy, we also need to be mindful of what the end point is likely to be. My estimate of the neutral rate is much higher than it was before the pandemic. Therefore, I think we are much closer to neutral than would have been the case under pre-pandemic conditions, and I did not see the peak stance of policy as restrictive to the same extent that my colleagues may have. With a higher estimate of neutral, for any given pace of rate reductions, we would arrive at our destination sooner.</p>
<p><strong>Ongoing Risks to the Outlook</strong><br />Turning to the risks to achieving our dual mandate, I continue to see greater risks to price stability, especially while the labor market continues to be near estimates of full employment. Although the labor market data have been showing signs of cooling in recent months, still-elevated wage growth, solid consumer spending, and resilient GDP growth are not consistent with a material economic weakening or fragility. My contacts also continue to mention that they are not planning layoffs and continue to have difficulty hiring. Therefore, I am taking less signal from the recent labor market data until there are clear trends indicating that both spending growth and the labor market have materially weakened. I suspect the recent immigration flows have and will continue to affect labor markets in ways that we do not yet fully understand and cannot yet accurately measure. In light of the dissonance created by conflicting economic signals, measurement challenges, and data revisions, I remain cautious about taking signal from only a limited set of real-time data releases.</p>
<p>In my view, the upside risks to inflation remain prominent. Global supply chains continue to be susceptible to labor strikes and increased geopolitical tensions, which could result in inflationary effects on food, energy, and other commodity markets. Expansionary fiscal spending could also lead to inflationary risks, as could an increased demand for housing given the long-standing limited supply, especially of affordable housing. While it has not been my baseline outlook, I cannot rule out the risk that progress on inflation could continue to stall.</p>
<p>Although it is important to recognize that there has been meaningful progress on lowering inflation, while core inflation remains around or above 2.5 percent, I see the risk that the Committee's larger policy action could be interpreted as a premature declaration of victory on our price-stability mandate. Accomplishing our mission of returning to low and stable inflation at our 2 percent goal is necessary to foster a strong labor market and an economy that works for everyone in the longer term.</p>
<p>In light of these considerations, I believe that, by moving at a measured pace toward a more neutral policy stance, we will be better positioned to achieve further progress in bringing inflation down to our 2 percent target, while closely watching the evolution of labor market conditions.</p>
<p><strong>The Path Forward</strong><br />Despite my dissent at the recent FOMC meeting, I respect and appreciate that my FOMC colleagues preferred to begin the reduction in the federal funds rate with a larger initial cut in the target range for the policy rate. I remain committed to working together with my colleagues to ensure that monetary policy is appropriately positioned to achieve our goals of attaining maximum employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent target.</p>
<p>I will continue to monitor the incoming data and information as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy, and I will remain cautious in my approach to adjusting the stance of policy going forward. It is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. My colleagues and I will make our decisions at each FOMC meeting based on the incoming data and the implications for and risks to the outlook guided by the Fed's dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. We need to ensure that the public understands clearly how current and expected deviations of inflation and employment from our mandated goals inform our policy decisions.</p>
<p>By the time of our next meeting in November, we will have received updated reports on inflation, employment, and economic activity. We may also have a better understanding of how developments in longer-term interest rates and broader financial conditions might influence the economic outlook.</p>
<p>During the intermeeting period, I will continue to visit with a broad range of contacts to discuss economic conditions as I assess the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance. As I noted earlier, I continue to view inflation as a concern. In light of the upside risks that I just described, it remains necessary to pay close attention to the price-stability side of our mandate while being attentive to the risks of a material weakening in the labor market. My view continues to be that restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment over the longer run. However, should the data evolve in a way that points to a material weakening in the labor market, I would support taking action and adjust monetary policy as needed while taking into account our inflation mandate.</p>

It is a pleasure to join you and to have the opportunity to discuss my views on the economy and monetary policy. And given the recent FOMC meeting decision and my dissent, I appreciate being able to provide a more detailed explanation of the reasoning that led me to dissent in favor of a smaller reduction in the policy rate at last week's FOMC meeting.</p>

Mr Osunkoya falsely told the FCA that he had sold the crypto ATM network to an individual which the evidence showed did not exist. The maximum sentence for the offences of forgery and using a false instrument is up to 10 years in prison, or a fine, or both. And, the maximum sentence for an offence of possession of criminal property is up to 14 years in prison, or a fine, or both.</li>
<li>Regulation 92 of the MLRs states that where a body corporate, like GidiPlus Ltd, commits such an offence, an officer of that body corporate, such as a director of that body, is also guilty of the underlying offence where it was either committed with the consent or connivance of the officer, or is otherwise attributable to any neglect on the part of the officer.</li>
<li>Gidiplus applied for registration under the Money Laundering Regulations in 2020 and was refused in 2021.</li>
<li>Charges in relation to Sally Lavington Osunkoya were withdrawn by the FCA following Mr Osunkoya&rsquo;s guilty pleas.</li>

Summary:
ESMA launching selection procedures for CTPs for bonds and equities in 2025 under MiFIR regulation. Fair competition and transparent selection process.<br /><br /> <div>

<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, is publishing additional details on the selection of Consolidated Tapes Providers (CTPs) for bonds and for shares and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs).</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>ESMA will launch the selection procedure for the CTP for bonds on Friday 3 January 2025. This is the first working day for EU Institutions after Sunday 29 December 2024, the date set out in Article 27da(1) of MiFIR. ESMA intends to adopt a reasoned decision on the selected applicant within 6 months of the launch, i.e. by early July 2025.</p>
<p>In June 2025, ESMA will launch the selection procedure for the CTP for shares and ETFs with the objective to adopt a reasoned decision on the selected applicant by the end of 2025.</p>
<p>Each selection procedure will be launched with the publication of a contract notice and procurement documents on the&nbsp;<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/home">EU Funding &amp; Tenders Portal</a>.

<div> expand, Spodumene CIF China Fastmarkets Futures contract, battery metals risk management, industry trust, market transparency
Summary:<br /> CME Group to launch Spodumene CIF China Fastmarkets Futures contract for battery metals risk management, industry trust, and market transparency. <div>
<p>CME Group, the world's leading derivatives marketplace, today announced that it will expand its battery metals suite and launch a Spodumene CIF China (Fastmarkets) Futures contract on&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">October 28, 2024</span>, pending regulatory review.</p>
<p>"Our suite of cobalt and lithium products serve an important role in the rapidly evolving battery metals space, with industry adoption accelerating," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Jin Hennig</span>, Global Head of Metals at CME Group. "With this launch of Spodumene futures, we will expand hedging capabilities, making it easier for the market to manage the price differences across products in the lithium value chain."</p>
<p>"Albemarle welcomes CME Group's launch of spodumene futures, which complements the lithium market's evolving risk management needs," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Peter Hannah</span>, Albemarle's Global Product Pricing Manager. "We recognize that trust in physical prices underpins confidence in futures trading, and are proud that our bidding event price discovery initiative has added valuable transparency to the spot market. The combination of liquid and robust physical and futures pricing mechanisms can help our industry grow."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Developing a liquid and transparent lithium market is essential for all the players in the battery value chain and CME Group continues to work towards this goal," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Grant Donald</span>, Chief Commercial Officer at Liontown. "A forward curve for key materials across the entire supply chain will be essential to effectively manage price risk for the rapidly growing clean energy market."</p>
<p>"The spodumene futures contract launch with the CME Group marks a significant step forward for the lithium market," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Raju Daswani</span>, Chief Executive Officer at Fastmarkets. "With this contract, the industry gains a tool to manage price risk associated with the spodumene price, conversion margins, as well as take a view on the lithium conversion spread itself. We believe this will positively contribute to the liquidity across the entire battery raw materials futures complex," he added.</p>
<p>CME Group is the leading marketplace for managing battery metals risk. Open interest in Lithium Hydroxide futures surpassed 30,000 contracts for the first time this year and now extends through 2026.

<title>Tokyo Financial Exchange: Application Of Intraday Additional Margin Call</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Margin Call, Interest-rate Futures contracts, TFX, Intraday, SPAN®<br />
Summary:<br /> 
The Intraday Additional Margin Call is triggered when price fluctuations exceed set limits at 11:25 am Tokyo Time, requiring additional deposits. <div>
<p>Today, Tokyo Financial Exchange (TFX) applied the Intraday Additional Margin Call of Interest-rate Futures contracts for the first time since 20 September 2022.<br /><br />・What is the Intraday Additional Margin Call?<br /><br />TFX usually calculates margin requirements based on the SPAN&reg; margin system, which accommodates a certain range of price fluctuations of futures contracts traded under a normal circumstance.<br /><br />However, when the market moves out of this range, TFX determines the intraday settlement price for the futures contracts at the end of its morning session (11:30 am Tokyo Time), and calculates intraday additional margin requirements based on positions carried by a member at the time. TFX then requests additional deposits from a member whose margin deposits are less than the amount required by the Intraday Additional Margin Call.<br /><br />・When is the Intraday Additional Margin Call triggered?<br /><br />The Intraday Additional Margin Call is triggered when changes in price of the leading contract month (currently DEC 2024 contract) traded at TFX exceed a range of price fluctuations set by TFX (currently 4.0 ticks, or 0.040%) at 11:25 am Tokyo Time, 5 minutes before the end of its morning session.</p>

<title>ASIC Updates Guidance For Participants In The Carbon Market Following Safeguard Mechanism Reforms</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-updates-guidance-for-participants-in-the-carbon-market-following-safeguard/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-updates-guidance-for-participants-in-the-carbon-market-following-safeguard/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Regulatory Guide 236, ASIC, carbon markets, AFS licence, safeguard mechanism reforms<br />
<br />Summary: ASIC's updated Regulatory Guide 236 provides guidance for carbon market participants on AFS licence requirements, addressing safeguard mechanism reforms and changes to the ACCU Scheme. <div>
<p>ASIC has today released its updated regulatory guidance for carbon market participants in Regulatory Guide 236&nbsp;<em>Do I need an AFS licence to participate in carbon markets?&nbsp;</em>(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/regulatory-guides/rg-236-do-i-need-an-afs-licence-to-participate-in-carbon-markets/" title="RG 236 Do I need an AFS licence to participate in carbon markets?">RG 236</a>).</p>
<p>RG 236 provides guidance for participants in the carbon markets including people involved in the Australian Carbon Credit Unit (ACCU) scheme, responsible emitters for safeguard facilities, market intermediaries and advisers to participants in the carbon market.</p>
<p>The guidance will assist participants in carbon markets in deciding whether they need an AFS licence to engage in activities associated with participation in the carbon market. These activities may involve providing a financial service, such as providing financial product advice, or dealing in emissions units regulated as financial products, including ACCUs and Safeguard Mechanism Credits (SMCs).</p>
<p>The updates to RG 236:</p>
<ul>
<li>address the safeguard mechanism reforms that commenced on 1 July 2023; and</li>
<li>reflect changes to the ACCU Scheme that have occurred since RG 236 was last re-issued in May 2015.</li>
</ul>
<p>ASIC is updating RG 236 following consultation with stakeholders initiated by Consultation Paper 378&nbsp;<em>Safeguard mechanism reforms: Updates to RG 236</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/consultations/cp-378-safeguard-mechanism-reforms-updates-to-rg-236/" title="CP 378 Safeguard mechanism reforms: Updates to RG 236">CP 378</a>). ASIC received 19 submissions in response to CP 378, including six confidential submissions. Respondents were supportive of our proposals to update RG 236, and to provide updated guidance in relation to derivatives, managed investment schemes, financial product advice and making a market.</p>
<p><a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/consultations/cp-378-safeguard-mechanism-reforms-updates-to-rg-236/#feedback" title="CP 378 Safeguard mechanism reforms: Updates to RG 236">A summary and a copy of the non-confidential submissions</a>&nbsp;made to ASIC as well as an outline of ASIC&rsquo;s response to the submissions received is available on&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/consultations/cp-378-safeguard-mechanism-reforms-updates-to-rg-236/#submissions" title="CP 378 Safeguard mechanism reforms: Updates to RG 236">CP 378</a>.</p>
<p>ASIC will also update Information Sheet 156&nbsp;<em>Regulated emissions units: Applying for or varying an AFS licence</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/carbon-markets/regulated-emissions-units-applying-for-or-varying-an-afs-licence/" title="Regulated emissions units: Applying for or varying an AFS licence">INFO 156</a>) to address the safeguard mechanism reforms and updates made in RG 236. We expect to publish the update in Q4 2024.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The Safeguard Mechanism reforms were introduced under the&nbsp;<em>Safeguard Mechanism (Crediting) Amendment Act 2023</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (Safeguard Mechanism) Rule 2015&nbsp;</em>and commenced on 1 July 2023. Under the Safeguard Mechanism, the Clean Energy Regulator may issue SMCs to entities responsible for large industrial facilities to whom the Safeguard Mechanism applies (i.e. responsible emitters) from January 2025. Like ACCUs, SMCs are regulated as a financial product under the Corporations Act.</p>
<p>The regulation of SMCs as a financial product may have implications for responsible emitters under the Safeguard Mechanism, advisers to responsible emitters and carbon market participants that trade in SMCs or derivatives involving SMCs. The updated guidance in RG 236 will assist these carbon market participants to consider whether they may require an AFS licence.</p>

<div> Minister of State, SGX, Remisier Development Programme, retail investors, digital skills
Summary:
SGX, SRS, and SAS collaborate to enhance remisiers' skills through digital training, attracting new professionals to ensure a healthy securities sector.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Mr Alvin Tan, Minister of State, Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth &amp; Ministry of Trade and Industry, and Board Member of the Monetary Authority of Singapore;<br />Ms Phua Wee Ling, Executive Director, Monetary Authority of Singapore,&nbsp;<br />Mr Ian Chung, Executive Director, Monetary Authority of Singapore,&nbsp;<br />Mr S Nallakaruppan, President, Society of Remisiers (Singapore),&nbsp;<br />Mr Luke Lim, Chairman, Securities Association of Singapore,&nbsp;<br />Friends from securities industry, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone and welcome to SGX! On behalf of SGX Group and our partners, the Society of Remisiers Singapore (SRS) and the Securities Association of Singapore (SAS), it&rsquo;s a tremendous pleasure to have you all join us today. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The remisier force has been and continues to be a unique community in the Singapore market, growing together with our country's broadening internationalisation. Remisiers play an essential role in serving and guiding investors in their stock-trading decisions. The remisiers&rsquo; high-touch personalised service provides a distinct model of stock market access that is much valued by Singapore investors, perhaps even more so now that robo-advisers and electronic trading become more widespread.</p>
<p>The customised human touch, and calm and measured approach is a reassurance as market cycles pull up and down. Which is especially true for less seasoned investors. Human assurance is the unique proposition remisiers offer, born of market intuition honed over years of interaction and dealing with the stock market.</p>
<p>It is therefore exciting that the Society of Remisiers (Singapore) and the Securities Association of Singapore have come together to enhance the skills of the remisier to ensure that they remain at the forefront, to support retail investors in capitalising on new opportunities. &nbsp;SGX is delighted to deepen our support through the Remisier Development Programme.</p>
<p>Through this programme, remisiers can pick up new digital skills and use technology to help them with trading management and strategies. Whether through more personalised portfolio recommendations, timely execution or insights from data &amp; analytics, the combination of technology and experience is powerful.</p>
<p>And ultimately this will benefit our Singapre retail investors who will receive the best of both worlds &ndash; human expertise backed with digital toolkits.</p>
<p>And this is not just for the current 2,000-strong community. We want to encourage new blood to join the securities industry. The industry will benefit as younger professionals join with fresh perspectives and digital-native fluency. This injection of vitality, combined with the experience of veteran remisiers will help ensure the long-term health and growth of the securities sector in Singapore.</p>
<p>A healthy and vibrant market is only possible when key stakeholders come together with a common objective. Today&rsquo;s event marks such an occasion and I look forward to more in the future.</p>
<p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

<title>CFTC Charges Fake Commodity Trading Platform With Fraud And Misappropriation In An Online Scam Targeting Asian American</title>

<div> enforcement action, CFTC, fraud, commodity trading, solicitors
Summary:<br /><br />The CFTC filed a civil enforcement action against Aipu Limited and others for fraudulently soliciting and misappropriating funds in a commodity trading scheme. <div>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today filed a civil enforcement action in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington against&nbsp;Aipu Limited,&nbsp;Qian Bai, and&nbsp;Lan Bai, together with&nbsp;Fidefx Investments Limited&nbsp;and&nbsp;Chao Li.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;complaint alleges from approximately Feb. 6, 2023 to the present, Bai and Lan Bai, individually and as controlling persons of Aipu, with Fidefx and Li, acting as a common enterprise, fraudulently solicited and misappropriated at least $3.6 million from at least 32 customers as part of a fraudulent investment scheme. The defendants have and continue to solicit and accept assets &ndash; fiat currency and digital assets &ndash; from customers for the sale of agreements; contracts or transactions in commodities on a leveraged or margined basis or financed by the offeror counterparty or a person acting in concert with the offeror or counterparty on a similar basis; off-exchange retail foreign currency contracts and commodity futures contracts.</p>
<p>The CFTC seeks restitution to defrauded customers, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil monetary penalties, trading bans, and a permanent injunction against further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations.</p>
<p>Case Background</p>
<p>As alleged in the complaint, the fraudulent common enterprise follows a similar pattern with customers either directly funding a purported &ldquo;trading account&rdquo; with Aipu or Fidefx via their respective websites, or agreeing to trade commodity interests via Aipu and/or Fidefx after being contacted by individuals (solicitors) acting on behalf of the defendants. The websites are identical but operating under different names. Aipu and Fidefx operated similar schemes where solicitors contact the customers via computer and cell phone applications such as WeChat, WhatsApp, and Line, or other social media platforms. The solicitors claim to have knowledge or inside information that earns them 10% to 30% profits per trade trading in commodity interests such as leveraged or margined retail commodity transactions, retail forex, and/or commodity futures contracts. The solicitors offer to share their knowledge or inside information with customers and to help them trade by providing particularized trading advice. After an account is funded, customers are provided access to online account statements that show purported deposits into their trading accounts and profitable trading at Aipu or Fidefx.</p>
<p>These account statements are false. Neither Aipu nor Fidefx have any trading accounts in the United States to which customer funds are sent.&nbsp; No trading takes place on behalf of customers at either Aipu or Fidefx. The defendants do not have any commodity interest trading accounts; fail to use customer assets to margin, guarantee or secure trades on behalf of defrauded customers; and misappropriate all assets they accepted and continue to accept from customers. They immediately transfer assets to offshore entities with no connection to commodity trading.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Throughout the relevant period, to fund customers' purported commodity trading accounts, the defendants worked with solicitors as a common enterprise. They directed customers to transfer their fiat and digital assets through a series of bank accounts and private digital wallets affiliated with the defendants. None of these accounts are held or controlled by a CFTC-registered futures commission merchant or retail foreign currency dealer. Rather than using these assets to trade commodity interests on behalf of customers, the defendants immediately misappropriate customers' assets by transferring them offshore to non-trading accounts controlled by persons located outside of the U.S.</p>
<p>Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this case are George H. Malas, Michael Amakor, Karen Kenmotsu, Timothy J. Mulreany, and Paul Hayeck.</p>
<p>* * * * * *</p>
<p>CFTC&rsquo;s Fraud Advisory</p>
<p>The CFTC has issued several customer protection&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/index.htm">Fraud Advisories and Articles</a>, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/CustomerAdvisory_RomanceScam.html">Avoid Forex, Precious Metals, and Digital Asset Romance Scams</a>, which warns users of online dating and social media platforms about an increase in scams that lure victims into sending their money to fraudulent websites that claim to trade foreign currency exchange (forex) contracts, precious metals contracts, and/or digital assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CFTC also strongly urges the public to verify a company&rsquo;s registration with the CFTC at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nfa.futures.org/basicnet">NFA BASIC</a>&nbsp;before committing funds. If unregistered, a customer should be wary of providing funds to that entity.</p>
<p>Customers and other individuals can report suspicious activities or information, such as possible violations of commodity trading laws, to the Division of Enforcement via a toll-free hotline 866-FON-CFTC (866-366-2382) or<a href="http://www.cftc.gov/ConsumerProtection/FileaTiporComplaint/index.htm">&nbsp;file a tip or complaint online</a>&nbsp;or contact the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whistleblower.gov/">Whistleblower Office</a>.&nbsp; Whistleblowers are eligible to receive between 10 and 30 percent of the monetary sanctions collected, paid from the Customer Protection Fund financed through monetary sanctions paid to the CFTC by violators of the CEA.</p>

<title>SEC Adopts Improvements To EDGAR System To Enhance Security, Filer Access, And Account Management</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> EDGAR, SEC, amendments, APIs, compliance
Summary:
SEC adopts rule amendments for EDGAR system, requiring filers to use Login.gov credentials, offering APIs, and modernizing Form ID. Beta testing opens in 2024. Compliance required by 2025. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today adopted rule and form amendments intended to enhance the security of its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system and improve filers&rsquo; access and account management capabilities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The public and the SEC long have benefited from the EDGAR electronic filing system,&rdquo; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s amendments are an important next step for EDGAR account access protocols.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The amendments require EDGAR filers to authorize identified individuals who will be responsible for managing their accounts, and individuals acting on behalf of EDGAR filers will need to present individual account credentials obtained from Login.gov to access those EDGAR accounts and make filings. Form ID, the application for access to EDGAR, will be modernized to make the form more user-friendly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SEC also will offer filers optional Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), a machine-to-machine method of making submissions, retrieving information, and performing account management tasks that will improve the efficiency and accuracy of filers&rsquo; interactions with EDGAR. Among other things, these APIs will allow filers to manage their EDGAR accounts with minimal manual interaction with EDGAR.</p>
<p>On Sept. 30, 2024, the SEC will open for filer testing and feedback a beta software environment that will reflect the adopted rule and form amendments and the related technical changes. Information about signing up for beta testing and extensive additional information about the rule adoption and related technical changes can be found on the SEC website:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/submit-filings/improving-edgar/edgar-next-improving-filer-access-account-management">EDGAR Next &ndash; Improving Filer Access and Account Management</a></p>
<p>Compliance with amended Form ID is required on March 24, 2025. All rule and form amendments will be effective on that date, and filers will be required to comply with all rule and form amendments by Sept. 15, 2025.</p>

<div> EDGAR, filings, modernization, implementation, feedback<br />
Summary: The article discusses the modernization of the Commission's EDGAR system, including extended beta period, API availability, and the importance of feedback. <div>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s EDGAR system ensures the relatively easy submission of filings to the Commission and quick retrieval of filings by the public. Few notice when it works, but the problems can be significant and potentially market moving if EDGAR&rsquo;s systems are disrupted or breached. Today&rsquo;s EDGAR Next rulemaking facilitates an important modernization of EDGAR. I hope&mdash;to quote the raven in Edgar Allen Poe&rsquo;s famous poem&mdash;that now we will be able to say &ldquo;Nevermore&rdquo; to unauthorized filings and, in the process, make life easier for authorized filers.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-edgar-next-092724?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>To ensure that EDGAR Next achieves its promise as early and efficiently as possible, the implementation period is very important. Commenters already provided helpful feedback to the proposal, and I look forward to continued feedback from filers during the beta period. The Commission extended EDGAR Next&rsquo;s beta period from the proposed 1 month to 6 months and is providing filers with a grace period to enroll in EDGAR Next after the 6-month enrollment period without filing a new Form ID. The Commission also was responsive to requests for application programming interfaces (&ldquo;APIs&rdquo;) to navigate EDGAR Next; the final rule offers twelve new APIs.</p>
<p>Despite the skill and dedication of the Commission&rsquo;s EDGAR Business Office (&ldquo;EBO&rdquo;) staff, this undertaking is complex, and unforeseen problems may emerge during the onboarding process or as people begin to use the new filing tools. To facilitate the smooth operation of EDGAR Next, I encourage the filer community to raise any concerns early and often. Today&rsquo;s rule is responsive to commenters, and I expect the Commission to be similarly responsive to concerns after today. In addition to contacting the EBO directly at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:EDGARNextBeta@sec.gov%E2%80%94">EDGARNextBeta@sec.gov</a>&nbsp;with any feedback, please feel free to contact my office at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:CommissionerPeirce@sec.gov">CommissionerPeirce@sec.gov</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you to the EDGAR Business Office, including Jed Hickman, Rosemary Filou, Daniel Chang, Laurita Finch, Jane Patterson, Margaret Marrero, and Lidian Pereira, along with Mika Morse in the Chair&rsquo;s office, and staff in the Office of the General Counsel, and the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis.</p>

<div> Securities, EDGAR, Commission, filings, technology <br />
Summary: The article discusses the adoption of EDGAR Next by the Commission, detailing changes, transition processes, and staff collaboration for implementation. <br /> <div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Beginning in May 1996, all domestic companies were required by the Commission to make their filings electronically, through EDGAR.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-edgar-next-092724?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;At the time, I was a first-year associate at a law firm. A fourth-year associate handed the EDGAR Filer Manual to me and muttered something along the lines of &ldquo;I guess we need to file with the SEC electronically now; I don&rsquo;t want to figure it out, so that&rsquo;s now your job.&rdquo; Such was my introduction to the wonders of EDGAR. In some respects, I have &ldquo;grown up&rdquo; with EDGAR as a securities lawyer since then.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-edgar-next-092724?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Over time, EDGAR has moved beyond being a system to electronically file documents with the Commission to one that is the principal method by which corporate disclosures are disseminated to the public and available for free. Accordingly, I consider EDGAR to be one of the Commission&rsquo;s crown jewels. As with any company and its important assets, the Commission must continuously improve EDGAR to keep up with changes in technology.</p>
<p>As part of that goal, the Commission is adopting changes today concerning access to, and management of accounts on, EDGAR.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-edgar-next-092724?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;These changes, referred to as EDGAR Next, are intended to enhance the security of EDGAR, improve the ability of filers to securely manage and maintain access to their EDGAR accounts, facilitate the responsible management of filer credentials, and simplify the procedures for accessing EDGAR. The EDGAR Next project started nearly four years ago, beginning with a request for comment in September 2021,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-edgar-next-092724?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;followed by the proposing release last November.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-edgar-next-092724?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who has provided feedback on this project. In response to commenters, the Commission made several changes to EDGAR Next from the proposing release to the adopting release. These include clarifying the process for individual Section 16 filers, offering additional application programming interfaces, or APIs, and lengthening the period for the transition process, including the enrollment period.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-edgar-next-092724?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>While the Commission is adopting EDGAR Next today, the agency&rsquo;s work is only beginning. Changes to EDGAR must be workable and operationally practical. Over the next 15 months, the Commission staff will need to work with filers, filing agents, and the rest of the filing community to carry out &ndash; and implement changes from &ndash; additional beta testing of EDGAR Next functionalities.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-edgar-next-092724?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;Commission staff will also need to ensure that filers are aware of EDGAR Next, including the requirement to enroll by no later than December 19, 2025, and ideally by September 12, 2025.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-edgar-next-092724?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;I will be following the staff&rsquo;s progress on ensuring a smooth transition to, and the implementation of, EDGAR Next.</p>
<p>Because of the project&rsquo;s overall goal and changes made in response to commenters, I support the adoption of EDGAR Next. Thank you to the staff of the EDGAR Business Office, the Office of the General Counsel, and the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis for their work on this rulemaking.</p>

<title>Statement On EDGAR, SEC Chair Gary Gensler, Sept. 27, 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-on-edgar-sec-chair-gary-gensler-sept-27-2024/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-on-edgar-sec-chair-gary-gensler-sept-27-2024/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, the Commission approved amendments regarding login, password, and other account access protocols for filers and other registrants using the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval System, commonly known as EDGAR. I am pleased to support these amendments because they enhance EDGAR&rsquo;s security and further improve filers&rsquo; access to the EDGAR system.</p>
<p>The public and the SEC long have benefitted from the EDGAR electronic filing system. Today, EDGAR is a rich and accessible library for investors and filers alike. Unlike streaming platforms and other subscription platforms, EDGAR is available to the public free of charge. I think it&rsquo;s one of the great innovations of the SEC.</p>
<p>A lot has changed in the three decades since the Commission first required mandatory EDGAR filings in 1993.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-statement-edgar-next-092724?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;EDGAR has lived through the rise of the internet, social media, and streaming content. We also have learned a great deal about data security and password protection in that time. To keep pace with ever-evolving markets, technology, and business models, we&rsquo;ve updated EDGAR over the years. Our most recent meaningful update, though, to EDGAR login, password, and other account access protocols was more than a decade ago.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s amendments are an important next step for EDGAR account access protocols. Under previous requirements, registrants had one login per company. This is like having a family passing around one shared login and password for a movie streaming app. You know where that can lead. That&rsquo;s simply not the most secure system&mdash;for filers and the Commission alike&mdash;when it comes to information relating to financial disclosure. By contrast, today&rsquo;s amendments further secure login protocols by requiring every person filing something into EDGAR to login with individual credentials and to use multi-factor authentication.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s EDGAR Business Office will open to the public a beta version for filer testing and feedback, which will include a set of optional Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). These APIs will help enhance how filers, including registrants and their agents, can access EDGAR, retrieve information, and submit bulk filings. Such changes promote efficiency for both filers and the Commission.</p>
<p>The final amendments include a number of changes in response to commenters&rsquo; feedback. For instance, the grace period for filers to perform annual confirmation was extended from two weeks to three months. Filers will have six months to prepare for compliance, rather than one month as proposed. They will continue to have six months to enroll in EDGAR using the new login protocols, as considered in the proposal, but the final amendments build in an additional three-month period to enroll before making filings after the compliance date. After that point, filers that have not enrolled would need to submit a new Form ID to make filings.</p>
<p>Taken together, these amendments benefit the Commission, filers, and investors alike.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the SEC staff for working on this matter, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jed Hickman, Rosemary Filou, Dan Chang, Laurita Finch, Margie Marrero, Jane Patterson, Gina Pearson, Lidian Pereira, Melinda Hobbs, Meddie Brown, Freddie Ntim, Sherwin Joseph, Lisa Butler, Tayeb Quereshi, Tina Herring, Pachie Perrow in the EDGAR Business Office;</li>
<li>Jessica Wachter, Oliver Richard, Charles Woodworth, Wei Liu, Ralph Bien-Aime', and Caroline Schulte in the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis; and</li>
<li>Bryant Morris, Peggy Kim, Joe Valerio, and Eduardo Aleman in the Office of the General Counsel.</li>

<title>SEC Charges Entities Operating Crypto Asset Trading Platform Mango Markets For Unregistered Offers And Sales Of The Platform’s “MNGO” Governance Tokens - Pair Of Affiliated Entities Separately Charged For Acting As Unregistered Brokers</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-charges-entities-operating-crypto-asset-trading-platform-mango-markets-for-u/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed settled charges against Mango DAO and Blockworks Foundation for engaging in the unregistered offer and sale of crypto assets called &ldquo;MNGO&rdquo; tokens. The SEC also settled charges against Blockworks Foundation and Mango Labs LLC for engaging in unregistered broker activity in connection with various crypto assets being offered and sold as securities on the Mango Markets platform. The SEC&rsquo;s complaint alleges that by skirting the SEC&rsquo;s registration provisions, Mango DAO, Blockworks Foundation, and Mango Labs deprived investors of critical protections afforded by the federal securities laws.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, starting in August 2021, Mango DAO, a purportedly decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, and Blockworks Foundation, a Panamanian entity, raised more than $70 million from unregistered offers and sales of MNGO tokens, the so-called governance tokens of the Mango Markets platform, to hundreds of investors worldwide, including in the U.S. The SEC also alleges that, since at least August 2021, Blockworks Foundation and Mango Labs each operated as an unregistered broker by actively soliciting and recruiting users of Mango Markets to trade securities; providing advice and valuations as to the merits of an investment in securities; and helping to facilitate securities transactions on the Mango Markets platform by assisting customers in opening accounts and regularly handling customer funds and securities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since the inception of our crypto enforcement program, our view has been that the label &lsquo;DAO&rsquo; does not change the reality of who is behind a project, what activities they engage in, or whether their activities need to be registered. Nor does engaging in intermediation of securities with the aid of automated or open source software change the nature of such activities,&rdquo; said Jorge G. Tenreiro, Acting Chief of the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit. &ldquo;If you engage in securities-intermediary functions, you must register or be exempt from doing so, regardless of the technology employed and the type of legal entity used.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Mango DAO and Blockworks Foundation with violations of the securities offering registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, and charges Blockworks Foundation and Mango Labs with violations of the broker registration provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Mango DAO, Blockworks Foundation, and Mango Labs have agreed to settle the SEC charges, consenting to injunctions and orders to collectively pay nearly $700,000 in civil penalties. They have also agreed to destroy their MNGO tokens, to request the removal of MNGO tokens from trading platforms, and to refrain from soliciting any trading platform to allow trading in or offering or selling MNGO. The settlements are subject to court approval.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Kristin Pauley, with assistance from Thomas Bedkowski, both of the SEC&rsquo;s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit. The SEC&rsquo;s litigation will be led by Alyssa Qualls of the Chicago Regional Office. The matter was supervised by Mr. Tenreiro and Amy Flaherty Hartman, also of the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit.</p>

<title>IOSCO Sustainable Finance Task Force, Singapore, September 27, 2024, Scott O’Malia, ISDA Chief Executive</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/iosco-sustainable-finance-task-force-singapore-september-27-2024-scott-omal/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/iosco-sustainable-finance-task-force-singapore-september-27-2024-scott-omal/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good morning and thank you for inviting me to address this plenary meeting of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) Sustainable Finance Task Force. Global policymakers and financial market participants have a critical role to play in the transition to a sustainable economy, so I&rsquo;m delighted to participate in this important forum.</p>
<p>Meeting the objectives of the Paris Agreement by 2050 will require trillions of dollars of investment in sustainable infrastructure and technology. This is an unprecedented global challenge and there is no time to waste. Governments simply cannot fund the transition on their own &ndash; they need to leverage global capital markets to raise the financing that is needed.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the objectives of the official and private sectors are largely aligned. Just as governments have committed to the goals of the Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement, thousands of corporates have now adopted net-zero strategies that have the potential to bring those commitments within reach.</p>
<p>But shared objectives are not sufficient to meet this challenge. We need continuous collaboration and dialogue between the official and private sectors to move the needle on climate change. It must be a partnership. This is particularly important in two areas.</p>
<p>First, the development of data-driven, risk-appropriate scenario analysis for climate risk. Over the past two years, ISDA has developed and tested a conceptual framework for climate risk scenario analysis in the trading book. By enabling financial institutions to prepare for the effect of future climate shocks on traded assets, this framework breaks new ground. Regulators and market participants must now work together to make sure the potential impact is properly understood and appropriately managed.</p>
<p>Second, the setting of robust and consistent standards for the voluntary carbon market. If strong guardrails are in place to prevent greenwashing, the carbon market could serve as an important financing channel that allows companies to offset those emissions they can&rsquo;t eliminate now. But the market must be transparent, standardized and auditable, based on consistent definitions and high standards. This can only be achieved if the public and private sectors work together.</p>
<p>If we are successful in bringing about constructive and sustained collaboration in these two areas, I&rsquo;m confident we can improve the management of climate risk globally and increase investment in technological and nature-based carbon solutions. I&rsquo;ll explore both topics in these remarks and I&rsquo;ll set out five vital steps that must be taken to develop liquid, effective and transparent voluntary carbon markets.</p>
<p><span>Climate risk</span></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start by bringing you up to date with our work on climate risk.</p>
<p>Effective risk management requires firms to assess the potential impact of a variety of risks that might affect their businesses, both in the short and long term. There&rsquo;s no doubt this now includes climate risk. Severe weather events are occurring with increasing frequency, and they can have far-reaching consequences. Up until now, however, there has been relatively limited understanding of the potential impact on traded assets.</p>
<p>Climate shocks fall broadly into two categories: a physical event, such as a flood or an earthquake; or a transition event, such as a change in climate policy or the introduction of a carbon tax. In either scenario, there would be knock-on implications for financial markets, which could be severe depending on the scale of the shock or repricing.</p>
<p>Good progress has been made in developing scenarios to model the effect of climate shocks on long-term assets. The Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) has played a key role here, as have the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve. The scenarios they have developed typically take a long-term view, modelling the expected impact of climate shocks over a period of years or decades.</p>
<p>But climate scenario analysis for shorter-dated traded assets has been hampered by the lack of standardized methodology and scarcity of data. In response, ISDA has worked with a group of more than 30 banks to develop a conceptual framework for the trading book, as well as defining key issues to support the design and implementation of scenarios.</p>
<p>We published the framework in the middle of last year, establishing a solid foundation for a robust and consistent approach to trading book scenarios<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/09/27/iosco-sustainable-finance-task-force-scott-omalia-remarks/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>. The framework maps the specific stages of scenario design and implementation, from defining the objective and climate narrative to deriving data and generating market risk shocks.</p>
<p>In the next phase of the project, we set about designing and modelling three specific scenarios<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/09/27/iosco-sustainable-finance-task-force-scott-omalia-remarks/#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>. These comprised a physical risk scenario involving a sudden increase in temperature, a transition risk scenario in which carbon taxes increase sharply, and a combined scenario in which both physical shocks and transition repricing take place at the same time.</p>
<p>These scenarios demonstrate how the trading book impact of climate events can be modelled, with severe but plausible situations. Our analysis projected the 12-month effect on a set of macroeconomic indicators, and we then modelled the expected market risk impact across equities, credit, interest rates, commodities and foreign exchange.</p>
<p>This is entirely new territory that has given market participants a glimpse of how climate shocks and repricing could affect their traded assets, with time horizons running from one year to a single day. In developing these scenarios, ISDA engaged closely with the public sector, particularly the NGFS, which is working to expand its own set of climate scenarios.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve now embarked on the next phase of this work, which involves the expansion of the scenarios to include more regions and sectors. We&rsquo;re working with a group of banks on this, but we can&rsquo;t do it on our own. As the project evolves, we will need the support and collaboration of the official sector so we can raise the bar on climate risk management across jurisdictions.</p>
<p><span>Carbon markets</span></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll now turn to the carbon markets.</p>
<p>As I noted at the outset, there is remarkable alignment between the public and private sectors on the need to find robust solutions to remove and offset carbon emissions. The ambition on both sides is unmistakable, and we can see it in a series of important developments:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement have established a global framework to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2050.</li>
<li>Second, the public-sector aspiration has been matched by the commitments of thousands of corporates around the world to reduce their emissions.</li>
<li>Third, regulated emissions trading systems are well-established in many countries and regions, including the EU, the UK and China. In parallel, there has been a concerted push to scale up the voluntary carbon market, which provides a valuable channel for investment in nature-based and technological solutions that will be critical in shifting to sustainable processes.</li>
<li>And finally, the EU&rsquo;s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) will introduce a levy for carbon emitted during the production of certain goods imported into the region. When it comes into effect in 2026, the CBAM will be transformative and will reshape the EU&rsquo;s trade and climate policies, so we need to be ready for this.</li>
</ol>
<p>With gathering momentum to scale up carbon markets globally, I believe the die has been cast and we are now set on an irreversible path towards a more sustainable future. Derivatives markets have an important role to play in supporting this transition. By enabling market participants to manage their risk in a cost-effective way and providing a price reference for buyers and sellers, they are critical to the development of vibrant, liquid markets.</p>
<p>But we can&rsquo;t afford to rest on our laurels. The development of derivatives markets over the past 30 years has shown that alignment and standardization of terms, practices and rules are the foundation for vibrant, liquid markets.</p>
<p>The good news is we have seen some progress on raising standards and a strong push to make sure carbon credits are consistently defined and managed. ISDA has been very supportive of these efforts, particularly the work of the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM). We also appreciate IOSCO&rsquo;s commitment to developing good practices for the regulation of voluntary carbon markets, as well as its recognition of the critical role financial market participants have to play.</p>
<p>But more needs to be done. I&rsquo;ll now outline five key areas where urgent action is needed to enable the voluntary carbon market to reach its full potential.</p>
<ol>
<li>First, we must have a globally consistent definition of a ton of carbon that is adopted by all market participants. That definition must align UN Article 6 credits with voluntary market standards. This goes hand-in-hand with an independent, science-based system to verify and audit the soundness and integrity of voluntary carbon credits (VCCs).</li>
<li>Second, we need a sound legal framework to create greater certainty and confidence. This includes standard documentation and consistent definitions of products.</li>
<li>Third, we need clarity on the accounting treatment for VCCs.</li>
<li>Fourth, we need to develop a liquid forward market, which will provide valuable price signals as the market evolves. This will be built on standardized, common units of larger carbon projects that are fungible and benefit from market pricing.</li>
<li>Finally, we need to continue to engage with the official sector, advocating for a globally consistent regulatory framework for this market. This must be considered in the context of implementation of the EU&rsquo;s CBAM.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Definitions</span></li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start by explaining why consistent definitions are so important.</p>
<p>There has been a concerted push in both the public and private sectors to more accurately define what constitutes genuine carbon removal and mitigation. Without broad agreement on this, it is impossible to make progress. A globally consistent, widely adopted definition of a ton of carbon will be the foundation on which we can build and grow an effective voluntary carbon market. That means having consistency in the definition used in Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which sets out how countries can cooperate to reach their climate targets, and alignment with the ICVCM, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation and other relevant agencies.</p>
<p>Linked to this is the need to build trust in carbon trading through effective and independent verification and identification systems. If there is uncertainty over the environmental value of the credits being bought and sold, or a lack of transparency over what a credit represents, prices and investment will remain well below their true potential. This undermines the basic premise of the market and could result in a missed opportunity on the road to net zero.</p>
<p>Greater transparency, integrity and standardization are non-negotiable ingredients for an effective carbon market. Verification of carbon credits must be based on scientific evidence &ndash; there can be no shortcuts if this market is to reach its true potential.</p>
<p>Some progress has certainly been made. The ICVCM has now established its core carbon principles that set a global benchmark for high-integrity carbon credits, with rigorous thresholds on disclosure and sustainable development. We have integrated these higher standards into the 2022 ISDA Verified Carbon Credit Transactions Definitions, enabling market participants to efficiently reference them in their trading documentation.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also seen the appearance of a new group of firms that provide science-based verification and ratings of carbon projects. By offering meticulous validation of carbon removal and mitigation, these firms will help to provide the transparency, integrity and confidence that is required.</p>
<p>We must make sure standards are properly applied to promote and maintain carbon credit integrity. We also need to establish a consistent global product identification system that enables credits to be tracked, audited and subdivided into common units. This will require both collaboration and persistence to develop a framework that can be rolled out on a global basis.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><span>Legal framework</span></li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;ll now turn to the importance of a sound legal framework.</p>
<p>As for any intangible asset, the legal nature of a verified carbon credit determines how it can be created, bought, sold and retired. To sustain deep and liquid secondary markets, create clear price signals and allow funds to be efficiently channeled to emissions-reducing projects, it is critical to understand and define the legal treatment of VCCs. This also paves the way towards the drafting of standardized documentation and legal opinions for the VCC derivatives market.</p>
<p>ISDA believes all VCC trades should be protected by a consistent legal framework that creates certainty over the exchange of collateral and obligations in a bankruptcy scenario. This includes sovereign-originated contracts such as Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs) that represent a ton of greenhouse gases reduced or removed from the atmosphere. By establishing consistent legal foundations that cover all contracts, we will build greater market depth.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the first bilateral Article 6.2 ITMO transfer took place between Thailand and Switzerland<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/09/27/iosco-sustainable-finance-task-force-scott-omalia-remarks/#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>, and many other countries have negotiated similar transfers. Suriname, for example, recently announced its intention to be the first country to sell ITMO credits in the private market, consistent with UN guidelines<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/09/27/iosco-sustainable-finance-task-force-scott-omalia-remarks/#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>. And last week, Singapore&rsquo;s state-backed GenZero announced a deal to generate Article 6 credits in Rwanda<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/09/27/iosco-sustainable-finance-task-force-scott-omalia-remarks/#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>.</p>
<p>ISDA has explored the key legal issues relating to VCCs in key jurisdictions and we set out steps to create greater legal certainty in a series of whitepapers<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/09/27/iosco-sustainable-finance-task-force-scott-omalia-remarks/#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a><a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/09/27/iosco-sustainable-finance-task-force-scott-omalia-remarks/#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>. We&rsquo;ve also asked two intergovernmental institutions focused specifically on commercial law standards &ndash; the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law and the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law &ndash; to provide guidance on the appropriate standards to ensure bankruptcy treatment and the exchange of security are properly defined, and the rights of holders are protected. This guidance will enhance the legal certainty of these transactions for all types of counterparties, giving individual countries a common baseline when drafting rules for these markets.</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve seen in other asset classes, investors will be drawn to those jurisdictions that have done the groundwork to create legal certainty for the trading of carbon credits. This will enable them to be loaned and used as collateral, contributing to a virtuous circle of greater trading and liquidity.</p>
<p>Standard trading documentation setting out the legal rights and obligations of counterparties is also critical. ISDA&rsquo;s VCC definitions, which we published in late 2022, have created a single contractual framework for the trading of these contracts<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/09/27/iosco-sustainable-finance-task-force-scott-omalia-remarks/#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>. The definitions can be used for any carbon standard or registry, allowing firms to trade VCCs more easily and on a global basis. They&rsquo;re published in digital format on ISDA&rsquo;s MyLibrary platform, which means we can seamlessly update the documentation for all users as the market evolves and new transactions emerge.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><span>Accounting treatment</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Just as we need a robust legal framework, a strong accounting framework is also vital. This will give market participants greater confidence that the transactions they enter into are appropriately reported in line with the relevant standards. However, there are currently no specific provisions relating to carbon credits under either US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP) or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).</p>
<p>We understand the Financial Accounting Standards Board will issue an exposure draft in the near future, which we look forward to reviewing. In the meantime, a recent ISDA whitepaper explores the key accounting issues and advocates for continued convergence of specific accounting standards to enable comparability and avoid fragmentation under US GAAP and IFRS<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/09/27/iosco-sustainable-finance-task-force-scott-omalia-remarks/#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><span>Secondary market</span></li>
</ol>
<p>While there is a clear need to evolve the primary market, which is still characterized by bespoke transactions and relatively poor liquidity, we should not forget the importance of the secondary market. Having a liquid forward market would represent a positive step that would send valuable price signals to buy- and sell-side firms, enabling them to gauge supply and demand and manage their risk.</p>
<p>Transforming a bespoke, project-based market into a more standardized set of fungible carbon units that can be used to create portfolios for sale in the secondary market must be a priority. Only with a vibrant and liquid secondary market will we secure long-term investment in carbon removal technologies and nature-based solutions. The development of forward pricing curves will bring greater pricing transparency and improved risk management.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><span>Regulatory engagement</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Before finishing, I&rsquo;ll say a few words on the ongoing need for education and engagement.</p>
<p>Sustainable finance has been a key focus for ISDA since 2020. We&rsquo;ve explored the legal, regulatory and accounting implications of VCCs; we&rsquo;ve developed key performance indicators and guidance for sustainability-linked derivatives; and we&rsquo;ve broken new ground in developing climate scenario analysis tools for trading book assets. We&rsquo;ve published more than a dozen whitepapers on these topics and held conferences and meetings with policymakers around the world. As carbon markets evolve, ISDA will continue to work with members, policymakers and other stakeholders to provide the education, expertise and guidance that is needed.</p>
<p>It is vital that the official sector focuses its efforts urgently and appropriately. There is no need to reinvent the wheel. Before developing a new regulatory framework, policymakers should be mindful of existing rules for trading in the secondary market, which are sufficiently robust and fit for purpose.</p>
<p>Last week, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission published final guidance for the listing of voluntary carbon derivatives contracts on regulated futures exchanges<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/09/27/iosco-sustainable-finance-task-force-scott-omalia-remarks/#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>. This new framework underscores the commission&rsquo;s fraud and manipulation authority over commodities and clarifies that it has the authority to require futures exchanges to conduct a more diligent review of certain commodities, such as VCCs.</p>
<p>Another important regulatory driver that will impact carbon markets will be the implementation of the CBAM. This will be an absolute game changer. It might be an EU policy, but it has global ramifications, so we need to get ahead of this change and make sure we are ready to deal with it. By requiring importers of certain carbon-intensive goods to pay a levy for the carbon they have emitted, the CBAM will put carbon pricing right at the center of trade policy.</p>
<p>As the director-general of the World Trade Organization pointed out in a recent press interview, we now need a global carbon pricing mechanism to avert trade friction and transition to the CBAM without disruption.</p>
<p><span>Conclusion</span></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll finish by once again thanking IOSCO for inviting ISDA to participate in this meeting.</p>
<p>IOSCO is uniquely positioned to deliver the much-needed collaboration between the public and private sectors that I have talked about in my remarks. We need thought leadership and education on appropriate legal frameworks that address bankruptcy and security transfer issues, as well as the application of appropriate common identifiers. IOSCO also has a role to play in supporting efforts to improve market transparency and liquidity formation.</p>
<p>This is not the first product to face these challenges. ISDA and IOSCO have decades of combined experience in bringing greater standardization and transparency to the derivatives, bond and credit markets. It is critical that we now focus our efforts on the carbon market. ISDA is committed to working with you and other agencies to address the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.</p>
<p>We are at a unique moment, and we must work together to align the legal and eligibility standards for carbon credits. Science will help to validate the standards. Rating agencies and registries will track the projects. Markets will improve transparency and pricing, driving the investment that is needed in innovative technologies and nature-based solutions. We would urge policymakers to consider ISDA&rsquo;s five recommendations to create a vibrant, efficient voluntary carbon market &ndash; and to work with us to implement them. Now is the time for action.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<title>SEC Charges U.K. Citizen In Hacking And Trading Scheme Involving Five U.S. Public Companies</title>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against U.K. citizen Robert B. Westbrook for hacking into the computer systems of five U.S. public companies to obtain material nonpublic information about their corporate earnings and using that information to make approximately $3.75 million in illicit profits by trading in advance of the companies&rsquo; public earnings announcements.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed on September 27, 2024 in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleges that, between approximately January 2019 and August 2020, Westbrook gained unauthorized access into the public companies&rsquo; computer systems&mdash;prior to the companies&rsquo; earnings announcements&mdash;by resetting passwords of senior level executives&rsquo; accounts. As a result of these hacks, Westbrook deceptively obtained material nonpublic information that he used to trade in the securities of the five public companies prior to the release of at least 14 earnings announcements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The SEC is engaged in ongoing efforts to protect markets and investors from the consequences of cyber fraud,&rdquo; said Jorge G. Tenreiro, Acting Chief of the SEC&rsquo;s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit. &ldquo;As this case demonstrates, even though Westbrook took multiple steps to conceal his identity &ndash; including using anonymous email accounts, VPN services, and utilizing bitcoin &ndash; the Commission&rsquo;s advanced data analytics, crypto asset tracing, and technology can uncover fraud even in cases involving sophisticated international hacking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint charges Westbrook with violating the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaint seeks a final judgment ordering Westbrook to pay civil penalties, ordering him to return his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and enjoining him from committing future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws.</p>
<p>In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the District of New Jersey today announced criminal charges against Westbrook.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation, which is ongoing, is being conducted by Alison R. Levine, Karolina Klyuchnikova, and Matthew Lambert of the New York Regional Office; David Austin, Patrick McCluskey, and Matthew Koop of the SEC Enforcement Division&rsquo;s Market Abuse Unit; IT Forensics staff member Kenneth Zavos; and Thomas Bedkowski of the SEC Enforcement&rsquo;s Division&rsquo;s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit. The Division of Economic and Risk Analysis also provided substantial assistance. The case is being supervised by Mark R. Sylvester and Mr. Tenreiro of the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit and Joseph Sansone of the Market Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Rusty Feldman and Ms. Klyuchnikova. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority.</p>

<div> Singapore-based, Olam Group Ltd., CFTC, USDA, cotton
<br />
Olam Group Ltd. fined $3,250,000 for false reporting of U.S. cotton sales data to the CFTC and USDA.
<br />Summary: Singapore-based Olam Group Ltd. fined $3,250,000 for false reporting of U.S. cotton sales data to the CFTC and USDA. <div>
<p><span><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an order filing and settling charges against&nbsp;<span>Olam Group Ltd</span><strong>.</strong>, a Singapore-based integrated supply chain manager, for submitting false, misleading, or inaccurate reports to the CFTC and the U.S. Department of Agriculture in connection with the sale of U.S. cotton worth more than $190 million. The order requires Olam to pay a $3,250,000 civil monetary penalty and to cease and desist from further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations, as charged.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&ldquo;Olam&rsquo;s failure to report accurate cotton sales data to USDA resulted in the publication of inaccurate and misleading information regarding cotton sales, undermining faith in a key indicator of supply and demand, and potentially impacting the integrity of commodities pricing,&rdquo; said Director of Enforcement Ian McGinley. &ldquo;This enforcement action sends the message that CFTC will ensure entities that play fast and loose with reporting requirements are held accountable.&rdquo;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN">Case Background</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The order finds in August and September 2021, Olam made five sales of U.S. cotton to a counterparty in Asia that is typically one of the largest global purchasers of cotton. In the aggregate, Olam sold more than 375,000 bales of cotton with a sales value of more than $190 million to this counterparty. The order finds rather than immediately reporting those sales to USDA and the CFTC promptly as required, certain Olam employees diverged from Olam&rsquo;s standard practices, causing the sales to be reported between one to five weeks late.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The export sales data Olam submits to USDA is incorporated into weekly and monthly reports published by USDA that are important indicators of supply and demand for both futures traders and participants in the physical cotton markets. The order states Olam employees knew or recklessly disregarded the fact that Olam&rsquo;s reports to USDA did not reflect the five sales at the time they occurred.

<div> Securities and Exchange Commission, municipal advisor, financial advisor, municipal securities market, regulatory duties
<br />
Summary:<br />As the Director of the Office of Municipal Securities, the article discusses the Municipal Advisor Rule, key decisions in the issuance process, and protections for municipal entities. <div>
<p>Good morning, everyone:</p>
<p>As is customary, my comments today are provided in my official capacity as Director of the Office of Municipal Securities, but do not necessarily reflect the views of the Commission, the Commissioners, or members of the staff.</p>
<p>I want to start by thanking the California Debt and Investment Advisory Commission (&ldquo;CDIAC&rdquo;) for inviting me to speak here today.&nbsp; I also want to thank all the panelists and moderators for their time and effort and to everyone involved with putting together this incredibly important program on municipal debt essentials. &nbsp;I started my public finance career in California and consulted the CDIAC debt primer constantly to learn about how debt offerings work in California.&nbsp; And throughout my career, but especially lately, CDIAC educational offerings have been invaluable to me and other municipal market participants as they address the most timely and meaningful topics in the market.&nbsp; We are lucky to have such a great resource here in California.</p>
<p class="text-align-center">***</p>
<p>I also want to thank all of you for attending this program. &nbsp;As government officers, you play a crucial role in the municipal securities market and are in the unique position of being able to influence the practices of the various professionals that you may choose to hire when issuing bonds. &nbsp;As such, it is also important that you understand the federal protections that exist to help ensure that some of those professionals you may hire fulfill their regulatory duties, including fair dealing and acting in your best interests, particularly when it comes to advising you on big picture decisions such as when and how much to borrow, method of sale and the amount of interest you have to pay on your bonds.</p>
<p>When doing a deal, you may find yourself employing the services of a municipal advisor, various other legal counsel and advisors, and an underwriter. &nbsp;Today, I will be focusing on the duties of municipal advisors but will also touch briefly on the duties of underwriters. &nbsp;For those who may be unfamiliar, a municipal advisor&nbsp;<a name="_Hlk178236508">&ndash;</a>&nbsp;sometimes imprecisely referred to as a financial advisor &ndash; is often engaged by the borrower/issuer (i.e., you) to provide advisory services as to municipal financial products and issuance of municipal securities, and the structuring of such transactions.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, there are over 400 registered municipal advisors, ranging from large firms with national coverage to sole proprietorships.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;An underwriter is typically a firm, or one of a group of firms, that purchase securities from the issuer and then offer them to investors.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<h2>1. the Municipal Advisor Rule and Accompanying Protections</h2>
<p>Keeping track of the different categories of regulated entities and corresponding regulators can be confusing, so let me start with a brief explanation of who the regulators are and the types of entities that they regulate.&nbsp; Municipal advisors are primarily regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). &nbsp;The SEC also regulates broker-dealers and regulates municipal issuers with respect to disclosure through the operation of the antifraud provisions.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp; In 2010, Section 975 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) amended Section 15B of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) to add a new requirement that &ldquo;municipal advisors&rdquo; register with the SEC.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2013, the SEC approved what is known as the Municipal Advisor Rule and it has been effective since 2014.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Municipal Advisor Rule establishes a registration regime for professionals who engage in municipal advisory activities<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;and, among other things, provides that municipal advisors and any person associated with such municipal advisor are deemed to have a fiduciary duty to any municipal entity for whom such municipal advisor acts as a municipal advisor.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p>The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) (a self-regulatory organization) was established by Congress in 1975 and charged with a mandate to protect investors, municipal entities, obligated persons, and the public interest.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp; Congress initially authorized the MSRB to regulate the activities of broker-dealers and banks that buy, sell, and underwrite municipal securities.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp; In 2010, Congress expanded the MSRB&rsquo;s authority to include the regulation of municipal advisors.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp; The MSRB does not regulate municipal entities, including issuers of municipal securities.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp; The MSRB is overseen by Congress and the SEC, and MSRB rules generally must be approved by the SEC before becoming effective.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp; The MSRB does not carry out the enforcement of its rules or conduct compliance examinations.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp; Instead, the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) share responsibility for enforcement and compliance examinations.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></p>
<p>But back to the Municipal Advisor Rule which, for me, is first and foremost a consumer protection rule, with the consumers being all of you who utilize the services of a municipal advisor. &nbsp;For example, the Municipal Advisor Rule requires any firm that engages in municipal advisory activities to file an initial registration with the SEC to disclose information such as the firm&rsquo;s direct and indirect ownership, other business activities, and any prior regulatory or criminal actions.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Each municipal advisory firm must also file an annual update that includes any changes to any previously filed information.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the municipal advisory firm must also file a form for each person associated with the firm who is engaged in municipal advisory activities which discloses information on that person&rsquo;s education and employment history as well as information on any criminal or regulatory actions, investigations, terminations, and customer complaints.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;These important disclosures are publicly available on the SEC&rsquo;s EDGAR website,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>&nbsp;and I encourage all of you to consult that site as you interact with different municipal advisors throughout your business. &nbsp;We continue to see a concerning number of unregistered entities engaging in what appears to be municipal advisory activity<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a>&nbsp;and urge you to confirm that any professional providing municipal advisory services to you is properly registered. &nbsp;If you believe someone is not properly registered, please consider submitting a tip on the SEC&rsquo;s website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/submit-tip-or-complaint">https://www.sec.gov/submit-tip-or-complaint</a>&nbsp;or reaching out to the Office of Municipal Securities at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:munis@sec.gov">munis@sec.gov</a>.</p>
<p>Accordingly, you should also be aware of the robust rules in place that municipal advisors must adhere to when providing municipal advisory services to their municipal entity clients.&nbsp; For example, municipal advisors are required to follow certain standards of conduct when engaging with their municipal entity clients.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a>&nbsp; The Exchange Act establishes standards of conduct for municipal advisors engaging in municipal advisory activity.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a>&nbsp; MSRB Rule G-42 also articulates standards of conduct for municipal advisors engaging in municipal advisory activities.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;When performing municipal advisory activities for a municipal entity client or an obligated person client, a municipal advisor must act in accordance with a duty of care.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;A municipal advisor acting with a duty of care must, among other things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Possess the degree of knowledge and expertise needed to provide a client informed advice;</li>
<li>Make a reasonable inquiry as to the facts that are relevant to a client&rsquo;s determination as to whether to proceed with a course of action, such as the issuance of securities;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Make a reasonable inquiry as to the facts that form the basis for any advice the municipal advisor provides to a client; and</li>
<li>Have a reasonable basis for any advice provided to a client.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, and very importantly, municipal advisors to a municipal entity client are also subject to a duty of loyalty.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The duty of loyalty requires a municipal advisor to deal honestly and with the utmost good faith and act in its municipal client&rsquo;s best interests without regard to the financial or other interests of the municipal advisor.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a></p>
<p>Municipal advisors are also required to disclose material conflicts of interest to their clients, and those disclosures are some of the most important protections issuers have in evaluating whether their municipal advisor is acting in the client&rsquo;s best interest.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule G-42 requires a municipal advisor to make a full and fair disclosure, in writing, of all material conflicts of interest and all legal and disciplinary events that are material to a client&rsquo;s evaluation of a municipal advisor or the integrity of its management and advisory personnel.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;These disclosures must be provided to the municipal client by the municipal advisor prior to or upon engaging in municipal advisory activities for the municipal client or on the municipal client&rsquo;s behalf.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a></p>
<p>Municipal advisors are also required to document their municipal advisory relationship with their municipal clients in writing, and the documentation must be dated and delivered to the municipal client prior to, upon, or promptly after the municipal client and the municipal advisor establish their municipal advisory relationship.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;This also helps ensure that both the municipal issuer client and the municipal advisor have clear expectations about the activities to be performed by the municipal advisor.</p>
<h2>2. The Municipal Advisor Rule and Key Decisions in the Issuance Process</h2>
<p>The protections just discussed apply to all of the advice provided to you by a municipal advisor.&nbsp; But, I wanted to discuss how these protections work in the context of several key points in the issuance process. &nbsp;First, these protections apply to advice given as to whether to proceed with a bond issuance.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;In many instances, but particularly in the case of a refunding, one of the first decisions you would have to make is whether it is even necessary or advisable to do the deal.&nbsp; Many times, your municipal advisor (as well as other professionals) will have an inherent conflict of interest because they will only get paid if a deal is done, thus giving them an incentive to recommend borrowing.&nbsp; The SEC recently brought an action against a municipal advisor for recommending a borrowing when the municipal entity had sufficient reserves to cash fund a project.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;In that case the recommendation to borrow was based on an analysis that led to inaccurate conclusions regarding the relative costs of different options.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Commentators have also raised question about the economics of taxable advance refundings and tenders that take the place of traditional refundings.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a>&nbsp; Particularly when the idea to borrow money or refund bonds is not your own, your municipal advisor or underwriter should be presenting you with recommendations that are not based on materially inaccurate or incomplete information.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a>&nbsp; This analysis could include items such as a cost analysis of different funding options.</p>
<p>Another major decision you will face is whether to do a competitive or negotiated sale.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a>&nbsp; A competitive sale occurs when multiple underwriters compete by submitting purchase bids consisting of coupons, yields, and the underwriter&rsquo;s discount, with the issuer generally selecting the underwriter with the lowest true cost.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;By contrast, in a negotiated sale, the issuer selects the underwriter at the outset of the financing, well in advance of the sale of the bonds, usually after an RFP process.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[39]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Numerous studies<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40">[40]</a>&nbsp;suggest that competitive sales are more efficient for the issuer in the majority of transactions. &nbsp;In the last few decades, however, the majority of deals have been negotiated sales.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41">[41]</a>&nbsp;From 2018 through 2022, 46.4% of deals nationwide (representing 26.8% of total par value) were competitive sales.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42">[42]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;In California, during that same period, the number was even lower: a mere 12.8% of deals were competitive sales.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43">[43]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;By contrast, in New York, 84.5% of deals during that period were competitive sales.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44">[44]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that independent research suggests that competitive sales are more efficient with a lower true interest cost (TIC) for the borrower in the majority of transactions,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45">[45]</a>&nbsp;I am &nbsp;concerned about the number of municipal entities still choosing to do negotiated sales and question whether this may be due to municipal entities not being given enough information to make the best decision for themselves on what method sale to utilize. &nbsp;I am not the only one concerned about this issue; just last year the State of California Treasurer&rsquo;s Office gave a presentation to the California Society of Municipal Finance Officers to offer a &ldquo;fresh look&rdquo; at competitive sales.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46">[46]</a></p>
<p>There are a few possible reasons why negotiated sales remain the dominant method of sale despite evidence that competitive sales may result in interest cost savings for issuers in a large number of cases. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The first is that municipal entities are accustomed to doing negotiated sales and are hesitant to stray from their past, established practice.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47">[47]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is just a matter of habit.&nbsp; However, one recent paper from the Chief Economist of the MSRB affirmed that negotiated offerings tend to trade at higher prices than competitive offerings in the secondary market,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48">[48]</a>&nbsp;which suggests that issuers could get lower interest rates on their debt with a competitive sale, depending on the particular facts and circumstances. &nbsp;Given that, I urge you all to not fall into the trap of choosing one method of sale simply because that is the way things have always been done at the expense of the potential interest savings that could be achieved by evaluating your options each time you go to market. To be clear, there is nothing preventing a municipal entity from continuing to prefer negotiated sales.&nbsp; We recognize that issuers may have policy reasons to prefer a negotiated sale, and negotiated sales may continue to be preferable in certain circumstances.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49">[49]</a></p>
<p>The second possible reason why negotiated sales remain the dominant method of sale is that municipal advisors are failing to even raise with issuers the possibility of a competitive sale. &nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, municipal advisors who provide advice on the issuance of bonds have a fiduciary duty to their clients. &nbsp;But, given the continued prevalence of negotiated sales,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50">[50]</a>&nbsp;it is important to remind municipal advisors of how that duty is implicated when they are providing advice on the method of sale.&nbsp; Municipal advisors should carefully evaluate the sufficiency of the information they provide to issuers before issuers make a choice about what method of sale to use. &nbsp;A municipal advisor may claim that a deal comes to them where this decision is already made, but a non-binding agreement to do a negotiated sale does not absolve a municipal advisor of its fiduciary duty to explore and present alternatives to you.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51">[51]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;You may worry that municipal advisors will take advantage of this obligation as an excuse to prepare extra, unnecessary reports and run up costs.&nbsp; But remember that it is you &ndash; the issuer &ndash; who remains in control of the municipal advisor relationship and the bond issuance process.&nbsp; Our goal is simply to make sure that your municipal advisor fulfills its duties to you in the context of that relationship.</p>
<p>In sum, when I see the continued prevalence of negotiated sales, I ask myself whether the appropriate gatekeepers (i.e., municipal advisors) are fulfilling their responsibilities. &nbsp;None of these responsibilities are new. &nbsp;Dodd-Frank<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52">[52]</a>&nbsp;was passed almost 13 years ago, the MSRB Rule G-42 standards of conduct are from 2016, and the Municipal Advisor Rule was adopted 10 years ago.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53">[53]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the two major issues raised above, we will continue to focus on price movement and trading immediately after issuance in negotiated sales and remind municipal advisors and underwriters of their regulatory responsibilities with respect to pricing. This could include comparing the results of negotiated sales not only to other comparable negotiated sales but also to comparable competitive sales.&nbsp; For municipal advisors these responsibilities could also include appropriate responses to oversubscription rates during pricing as well as monitoring post-issuance sales activity.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54">[54]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not the only ones monitoring price movement and trading; the Chief Economist of the MSRB recently looked at data from January 2019-December 2021 and found that the median trade spread for offerings that trade in the first 30 days post-issuance is -1 basis points for competitive offerings but 11.4 basis points for negotiated offerings.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-california-debt-investment-advisory-commission-municipal-debt-essentials-seminar?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55">[55]</a>&nbsp; This could reflect that the negotiated sale resulted in a higher than necessary cost of borrowing for the issuer.&nbsp; We encourage you to remain vigilant against decision inertia, and especially to ask questions of your municipal advisor about the major decisions you will make during the issuance process, and know the protections available under the Municipal Advisor Rule.</p>
<p>Again, thank you again to the staff at CDIAC and our municipal market participants for putting this seminar together and thank you for attending.</p>
<p>Lastly, I invite you to visit OMS&rsquo;s (sec.gov/municipal), MSRB&rsquo;s, and FINRA&rsquo;s websites for regulatory and compliance information and helpful updates. &nbsp;Our website in particular contains a host of information and guidance on the Municipal Advisor Rule, and frequently updates its information for market participants. &nbsp;My hope is that you will consult those resources now and throughout your careers to understand the protections afforded to your municipal entities. &nbsp;Our Office also runs a help line and email inbox which can be found on our website. &nbsp;If you ever have any questions at all, please don&rsquo;t hesitate to call or email our Office.</p>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/warsaw-stock-exchange-appoints-issuer-council/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The Warsaw Stock Exchange has appointed the Issuer Council to the President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange. The Issuer Council will serve as a platform for dialogue among issuers, investors, and regulators with a mission of making the market more efficient and promoting long-term development strategies of Polish companies listed on GPW.</span></p>
<p>The Issuer Council is a newly appointed group of experts with an advisory role to the President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange. It comprises owners and presidents of private companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. The mission of the Issuer Council is to share the knowledge and experience of issuers&rsquo; representatives with the GPW authorities in order to contribute to the further development and improvement of the capital market in Poland.</p>
<p>The activity of the Issuer Council will focus on three key areas: improving market transparency, promoting the capital market, and building investor confidence. The Issuer Council will be a platform for the exchange of experience and initiatives to make a real impact on the future of the capital market. Issuer Council members will be ambassadors of positive change, supporting the development and stability of the market in Poland.<br /><br />&ldquo;<em>The stock exchange is much more than numbers, charts, and quotations. It is first and foremost about people, their experience, knowledge, and commitment.

ACER releases first Opinion on Estonian National Resource Adequacy Assessment. Estonian assessment reflects regional specificities, but needs consistent application of updated assumptions.<br /><br /> <div>
<p>Today, ACER releases its&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtSB1IGBABWVkxcVVYGHVYBUQMdCgkBBxoGAwRSAwpXVAUGV1QdBwdaAwkEDQIdUAhXUB0GCwBUGldVUFEZClRTVAZQA1kCAgVXRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Opinion</a>&nbsp;on the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsCCQUHUwRWUUwIAVBbHVYLDFMdUAAIBBpTB1EGB1cEBw4IBQcdBwdaAwkEDQIdUAhXUB0GCwBUGldVUFEZClRTVAZQA1kCAgVXRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">National Resource Adequacy Assessment of Estonia.</a>&nbsp;This is the first ACER Opinion on a National Resource Adequacy Assessment (NRAA).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is a resource adequacy assessment?</span></p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtUAw4CBVYBB0xfAlVTHVYPVg8dUAsIAhpTVwMFVgMEDgRTD1UdBwdaAwkEDQIdUAhXUB0GCwBUGldVUFEZClRTVAZQA1kCAgVXRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">European Resource Adequacy Assessment</a>&nbsp;(ERAA) identifies potential concerns about electricity resource adequacy across the EU and provides an objective framework for assessing the need for additional national measures to ensure security of electricity supply.</p>
<p>Member States can complement the European analysis with their own&nbsp;<em>national</em>&nbsp;assessment (NRAA). While national assessments follow the ERAA&rsquo;s methodology, they may introduce changes in terms of, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>new information as it becomes available since the latest ERAA;</li>
<li>national specificities that are not reflected in ERAA.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why an ACER Opinion?</span></p>
<p>When a national assessment identifies new adequacy concerns, and the Member State informs ACER, ACER must issue an Opinion on the differences between the national and European assessments.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are ACER&rsquo;s main findings?</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The Estonian NRAA includes elements that represent a positive benchmark for future national assessments by: 
<ul>
<li>Modelling the relevant neighbouring countries.</li>
<li>Using ERAA 2023 as a starting point to ensure consistency and comparability between the two assessments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The differences with some of the ERAA 2023 assumptions are justified, as the Estonian NRAA: 
<ul>
<li>Incorporates new information about interconnector commissioning and renewable energy development.</li>
<li>Better reflects regional specificities.</li>
<li>Includes a sensitivity analysis to illustrate the role of oil shale-based generation at national level.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>However, the application of the updated assumptions is inconsistent throughout the assessment, as their impact on the market has not been evaluated.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the next steps?</span></p>
<p>ACER recommends the Estonian Transmission System Operator to assess how the new assumptions may impact the market and amend the NRAA as necessary.</p>

Summary:<br />Physitrack PLC fined SEK 322,359 by Nasdaq Stockholm for violating EU Market Abuse Regulation and Rulebook by releasing financial statement early. <div>
<p>The Disciplinary Committee of Nasdaq Stockholm (the &ldquo;Exchange&rdquo;) has found that Physitrack PLC (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) has breached the rules of Nasdaq First North Growth Market (the &ldquo;Rulebook&rdquo;) and therefore ordered the Company to pay a fine of two annual fees, corresponding to an amount of SEK 322,359.</p>
<p>The Disciplinary Committee notes that it is undisputed that the Company has violated article 17 of the EU Market Abuse Regulation and the Rulebook. The violation consisted of the Company making its Annual Financial Statement Release for 2023 available on its website before it was disclosed via a press release.</p>
<p>The Disciplinary Committee finds that the violation is serious, and therefore a fine shall be imposed as a sanction. The Disciplinary Committee considers that the Company swiftly took action to correct the situation. The Disciplinary Committee sets the fine at two times the annual fee.</p>
<p>The Disciplinary Committee&rsquo;s decision is available at:</p>

<div> Monetary Authority of Singapore, World Bank, coal transition, market-based approaches, energy transition
Summary:
1. Coal transition is crucial for clean energy.
2. Renewables are growing, but unevenly.
3. Challenges in coal transition must be addressed.
4. Market-based approaches are necessary.
5. Ambition, arsenal, actors, and action are essential for successful market-based approaches.
Summary: <div>
<p>1.<span> </span>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. The Monetary Authority of Singapore is delighted to co-host today&rsquo;s event with the World Bank.</p>
<p>2.<span> </span>If there was a Dummy&rsquo;s Guide to Decarbonisation, it would probably say something like this: clean the grid, electrify everything and leave a small carbon budget for genuinely hard-to-abate sectors.</p>
<p>3.<span> </span>The focus on coal transition addresses the first of those three limbs: clean the grid. Today, our grids are primarily powered by fossil fuels, accounting for over 60% of the share of global electricity generation. Coal continues to remain the largest source of electricity globally and remains the dominant energy source for many countries.<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/towards-a-triple-a-market-based-approach-for-coal-transition#1">[1]</a></span></p>
<p>4.<span><span> </span>There is some reason for optimism. Based on IEA forecasts, more than a third of the world&rsquo;s electricity will come from renewables by next year, surpassing coal as the largest source of supply.</span>&nbsp;In advanced economies last year, renewables accounted for 34% of total power generation, while coal&rsquo;s share plummeted to a historic low of 17%.<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/towards-a-triple-a-market-based-approach-for-coal-transition#2">[2]</a></span></p>
<p>5.<span><span> </span>However, the transition is taking place unevenly and we are seeing a different trajectory in developing regions</span>. For instance, in Southeast Asia, coal continues to account for over 40% of the energy mix.<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/towards-a-triple-a-market-based-approach-for-coal-transition#3">[3]</a></span>&nbsp;Renewables make up only a quarter of the region&rsquo;s power generation.<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/towards-a-triple-a-market-based-approach-for-coal-transition#4">[4]</a></span>&nbsp;We have a fair bit of ground to close, given the International Renewable Energy Agency&rsquo;s (IRENA) estimates that renewables will need to account for between 90-100% of electricity generation in 2050, if are to keep to a 1.5 degree scenario for Southeast Asia.<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/towards-a-triple-a-market-based-approach-for-coal-transition#5">[5]</a></span></p>
<p>6.<span> </span>We should all be concerned about this because one in every seven tonnes of greenhouse gas emitted into the atmosphere comes from a coal plant in Asia. If we are serious about the climate transition, we need to get serious about Asian coal.</p>
<div>
<p>7.<span> </span>If nothing is done, coal power will continue to be dominant for three main reasons:</p>
<p>a.<span><span> </span>Coal is already locked in</span>. Asia&rsquo;s coal plants are young, less than 15 years old on average. There is established infrastructure, and long-term power purchase agreements (PPA). These make transitioning from coal a costly process.</p>
<p>b.<span> </span><span>The second reason underpinning the dominance is that bottlenecks in grid infrastructure are hindering renewable energy deployment</span>. There is no transition without transmission. There is little value in adding more generation capacity if the electricity cannot reach the intended end-user. In Vietnam for example, the influx of solar and wind capacity in the South has caused renewable energy generation curtailment. At the same time, the country&rsquo;s coal-dependent northern provinces face supply challenges.</p>
<p>c.<span><span> </span>Lastly, if we only think of coal in economic terms, we have missed the plot. Coal is not just an economic asset; it is an asset with deep security and social implications.</span>&nbsp;Coal is viewed as essential for energy security given its reliability as baseload capacity. In Asia, some 6.7 million jobs are tied to the coal industry, from mining to power generation. The transition away from coal, if not managed carefully, could lead to significant social disruption, particularly in regions where alternative employment opportunities are scarce.</p>
<p>8.<span><span> </span>These three challenges &ndash; (i) lock in, (ii) grid infrastructure, and (iii) the broader entrenchment of coal, particularly in emerging markets &ndash; highlight why broad-brush efforts to phasing out coal have met with limited success.</span>&nbsp;Because coal has deep economic, social and existential roots, we need to complement these efforts with market-based solutions.</p>
<p>9.<span><span> </span>Market-based approaches are not just purely theoretical, they are already being implemented with promising results.</span>&nbsp;Such mechanisms are being pioneered through initiatives such as the U.S. Energy Transition Accelerator and the Just Energy Transition Partnership. Recent modelling by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) has found that the decommissioning of over 800 coal power plants in emerging economies can be achieved through large-scale investments in renewables and restructured power purchase agreements. All costs would be covered through this market-based approach, including financing PPAs, the development of renewables, retraining workers and upgrading grid infrastructure.<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/towards-a-triple-a-market-based-approach-for-coal-transition#6">[6]</a></span></p>
<p>10.<span> </span>Given that market-based approaches are the focus of today&rsquo;s event, I thought it would be useful for me to outline the key components of such an approach.</p>
<p>11.<span> </span>I would say there are three key components &ndash;&nbsp;<span>the three &ldquo;As&rdquo;: ambition, arsenal and actors.</span></p>
<div><span>12.</span><span><span><span> </span>First, ambition. What is essential here is to ensure strong ambition loops between demand and supply.</span></span><span>&nbsp;Market-based approaches work best when demand and supply goals and parameters are aligned. This is a key principle underpinning the work to develop transition credits. Transition credits are a new form of carbon credits that can be generated from the emissions reduced by retiring a coal plant early and transitioning to&nbsp;<span>cleaner energy sources. For this to be a viable financing tool, the supply of transition credits has to be of high integrity. Confidence in the integrity of the credits will reinforce demand. This is where we need to build a virtuous loop of demand and supply to build a market for transition credits.</span></span></div>
<div><span>&nbsp;</span>
<p>13.<span> </span>To concretely unpack how this can be achieved, MAS launched the Transition Credits Coalition (TRACTION) at COP28 with more than 30 members. TRACTION is exploring how to support the development of high-integrity supply and build up buyer confidence in transition credits. This means hearing from demand-side players, including sovereigns, corporates and sectoral bodies from both the compliance and voluntary markets. We are asking them what key attributes they look for when purchasing credits.&nbsp; This, in turn, feeds into TRACTION&rsquo;s work on the supply side, to identify suitable coal retirement projects for the generation of such credits.</p>
<p>14.<span> </span>Beyond supply and demand, what makes TRACTION different is a third focus on making transactions scalable.&nbsp;<span>This means looking beyond pilots. We are looking to build replicable ambition loops between demand and supply at scale</span>. Part of this involves mapping the risks faced by stakeholders in a transition credit value chain, and identifying ways to mitigate these risks.</p>
<p>15.<span> </span><span>The second &ldquo;A&rdquo; in a strong market-based approach is arsenal.<span>&nbsp;This refers to the need to develop an arsenal of tools and mechanisms to improve the economic viability and risk profile of coal decommissioning projects.</span></span>&nbsp;Concessional capital is certainly a key tool, but it cannot be our only tool. Market-based approaches use a variety of complementary tools, such as blended finance, technical assistance, guarantees, and carbon credits. Each tool seeks to address a different gap.</p>
<p>16.<span> </span>Applying this to the example on Transition Credits,&nbsp;<span>we need to be receptive to a wide arsenal of approaches even as we address the</span>&nbsp;<span>foundational issue of credit integrity</span>. Several methodologies that prescribe how high integrity transition credits can be generated are being developed as we speak. Some of these are premised on a project-based approach, where the mitigation activity is implemented by each individual coal plant. Others use a sectoral approach where the mitigation activities are managed across a jurisdiction, at the national or subnational level.</p>
<p>17.<span> </span>TRACTION is examining both approaches. Let me share three initial observations:</p>
<p><span>a.<span> </span>First, project-based and sectoral approaches use different guardrails to meet high integrity standards and Just Transition needs. Importantly, these requirements also have to consider implementation practicalities.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>For instance, project-based methodologies require a just transition plan to be developed at the plant level with stakeholders. Sectoral approach would call for one at the national or subnational level.</li>
<li>While the approaches may be different, both stipulate that part of the credit proceeds must be directed to just transition.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>b.<span> </span>Second, jurisdictions and plant owners should choose a crediting methodology that suits their local context.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>For example, where there are no site-appropriate options for cleaner energy, a sectoral approach may be considered provided there is a national energy transition plan.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>c.<span> </span>Third,</span>&nbsp;<span>with multiple approaches under development, stakeholders facing different circumstances will have more options to accelerate a just coal transition action globally.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>We must recognise that energy transition will not be homogenous as markets have their unique needs for energy security and growth. And the economics of energy transition for each market will also be different.</li>
<li>This goes back to my point on the need to have an arsenal of tools. Different methodologies can and should be part of the toolkit to encourage more countries and plant owners to take action today.</li>
</ul>
<p>18.<span><span> </span>The final &ldquo;A&rdquo; is actors. We need everyone to step up to the plate more decisively.</span>&nbsp;We need better coordination across actors so that those with the ability to step in can quickly plug the gaps.&nbsp;<span>Governments, development finance institutions, and philanthropies could provide concessional capital. Multilateral development banks can provide technical assistance, including advisory and structuring support, and commercial capital. We&nbsp;</span>also need to more extensively harness the capabilities of financial<span>&nbsp;institutions, such as insurance players, to provide innovative risk mitigation solutions across the project development lifecycle.</span></p>
<p>19.<span><span> </span>We are starting to see the beginnings of this in the Financing Asia&rsquo;s Transition Partnership (FAST-P), the US$5bn blended finance platform that we launched at COP28 last year.&nbsp;</span>One specific theme under FAST-P is the Energy Transition Acceleration Fund (ETAF), which is being developed in partnership with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP). The fund focusses on energy transition projects in Asia, such as the early phaseout of coal assets and replacement with renewables. The ADB provides not just concessional capital from its donors, but also its structuring expertise, experience in working on the Energy Transition Mechanism in Asia, and a pipeline of potential projects. GEAPP, with its experience in the energy transition, and a network of willing partners with a focus on green energy access, is well placed to ensure that investments in the space are socially inclusive and just. We are also grateful for the World Bank&rsquo;s partnership in FAST-P. Singapore is working with the&nbsp;<span>International Finance Corporation (</span>IFC) and other partners on a Green Investment Partnership under FAST-P to finance marginally bankable green infrastructure projects and companies in Asia. IFC&rsquo;s experience in deploying blended finance and scaling infrastructure projects has been invaluable.</p>
<p>20.<span><span> </span>Market-based approaches are not just a novelty or an interesting talking point.</span>&nbsp;They are a necessity if we are to accelerate the coal transition at the scale we need. For these approaches to work, I have outlined three key &ldquo;A&rsquo;s&rdquo; that are essential: (i)&nbsp;<span>Ambition</span>&nbsp;loops to harness the market-making power of demand and supply, (ii) the ability and willingness to tap on a wide&nbsp;<span>Arsenal</span>&nbsp;of tools, and (iii) a strong ecosystem of&nbsp;<span>Actors&nbsp;</span>that readily step up to play critical roles.</p>
<p>21.<span> </span><span>I would also add a fourth &ldquo;A&rdquo; &ndash; Action.</span>&nbsp;I have outlined some concrete workstreams and initiatives that can make decisive impact on coal transition. I hope you will step forward to contribute to this work.</p>
<p>22.<span> </span>With this, I look forward to the panel discussion that will cover a number of innovative market-based approaches, and to the fruitful discussions that will no doubt follow.</p>

<div> AI, labor market, productivity, employment, implications
Summary:
University speaker discusses AI's potential for boosting productivity, labor market evolution, and need for workers to familiarize themselves with AI. <div>
<p>I am grateful for the educational opportunities this university has afforded my family over the years, including my uncle Samuel DuBois Cook who received his M.A. and Ph.D. here in 1950 and 1953. I am delighted to be here! Today, I would like to discuss the implications of artificial intelligence (AI) for workers and the labor market, more generally.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20240926a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;I will discuss AI's potential to boost productivity, offer a framework to consider which jobs will be most affected by AI, and consider AI's effect on aggregate employment. I hope this discussion will be informative for many of you in the audience, especially those of you who will be entering the job market in the next few years. However, before discussing AI, I think it will be helpful to first set the stage by reviewing how the labor market has evolved in recent years and where it is today.</p>
<p><strong>View of the Labor Market</strong><br />On the eve of the pandemic, the labor market was quite strong. The unemployment rate was flirting with historical lows, having fallen to 3.5 percent in the fall of 2019 from an average of 4.7 percent between 2014 and 2019. Jobs were relatively plentiful, with 12 openings for every 10 unemployed job seekers.</p>
<p>Then, the labor market changed dramatically in the first few months of the pandemic when economies around the world shut down. By April 2020, nearly one out of every seven U.S. workers was unemployed. The U.S. labor market lost more than 20 million jobs in just two months. To put that into perspective, that is nearly four times the total number of jobs in Ohio. U.S. workers and employers, with the support of timely and extraordinary policy action, proved to be resilient and innovative. As we know from the National Bureau of Economic Research's Business Cycle Dating Committee, the pandemic recession was the shortest on record, even though it was the deepest since the Great Depression. By mid-2020, the economy was growing again.</p>
<p>And grow it did. The labor market roared back, gaining 25 million jobs in the three years from its low point in April 2020. Demand for labor outpaced supply such that by mid-2022 there were 20 job openings for every 10 unemployed job seekers. By early 2023, the unemployment rate fell to 3.4 percent, its lowest level in 60 years.</p>
<p>In the last year and a half, labor demand has moderated, as restrictive monetary policy helped bring aggregate demand in line with supply and eased inflationary pressure. At the same time, labor supply grew rapidly, and now labor demand and supply are more balanced. While the overall labor market remains solid, it has cooled noticeably this year and is now less tight than it was on the eve of the pandemic. In August, the unemployment rate stood at 4.2 percent, having risen by almost a 1/2 percentage point over the past 12 months. And, in recent months, the number of job openings relative to unemployed job seekers has fallen to just below its pre-pandemic range.</p>
<p>As labor demand and supply are now more evenly balanced, it may become more difficult for some individuals to find employment. For example, younger workers could experience more hurdles as they look for that first job that will launch them on a longer career path. Over the past 12 months, the share of 16- to 24-year-olds in the labor force who are unemployed has risen over 1 percentage point, notably larger than the overall increase. Such data are consistent with a report in the most recent Beige Book, a compilation of anecdotal information from around the country shared with Fed officials before our meetings, indicating some recent graduates are facing unexpected difficulties finding suitable jobs.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20240926a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;It is also the case that less-educated and minority workers could face greater hurdles, as they tend to benefit more from tighter labor markets and suffer more from weakening economic conditions.</p>
<p>The slowing of the solid labor market has come alongside a significant easing in inflationary pressure. Inflation was 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in July, notably closer to our 2 percent target than a year earlier&mdash;when inflation was 3.3 percent&mdash;and far below its peak of 7 percent in mid-2022. In recent months, the upside risks to inflation have diminished, and the downside risks to employment have increased. In response to these changing conditions, I whole heartedly supported the decision at last week's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting to lower our policy interest rate by 1/2 percentage point. The FOMC, of which I am a member, is the Federal Reserve's primary monetary policymaking body. That decision reflected growing confidence that, with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, the solid labor market can be maintained in a context of moderate economic growth and inflation continuing to move sustainably down to our target. In thinking about the path of policy moving forward, I will be looking carefully at incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.</p>
<p>The return to balance in the labor market between supply and demand, as well as the ongoing return toward our inflation target, reflects the normalization of the economy after the dislocations of the pandemic. This normalization, particularly of inflation, is quite welcome, as a balance between supply and demand is essential for sustaining a prolonged period of labor-market strength. Of course, there will always be new developments and changes that will reshape the labor market. Recent advances in AI technology are perhaps the most talked about and debated of such developments today. I anticipate that these advances may have a significant effect on workers, the labor market, and the economy in coming years.</p>
<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence and Productivity</strong><br />From the outset, I, like most of my economist colleagues studying the economics of innovation and AI closely, acknowledge that the implications of AI are highly uncertain. We still do not know what the ultimate magnitude or intensity of this effect will be, which workers and firms will be most affected, or even the time period over which these effects will be realized. But today, I will highlight how economic theory and some recent studies can shed initial light on these critical questions.</p>
<p>The key reason why many expect AI will have a substantial effect on the economy is, because AI has the potential to provide a large and sustained boost to labor-productivity growth&mdash;which is simply how much output of an individual worker grows over time. Ultimately, growth in output per person, workers' real earnings, and households' real purchasing power can all be tied back to growth in labor productivity. Like many of the most significant technological innovations of the past 200 or so years&mdash;such as the steam engine, electricity, computers, and the internet&mdash;AI has the potential to affect labor productivity in a plethora of economic activities across many industries and occupations.</p>
<p>For instance, over the past few years we have seen dramatic advances in generative AI technologies, which synthesize massive quantities of data to create models that can produce high-quality text, images, and video. Building upon these recent advances, a wide variety of new AI assistants have been deployed to help workers in a broad range of jobs. Although the degree to which these new assistants will improve labor productivity is likely to be quite idiosyncratic, some early studies suggest the effects could be large. One recent study examined the effect of an AI assistant for customer support agents and found that agents using the AI assistant resolved 14 percent more customer issues per hour&mdash;with this improvement being most pronounced for workers with comparatively less experience and less formal training.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20240926a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>But perhaps even more promising is AI's potential for improving our ability to generate new ideas. AI is being used in drug discovery to identify novel chemical compounds; in energy research to extend the duration of a fusion reaction; and in engineering to better understand the aerodynamics of automobiles, airplanes, and ships. If AI can improve our ability to generate new ideas, then it could provide a long-term boost to labor productivity growth, as each newly discovered idea will itself provide an incremental boost to labor productivity.</p>
<p><strong>Judging the Effect of Artificial Intelligence on Occupations</strong><br />Because of their effects on labor productivity, past technological innovations have resulted in dramatic positive and negative shocks to the demand for specific occupations or tasks. We should expect AI to do the same: eliminating some jobs but, crucially, also creating new ones. As a society, we will need to consider how to retrain and support workers who may be displaced from their jobs, even as many others benefit from AI adoption. As I think about AI's implications for employment in any given job or task, I tend to focus on three questions.</p>
<p><em>How much exposure?</em><br />First, how exposed is a particular job to AI?</p>
<p>It is helpful to think about a job as a set of tasks that the worker must perform. Economist David Autor pioneered this task-based framework for jobs. He used it to demonstrate that the shift in labor demand, which began in the 1970s, away from jobs that involved a large degree of routine tasks can be explained by these jobs' greater exposure to the rapid adoption of computerization and automation technologies.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20240926a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;We can take a similar task-based approach to determine a job's exposure to AI.</p>
<p>Start by considering what share of a job's tasks can be performed by AI. For example, we might expect AI to be able to perform a larger share of a software programmer's tasks versus those of a plumber.</p>
<p>Next, for those tasks that can be performed by AI, consider how well AI performs them relative to a typical worker. For instance, generative AI is used in a medical setting to summarize patient interviews&mdash;a task that it performs quite well relative to a human doctor. Based on that interview, AI could diagnose a patient and develop a treatment plan, but these are tasks that doctors still tend to perform better than AI.</p>
<p>Finally, for those tasks that can be performed by AI, think about the quality threshold required for that job task.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Coming back to the example of a doctor and AI, while there may be some tolerance for incorrectly summarizing a patient interview, there is little tolerance for misdiagnosing a patient or developing a bad treatment plan. I would also note that we may have higher quality thresholds for AI than we do for human workers&mdash;with driverless cars being an example where AI drivers may be held to a higher standard than human drivers. Thus, a job will be more exposed to AI, if AI can perform a large share of the job's tasks sufficiently well relative to a human worker and a set of quality thresholds. Importantly, we can expect that a job's exposure to AI will change over time, because advances in AI technology will both expand the set of tasks that AI can perform and improve the quality of AI's performance of those tasks.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my second question for AI's implications for any given job.</p>
<p><em>Complement or substitute?</em><br />Will AI be a complement to or a substitute for the job, given its set of tasks?</p>
<p>AI is more likely to serve as a complement to jobs that have less exposure to AI but use the services or products that are produced by jobs with a high degree of AI exposure. For instance, a job as a litigator may have little direct exposure to AI but will benefit from AI's ability to assist with legal research.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20240926a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a></p>
<p>Even for some jobs with a high degree of exposure to AI, it is possible for AI to serve as a complement. Let's return to the example of the doctor, who may now see more patients or spend more time on diagnoses, because AI has taken over writing summaries of patient interviews. More broadly, jobs with a high degree of exposure to AI will likely be complemented by AI, if workers are able to offload time-intensive, but low value-added, tasks to AI and focus their time on the highest value-added tasks.</p>
<p>However, we can expect that there will be some jobs that have a high degree of exposure to AI and for which AI can perform some especially high-valued tasks. Thus, AI may be more of a substitute for human labor in these jobs. But even for these jobs, the employment implications are ambiguous and will depend on the third question.</p>
<p><em>What is the elasticity of demand?</em><br />What is the price elasticity of demand for the output of these jobs that are highly affected by AI?</p>
<p>To understand what I mean, it is helpful to consider a concrete example. I want to come back to the software programmer jobs that I mentioned before as having a high degree of exposure to AI. Recent advances in generative AI have resulted in the development of new AI-powered coding assistants that help automate some aspects of writing software code. Some early studies have found that these AI coding assistants can provide a significant boost to programmers' productivity. One randomized controlled trial found that these AI coding assistants cut in half the amount of time it took to finish a small programming project.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20240926a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;Another study found that programmers who were randomly assigned to use an AI coding assistant submitted 20 percent more requests each week asking to add code they had written to a software project.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20240926a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;And I emphasize that these tools are still in their infancy, which suggests that the productivity gains for software-programming jobs may be even larger.</p>
<p>These productivity enhancements will allow software programming projects to be delivered in less time and at a lower cost. As we know from economic theory, as the costs and delivery times for software projects fall, demand for such projects should increase. The number of software-programming jobs will depend on whether the demand for software projects increases more than one for one with the decrease in cost. In other words, is the price elasticity of demand for software projects greater than one? If it is, then the reduction in software programmers' hours devoted to programming tasks that can now be performed by AI will be more than offset by the increase in their hours from the greater demand for AI-enhanced software programming.</p>
<p>I find these questions helpful for framing how to think about AI's implications for any job or set of tasks. While I mentioned that there will likely be benefits for certain workers, it is important to recognize a universal lesson from past technological innovations&mdash;namely, that the employment and earnings of some workers are likely to be negatively affected by these innovations. The magnitude and extent of these negative effects will depend on a variety of factors.</p>
<p>For instance, consider if AI is able to perform job tasks that previously required a high degree of training or specialization. Affected workers in these jobs could experience larger declines in their earning power, if AI depreciates the value of their accumulated human capital. The degree to which AI could negatively affect some workers' earnings and employment will also be influenced by the pace of AI adoption. It is possible that if AI adoption is rapid, we could see the effects on some workers come quickly and be more concentrated, depending on which sectors are early adopters.</p>
<p><strong>Implications of Artificial Intelligence for Aggregate Employment</strong><br />In addition to considering AI's effects on individual workers, economists also evaluate AI's implications for aggregate employment. As I discussed, it remains unclear whether AI will be a boon for or a drag on net employment for those jobs that are most directly affected by AI.</p>
<p>For workers who are not directly exposed to AI but, rather, are users of the output from AI-exposed jobs, the aggregate employment implications are more likely to be positive. Generally, these downstream jobs will benefit from the lower input costs that result from greater productivity realized by AI-exposed jobs. An exception might be jobs where the cheaper inputs are a substitute for labor in the downstream job.</p>
<p>Moreover, I anticipate that inventors and innovators will continue to discover new products and services that are enabled by AI. The companies that are then formed to deliver these new products and services can be expected to raise aggregate employment.</p>
<p>In light of the uncertainty regarding AI's implications for the labor market, I want to highlight the important role that decisions by firms and, to a lesser extent, workers can have for determining how AI will affect the labor market.</p>
<p>If incumbent firms are able to adjust their processes to capture productivity benefits from AI, then these firms could help mitigate some of AI's potential for job displacement by internally reallocating affected workers to new roles and providing necessary training. If some job tasks can be replaced with AI&mdash;especially those that are mundane and repetitive&mdash;workers may be freed up to focus on other tasks or new activities they find more rewarding.</p>
<p>Individual workers play a limited role in determining how AI will affect their earnings and employment. Workers in jobs that will be complemented by AI might benefit from familiarizing themselves with how to effectively use AI. Workers in jobs where AI will be able to perform a substantial share of their tasks will face greater challenges. Some of these workers may seek to develop expertise in the aspects of their jobs for which AI is particularly ill-suited. Yet, many of these more-exposed workers may need to invest in training in alternative occupations that are less exposed to AI, similar to some of the skill-retraining efforts for manufacturing workers over the past 50 years.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />In closing, I suspect that the tremendous uncertainty I highlighted related to AI's implications for the labor market will be some combination of disconcerting and exciting for many in the audience, especially those who will be graduating and launching their careers in the coming years.</p>
<p>My recommendation to you is to take the time to experiment with AI, familiarizing yourself with its capabilities and limitations. Doing so will make you well placed to help your future employers&mdash;and that could include yourselves&mdash;transform their business processes to effectively use AI. And for the smaller subset of you who are purely excited about the opportunity presented by AI, I look forward to seeing the innovative new products and services you create and disseminate throughout the economy to raise the living standards for all Americans.</p>
<p>Thank you for having me at The Ohio State University. I look forward to your questions.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Cassava Sciences, Two Former Executives For Misleading Claims About Alzheimer’s Clinical Trial - Cassava-Affiliated University Scientist Also Charged For Manipulating Clinical Trial Results</title>

<div> SEC, Cassava Sciences, Alzheimer's, clinical trial, misleading statements 
Summary: 
SEC charges Cassava Sciences, founder, and consultant for misleading statements about Alzheimer's drug trial results, settling for over $40 million. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced Cassava Sciences, Inc., its founder and former CEO, Remi Barbier, and its former Senior Vice President of Neuroscience, Dr. Lindsay Burns, will pay more than $40 million to settle charges related to misleading statements made in September 2020 about the results of a Phase 2 clinical trial for the company&rsquo;s purported therapeutic for the treatment of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p>
<p>In a related order, the SEC charged Cassava consultant, Dr. Hoau-Yan Wang, an associate medical professor at the City University of New York&rsquo;s Medical School and the therapeutic&rsquo;s co-developer, for manipulating the reported clinical trial results.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, Wang received information that unblinded him to some aspects of the Phase 2 clinical data, which he used to identify about a third of the patients enrolled in the trial. In a blinded clinical trial, to avoid bias in the results, no one involved in the trial knows the treatment assignment of individual patients, including whether the patient received a placebo or an active dose of the therapeutic. Using information that unblinded him to aspects of the trial data, Wang was able to manipulate the data to create the appearance that the drug had caused dramatic improvements in biomarkers associated with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, such as total tau and phosphorylated tau, which are common indicators of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer&rsquo;s patients. The order also finds that Wang knew Cassava would disclose the manipulated data when announcing the results of its Phase 2 clinical trial, and Cassava did in fact publicize the data in a press release and investor deck issued on September 14, 2020. The SEC&rsquo;s related civil complaint alleges that Cassava and Burns misled investors with claims that the Phase 2 trial was conducted in blinded conditions, even though Wang had been unblinded.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint further alleges that Cassava misled investors by announcing that the company&rsquo;s therapeutic significantly improved patient cognition. Among other things, Cassava claimed that the Phase 2 results showed significant improvement in episodic memory of the Alzheimer&rsquo;s patients involved in the clinical trial. In reporting the results, however, Cassava failed to disclose that the full set of patient data &ndash; as opposed to the subset of data hand-selected by Burns &ndash; showed no measurable cognitive improvement in the patients&rsquo; episodic memory. Cassava and Barbier also failed to disclose Wang&rsquo;s role in the clinical trial, despite his personal, financial, and professional interest in the therapeutic&rsquo;s success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our capital markets can and should be a powerful engine for innovation in the development of new and potentially life-altering therapeutics,&rdquo; said Mark Cave, Associate Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s actions &ndash; which include charges against senior executives and significant monetary relief against Cassava &ndash; reflect our commitment to upholding public confidence in the market&rsquo;s ability to accelerate legitimate scientific advances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, charges Cassava, Barbier, and Burns with violating antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and charges Cassava with violating reporting provisions of the federal securities laws. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Cassava, Barbier, and Burns consented to civil injunctions against future violations and agreed to pay civil penalties of $40 million, $175,000, and $85,000, respectively. Barbier and Burns agreed to be subject to officer-and-director bars of three and five years, respectively. The settlements are subject to court approval.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order alleges that Wang violated antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and that he aided and abetted Cassava&rsquo;s violations of the reporting provisions. Without admitting or denying the violations, Dr. Wang consented to cease and desist from future violations and to pay a $50,000 penalty.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Matthew Spitzer, Ernesto Amparo, and Zachary Avallone and was supervised by Sarah Hall, Melissa Armstrong, and Mr. Cave. Eugene Canjels from the Commission&rsquo;s Division of Economic Risk and Analysis provided assistance.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Advisory Firm GQG Partners With Violating Whistleblower Protection Rule - Firm’s Agreements With Potential Hires And A Former Employee Raised Barriers To Reporting Information To The SEC</title>

<div> SEC, GQG Partners LLC, whistleblower protection, violations, settlement
Summary:<br />SEC settled charges with GQG Partners for impeding employees from reporting securities violations, violating whistleblower protection rule, and agreed to a $500,000 civil penalty. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against Florida-based GQG Partners LLC, a registered investment adviser, for entering into agreements with candidates for employment and a former employee that made it more difficult for them to report potential securities law violations to the SEC. &nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, from November 2020 through September 2023, GQG entered into non-disclosure agreements with 12 candidates for employment that prohibited them from disclosing confidential information about GQG, including to government agencies. While the agreements permitted the candidates to respond to requests for information from the Commission, it required notification to GQG of any such request and prohibited responding to requests arising from a candidate&rsquo;s voluntary disclosure.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that GQG also entered into a settlement agreement with a former employee whose counsel had told GQG that he or she intended to report alleged securities law violations to the Commission. Specifically, the settlement agreement said that it permitted reporting possible securities law violations to government agencies, including the Commission; however, it also required the former employee to affirm that he or she had not done so; was not aware of facts that would support an investigation; and would withdraw any statements already made that might support an investigation. These provisions violated the whistleblower protection rule.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether through agreements or otherwise, firms cannot impose barriers to persons providing evidence about possible securities law violations to the SEC, as GQG did,&rdquo; said Corey Schuster, Co-Chief of the Division of Enforcement&rsquo;s Asset Management Unit. &ldquo;Even agreements that contain carve-out language allowing people to voluntarily report to the SEC can be violative if restrictive language in a separate provision impedes voluntary reporting to the Commission staff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that GQG violated whistleblower protection Rule 21F-17(a), which prohibits any action to impede an individual from communicating directly with the SEC staff about a possible securities law violation. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, GQG agreed to be censured, to cease and desist from violating the whistleblower protection rule, and to pay a $500,000 civil penalty.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Marie DeBonis, Marilyn Ampolsk, and Brian Fitzpatrick, and supervised by Virginia Rosado Desilets, Mr. Schuster, and Andrew Dean, all of the Asset Management Unit.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<title>SEC Charges DraftKings With Selectively Disclosing Nonpublic Information Via CEO’s Social Media Accounts</title>

<div> charged, DraftKings Inc., Regulation Fair Disclosure, social media, SEC
Summary:
DraftKings charged by SEC for selectively disclosing nonpublic info on CEO's social media, violated Regulation FD, agreed to pay $200,000 penalty. Summary: <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged DraftKings Inc. with selectively disclosing material, nonpublic information to investors who followed or otherwise viewed the company CEO&rsquo;s social media accounts without disclosing that same information to all investors, in violation of Regulation Fair Disclosure (FD). DraftKings agreed to pay a $200,000 civil penalty to settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges.</p>
<p>The order finds that, on July 27, 2023, at 5:52 p.m., DraftKings&rsquo; public relations firm published a post on the personal X account of the DraftKings CEO. The post, according to the order, stated that the company continued to see &ldquo;really strong growth&rdquo; in states where it was already operating. DraftKings&rsquo; public relations firm posted a similar statement that same day on the CEO&rsquo;s LinkedIn account. At the time of the posts, DraftKings had not yet disclosed its second quarter 2023 financial results, nor had it otherwise publicly disclosed certain information contained in the posts. Shortly after the public relations firm published the posts, it removed both posts at the request of DraftKings. According to the order, even though Regulation FD required DraftKings to promptly disclose the information to all investors after it was selectively disclosed to some, DraftKings did not disclose the information to the public until seven days later when it announced its financial earnings for the second quarter of 2023.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Information about growth in sales as a public company can be extremely important to investors,&rdquo; said John Dugan, Associate Director for Enforcement in the SEC&rsquo;s Boston Regional Office. &ldquo;It is essential that, when companies disseminate material, nonpublic information, they do so fairly to all investors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The order charges DraftKings with violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Regulation FD. Without admitting or denying the order&rsquo;s findings, DraftKings agreed to cease and desist from future violations of the charged provisions, pay the civil penalty referenced above, and comply with certain undertakings, including required Regulation FD training for employees who have corporate communications responsibilities.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Jonathan Menitove, Colin Forbes, Patrick Noone, Sean Fishkind, and Kathleen Shields, and supervised by Celia Moore of the SEC&rsquo;s Boston Regional Office.</p>
<p>While companies can use social media outlets to announce key information in compliance with Regulation FD, investors must first have been alerted about which social media will be used to disseminate such information.

<div> CFTC, CHS Hedging, LLC, recordkeeping deficiencies, customer authorizations, civil monetary penalty <br />
Summary:<br />
CFTC charges CHS Hedging, LLC for recordkeeping deficiencies and unauthorized trades, orders a $650,000 penalty, admits to violations, and recognizes cooperation in investigation.<br /> <div>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an order simultaneously filing and settling charges against&nbsp;CHS Hedging, LLC, a Minnesota based futures commission merchant, for recordkeeping deficiencies and failure to obtain customer authorizations before entering trades for customers.</p>
<p>The order requires CHS Hedging, LLC, to pay a $650,000 civil monetary penalty. The respondent admits the facts related to its recordkeeping deficiencies as detailed in the order and is ordered to cease and desist from further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations, as charged. In accepting CHS&rsquo;s Offer, CFTC recognizes CHS&rsquo;s self-reporting and cooperation in connection with this Division of Enforcement&rsquo;s investigation.</p>
<p>Case Background</p>
<p>The order finds from&nbsp;June 21, 2019, to Sept. 2, 2023, CHS used at least three different recording platforms to make or keep audio recordings of communications by its associated persons (APs) with CHS customers. At various points during that time, these platforms suffered from deficiencies or other issues resulting in CHS&rsquo;s failure to make or keep approximately 3,000 audio recordings of its APs calls with CHS customers. These calls would have included communications concerning quotes, solicitations, bids, offers, instructions, trading, and/or prices leading to transactions in commodity interests.</p>
<p>Additionally, the order finds during this time, CHS, through three of its APs, placed 75 trades for seven customers without a power of attorney and without obtaining specific information from customers about the quantity and/or precise commodity interest to be purchased or sold.</p>
<p>The order also acknowledges CHS&rsquo;s representations concerning its remediation in connection with this matter.</p>
<p>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this matter are James Deacon, Alison Wilson, and Rick Glaser.</p>

<div> SCOOS, Dealer Financing Terms, Credit Officers, Securities Financing, OTC Derivatives
Summary:
The Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey (SCOOS) gathers data from credit officers about securities financing and OTC derivatives, providing insight into credit terms and conditions. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms (SCOOS) is a quarterly survey providing information about the availability and terms of credit in securities financing and over-the counter (OTC) derivatives markets. The SCOOS is modeled after the long-established Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, which provides qualitative information about changes in supply and demand for loans to households and businesses at commercial banks. The SCOOS collects qualitative information on credit terms and conditions in securities financing and OTC derivatives markets, which are important conduits for leverage in the financial system. The survey panel for the SCOOS began by including 20 dealers and over time has been expanded. These firms account for almost all of the dealer activity in dollar-denominated securities financing and OTC derivatives markets. The survey is directed to senior credit officers responsible for maintaining a consolidated perspective on the management of credit risks. The HTML links below include the full report; the PDF links include the summary only.</p>

<div> Securities, CTPs, VRCAs, investor protection, crypto assets
<br />
Summary: The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) is extending the deadline for crypto asset trading platforms (CTPs) to comply with terms and conditions. It cautions investors about the risks of holding crypto assets. <div>
<p><span>The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) is providing a further update for crypto asset trading platforms (CTPs) that are registered, or that provided a pre-registration undertaking (PRU), about the application of terms and conditions in the CTPs&rsquo; registration and exemptive relief decisions or PRUs related to value-referenced crypto assets (VRCAs).</span><br /><br /><span>Investors have experienced significant harm from the collapse of unregulated VRCAs, other VRCA market disruptions and the activities of unregistered crypto market participants. While other international jurisdictions are developing payment-based, banking-based or hybrid regulatory regimes for certain types of VRCAs, the CSA is not aware of any such regulated VRCAs being traded in Canada. Nor is the CSA aware of any initiatives to develop similar regulatory regimes in Canada that would address a VRCA issuer&rsquo;s financial condition, conduct and public disclosure. As a result, we continue to have investor protection concerns with the trading of these investment products in Canada.</span><br /><br /><span>Recognizing that VRCAs may have certain uses for the Canadian clients of CTPs, the CSA&rsquo;s approach, described in&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.asc.ca/securities-law-and-policy/regulatory-instruments/21-333" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CSA Staff Notice 21-333&nbsp;<em>Crypto Asset Trading Platforms: Terms and Conditions for Trading Value-Referenced Crypto Assets with Clients</em></a><span>&nbsp;(the Staff Notice), reflected a willingness to allow the continued trading of certain VRCAs that are referenced to the value of a single fiat currency (fiat-backed crypto assets, or FBCAs). The Staff Notice described terms and conditions that would address the CSA&rsquo;s investor protection concerns. (the Staff Notice), reflected a willingness to allow the continued trading of certain VRCAs that are referenced to the value of a single fiat currency (fiat-backed crypto assets, or FBCAs). The Staff Notice described terms and conditions that would address the CSA&rsquo;s investor protection concerns.</span><br /><br /><span>The Staff Notice included a deadline of April 30, 2024 by which the CSA expected that CTPs would no longer allow clients to buy, deposit, or enter into crypto contracts to buy or deposit FBCAs that do not comply with the applicable terms and conditions. As part of the CSA&rsquo;s ongoing engagement with Canadian crypto market participants on the implementation of these terms and conditions, and in response to technical issues CTPs raised with meeting the April 30 deadline, the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.asc.ca/en/News-and-Publications/News-Releases/2024/04/apr-17-CSA-provide-update-on-interim-approach-to-value-referenced-crypto-assets">CSA extended the April 30 deadline to October 31, 2024</a><span>&nbsp;and invited submissions on the appropriate long-term regulation of VRCAs.</span><br /><br /><span>The CSA has actively engaged with CTPs and crypto industry participants and remains open to proposals for alternative ways to address investor protection concerns raised by VRCAs.&nbsp;</span><strong>To that end, the CSA is further extending the October 31 deadline to December 31, 2024.</strong><span>&nbsp;The extension is intended to provide more time for CTPs to either comply with the terms and conditions of their registration and exemptive relief decisions, or their PRUs, or to propose alternatives that address investor protection concerns, as long as any alternatives are in place or substantially finalized prior to December 31, 2024. The CSA also remains open to considering exemptions relating to specific use cases for VRCAs that do not raise investor protection concerns.

<div> Treasury Market, Regulation, Central Clearing, Transparency, Securities

Summary: SEC Commissioner discusses reforms in the Treasury market, including central clearing, dealer-trader registration, and transparency for market integrity and efficiency. <div>
<p>Thank you for the kind introduction. As is customary, I&rsquo;d like to note that I&rsquo;m not speaking on behalf of my fellow Commissioners or the SEC staff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m honored to be speaking with you today following Secretary Yellen, under whose leadership we are in the midst of much needed reforms of our Treasury market. I think our nation&rsquo;s first Treasury secretary, Alexander Hamilton, would tip his tricorn hat to his 77<span>th</span>&nbsp;successor, for focusing on the efficiency and resiliency of the Treasury market.</p>
<p>A couple hundred years before he became a Broadway star, in 1790, Hamilton told Congress that &ldquo;the proper funding of the present debt, will render it a national blessing.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-treasury-market-conference-092624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Hamilton&rsquo;s prophecy has turned out to be prescient. Treasuries are called &ldquo;risk-free assets,&rdquo; not just here in the U.S. but around the globe. They are the base upon which our entire capital markets are built. The U.S. Treasury markets play an integral role in the dollar&rsquo;s dominance. They are how we, as a government and as taxpayers, raise money to fund roads, bridges, and public universities. We are the issuer. They are integral to how the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy.</p>
<p>Given the magnitude, leverage, and importance of the Treasury markets, as policymakers, we need to promote efficiency in these markets.</p>
<p>Further, over the years, all too often, we&rsquo;ve seen tremors in these markets. In 2014, we had a &ldquo;Flash Rally.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-treasury-market-conference-092624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;In the fall of 2019, the Treasury funding markets again experienced real stress.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-treasury-market-conference-092624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;We all recall the significant &ldquo;dash-for-cash" in the Treasury market back in 2020, at the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis. While not as significant, we saw jitters again when some regional banks were failing in 2023.</p>
<p>This is not a new phenomenon. I witnessed it during my early days on Wall Street when a dozen government securities dealers failed in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Given the magnitude, leverage, and importance of the Treasury markets, as policymakers, we can&rsquo;t ignore these tremors.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-treasury-market-conference-092624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p><span>Clearance and Settlement</span></p>
<p>While clearinghouses do not eliminate all risk, they do lower it. They facilitate what one might call the market plumbing, that which happens after you execute a transaction through the time that it settles.</p>
<p>First, clearinghouses do so by sitting in the middle and reducing the risks amongst and between counterparties. They also provide multilateral netting, which helps lower the overall margin (collateral) needed to be posted in the system. Further, central clearing reduces risks through the robust rules of the clearinghouses themselves, including for the collection of initial and variation margin.</p>
<p>After those tremors in the Treasury market in the 1980s, Congress worked with President Reagan and the 65<span>th</span>&nbsp;Treasury Secretary Jim Baker to set up a federal regulatory regime for government securities dealers, brokers, and clearinghouses. A few weeks later, the first clearinghouse for government securities was incorporated. I might note that since the beginning in 1986, Treasury transactions were settled on a T+1 basis.</p>
<p>Speaking of T+1, back in May, the U.S. smoothly shortened the standard settlement cycle for equities, corporate bonds, and municipal securities to one day after the transaction date.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-treasury-market-conference-092624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;This was a win for investors, who will no longer need to wait two days to get their money when they sell stocks. It&rsquo;s a win for resiliency as it lowers risk in the system.</p>
<p>Transitioning to T+1 was a team sport. Thousands of market participants&mdash;from the clearinghouse, depositories, custodian banks, broker dealers, investment advisers, self-regulatory organizations, stock exchanges, service providers, and industry groups&mdash;worked, along with SEC staff, to make the transition happen smoothly.</p>
<p>Back to Treasury clearing, by 2022, only &ldquo;approximately 20 percent of all repo and 30 percent of reverse repo is centrally cleared.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-treasury-market-conference-092624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;Further, inter-dealer brokers (IDBs), which sit in the middle of these cash markets, often are bringing just one side of the trades on their platforms into central clearing.</p>
<p>Thus, in December 2023, the SEC adopted rules to facilitate additional central clearing for the U.S. Treasury markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-treasury-market-conference-092624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>First, in March 2025, the separation of house and customer margin must be completed, ensuring that clearinghouses facilitate indirect participants as well.</p>
<p>When posting margin to the clearinghouse, members no longer will be able to net their customers&rsquo; positions against their own proprietary positions. This will better protect customers as well as the clearinghouse itself. Further, I think it could enhance competition as broker-dealers will no longer be able to use their customer positions to lower the margin they post to the clearinghouse.</p>
<p>The rules also allow for customer margin collected by broker-dealers to be onward posted to the clearinghouse under certain conditions. Allowing such rehypothecation helps both protect customers and free up broker-dealers&rsquo; resources.</p>
<p>Market participants have experience with similar rules regarding both gross margining and rehypothecation in the swaps, options, and derivatives markets.</p>
<p>Further, providing clearing for so-called &ldquo;done-away&rdquo; transactions can be an important component of promoting access and competition in the markets.</p>
<p>To facilitate access to markets, it&rsquo;s important that clearinghouses and their clearing members promote the ability for market participants to trade anonymously with the confidence that they will have access to central clearing on both sides of the trade. This helps promote all-to-all trading as well as the efficiency and resiliency of central clearing itself. To achieve this, there should be provision of clearing services such that it doesn&rsquo;t matter with whom one does a trade.</p>
<p>Subsequent to the SEC adopting the Treasury clearing rules, The Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) filed proposed rule changes intended to meet the requirements to separate house and customer margin as well as regarding customer access. The Commission has received numerous comments and continues to engage with market participants on the issues raised in FICC&rsquo;s proposal. The Commission must approve or disapprove these rules by November.</p>
<p>More generally, Commission staff are monitoring various projects in which market participants are engaged in advance of increased central clearing in the U.S. Treasury market. Such projects include the development of standard documentation for each access model, the appropriate accounting treatment for each access model, and possible cross-margining between Treasury cash positions and Treasury futures positions for clients. Staff also are monitoring the development of additional methods by which registered investment companies will access central clearing.</p>
<p>Second, the SEC&rsquo;s final rules broaden the scope of which transactions clearinghouse members must clear. Starting at the end of 2025, the final rules mandate that clearinghouses require their members clear any Treasury cash trades executed on an IDB platform, with registered broker-dealers, or with registered government securities broker-dealers. Starting June 2026, the final rules require clearinghouses in the Treasury markets to ensure that their members clear all their repo and reverse repo transactions.</p>
<p>It has been reported that there may be new entrants considering offering central clearing in the Treasury markets. We at the SEC stand ready to consider any applications to do so.</p>
<p>Transaction volume at the clearinghouse is already increasing. Earlier this month, FICC announced that its yearly volume was up 42 percent. On September 3, they set a new record clearing $9.2 trillion in daily activity.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-treasury-market-conference-092624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p><span>Dealer-Trader</span></p>
<p>As I mentioned, when I was a young associate on Wall Street, a dozen government securities dealers failed, leading to President Reagan and Congress giving this agency important authorities over the Treasury markets.</p>
<p>I remember my colleagues and myself processing what had happened, as well as potential effects on the markets and the economy. Drysdale, which was not registered or regulated as a dealer, had significant involvement in the U.S. Treasury markets. It also was highly leveraged. The firm had only $30 million in capital yet managed a portfolio as large potentially as $4 billion.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-treasury-market-conference-092624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p>Yet, when I arrived at the SEC in 2021, I was told that though some firms have registered with the SEC as government securities dealers or broker-dealers, some market participants have not. I think that leaves potential regulatory gaps and risk in the system.</p>
<p>The markets also have evolved in other ways, such as electronification, the use of algorithmic trading, and market participants transacting faster than ever before. Some market participants, such as principal-trading firms (PTFs) that use high-frequency trading strategies, started participating significantly in the Treasury cash market. In 2019, for example, PTFs represented around 60 percent of the volume on the IDB platforms in the Treasury markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-treasury-market-conference-092624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p>In essence, these PTFs and other firms are acting in a manner consistent with dealers in the securities markets. Nevertheless, despite these firms acting as de facto market makers, and despite their regularity of participation consistent with buying and selling securities or government securities for their own account &ldquo;as a part of a regular business,&rdquo; a number of these firms have not registered with the Commission as dealers.</p>
<p>This deprives investors and the markets themselves of important protections&mdash;protections that benefit market integrity, resiliency, transparency, and more.</p>
<p>Thus, the Commission earlier this year adopted final rules to further define what it means to be part of a regular business, as the dealer definition provides, in these circumstances.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-treasury-market-conference-092624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;Firms that act as dealers are required to register with the Commission as dealers, thereby protecting investors as well as promoting market integrity, resiliency, and transparency.</p>
<p><span>Exchanges and Alternative Trading Systems</span></p>
<p>Reflecting the electronification and other significant changes in the Treasury markets over the years, the Commission proposed rules to require platforms that provide marketplaces for Treasuries to register as broker-dealers and to comply with Regulation Alternative Trading System (ATS).<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-treasury-market-conference-092624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>
<p>It was the dawn of the internet, when Bob Rubin was 70<span>th</span>&nbsp;Treasury Secretary and Arthur Levitt served as the 25<span>th</span>&nbsp;SEC Chair. Under Levitt&rsquo;s leadership, in responses to new trading models, the SEC in 1998 first adopted Regulation Alternative Trading Systems.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-treasury-market-conference-092624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;At the time, Treasury trading platforms were exempted from these regulations.</p>
<p>A lot, though, has changed in the capital markets in the intervening 26 years. Much of the secondary markets in Treasuries are now facilitated by electronic trading platforms.</p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s proposal, if adopted, would require registration of certain trading platforms in the Treasury markets. It would bring Treasury trading platforms with significant volume under Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity, a rule that protects for the resiliency of technology infrastructure.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-treasury-market-conference-092624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;It also would require these platforms to comply with the Fair Access Rule, which provides for fair access to platforms and would prohibit platforms from making unfair denials or limitations of access.</p>
<p>This update would close a regulatory gap among platforms.</p>
<p><span>Transparency</span></p>
<p>Before I close, I want to discuss a couple of items related to transparency. Earlier this year, we approved a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) rule change to enhance post-trade transparency in the Treasury markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-treasury-market-conference-092624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;The FINRA rule, for the first time, will provide the public with post-trade transparency in the Treasury markets on a trade-by-trade basis, rather than on an aggregated basis. The scope of what will be published to the public will include a trade&rsquo;s time, price, direction, venue, and size.</p>
<p>Further, we approved amendments last year to modernize a rule regarding which broker-dealers must register with FINRA, which will enhance cross-market and off-exchange oversight for some of the most active participants in the capital markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-treasury-market-conference-092624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a></p>
<p><span>Conclusion</span></p>
<p>From Hamilton to Baker to Rubin to Yellen, each understood the importance of the U.S. Treasury markets. Much has changed since Hamilton&rsquo;s era &mdash; after all, he didn&rsquo;t see the dawn of the internet and modern technology. I&rsquo;d like to think, though, he would have shared Secretary Yellen&rsquo;s knack for playing Candy Crush Saga.</p>
<p>The challenge in our times is to bring reforms to ensure that they are as efficient and resilient as they can be.</p>
<p>It's critical to taxpayers, to the capital markets, to monetary policy, and the role of the dollar around the globe.</p>

<div> Treasury, Financial Stability, Resilience, Regulation, Collaboration
Summary:
- Importance of a resilient financial system
- Approach to achieving a healthy and resilient financial system
- Key accomplishments in strengthening the U.S. financial system
- Focus on addressing cross-cutting risks
- Emphasis on global collaboration for financial stability. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Thank you for the introduction. I&rsquo;m very glad that I&rsquo;m able to join you for this tenth annual Treasury Market Conference. This conference helps the government identify ways to further improve the functioning and resilience of the Treasury market, which is of course core to the functioning and resilience of the U.S. financial system as a whole. And this makes it a fitting place for me to share my thoughts on the work I and my colleagues across the Biden-Harris Administration have done to navigate financial stresses and strengthen the U.S. financial system over the past three and a half years. In my remarks today, I&rsquo;ll address why this work is so important, our approach to achieving a healthy and resilient financial system, and what we&rsquo;ve accomplished.</p>
<h3><span>I. The Importance of a Resilient Financial System</span></h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve focused on financial stability as Treasury Secretary and throughout my career because of a deep conviction concerning the importance of the U.S. financial system to U.S. economic prosperity. I&rsquo;ve seen through many businesses cycles and financial stresses that a strong, dynamic, and resilient financial system is key to a strong, dynamic, and resilient economy.</p>
<p>When the financial system works as it should, it helps American households finance home purchases and save for their children&rsquo;s educations. It enables businesses to get the capital they need to grow and hire and to invest in new innovations. It allows households and businesses to manage their risks so that they&rsquo;re prepared for the future.</p>
<p>Our strong financial system was crucial to our historic economic recovery, with banks continuing to lend and provide other critical services throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, our financial system is crucial to our medium- and long-term economic agenda, supporting the record growth in new business applications we&rsquo;ve seen under this Administration and the massive investments in infrastructure, clean energy, and manufacturing that are at the heart of the strategy I&rsquo;ve called modern supply-side economics.</p>
<p>We should also never forget what happens when the financial system does not work as it should. During the Global Financial Crisis, the collapse of large and complex financial institutions and fragile short-term funding markets spread stresses through the financial system and then to the real economy. More than eight million Americans lost their jobs, the unemployment rate rose to 10 percent, and the net worth of American households fell by more than $10 trillion. The recession was the deepest since World War II, lasting six quarters.</p>
<p>All of this leaves no question about the need for a resilient financial system. But in January of 2021, I stepped into a Treasury Department whose focus on financial stability had all but disappeared. I knew that this could lead to devastating results for American families, businesses, and financial institutions. So, I worked to restore our government&rsquo;s focus on financial stability and to craft an approach to build and maintain a financial system that households and businesses can count on day-to-day and that supports economic prosperity in the long-run.</p>
<h3><span>II. Our Approach</span></h3>
<p>Our approach includes a focus on shoring up strong core foundations of the financial system, including safe and sound financial institutions, financial market utilities and central clearing counterparties, protections for investors and consumers, and financial market integrity.</p>
<p>We also, however, recognize the necessity of considering the stability of the system as a whole. We see that connectivity between different financial institutions and markets&mdash;from direct linkages to correlated trades&mdash;can create outsized effects on the broader financial system and on our economy.</p>
<p>This understanding is rooted in recent history. In the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis, the United States and other countries enacted important financial reforms and pursued new macroprudential policies focused on mitigating systemic risk. At home, there were some who strongly opposed the Dodd-Frank Act, arguing that its regulation would hold back innovation and economic growth. I and many others have insisted on the opposite: Appropriate regulation is critical to supporting a resilient financial system that serves as an engine for innovation and growth.</p>
<p>Our view has been borne out. Critics&rsquo; warnings, for example, that regulation would undermine the competitiveness of U.S. banks, did not come to pass. Reforms strengthened the financial system, including by equipping banks with substantially more and higher-quality capital that made them better positioned to extend credit to households and businesses that needed it during the pandemic.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re well aware that financial intermediation continues to evolve, including in response to reforms. The pandemic also caused profound financial market disruptions like the global dash for cash in March of 2020, revealing additional vulnerabilities including in short-term funding markets.</p>
<p>Finally, our approach reflects the importance of collaboration and communication across regulators and other authorities. Responding to financial crises requires swift, coordinated action. Identifying vulnerabilities requires sharing insights. We recognized this need in the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis as well and established the Financial Stability Oversight Council to inform a more holistic view of and approach to risks.</p>
<p>But the Council was severely weakened during the prior Administration. When I took office, the number of Council staff had been cut to single digits. The Council&rsquo;s analysis team at Treasury, which monitors systemic risks, had been eliminated. The infrastructure supporting interagency engagement and coordination had been significantly scaled back. Put simply, we were without crucial tools to identify and help respond to risks to financial stability. This meant we faced an increased likelihood that risks would materialize into negative impacts on American households and businesses.</p>
<p>So, we rebuilt FSOC, scaling up staff and increasing opportunities for agencies to come together to share expertise and insights. FSOC&rsquo;s new Analytic Framework for Financial Stability Risks is also critical, identifying key vulnerabilities, transmission channels, and authorities to mitigate risks. This positions the Council to take more effective action. And it increases public transparency.</p>
<h3><span>III. Key Accomplishments</span></h3>
<p>Let me now turn to how we&rsquo;ve deployed this focus on core foundations, the system as a whole, and collaboration and communication to meet challenges in four key areas. I&rsquo;ll address how we&rsquo;ve improved the resilience of the Treasury market; implemented an effective and targeted response so that the regional banking stress in 2023 did not derail our recovery; addressed the diverse risks posed by the evolving nonbank sector; and tackled cross-cutting risks. I&rsquo;ll also speak to our global work.</p>
<p><em>A. Treasury Market</em></p>
<p>Given where we are, I&rsquo;ll start with the Treasury market. As this audience knows well, the Treasury market carries out a range of critical functions. Treasury securities are used to finance our government at the lowest cost to the taxpayer and by the Federal Reserve to implement monetary policy. A strong Treasury market helps underpin the role of the dollar in global transactions. Treasuries are a major fixed-income asset for investors around the world and serve as collateral for a wide variety of transactions. They&rsquo;re also used as a reference benchmark for global asset prices.</p>
<p>So, since the start of this Administration, our focus on strong core foundations has led to wide-ranging work with other agencies and the private sector to strengthen the Treasury market so that it remains the deepest, most liquid market in the world. Even as there&rsquo;s always more to do, we&rsquo;ve made significant progress and documented it each year, publishing the latest report just last week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve supported transparency and enabled the government to better assess vulnerabilities by increasing the availability and quality of data on Treasury market activity. For example, just this year, we&rsquo;ve made more information on Treasury market trading activity available to the public. And we&rsquo;ll soon begin collecting transaction-level data in the non-centrally cleared bilateral repo market&mdash;likely the largest repo market segment in the U.S. and concerningly the one for which the least information has been available.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re helping bolster market liquidity through a new Treasury buyback program that provides regular opportunities for dealers to sell off-the-run Treasuries back to Treasury.&nbsp; Buybacks also strengthen Treasury&rsquo;s cash management&mdash;including to reduce borrowing costs over time.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve made progress in standardizing risk management through the SEC&rsquo;s adoption of a new rule to expand central clearing in the Treasury market. And we&rsquo;ve increased consistent regulatory oversight and enhanced investor protection with a rule clarifying when liquidity providers are required to register as dealers.</p>
<p><em>B. Banks</em></p>
<p>But as I laid out, our approach considers not just strong core foundations, but also the stability of the system as a whole and the need for strong communication and coordination. Our response to the regional banking stress in 2023 showcased how we&rsquo;re making good on all of these aspects.</p>
<p>A year and a half ago now, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank experienced runs that were particularly large and fast by historical standards. These banks had seen rapid deposit growth, especially in uninsured deposits, as well as significant unrealized losses on their securities portfolios. Their runs were followed by deposit outflows from other regional and mid-sized banks that were perceived to have similar weaknesses.</p>
<p>We knew we needed to mitigate what was a serious risk of contagion. So, we acted decisively. Regulators moved quickly to close the banks. After receiving recommendations from the Boards of the FDIC and the Fed and consulting with the President, I approved invoking the systemic risk exception during that first weekend. This enabled uninsured depositors at these banks to have access to their funds on Monday morning so that they could pay their employees and suppliers. And that same weekend, with my approval, the Fed established the Bank Term Funding Program to help limit broader contagion.</p>
<p>Our efforts were successful, building on the base of a banking system strengthened by the reforms following the Global Financial Crisis. We prevented contagion that could have destabilized the broader financial system and derailed our economic recovery. And we made sure that American taxpayers didn&rsquo;t bear the costs.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re well aware, however, that we need to address the core weaknesses these banking stresses revealed, and we urge moving forward on key next steps. We need greater supervisory attention on banks with less stable deposits, and we need regulations that account for unrealized losses on securities. We also need changes so that banks are better prepared for liquidity stress, such as making sure that they have diverse sources of contingency funding and especially that they have the capacity to borrow at the discount window and periodically test this capacity. This includes considering establishing collateral pre-positioning requirements to facilitate borrowing from the discount window, improving the discount window&rsquo;s operational capacity, and enhancing coordination between the discount window and the Federal Home Loan Banks. And we also need to support regulators&rsquo; efforts to strengthen long-term debt requirements for regional banks so that they can be more effectively resolved if they do fail.</p>
<p><em>C. Nonbanks</em></p>
<p>Our understanding of the need for a holistic approach has also driven work on nonbanks, which have become an increasingly important part of the U.S. financial system over the past few decades. Credit provided by U.S. nonbank intermediaries has been growing more quickly than bank credit and now exceeds on-balance sheet bank credit. This makes nonbanks an essential source of financing, with different segments of the sector supporting diverse activities, from trading to retail. And this also means we need to focus on their vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Making sure FSOC has the tools it needs has been at the heart of our work. Last November, the Council took a key step forward by issuing updated guidance that establishes a transparent and durable process for how the Council uses its authority to designate a nonbank financial company for Fed supervision and prudential standards. This strengthens the Council&rsquo;s ability to promote a resilient financial system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But designation remains only one of FSOC&rsquo;s statutory authorities, and the nonbank sector is heterogeneous and diverse, so we&rsquo;ve also pursued much broader work.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve made progress addressing investment funds with features that create financial vulnerabilities, such as through the SEC increasing liquidity requirements for money market mutual funds to reduce run risk. FSOC member agencies continue working to support better data collection and monitoring to identify risks from highly leveraged hedge funds and the growth in private credit. In other areas, like open-end funds, the SEC and industry should continue to explore potential options to address remaining vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also focused on the increase in market share of nonbank mortgage servicers, which perform critical functions like collecting payments. FSOC, using its new Analytic Framework, issued a report finding that stress in this sector could harm mortgage borrowers and disrupt economic activity. Its recommendations include encouraging state regulators to strengthen prudential standards and require resolution and recovery planning and calling for congressional action to establish a fund to facilitate continuity of servicing operations in the event of stress while avoiding taxpayer-funded bailouts.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also identified new vulnerabilities related to newer entrants like fintechs and technological changes, including vulnerabilities presented by the significant growth of digital assets and trading platforms. Our work included issuing a report on digital assets and one on stablecoins, both of which assessed risks and called for Congress to legislate to close regulatory gaps while supporting innovation.</p>
<p><em>D. Cross-Cutting Risks</em></p>
<p>And across banks and nonbanks, we have also been focused on what I&rsquo;ll refer to today as cross-cutting risks, including those related to cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and climate.</p>
<p>To combat cyber risks, we&rsquo;ve helped lead a multi-year effort in collaboration with the private sector to bolster the safe and effective use of cloud services. We worked with banks to launch a cybersecurity alliance called Project Fortress: a public-private partnership through which we&rsquo;re joining forces with financial institutions of different sizes to deploy defensive measures like a tool that scans for vulnerabilities and offensive measures like sanctions to hold perpetrators of cyber-related activities accountable. AI could provide an advantage, at least initially, to cyber threat actors, so we&rsquo;ve responded by providing a playbook for financial institutions on best practices for managing AI-specific cyber risks.</p>
<p>More broadly, we also see that AI technologies bring significant potential for efficiency and other benefits but also potential risks. We are working to monitor adoption, identify vulnerabilities, and assess whether existing regulations are sufficient to mitigate them or new ones are needed.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve focused on climate-related risks to financial stability as well. The Council&rsquo;s work to strengthen interagency coordination has been key, given gaps in data and fast-evolving risk-assessment methodologies. The Office of Financial Research launched a cutting-edge platform that provides regulators access to climate and financial data to support more research and analysis. And we&rsquo;re currently collaborating with state insurance regulators to collect data on the cost and availability of homeowners insurance at the zip-code level to help us better understand the risks to the financial system from increasingly severe and frequent climate-related disasters.</p>
<p><em>E. Global Work</em></p>
<p>Addressing cyber, AI technologies, climate and many other risks also requires applying another aspect of our approach: coordination and collaboration, including across jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Risks don&rsquo;t respect national borders. The largest financial firms operate in many countries, and cross-border investor flows are sizable. This means we need to coordinate and communicate regularly with our counterparts in other countries, and to engage through multilateral groups, like the G7, G20, and Financial Stability Board. We got a powerful reminder of the importance of strong international coordination, and especially the need for a well-functioning international framework for recovery and resolution, just last year with the failure of Credit Suisse.</p>
<p>So, we&rsquo;ve made it a key priority to work closely with other jurisdictions before, during, and after times of financial stress. We&rsquo;ve strengthened communication with counterparts in other jurisdictions, such as the EU, UK, and India, to understand each other&rsquo;s policies, clarify our intentions and expectations, and respond to crises.</p>
<p>And financial stability has also been a key focus of our efforts to build a healthy economic relationship with China. The Financial Working Group that Treasury launched and co-chairs with the People&rsquo;s Bank of China is now enabling regular and durable communication. And last month, we exchanged letters with the PBOC that strengthen information sharing and will make it easier to coordinate in times of financial stress.</p>
<h3><span>IV. Conclusion</span></h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ll end here today, having I hope given some indication of the breadth and depth of our recent and ongoing efforts.</p>
<p>Work to build and maintain a resilient financial system is never over. We&rsquo;ll never be able to just declare victory. And successes can be hard to fully appreciate because they often entail having avoided counterfactuals. But that does not make them any less significant.</p>
<p>We saw less than two decades ago how a financial crisis can turn the lives of millions of Americans upside down. And we saw only a year and a half ago that a government that keeps its eye on the ball can protect American businesses and households from financial contagion and its impacts.</p>
<p>I could not believe more strongly that we must keep at it. A resilient financial system is critical to a strong economy. And strengthening it requires insisting on thoughtful regulation, including in the face of challenges from those who advocate to roll back policies and regulations.</p>
<p>It has been an honor to contribute to this ever-changing, ever-important project throughout my career and over the past three and half years as Treasury Secretary. I am proud of where we are today, even as we remain committed to the work ahead.</p>

<div> Treasury, FinCEN, OFAC, Russian cybercrime, virtual currency exchange<br />
Summary:<br />
Treasury and international partners disrupt Russian cybercrime services, sanction virtual currency exchanges and individuals, combat illicit finance, and protect U.S. national security. <div>
<p>Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury is undertaking actions as part of a coordinated international effort to disrupt Russian cybercrime services. Treasury&rsquo;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is issuing an order that identifies PM2BTC&mdash;a Russian virtual currency exchanger associated with Russian individual Sergey Sergeevich Ivanov (Ivanov)&mdash;as being of &ldquo;primary money laundering concern&rdquo; in connection with Russian illicit finance. Concurrently, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is sanctioning Ivanov and Cryptex&mdash;a virtual currency exchange registered in St. Vincent and the Grenadines and operating in Russia. The FinCEN and OFAC actions are being issued in conjunction with actions by other U.S. government agencies and international law enforcement partners to hold accountable Ivanov and the associated virtual currency services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The United States and our international partners remain resolute in our commitment to prevent cybercrime facilitators like PM2BTC and Cryptex from operating with impunity,&rdquo; said Acting Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley T. Smith. &ldquo;Treasury, in close coordination with our allies and partners, will continue to use all tools and authorities to disrupt the networks that seek to leverage the virtual assets ecosystem to facilitate their illicit activities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Treasury&rsquo;s actions aim to protect&nbsp;U.S. national security and the integrity of the U.S. financial system by cutting off illicit financial institutions from the U.S. market. These actions exemplify how Treasury is leveraging international cooperation and all available tools to counter the ransomware threat and target Russian illicit financial activity.&nbsp;The United States has pressed the Russian government to take concrete steps to prevent cyber criminals from freely operating in its jurisdiction.</p>
<h3>A coordinated, international effort to combat russian illicit finance</h3>
<p>In coordination with OFAC and FinCEN&rsquo;s actions, other U.S. government agencies&nbsp;and foreign law enforcement partners are also taking related actions. The U.S. Secret Service&rsquo;s Cyber Investigative Section, the&nbsp;Netherlands Police, and the Dutch Fiscal Intelligence and Investigation Service (FIOD) have seized web domains and/or infrastructure associated with PM2BTC, UAPS, and Cryptex. The U.S. Department of State has issued a reward offer up to $10 million through its Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of Ivanov. Lastly,&nbsp;the U.S. Secret Service&nbsp;and the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia are unsealing an indictment of Ivanov and another Russian national, Timur Shakhmametov. These actions by U.S. and Dutch agencies were taken in partnership with&nbsp;<a class="external" href="https://www.operation-endgame.com/">Operation Endgame</a>, a multinational coordinated cyber operation with European partners, to dismantle financial enablers of transnational organized cybercrime.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<h3>PM2BTC: A primary money laundering concern</h3>
<p>FinCEN&rsquo;s order identifying the virtual currency exchange&nbsp;<span>PM2BTC</span>, a virtual currency exchanger associated with Ivanov, as being of &ldquo;primary money laundering concern&rdquo; in connection with Russian illicit finance is made pursuant to section 9714(a) of the Combating Russian Money Laundering Act (as amended). The order is effective immediately and prohibits certain transmittals of funds involving PM2BTC by any covered financial institution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As set out in the order, PM2BTC facilitates the laundering of convertible virtual currency (CVC) associated with ransomware and other illicit actors operating in Russia. PM2BTC provides direct CVC-to-ruble exchange services using U.S.-sanctioned financial institutions, otherwise facilitates sanctions evasion, and has failed to maintain a credible and effective anti-money laundering and know your customer (KYC) program. FinCEN found that nearly half of PM2BTC&rsquo;s exchange activity had links to illicit activity, and correspondingly, that PM2BTC facilitates a substantially greater proportion of transactions with apparent links to money laundering activity in connection with Russian illicit finance as compared to 99 percent of other virtual asset service providers. FinCEN also determined that PM2BTC employs an unusual obfuscation that inhibits attribution of transactions to illicit activity and actors. The same technique has notably been used by several virtual currency exchanges of concern, some of which are sanctioned by OFAC.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fincen.gov/resources/statutes-regulations/federal-register-notices/imposition-special-measure-prohibiting-0">The text of FinCEN&rsquo;s order can be found here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Cryptex And Ivanov: russian facilitators of cybercrime</h3>
<p><span>Cryptex</span>&nbsp;is a virtual currency exchange registered in St. Vincent and the Grenadines under the name &ldquo;International Payment Service Provider&rdquo; that provides financial services to cybercriminals and is operating in the financial services sector of the Russian Federation economy. Cryptex advertises its virtual currency services in Russian and has received over $51.2&nbsp;million in funds derived from ransomware attacks. Cryptex is also associated with over $720&nbsp;million in transactions to services frequently used by Russia-based ransomware actors and cybercriminals, including fraud shops, mixing services, exchanges lacking KYC programs, and OFAC-designated virtual currency exchange Garantex. OFAC is designating Cryptex pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.)&nbsp;13694, as amended by E.O.&nbsp;13757 (&ldquo;E.O.&nbsp;13694, as amended&rdquo;), for being responsible for or complicit in, or for having engaged in, directly or indirectly, a cyber-enabled activity identified pursuant to E.O.&nbsp;13694, as amended, and pursuant to E.O.&nbsp;14024 for operating or having operated in the financial services sector of the Russian Federation economy.</p>
<p><span>Sergey Sergeevich Ivanov</span>&nbsp;is an alleged Russian money launderer, who has laundered hundreds of millions of dollars&rsquo; worth of virtual currency for ransomware actors, initial access brokers, darknet marketplace vendors, and other criminal actors for approximately the last 20 years. Through various payment processing services, including one that does business under the name &ldquo;UAPS,&rdquo; Ivanov has served as the payment processor for various fraud shops, including OFAC-designated Genesis Market, whose website was taken down by law enforcement in&nbsp;2023. Ivanov is currently associated with Cryptex. OFAC is designating Ivanov pursuant to E.O.&nbsp;14024 for operating or having operated in the financial services sector of the Russian Federation economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>OFAC&rsquo;s designations follow several recent U.S. Treasury actions to combat Russia-based cyber criminals and further illustrates that Russia continues to offer safe harbor to such actors. These include the&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2473">July&nbsp;19,&nbsp;2024 designation</a>&nbsp;of two members of the Russian hacktivist group Cyber Army of Russia Reborn; the&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2326">May&nbsp;7,&nbsp;2024 designation</a>&nbsp;of Dmitry Khoroshev, also known as LockBitSupp, who is a leader of the LockBit ransomware group; and the&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2114">February&nbsp;20,&nbsp;2024 designation</a>&nbsp;of LockBit affiliates Ivan Kondratiev and Artur Sungatov. The individual and entity designated today facilitated transactions worth hundreds of millions of dollars for cybercriminals and cybercrime services, including ransomware actors and OFAC-designated darknet market Genesis Market.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>SANCTIONS IMPLICATIONS</h3>
<p>As a result of today&rsquo;s action by OFAC, all property and interests in property of the designated persons described above that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC. In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. Unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt, OFAC&rsquo;s regulations generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Financial institutions and other persons that engage in certain transactions or activities with the sanctioned entities and individuals may expose themselves to sanctions or be subject to an enforcement action. The prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any designated person, or the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person. Foreign financial institutions that conduct or facilitate significant transactions or provide any service involving Russia&rsquo;s military-industrial base run the risk of being sanctioned by OFAC. For additional guidance, please see the updated OFAC advisory, &ldquo;<a href="https://ofac.treasury.gov/media/932436/download?inline">Updated Guidance for Foreign Financial Institutions on OFAC Sanctions Authorities Targeting Support to Russia&rsquo;s Military-Industrial Base</a>,&rdquo; as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://ofac.treasury.gov/faqs/topic/6626">OFAC Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1146-1157</a>.</p>
<p>The power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC&rsquo;s ability to designate and add persons to the SDN List, but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law. The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior.&nbsp;</p>

<div> Treasury market, liquidity regulations, discount window, Federal Reserve facilities, monetary policy <br />
Summary:<br />The article discusses the Federal Reserve's efforts to enhance the resilience of the Treasury market through liquidity regulations, incorporating the discount window, and adjustments to banking stress. <div>
<p>Thank you, and thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20240926a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>It is great to be here again, particularly because this year marks the 10th annual conference on the Treasury market, a milestone that is worth celebrating. I want to acknowledge the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for its leadership in this area, including the dedication and excellence it has brought to hosting this conference over the past decade, in collaboration with the Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance, led by the Treasury Department. The Treasury market is the means by which our government meets its financing needs in service to the American people, and it is also the bedrock of the financial system. Promoting the resilience of the Treasury market and ensuring it can continue to fulfill these roles requires the collaboration of agencies and individuals across the government along with the private sector.</p>
<p>As others have pointed out today, we have made important progress since last year's conference. The Securities and Exchange Commission has finalized a rule on central clearing of Treasury transactions, the Treasury Department has instituted a program for buying back less-liquid Treasury securities, and the Office of Financial Research is preparing for its permanent collection of data on non-centrally-cleared bilateral repurchase agreement (repo) transactions, which will support our understanding of this market segment as it evolves.</p>
<p>I will share some thoughts with you on how I see the work of the Federal Reserve in supporting Treasury market resilience. Our capital and liquidity regulations, our supervision of the firms over which we have authority, and our liquidity facilities play important roles in supporting market resilience and financial stability. Earlier this month, I gave a speech where I reiterated the crucial role of capital in serving these objectives, and the need to balance resilience and efficiency in designing our rules. In that speech, I also outlined the elements of a capital re-proposal that I believe will have broad consensus at the Federal Reserve Board. The adjustments are in response to a robust public comment process, and some of them are designed to address interactions and market functioning concerns raised by commentators.</p>
<p>In terms of rulemaking, today I will focus on some additional aspects of our regulatory framework&mdash;namely, enhancements to our liquidity regulations. I will share some perspective on how our liquidity regulations work together and are supportive of market functioning and the smooth implementation of monetary policy.</p>
<p><strong>The Intersection of Monetary Policy Tools and Supervision and Regulation</strong><br />We consider how all of the Fed's tools work together to support our objectives. In previous speeches, I have talked about the role of the discount window and the standing repo facility (SRF) in supporting both monetary policy implementation and financial stability, noting how important it is that eligible institutions be ready to use these facilities.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20240926a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;Today I want to dig into this topic a bit more, including how these tools support monetary policy implementation through appropriate incorporation into liquidity regulations and supervisory practices.</p>
<p>After the banking stress in March 2023, we saw a substantial improvement among banks of all sizes in their level of readiness to tap the discount window both in taking the necessary steps for set-up and in their pledging of collateral. Since that time, over $1 trillion in additional collateral has been pledged to the discount window, and additional banks have established access to the SRF. Both of these facilities are potential venues for monetizing assets and raising liquidity to address volatility in private funding market rates or gaps in the availability of private-market funding.</p>
<p>We had been hearing that some were confused about how banks could incorporate ready access to the discount window and the SRF into their contingency funding plans and internal liquidity stress tests. Supervisors have a role in assessing the viability of large banks' plans to meet stressed outflows in their stress scenarios, and we have been asked whether the discount window, the SRF, and also Federal Home Loan Bank advances can play a role in those scenarios. The answer to this question is "yes."</p>
<p>We provided clarity to the public in August on permissible assumptions for how firms can incorporate the discount window and the SRF into their internal liquidity stress-test scenarios. There are a couple of principles that underlie our response in the frequently asked questions we posted on the Board's website.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20240926a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;One principle is that our tools are readily available to firms. This means that we see it as acceptable and beneficial for firms to incorporate our facilities to meet liquidity needs in both planning and practice. If firms plan to use our facilities, we expect them to demonstrate ex ante that they are fully capable of doing so, including through test transactions. An additional principle underlying our approach is that, while firms should be ready to use a range of funding sources, firms need to hold sufficient highly liquid assets to meet their potential liquidity needs. That is, they need to self-insure against their own liquidity risks. A third principle is that firms should be ready and able to use private channels to turn these assets into cash, in addition to any public channels they may plan to use.</p>
<p>I want to dig a bit deeper into the benefits to both individual firms and the financial system when firms incorporate Fed facilities into their stress preparedness planning. Again, a design feature of our liquidity regulations is that large banks must&nbsp;<em>self-insure</em>&nbsp;against<em>&nbsp;</em>major liquidity risks. Our regulations also provide flexibility in terms of the portfolio composition such banks use to do so. This flexibility allows them to adjust their portfolios based on market conditions and firm needs. A key component of this flexibility is that reserves and certain high-quality liquid assets (HQLA), such as Treasury securities, are equivalent in terms of being treated as the highest quality of liquid assets. This feature is important because, while it allows firms to manage their liquidity buffers more flexibly, it also allows for greater flexibility in our monetary policy implementation and it supports market functioning. We have heard over the years, however, that the degree of substitutability among these assets has been limited by concerns about capacity in stress for the market to turn securities into reserves immediately; these concerns are valid. This constraint can be addressed in part by the appropriate incorporation of Federal Reserve facilities into monetization plans in firms' internal liquidity stress tests.</p>
<p>When firms understand that they will not be fully constrained by the capacity of private markets or their individual credit lines to monetize HQLA immediately in stress, they can reduce their demand for reserves in favor of Treasury securities, all else being equal, for their stress planning purposes. This dynamic improves the substitutability of holding reserves and holding Treasury securities either outright or through repo transactions.</p>
<p>When banks exhibit a high degree of substitutability of demand for these assets, money market functioning improves. Let me explain with an example. If a bank sees holding reserves and investing in Treasury repo as near substitutes in its liquidity portfolio, it should lend into Treasury repo markets when repo rates rise above the interest rate earned on reserves. When banks can nimbly adjust portfolios in response to price incentives, the efficiency of reserves redistribution through the system improves, and market functioning is enhanced.</p>
<p>In aggregate, this activity can prevent rates from rising further, all else being equal. The point at which banks, in aggregate, have a relatively immutable demand for reserves, and are unwilling to lend them out, is evident when a small decrease in the supply of reserves results in a sharp increase in the cost to borrow them. Our monetary policy tools are well positioned to help us avoid this outcome. But, of course, greater willingness of banks to reallocate across close substitutes should help avoid the emergence of sudden pressures in money markets by reducing money market frictions.</p>
<p>In 2021, the Federal Reserve launched the SRF, which, along with the discount window, should help cap upward pressure in repo markets that could spill over into the federal funds market. Use of these facilities also increases the supply of reserves in the system. The enhanced clarity for firms that Fed facilities are a fully acceptable venue to get same-day liquidity for their HQLA should help reassure firms about holding reserves and their close substitutes, such as Treasury securities, in their liquidity portfolios.</p>
<p>Of course, as I stated earlier, for the largest banks, there is a requirement that they hold highly liquid assets to address their own liquidity risks. They must also be ready to use private markets to monetize these assets. It is also critical that banks recognize and manage the interest rate and liquidity risk of their securities portfolios to ensure those securities held for liquidity purposes can be monetized in stress without creating other adverse effects on a firm's safety and soundness. In 2022 and 2023, certain large banks did not effectively manage the risks of rising rates, and suffered significant fair value losses on their securities holdings, including those in held-to-maturity (HTM) portfolios. These losses affected their ability to respond to liquidity stress, as monetizing the assets could result in realizing losses. When the banking stress hit in March 2023, these securities could not be sold to meet stressed outflows because large unrealized losses inhibited their sale without significant capital implications. This is further complicated in the case of HTM securities, which cannot be sold without risking revaluing a firm's entire HTM portfolio. Selling HTM securities to generate liquidity would therefore have had a particularly large effect on these firms' capital levels, likely increasing the stress on these firms. Further, some firms were unable to rely on private channels such as repo markets for monetization because they were not prepared, they were not regular participants in the market, and market participants were unwilling to lend because of counterparty credit concerns. This combination of factors meant that HTM securities that had been identified by banks as available to serve as a liquidity buffer of assets in stress could not effectively serve that function.</p>
<p><strong>Improvements to Our Liquidity Regulations</strong><br />As I have mentioned in previous speeches, to address the lessons about liquidity learned in the spring of 2023, we are exploring targeted adjustments to our current liquidity framework.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20240926a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;Many firms have taken steps to improve their liquidity resilience, and the regulatory adjustments we are considering would ensure that large banks maintain better liquidity risk&ndash;management practices going forward. Improvements to our liquidity regulations will also complement the other components of our supervisory and regulatory regime by improving banks' ability to respond to funding shocks.</p>
<p>Specifically, we are exploring a requirement that larger banks maintain a minimum amount of readily available liquidity with a pool of reserves and pre-positioned collateral at the discount window, based on a fraction of their uninsured deposits. Community banks would not be covered, and we would take a tiered approach to the requirements. The collateral pre-positioned at the window could include both Treasury securities and the full range of assets eligible for pledging at the discount window. It is vital that uninsured depositors have confidence that their funds will be readily available for withdrawal, if needed, and this confidence would be enhanced by a requirement that larger banks have readily available liquidity to meet requests for withdrawal of these deposits. This requirement would be a complement to existing liquidity regulations such as those that require the internal liquidity stress tests (ILST) I described earlier as well as meeting the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR).<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20240926a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a></p>
<p>Incorporating the discount window into a readiness requirement would also reemphasize that supervisors and examiners view use of the discount window as appropriate under both normal and stressed market conditions.</p>
<p>In addition, as I have discussed previously, we identified significant gaps in interest rate risk management in the March 2023 banking stress, including in portfolios of highly liquid securities. Relatedly, we saw that banks faced constraints in monetizing HTM assets with large unrealized losses in private markets because they were unable to repo these securities or sell these securities without realizing significant losses. To address these gaps, we are considering a partial limit on the extent of reliance on HTM assets in larger banks' liquidity buffers, such as those held under the LCR and ILST requirements. These adjustments would address the known challenges of banks being able to use these assets in stress conditions.</p>
<p>Finally, we are reviewing the treatment of a handful of types of deposits in the current liquidity framework. Observed behavior of different deposit types during times of stress suggests the need to recalibrate deposit outflow assumptions in our rules for certain types of depositors. We are also revisiting the scope of application of our current liquidity framework for large banks.</p>
<p>These enhancements to our liquidity regulations will help bolster firms' ability to manage liquidity shocks, and they will also be well integrated with our monetary policy tools and framework.</p>
<p><strong>Modernizing Our Tools to Meet Current and Future Needs</strong><br />Turning back to the discount window, I also want to note that the discount window has served its role well in recent years, and that we are also engaging in ongoing work to improve its operations. Given the crucial role of the discount window in providing ready access to liquidity in a wide variety of market conditions, we continuously work to assess and improve its functionality while engaging with current and potential users of the window.</p>
<p>Among the steps we have taken recently include that we now have an online portal, Discount Window Direct, that allows firms to request and prepay discount window loans in a more streamlined manner than was previously possible. We also recently published a request for information on discount window operations and daylight credit asking about key components of these functions. Feedback from the public will help us prioritize areas for improvement, so I strongly encourage anyone with an interest in this topic to weigh in during the comment period. Your feedback will help us ensure that the discount window continues to improve in its role of providing ready access to funding under a variety of market conditions.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p><a name="fn5"></a>5. The LCR and ILST are two separate, but complementary, liquidity requirements. The LCR is a standardized liquidity measure across banks, meaning the outflow assumptions are the same for each bank. The ILST is a nonstandardized liquidity measure across banks, meaning each bank determines its own outflow assumptions, subject to supervisory input.&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Trading Technologies International, Inc. (TT), a global capital markets technology platform provider, announced that it won two major categories at the FOW Asia Pacific Awards 2024. The firm received the award for Technology Vendor of the Year while its TT platform earned the honor of Trading System of the Year at a ceremony yesterday in&nbsp;</span><span class="xn-location">Singapore</span><span>.</span></p>
<p>Hosted by Futures &amp; Options World (FOW), the awards are designed to recognize the "best and brightest innovations in the derivatives industry," and the winners in the two categories were decided by a specialist panel of experts from across the&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Asia-Pacific</span>&nbsp;(APAC) region. TT's&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Alice Pocklington</span>, EVP Head of APAC, and&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Alun Green</span>, EVP Managing Director, Futures &amp; Options, accepted the awards on behalf of the firm at the ceremony following FOW's Trading Singapore conference.</p>
<p>Last September, at the predecessor awards for the region &ndash; the FOW Asia Capital Markets Awards 2023 &ndash; and at the FOW International Awards in November, the TT platform was named Derivatives Trading System of the Year.</p>
<p>Judges selecting TT as the winner in the two categories cited a number of reasons for the two wins, including: "With multiple acquisitions such as RCM-X and&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Abel Noser</span>, TT continues to innovate and provide key solutions to market participants by integration." Another said: "TT has strived over the past two years to peel back and start on its journey to be the global vendor of choice&hellip;. I feel that they have achieved a lot of what they have set out to do and continue to provide that world-class access to their customers." And a third remarked: "The TT platform remains the most widely used globally for futures/futures options trading with new features and services being added with the recent acquisitions."</p>
<p>TT CEO&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Keith Todd</span>&nbsp;said: "APAC continues to represent an important part of our growth strategy, as we've further expanded our presence, captured more business in the region and made these markets accessible to our clients around the world, which include the leading institutions in APAC and globally. As we expand further into new asset classes, we expect this regional growth to accelerate even further, with increased use of the TT platform for cross-asset strategies and functionality."</p>
<p>In July, TT won Best Execution Management System (EMS) Provider and Best Algorithmic Trading Provider at the Waters Rankings, voted on by thousands of end users across the buy and sell sides. Also this year, the firm won the European Markets Choice Award for Best Listed Derivatives Execution/Order Management System (E/OMS) from Markets Media, Best Algo Trading Solution in the WatersTechnology Asia Awards, and Best Listed Derivatives Trading solution in both the TradingTech Insight&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">USA</span>&nbsp;and TradingTech Insight Europe Awards.</p>
<p>TT, which has already handled more than 2.5 billion transactions in 2024, offers connectivity to a growing array of more than 100 global exchanges and venues across multiple asset classes &ndash; including 20 in APAC &ndash; along with significant new functionality added through innovations, strategic partnerships and acquisitions. Its presence in the&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Asia-Pacific</span>&nbsp;region dates back to 2003, when the company opened an office in&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Sydney</span>. Since that time, TT's footprint has grown to also include offices in&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Singapore</span>,&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Tokyo</span>,&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Hong Kong</span>,&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Pune</span>&nbsp;and Ahmedabad. The firm last year opened its newest data center in&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Taipei</span>, adding to&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Singapore</span>,&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Hong Kong</span>,&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Tokyo</span>,&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Bangkok</span>,&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Seoul</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Sydney</span>. Over the last three years in APAC, TT has seen platform participation rise more than 600% and volume growth exceed 1,000%.</p>

<div> Annual U.S. Treasury Market Conference, Interagency Working Group, Treasury market, liquidity, electronic trading<br />
Summary: The 10th Annual U.S. Treasury Market Conference reflects on the changes in the market, discusses the 2015 flash crash, and emphasizes the importance of cooperation and communication.<br /> <div>
<p>Hello, everyone, and welcome to the 10th Annual U.S. Treasury Market Conference. "Tenth annual" is a phrase that generates a bit of surprise, and much pride. It is surprising because it does not seem like the first of these gatherings, which I was honored to play a role in organizing, was all that long ago. But the time passed also is something we can take pride in because the conference has persevered for so many years, and I hope will for many more to come.</p>
<p>Much has changed in the economy since we first gathered in 2015&mdash;but the need for discussing and studying the U.S. Treasury market has not. As you all know, this market is the deepest and most liquid in the world. In addition to meeting the financing needs of the federal government, it plays a critical role in the efficient implementation of monetary policy.</p>
<p>What happened in Treasury markets 10 years ago next month and the subsequent publication of the Interagency Working Group report on those events are what brought us together for the first Annual U.S. Treasury Market Conference.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20240926a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;That "flash crash" was a wakeup call because we had never seen such a large swing in Treasury prices in such a short period of time. The Interagency Working Group report helped us understand how much the structure of the Treasury market had changed and how large a role high-speed, electronic trading firms were playing in it. It also underscored the value of cooperation and communication between the five agencies in the working group, something that proved again to be vital during the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>I am pleased to see that all working group members are represented here today. You will be hearing directly from many senior leaders, including your host, President Williams; Vice Chair Barr; and Secretary Yellen, who, of course, was Fed chair at the time of the first conference.</p>
<p>As I noted when I spoke at this event in 2015, our nation's entire financial framework has been built around the ability to quickly and efficiently transform Treasury securities into cash liquidity. I said then that "these markets need to keep functioning at a high level, and we all have a stake in making sure that they do." I remain wholly dedicated to that goal.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20240926a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a></p>
<p>I wish you a productive and educational conference. I am sorry I am unable to join you in person. The conversations you will have today are important, and I hope we will keep having them. As evidenced by the decade of dedication to this event, I am sure we will.</p>

<div> inflation, monetary policy, FOMC meeting, economic conditions, labor market
Summary: The speech discusses the recent FOMC meeting, the current state of the U.S. economy, the outlook, and the speaker's preference for a more measured approach to monetary policy. <div>
<p>Good morning. I would like to thank the Mid-Size Bank Coalition of America for the invitation to join you today for the Board of Directors Workshop.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240926a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;I appreciate the opportunity to share my views on the U.S. economy and monetary policy before we engage on bank supervisory and regulatory issues and other matters affecting the banking industry.</p>
<p>In light of last week's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, I will begin my remarks by providing some perspective on my vote and will then share my current views on the economy and monetary policy.</p>
<p><strong>Update on the Most Recent FOMC Meeting</strong><br />In order to address high inflation, for more than two years, the FOMC increased and held the federal funds rate at a restrictive level. At our September meeting, the FOMC voted to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point to 4-3/4 to 5 percent and to continue reducing the Federal Reserve's securities holdings.</p>
<p>As the post-meeting statement noted, I dissented from the FOMC's decision, preferring instead to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 5 to 5‑1/4 percent. Last Friday, once our FOMC participant communications blackout period concluded, the Board of Governors released my statement explaining the decision to depart from the majority of the voting members. I agreed with the Committee's assessment that, given the progress we have seen since the middle of 2023 on both lowering inflation and cooling the labor market, it was appropriate to reflect this progress by recalibrating the level of the federal funds rate and begin the process of moving toward a more neutral stance of policy. As my statement notes, I preferred a smaller initial cut in the policy rate while the U.S. economy remains strong and inflation remains a concern, despite recent progress.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Conditions and Outlook</strong><br />In recent months, we have seen some further progress on slowing the pace of inflation, with monthly readings lower than the elevated pace seen in the first three months of the year. The 12-month measure of core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation, which provides a broader perspective than the more volatile higher-frequency readings, has moved down since April, although it came in at 2.6 percent in July, again remaining well above our 2 percent goal. In addition, the latest consumer and producer price index reports suggest that 12‑month core PCE inflation in August was likely a touch above the July reading. The persistently high core inflation largely reflects pressures on housing prices, perhaps due in part to low inventories of affordable housing. The progress in lowering inflation since April is a welcome development, but core inflation is still uncomfortably above the Committee's 2 percent goal.</p>
<p>Prices remain much higher than before the pandemic, which continues to weigh on consumer sentiment. Higher prices have an outsized effect on lower- and moderate-income households, as these households devote a significantly larger share of income to food, energy, and housing. Prices for these spending categories have far outpaced overall inflation over the past few years.</p>
<p>Economic growth moderated earlier this year after coming in stronger last year. Private domestic final purchases (PDFP) growth has been solid and slowed much less than gross domestic product (GDP), as the slowdown in GDP growth was partly driven by volatile categories including net exports, suggesting that underlying economic growth was stronger than GDP indicated. PDFP has continued to increase at a solid pace so far in the third quarter, despite some further weakening in housing activity, as retail sales have shown further robust gains in July and August.</p>
<p>Although personal consumption has remained resilient, consumers appear to be pulling back on discretionary items and expenses, as evidenced in part by a decline in restaurant spending since late last year. Low- and moderate-income consumers no longer have extra savings to support this type of spending, and we have seen loan delinquency rates normalize from historically low levels during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The most recent labor market report shows that payroll employment gains have slowed appreciably to a pace moderately above 100,000 per month over the three months ending in August. The unemployment rate edged down to 4.2 percent in August from 4.3 percent in July. While unemployment is notably higher than a year ago, it is still at a historically low level and below my and the Congressional Budget Office's estimates of full employment.</p>
<p>The labor market has loosened from the extremely tight conditions of the past few years. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has declined further to a touch below the historically elevated pre-pandemic level&mdash;a sign that the number of available workers and the number of available jobs have come into better balance. But there are still more available jobs than available workers, a condition that before 2018 has only occurred twice for a prolonged period since World War II, further signaling ongoing labor market strength despite the reported data.</p>
<p>Although wage growth has slowed further in recent months, it remains indicative of a tight labor market. At just under 4 percent, as measured by both the employment cost index and average hourly earnings, wage gains are still above the pace consistent with our inflation goal given trend productivity growth.</p>
<p>The rise in the unemployment rate this year largely reflects weaker hiring, as job seekers entering or re-entering the labor force are taking longer to find work, while layoffs remain low. In addition to some cooling in labor demand, there are other factors likely contributing the increased unemployment. A mismatch between the skills of the new workers and available jobs could further raise unemployment, suggesting that higher unemployment has been partly driven by the stronger supply of workers. It is also likely that some temporary factors contributed to the recent rise in the unemployment rate, as unemployment among working age teenagers sharply increased in August.</p>
<p><strong>Preference for a More Measured Recalibration of Policy</strong><br />The U.S. economy remains strong and core inflation remains uncomfortably above our 2 percent target. In light of these economic conditions, a few further considerations supported the case for a more measured approach in beginning the process to recalibrate our policy stance to remove restriction and move toward a more neutral setting.</p>
<p>First, I was concerned that reducing the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point could be interpreted as a signal that the Committee sees some fragility or greater downside risks to the economy. In the current economic environment, with no clear signs of material weakening or fragility, in my view, beginning the rate-cutting cycle with a 1/4 percentage point move would have better reinforced the strength in economic conditions, while also confidently recognizing progress toward our goals. In my mind, a more measured approach would have avoided the risk of unintentionally signaling concerns about underlying economic conditions.</p>
<p>Second, I was also concerned that reducing the policy rate by 1/2 percentage point could have led market participants to expect that the Committee would lower the target range by that same pace at future meetings until the policy rate approaches a neutral level. If this expectation had materialized, we could have seen an unwarranted decline in longer-term interest rates and broader financial conditions could become overly accommodative. This outcome could work against the Committee's goal of returning inflation to our 2 percent target.</p>
<p>I am pleased that Chair Powell directly addressed both of these concerns during the press conference following last week's FOMC meeting.</p>
<p>Third, there continues to be a considerable amount of pent-up demand and cash on the sidelines ready to be deployed as the path of interest rates moves down. Bringing the policy rate down too quickly carries the risk of unleashing that pent-up demand. A more measured approach would also avoid unnecessarily stoking demand and potentially reigniting inflationary pressures.</p>
<p>Finally, in dialing back our restrictive stance of policy, we also need to be mindful of what the end point is likely to be. My estimate of the neutral rate is much higher than it was before the pandemic. Therefore, I think we are much closer to neutral than would have been the case under pre-pandemic conditions, and I did not see the peak stance of policy as restrictive to the same extent that my colleagues may have. With a higher estimate of neutral, for any given pace of rate reductions, we would arrive at our destination sooner.</p>
<p><strong>Ongoing Risks to the Outlook</strong><br />Turning to the risks to achieving our dual mandate, I continue to see greater risks to price stability, especially while the labor market continues to be near estimates of full employment. Although the labor market data have been showing signs of cooling in recent months, still-elevated wage growth, solid consumer spending, and resilient GDP growth are not consistent with a material economic weakening or fragility. My contacts also continue to mention that they are not planning layoffs and continue to have difficulty hiring. Therefore, I am taking less signal from the recent labor market data until there are clear trends indicating that both spending growth and the labor market have materially weakened. I suspect the recent immigration flows have and will continue to affect labor markets in ways that we do not yet fully understand and cannot yet accurately measure. In light of the dissonance created by conflicting economic signals, measurement challenges, and data revisions, I remain cautious about taking signal from only a limited set of real-time data releases.</p>
<p>In my view, the upside risks to inflation remain prominent. Global supply chains continue to be susceptible to labor strikes and increased geopolitical tensions, which could result in inflationary effects on food, energy, and other commodity markets. Expansionary fiscal spending could also lead to inflationary risks, as could an increased demand for housing given the long-standing limited supply, especially of affordable housing. While it has not been my baseline outlook, I cannot rule out the risk that progress on inflation could continue to stall.</p>
<p>Although it is important to recognize that there has been meaningful progress on lowering inflation, while core inflation remains around or above 2.5 percent, I see the risk that the Committee's larger policy action could be interpreted as a premature declaration of victory on our price-stability mandate. Accomplishing our mission of returning to low and stable inflation at our 2 percent goal is necessary to foster a strong labor market and an economy that works for everyone in the longer term.</p>
<p>In light of these considerations, I believe that, by moving at a measured pace toward a more neutral policy stance, we will be better positioned to achieve further progress in bringing inflation down to our 2 percent target, while closely watching the evolution of labor market conditions.</p>
<p><strong>The Path Forward</strong><br />Despite my dissent at the recent FOMC meeting, I respect and appreciate that my FOMC colleagues preferred to begin the reduction in the federal funds rate with a larger initial cut in the target range for the policy rate. I remain committed to working together with my colleagues to ensure that monetary policy is appropriately positioned to achieve our goals of attaining maximum employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent target.</p>
<p>I will continue to monitor the incoming data and information as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy, and I will remain cautious in my approach to adjusting the stance of policy going forward. It is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. My colleagues and I will make our decisions at each FOMC meeting based on the incoming data and the implications for and risks to the outlook guided by the Fed's dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. We need to ensure that the public understands clearly how current and expected deviations of inflation and employment from our mandated goals inform our policy decisions.</p>
<p>By the time of our next meeting in November, we will have received updated reports on inflation, employment, and economic activity. We may also have a better understanding of how developments in longer-term interest rates and broader financial conditions might influence the economic outlook.</p>
<p>During the intermeeting period, I will continue to visit with a broad range of contacts to discuss economic conditions as I assess the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance. As I noted earlier, I continue to view inflation as a concern. In light of the upside risks that I just described, it remains necessary to pay close attention to the price-stability side of our mandate while being attentive to the risks of a material weakening in the labor market. My view continues to be that restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment over the longer run. However, should the data evolve in a way that points to a material weakening in the labor market, I would support taking action and adjust monetary policy as needed while taking into account our inflation mandate.</p>
<p><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong><br />In closing, thank you again for welcoming me here today. It is a pleasure to join you and to have the opportunity to discuss my views on the economy and monetary policy. And given the recent FOMC meeting decision and my dissent, I appreciate being able to provide a more detailed explanation of the reasoning that led me to dissent in favor of a smaller reduction in the policy rate at last week's FOMC meeting.</p>
<p>I look forward to answering your questions and to engaging with your members on bank regulatory and supervisory matters.</p>

<h2>Speech</h2>
<p>There have been two big events relating to competitiveness in recent months. One of them was a series of sporting gatherings in Paris over the summer that some of you may have been following; but today I want to talk about the other, more important, one - which is the first anniversary of the PRA&rsquo;s Secondary Competitiveness and Growth Objective (SCGO)<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/september/shoib-khan-speech-at-the-29th-bank-of-america-financials-ceo-conference#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The SCGO sits alongside the PRA&rsquo;s existing secondary competition objective. It was introduced last year by Parliament and requires the PRA to discharge its general functions to advance its primary objectives, in a way that facilitates international competitiveness and growth of the UK economy - as far as reasonably possible and subject to alignment with international standards. Today I will focus on some of the initiatives we are taking in our oversight of the UK insurance sector to deliver on this new objective.</p>
<p>We aspire to facilitate the UK&rsquo;s international competitiveness and advancing the SCGO through three regulatory foundations: (i) Maintaining trust in the UK prudential framework; (ii) Adopting effective regulatory processes and engagement; and (iii) Taking a responsive approach to UK risks, opportunities, and innovation. These, in turn, can enable insurers to allocate capital more efficiently, compete in international markets; and attract investment to the UK.</p>
<h3>The UK Insurance sector</h3>
<p>We&rsquo;re all aware of the significance of the UK insurance sector and the vital role it plays in the UK economy, serving households and businesses. It is the third largest market for insurance and long-term savings in the world and the largest in Europe<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/september/shoib-khan-speech-at-the-29th-bank-of-america-financials-ceo-conference#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[2]</a></sup>, contributing &pound;36 billion to the UK economy<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/september/shoib-khan-speech-at-the-29th-bank-of-america-financials-ceo-conference#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[3]</a></sup>&nbsp;and employing over 300,000<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/september/shoib-khan-speech-at-the-29th-bank-of-america-financials-ceo-conference#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[4]</a></sup>&nbsp;people. The wealth of insurance expertise in the UK underpins the attractiveness of the UK to international insurers and the ability of UK insurers to compete overseas.</p>
<p>The SCGO codifies the PRA&rsquo;s approach to supporting the UK&rsquo;s status as a global insurance market. We think that when you transact in the UK, our robust legal and regulatory framework mean that policyholders should be confident that they can enforce their claims, and that insurers will have the means to pay. And that&rsquo;s why the SCGO supplements our primary objectives of safety and soundness and policyholder protection.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the SCGO applies when we exercise our general functions - in other words our policymaking and supervisory approach. It does&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;apply to individual firm decisions. That being said, as we evolve our approach and respond to innovation, we will take into account what firms tell us about how we are impacting competitiveness and growth.</p>
<h3>A differentiated Supervisory Approach for Insurers</h3>
<p>The PRA is clear that innovation and efficiency are key features of the attractiveness of the UK&rsquo;s insurance sector; and that requires a robust but proportionate regulatory approach to support it.</p>
<p>One way in which we do this is by taking a differentiated supervisory approach<em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</em>clearly between banks and insurers, but also for the different segments within insurance - namely life insurance, general insurance, the London Market, and branches of overseas insurers - informed by their varying levels of risk to our objectives.</p>
<h3><a id="_Hlk173767165"></a><a id="_Hlk174434263"></a>Life insurers</h3>
<p>Higher interest rates have led to a significant increase in demand for Bulk Purchase Annuities (BPA) as defined benefit schemes in surplus seek to de-risk.&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk175740893"></a>UK Life insurers wrote a record-breaking &pound;50 billion<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/september/shoib-khan-speech-at-the-29th-bank-of-america-financials-ceo-conference#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[5]</a></sup>&nbsp;of BPA business in 2023, and some analysts estimate that&nbsp;<em>c</em>.&pound;400&ndash;600 billion<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/september/shoib-khan-speech-at-the-29th-bank-of-america-financials-ceo-conference#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[6]</a></sup>&nbsp;of liabilities may be transferred to UK life insurers through BPA deals over the next decade.</p>
<p>So how can more BPA business support competitiveness and growth? Firstly, annuity providers are well-placed to support growth in the UK economy through their investment strategy. Second, transferring pension liabilities to insurers can enable corporates to focus on their core business to the benefit of the economy.</p>
<p>The PRA has recently made policy changes that are particularly relevant to the BPA market, and any PRA insurance speech would be incomplete without a reference to the regulatory reforms undertaken as part of &lsquo;Solvency UK&rsquo;. Moreover, to discuss life insurance without mentioning the Matching Adjustment (MA) would be regulatory sacrilege! These reforms will allow firms to play a bigger role in productive investments in the UK economy and support delivery of competitiveness and growth, though much will depend on insurers&rsquo; investment choices and the extent of investments made in the UK.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk175742329"></a>For our part, within insurance supervision, we have established a new specialist team to streamline our decision making of MA applications, including for productive assets. As my colleague Gareth Truran remarked in his recent speech<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/september/shoib-khan-speech-at-the-29th-bank-of-america-financials-ceo-conference#footnote-7" id="footnote-ref-7"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[7]</a></sup>, insurers now have what they need to use the Solvency UK reforms to support their plans for UK productive investments. The onus is now on firms to make the most of the opportunity the reforms present.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also like to flag that we have seen a growing appetite for the use of funded reinsurance (Funded-Re) in the BPA market. Market participants tell us that the rationale for these arrangements include capital optimisation and asset origination limitations.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/september/shoib-khan-speech-at-the-29th-bank-of-america-financials-ceo-conference#footnote-8" id="footnote-ref-8"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[8]</a></sup>&nbsp;But we have made clear that, if not properly controlled, the growth of Funded-Re could lead to a rapid build-up of risks in the sector, and our policy seeks to mitigate such risks, including the potential of recapture. We have asked firms to undertake a gap analysis by the end of October on whether they meet our expectations and we have made clear that we will keep under review whether we need to take further action such as explicit regulatory restrictions on the amount and structure of Funded-Re, or measures to address any underestimation of risk, or regulatory arbitrage, inherent in these transactions.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk174434171"></a>In developing our policy for Funded-Re<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/september/shoib-khan-speech-at-the-29th-bank-of-america-financials-ceo-conference#footnote-9" id="footnote-ref-9"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[9]</a></sup>, we have sought to advance our primary objectives while also considering the impacts on the SCGO. Our aim is that Funded-Re arrangements are managed and modelled to a consistent and appropriate set of standards across the UK insurance industry, helping ensure a level playing field so that some insurers do not use funded reinsurance transactions in an imprudent way. Our policy will enable UK life insurers to continue to provide annuity products to policyholders in a sustainable manner and invest in a way which supports long-term economic growth.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, we continue to engage closely with the industry and have received positive feedback<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/september/shoib-khan-speech-at-the-29th-bank-of-america-financials-ceo-conference#footnote-10" id="footnote-ref-10"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[10]</a></sup>&nbsp;from our recent Innovation Roundtable and our engagement with industry via Subject Expert Groups relating to the Matching Adjustment and the MA Sandbox. To support innovation within the life insurance sector, we are considering how to take forward a so-called &ldquo;Accelerator&rdquo; initiative to facilitate future expansion of MA eligibility, including the possibility of allowing some degree of self-certification of new investments within existing eligibility rules.</p>
<h3>Other reforms</h3>
<p>Whilst important, the MA reforms can overshadow that Solvency UK was a wide package of reforms with many other initiatives. Important changes include streamlining our approach to Internal Models, simplifying TMTP calculations, and allowing firms greater flexibility in calculating the Group solvency requirements. All of these were designed by the PRA to reduce the regulatory burden on firms &ndash; reducing cost and increasing efficiency - whilst maintaining robust prudential standards.</p>
<p>We have also reduced the reporting and disclosure burden on insurers. The changes will come into effect at the end of 2024 and will result in a net removal of around a third of the templates currently required. This makes it easier for firms to get on with running their business whilst ensuring that the PRA has the data to do its job.</p>
<p>One important guardrail that I would like to flag is our intention in 2025 to publish, for the first time, firm specific stress test results for our major Life Insurers which will enhance market disclosure and, in turn, market discipline.</p>
<p>The authorisations regime has an important impact on competitiveness. That includes continuing to support new market entrants, where we have authorised 58 new insurers<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/september/shoib-khan-speech-at-the-29th-bank-of-america-financials-ceo-conference#footnote-11" id="footnote-ref-11"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[11]</a></sup>&nbsp;since the PRA&rsquo;s inception; and every year we approve around 600 individuals for senior manager regime positions in insurance firms. Working with the FCA, we have addressed delays in senior manager approvals, resulting in meeting our target of deciding cases within three months consistently since June 2023. We are now accelerating the clearance of the majority of straightforward cases, with half of them now dealt with in under 57 days, down from 87 days in early 2023.</p>
<p>We have also introduced a new &lsquo;mobilisation&rsquo; regime to facilitate entry and expansion for new insurers. This is an optional stage for up to 12 months when a new insurer would be authorised and operate with restrictions while it completes the final aspects of its development. Mobilisation has been successful within the banking industry and could have a positive impact on sustainable economic growth in the UK by improving ease of entry<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/september/shoib-khan-speech-at-the-29th-bank-of-america-financials-ceo-conference#footnote-12" id="footnote-ref-12"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[12]</a></sup>&nbsp;to UK insurance markets.</p>
<h3>Third-country insurance branches</h3>
<p>The UK market has always attracted international insurers looking to take advantage of its insurance expertise and strong legal and regulatory framework. Branching offers over 160 overseas insurers a convenient way to access the UK.</p>
<p>The PRA recently published an updated approach to the authorisation and supervision of Insurance Third Country Branches.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/september/shoib-khan-speech-at-the-29th-bank-of-america-financials-ceo-conference#footnote-13" id="footnote-ref-13"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[13]</a></sup>&nbsp;This clarifies our openness for insurers &ndash; particularly those focused on wholesale markets &ndash; to operate in the UK as a branch and may facilitate more international insurers to apply to operate in the UK through a branch, given that applications will be assessed against a clear set of criteria.</p>
<p>A fundamental part of our approach to branches is working with home state supervisors, whom we seek to rely on in supervising the whole insurer where we have confidence of equivalent regulatory standards and supervisory cooperation. We work with home state supervisors to identify risks that could affect the UK branch or policyholders and have taken steps to remove unnecessary regulatory duplication.</p>
<p>The PRA has also implemented reforms under Solvency UK to remove branch capital and asset localisation requirements and, consequentially reduced branch regulatory reporting.</p>
<h3>London Market</h3>
<p>Whilst innovation must be industry led, the PRA is seeking to create a regulatory environment that supports innovation and is responsive to the specifics of the UK market. This includes the London Market, which makes a crucial contribution to the UK&rsquo;s position as a global insurance centre.</p>
<p>The London Market is a leading place to underwrite large and complex risks internationally. It remains the dominant market for specialty insurance classes capturing over 40% of global market share<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/september/shoib-khan-speech-at-the-29th-bank-of-america-financials-ceo-conference#footnote-14" id="footnote-ref-14"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[14]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>One such example is the evolution of the UK cyber insurance market as the largest cyber market in Europe. It benefits from a deep expertise in cybersecurity and underwriting which has made it a natural hub for cyber risk taking<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/september/shoib-khan-speech-at-the-29th-bank-of-america-financials-ceo-conference#footnote-15" id="footnote-ref-15"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[15]</a></sup>. The PRA recognises the growing importance of this activity given evolving cyber threats at a time of increased geopolitical uncertainty<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/september/shoib-khan-speech-at-the-29th-bank-of-america-financials-ceo-conference#footnote-16" id="footnote-ref-16"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[16]</a></sup>&nbsp;such that our supervisory expectations around, for example, capital and exposure risk management, have allowed firms to develop these as the market grows.<s></s></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll now move on to what comes next &ndash; some of which also relates to the London Market&hellip;</p>
</section><section class="page-section">
<h2>What&rsquo;s next?</h2>
<h3>Insurance Special Purpose Vehicle (ISPV) Regime</h3>
<p>Another area where the PRA is seeking to reform and improve efficiency of is the UK ISPV regime, along with necessary changes to PRA rules and legislation. The PRA expects to consult on a package of reforms to the UK ISPV regime in coming months, intended to:</p>
<ul>
<li>allow a wider range of transaction structures in the UK regime;</li>
<li>streamline and speed up the application and approval processes, thereby also reducing costs for applicants; and</li>
<li>clarify the PRA&rsquo;s expectations of UK insurers who cede risks to ISPVs, wherever they are established.</li>
</ul>
<p><a id="_Hlk174984604"></a>Alongside these reforms, I can share with you that we intend to consult later this year on introducing a new, accelerated pathway for catastrophe bond applications. Commonly known as &lsquo;cat bonds&rsquo;, these vehicles have been effective in transferring insurance risks into capital markets for several years, and benefit from high levels of standardisation. In collaboration with the FCA, we plan to share information on how we will review complete applications within 10 working days rather than our current 4&ndash;6-week process. We will share more information on the proposal for how this pathway will operate as part of the wider package later in the year.</p>
<h3><a id="_Hlk177463231"></a>Working effectively with the Society of Lloyd&rsquo;s</h3>
<p>Lloyd&rsquo;s, as a market, plays an essential role in the vibrancy of the London Market. Both the PRA and the Society of Lloyd&rsquo;s have a role in regulating the Lloyd&rsquo;s market, and we work closely together, supported by a public Cooperation Agreement. Lloyd&rsquo;s managing agents, as PRA-authorised firms, are supervised to the same standards as all other PRA firms, but Lloyd&rsquo;s also provides oversight over Managing Agents and, in recent years, has implemented its Principles Based Oversight framework to enhance that oversight. So, we have been carefully considering how we can enhance our current cooperation. For example, we are working with Lloyd&rsquo;s and the FCA on how we can make the process for authorising Managing Agents quicker, and we think we can coordinate more with Lloyd&rsquo;s to ensure our oversight of Managing Agents is effective and efficient. To this end, we have also modified our categorisation for Managing Agents. While the categories will remain subject to review, the impact for affected Managing Agents will typically be a lower level of supervisory interaction with the PRA. These changes should reduce duplication and regulatory costs to support the competitiveness of the London Market without compromising prudential standards.</p>
<h3>Implementation of regulatory reforms is a key focus for the PRA</h3>
<p>We will continue to seek new opportunities to achieve the SCGO<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>We are also currently consulting on an important piece of the jigsaw which is to move the remaining parts of our prudential regime which we have inherited from the EU, and are still locked in legislation, to our rulebook. Once this process has completed, the Solvency UK regime will be mostly<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/september/shoib-khan-speech-at-the-29th-bank-of-america-financials-ceo-conference#footnote-17" id="footnote-ref-17"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[17]</a></sup>&nbsp;in the PRA&rsquo;s policy domain, giving us more flexibility to tailor and evolve the regime to the needs of the UK market in ways that we have not previously been able to. We are working with HMT to deliver this work, which includes their repeal of the relevant legislation, so that we can incorporate the relevant parts of Solvency II in our rules. We remain on track to complete this work by the end of 2024.</p>
<h3>Conclusion: Primary and secondary objectives</h3>
<p>Now, a reasonable question to ask is how the PRA is confident that it is fulfilling its secondary objectives, as far as possible, whilst delivering its primary objectives. We see these objectives as complementary and I have spoken today about a range of measures to deliver change, including to increase investment freedoms and reduce regulatory processes on insurers.</p>
<p>We are held to account through formal mechanisms, including annual reporting on the secondary objectives as required by legislation<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/september/shoib-khan-speech-at-the-29th-bank-of-america-financials-ceo-conference#footnote-18" id="footnote-ref-18"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[18]</a></sup>, the PRA practitioner panel, a new Cost Benefit Analysis Panel and the Bank&rsquo;s Independent Evaluation Office who recently published a report on the PRA&rsquo;s approach to SCGO<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/september/shoib-khan-speech-at-the-29th-bank-of-america-financials-ceo-conference#footnote-19" id="footnote-ref-19"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[19]</a></sup>. We are always keen to hear ideas from industry on places where we can make improvements to support delivery of our secondary objectives &ndash; without undermining our primary objectives. I hope you will continue to constructively engage with us and provide us with feedback.</p>
<p>I started today with a reference to the Olympics, and I am going to conclude by returning to that theme. As some of you will know, the Olympic motto is Citius, Altius, Fortius &ndash; Communiter. Or for those of us not so fluent in Latin, Faster, Higher, Stronger &ndash; Together. And that is quite apt for summing up what I have said today:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have been working to make our processes&nbsp;<strong>faster</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; such as streamlining authorisation and MA applications, alongside removing burdens which unnecessarily slow down firms.</li>
<li>Unlike an Olympic high jumper, we&rsquo;re not looking to continually raise the regulatory bar - but it is important that we maintain &ndash; and where necessary have&nbsp;<strong>higher</strong>&nbsp;standards to ensure financial soundness and policyholder protection, such as our work on Funded-Re.</li>
<li>We think by doing both these things, the reputation of the UK as a trustworthy, efficient, and responsive place to transact insurance business will therefore be&nbsp;<strong>stronger</strong>.</li>
<li>We have delivered a package of reforms under Solvency UK and have further initiatives in the pipeline; but it is important that we work&nbsp;<strong>together</strong>&nbsp;to identify where we can continue to enhance our policies and the way we supervise.</li>
</ul>
<p>The UK is, therefore, well-positioned with its robust and effective regulatory regime. Our differentiated supervisory approach, tailored to different sectors of the insurance industry, is key in enabling us to deliver the PRA&rsquo;s secondary objectives and support the UK economy in going for gold.</p>

<ul>
<li><span>Establishes Regional Management Structure to Deepen Client Connectivity</span></li>
<li><span>Supports the Growth and Development of Local and Regional Economies across Texas, U.S. Southern States and Latin America</span></li>

In Rachel we have the ideal partner to help bring this vision to life for our clients across Texas, the Southern United States and the Latin America region. A Texan born and raised, Rachel understands our clients and the unique local dynamics like no other - and she will be a powerful advocate for the interests and needs of our clients across the region.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am thrilled to return to Nasdaq and lead the newly established Texas, Southern United States, and Latin America regional franchise,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>Rachel Racz, SVP, Head of Listings for Texas, Southern U.S. and Latin America at Nasdaq</span>. &ldquo;Throughout my career I have been passionate about the power of markets to drive economic growth, scale innovation, and help innovators, companies, and leaders achieve their greatest ambitions. As a Texas native, I have had a front row seat to the extraordinary growth of the Texas economy &ndash; as well as our neighboring states &ndash; and I am honored to help our clients across the region build on this momentum as we drive the next phase of growth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Texas is home to more than 200 Nasdaq listed companies which equates to $1.3 trillion in market capitalization. Nasdaq is an integrated part of the Texas and regional economic fabric and a longstanding advocate for the communities that define it.

<title>FTSE Russell Launches Fixed Income TPI Index And TPI Focused Glidepath Index</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ftse-russell-launches-fixed-income-tpi-index-and-tpi-focused-glidepath-index/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="VerticalSpacing VerticalSpacing--m">
<div class="RichText   ">
<ul>
<li><span>The two new fixed income indices are designed to support investors&rsquo; climate commitments and sophisticated sustainability requirements with different investment purposes</span></li>
<li><span>Both products provide expertise via the Transition Pathway Initiative&rsquo;s (TPI) dataset to assess companies&rsquo; readiness for the climate transition</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="VerticalSpacing VerticalSpacing--l">
<div class="RichText   ">
<p>FTSE Russell today announces the launch of two new indices &ndash; the FTSE Fixed Income TPI Climate Transition Index Series and the FTSE Fixed Income TPI Focused Glidepath Index Series<span>1</span>. The new indices will help meet the growing demand of investors and offer a fixed income solution to support their climate commitments.</p>
<p>The<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.lseg.com/en/ftse-russell/indices/tpi-index-solutions"><span>FTSE Fixed Income TPI Climate Transition Index Series</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span>will capture a broad range of sustainable investment data and provide a multi-asset TPI opportunity through a methodology aligned with the equity version of the TPI Index.</p>
<p>The index series is designed to reflect the performance of global and regional fixed income markets, where index constituent weights are varied to account for the risks and opportunities associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy. Constituent weights are adjusted based on five key climate considerations through a fixed-tilt framework:</p>
<ul>
<li>Carbon emissions</li>
<li>Green revenues</li>
<li>Green bonds</li>
<li>TPI inputs that provide a forward-looking view on company alignment with the goals of the Paris agreement via:</li>
</ul>
<p>o Management quality (MQ) scores: reflecting companies&rsquo; climate governance activities (aligned with the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures&rsquo; recommendations)</p>
<p>o Carbon performance (CP) scores: reflecting company commitments to emissions pathways that are aligned to the Paris Agreement and 1.5&deg;C/below 2&deg;C warming scenarios</p>
<p>The<span>&nbsp;FTSE Fixed Income TPI Focused Glidepath Index Series</span>&nbsp;is a long-only investment selection index aimed at achieving low tracking error through a re-financing approach. The index is designed with fixed income characteristics in mind, specifically seeking to utilise a buy and hold-to-maturity strategy for corporate bonds. The use of proceeds from matured bonds are then directed into those high carbon intensive corporates that are assessed to be Paris aligned by 2050 using the TPI Carbon Performance data. Over time, directing capital flows to corporates&rsquo; helping the transition to a low carbon economy. The benefits to this strategy include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transparent, rules-based strategy that is benchmark aware</li>
<li>Delivers enhanced liquidity profile by only choosing to invest in the primary market</li>
<li>Provides the opportunity for engagement with issuers as part of the roadshow and book-build</li>
<li>Offers a relative decarbonisation compared to the parent index overtime</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Scott Harman, Head of Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities at FTSE Russell, comments:&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;FTSE Russell climate indices have evolved to meet the increasing sophistication of sustainable investors. We have seen growing demand from investors for indices that go beyond a narrow focus on carbon emissions and allow investors to integrate company activity within the green economy and leverage forward looking metrics, whilst minimising tracking error from the base index. By bringing together data and analysis from both FTSE Russell and TPI, these new index series&rsquo; will offer investors solutions to support their climate commitments by mitigating carbon risk, capturing green revenues and incorporating forward-looking metrics.&rdquo;</p>

<div> Individual, investor, ownership, Broadridge, voting
Summary:
Individual investor ownership is at a decade high, with increased voting participation. Director and say-on-pay support increased, but environmental and social proposal support declined. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Individual investor ownership was at its highest level in a decade&nbsp;according to the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.broadridge.com/report/2025-proxy-season-preview-and-2024-proxy-season-highlights?utm_medium=AffiliateMarketing&amp;utm_source=Third-Party&amp;sub_source=PublicRelations&amp;utm_campaign=L2_AM_CORP_AMER_XX_LP_ProxyPulseLandingPageReport_FY25_Q1&amp;content_id=1815369224432480743&amp;campaign_id=701RN00000BufDRYAZ" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ProxyPulse<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;report</a>&nbsp;released today&nbsp;by global Fintech leader,&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="http://www.broadridge.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc</a>. (NYSE:BR).&nbsp;Individual investors owned 31.7% of shares held beneficially in street name, up from 31.5% for the prior season. More individual investors are exercising their right to vote: their voting participation ticked up to 29.8% of the shares they hold from 29.6% last year, the highest in nine years.&nbsp;Individuals, as a group, were more supportive of board recommendations than were institutional investors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There continues to be a marked difference in how individual and institutional shareholders vote on environmental and social proposals,&rdquo; said Chuck Callan, Broadridge SVP Regulatory Affairs and co-author of the report. &ldquo;As a result, many fund companies and institutional asset managers now provide their investors with a vote or a say on how matters at portfolio companies are voted.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Director and Say-on-pay Support Increased</b></p>
<p>Shareholder support for corporate directors and say-on-pay proposals increased, as company market valuations improved. On average, director proposals were approved by 91% of the vote while say-on-pay received 88% support. Fewer directors and pay proposals failed to attain majority support this season.&nbsp;Only 481 directors failed to win majority support, the lowest in four years. Say-on-pay support was at a four-year high.</p>
<p><b>Environmental &amp; Social Support Continues to Decline</b></p>
<p>Backing for environmental &amp; social proposals declined. While more proposals were on the ballot (483) in meetings in the first 6 months of this year, average support fell to 21.2%, the lowest level in eight years, down from 25.5% last year.&nbsp; There continues to be a divergence in how individuals and institutional investors voted on proposals of this type.&nbsp; Support by individuals was 14.8% of their voted shares, on average, while support by institutions was higher at 22.4% of their voted shares.</p>

<div> Fintech, Milan, Summit, Innovation, Banking
Summary: 
Milan Fintech Summit in October, featuring international leaders, sessions on future of Fintech, diverse speakers, and international partnerships. Out of Summit session in Biella.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>
<div>The fifth edition of the&nbsp;<span><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a class="x_x_x_x_OWAAutoLink safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.milanfintechsummit.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Milan Fintech Summit</a></span></b></span>&nbsp;&ndash; a leading international event focused on innovation in banking and financial services &ndash; is returning to Milan.&nbsp;<b>Organised and promoted by Fintech District</b>, the international community representing Italy&rsquo;s Fintech and Techfin ecosystem, and&nbsp;<b>Business International, the knowledge unit of Fiera Milano</b>, the event will reinforce Milan&rsquo;s status as a key hub for innovation in Europe. The Summit aims to spotlight the Italian Fintech ecosystem, attract investments and talent, and foster business networking opportunities.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>On&nbsp;<b>October 8th and 9th</b>, the&nbsp;<b>Milan Fintech Summit</b>&nbsp;will bring together international Fintech leaders, financial players, investors, large corporations, SMEs, institutions, associations, and European hubs for a two-day event dedicated to the latest innovation and trends in financial services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>With over 15,000 financial companies, 2,800 startups, and a rapidly growing Venture Capital ecosystem, Milan is the perfect host for this significant event. Milan boasts 41% of Italian Fintech companies, including two unicorns, and attracts 69% of investments in the Italian Fintech sector.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As part of the event, the first data from the 2024 edition of the&nbsp;<b>ITALIAN FINTECH MAP</b>&nbsp;will be presented. This "map", created by Fintech District and Politecnico di Milano, offers a comprehensive overview of Fintech companies operating in Italy as well as European ones with Italian roots.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Building on the success of last year&rsquo;s edition, which featured&nbsp;<b>over 110 Italian and international speakers, and attracted more than 1,300 attendees (of which 63% were C-level executives) from over 30 countries</b>, the 2024 Summit aims to strengthen its position as a critical forum for discussions on the evolving trends in Fintech.</div>
<div><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></div>
<div>This year&rsquo;s theme, &ldquo;<b><i>SMELLS LIKE FINTECH SPIRIT&rdquo;</i></b>, draws inspiration from music. Each session will be named after a famous song, with participants and speakers contributing their favourite tracks to&nbsp;<span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a class="x_x_x_x_OWAAutoLink safe---anchor---wc" href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7BJWCp7KWhF36P1txxbDL2?si=36e15144a6b44e00" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">an official playlist</a></span></span>, created&nbsp;<i>ad hoc</i>&nbsp;for the Milan Fintech Summit. Music reflects the dynamic and disruptive nature of Fintech, whose solutions, when integrated across sectors, can deliver a cutting-edge customer experience.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Just as the music industry has evolved&mdash;from carrying boomboxes in the '80s to Walkmans, MP3 players in the 2000s, and now podcasts directly on our phones&mdash;Fintech is revolutionising banking, particularly in payments, which have moved from cash to P2P transfers and instant transactions via banking apps.</div>
<div><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /></span></b></div>
<div><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THE MILAN FINTECH SUMMIT LINE-UP</span></b></div>

<title>EDHEC Scientific Infra &amp; Private Assets: New Private Market Equivalent Allows The Alpha Of Private Funds To Be Tracked</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/edhec-scientific-infra-and-private-assets-new-private-market-equivalent-allows-th/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> alpha, fund selection, private assets, benchmark, monitoring
Summary:
SIPA's Direct Alpha method enables fair fund assessment, comparing alpha across funds, and supporting ongoing monitoring for informed decision-making. <div>
<p>In a newly released publication, &ldquo;<a href="https://publishing.edhecinfra.com/papers/2024_Fund_selection_and_alpha_tracking.pdf">Private Equity &amp; Infrastructure Fund Selection and Alpha Tracking</a>,&rdquo; Scientific Infra &amp; Private Assets (SIPA) has presented <a href="https://publishing.edhecinfra.com/papers/2024_Fund_selection_and_alpha_tracking.pdf">an approach to measure and track the alpha of private market funds</a>, allowing robust and representative fund selection and monitoring.</p>
<p>The approach uses the Direct Alpha method, which allows investors to assess the performance of each fund and manager fairly against a representative benchmark. SIPA calculates a <b>private market equivalent</b> return for a private equity or infrastructure fund. With this approach, investors gain actual insights into the excess returns (or alpha) generated by a given fund. This alpha measure can be compared directly across funds, facilitating an objective and unbiased decision-making process for fund selection and monitoring.</p>
<p>Additionally, this method supports the ongoing monitoring of fund investments and enables meaningful engagement with managers to understand the sources of return in private asset strategies</p>
<p>In the example below, while both funds appear to have outperformed public markets, only Fund 2 has been able to generate alpha against the representative private market benchmark.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fund 1      has delivered an IRR of 17.64% but underperformed the market with an alpha      of -0.61%. Fund allocation resulted in small positive alpha but was offset      by underperforming investments.</li>
<li>Fund 2      has delivered an IRR of 21.37% and outperformed with an alpha of 4.81%.      Primarily driven by superior investment selection by the manager.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<img alt="EDHEC_26Sept24" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/EDHEC_26Sept24.jpg" title="EDHEC_26Sept24" /></p>
<p>Abhishek Gupta, Associate Director &ndash; Solutions with SIPA, commented, "The SIPA approach allows funds to be ranked by market outperformance on a consistent and directly comparable basis so that the best strategies and managers can be either selected or re-invested in. It also allows the value-add created by the manager&rsquo;s allocation choices (segment or factor tilts) to be differentiated from that created by selecting individual assets and operational improvements."</p>

<p><span>Sustainable Trading, a membership organisation dedicated to improving the sustainability of the global markets trading industry, has released its&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://info.therealizationgroup.com/e3t/Ctc/I6+113/cWmHt04/VWt-cW30VL7gW1M4wXF1N1DnHW50jS-p5lqt6MN4nN_bK5kvg0W50kH_H6lZ3npW75dWVF2GXSxrN6kzqTwZf7-bW86WK6M3g-cWQN28BPmq-x82DW3qzh_L6DqBJgVwWVXV16tLn_VW29t829kY96W9c7S194v_KnsN2Vl2xxkzzj1W6LCrFz3t72rqW5W0JWb6RJH-KW8Fc_lK5KC2dQW8CKg9k5CvClNW9fd5jP8zSnPwW2Kr6qD1kH00pW2hSN_J4HKQBrW3_DLcy8BkPDRW7y0kKx2WxWsLW3vM5-N9czm2wW1nZl8X5xwS_sMkJNPzXvwtQVPSNtd5fnZ6xV7HnfJ7WzJMMW3ZnrhM2dvJFtW3HFrG02ZZ5CfW9lH-bj2Hry7pW1cJHKm82ypXWW1dCsDd4PPs-DW8Pq-XJ1TfLstW6YXrVC3gp5T5W7YS7Zn5pGS3nW5yM31x3DMCpdf2TGv4s04" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><strong><em><span>LIFE BEYOND THE DESK: Trading Employee Workplace Experience Report</span></em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;</em>offering an in-depth look at the<strong>&nbsp;</strong>experiences and challenges faced by trading professionals. Based on survey feedback from 270 current and former employees, the report highlights the need for firms to reevaluate their workplace practices&mdash;particularly in areas such as health, flexibility and career development&mdash;to better align with modern workforce expectations.</span></p>
<p><span>One notable finding from the report is that while market hours were not directly surveyed,&nbsp;<strong>35% of employees</strong>&nbsp;who provided optional comments on improving the industry referenced&nbsp;<strong>reducing market hours</strong>. Similarly, a further&nbsp;<strong>37% of employees</strong>&nbsp;who shared further feedback on wellbeing specifically noted&nbsp;<strong>long hours</strong>, referencing the negative effects on their health, family life or career longevity.</span></p>
<p><span>Alongside long working hours, the nature of the role itself is impacting the&nbsp;<strong>health and wellbeing</strong>&nbsp;of many employees, with&nbsp;<strong>1 in 5&nbsp;</strong>reporting that their job forces them to sacrifice personal wellbeing. While&nbsp;<strong>65% of employees</strong>&nbsp;said they have some&nbsp;<strong>flexibility to step away</strong>&nbsp;from their desks, others expressed that taking breaks, having lunch away from their desk or managing responsibilities outside of work&mdash;such as taking care of themselves and their families&mdash;remains a challenge.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Flexibility issues&nbsp;</strong>also affect how trading employees engage with company initiatives. For instance,&nbsp;<strong>71% of respondents</strong>&nbsp;believe it&rsquo;s important for their firm to offer volunteering opportunities, but only&nbsp;<strong>40% were able to participate</strong>, partly due to the constraints of stepping away from the desk.</span></p>
<p><span>On a positive note, employees praised&nbsp;<strong>hybrid and flexible work structures</strong>&nbsp;where they are available, and&nbsp;<strong>80% of employees</strong>&nbsp;report positive experiences with senior management, specifically when open communication styles were used in their organisations.</span></p>
<p><span>Career progression remains a pressing issue, with&nbsp;<strong>51% of respondents</strong>&nbsp;who left their roles in the past five years citing a lack of upward mobility as the primary reason. Notably, female respondents were&nbsp;<strong>four times more likely</strong>&nbsp;than men to leave a role due to company culture.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Duncan Higgins</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;CEO of Sustainable Trading</strong>, emphasised,&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Understanding emerging trends is key for the industry&rsquo;s evolution. To stay competitive and attract top talent, we must come together to explore these findings and collectively develop initiatives that align with evolving workforce expectations. It&rsquo;s time to reassess traditional practices and implement changes that support both employee wellbeing and industry growth.&rdquo;</em></span></p>

<p><span><span>Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) represent a significant advancement in cancer treatment, particularly within China's burgeoning oncology sector. With a little over 100 ADC candidates in various stages of development, Chinese companies lead the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region.

<title>The Dubai Financial Services Authority Accepts Enforceable Undertaking From Baker Tilly MKM Chartered Accountants For Violations Related To Audit Documentation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) has announced today that it has accepted an Enforceable Undertaking (EU) from Baker Tilly MKM Chartered Accountants (Baker Tilly).</p>
<p>Baker Tilly failed to assemble complete and final sets of audit documentations for several audit files in a timely manner. This is in violation of the<span>&nbsp;International Standard on Auditing 230</span>,&nbsp;<span>Audit Documentation,</span><i>&nbsp;</i>and the&nbsp;<span>International Standard of Quality Management 1</span>. Audit documentation demonstrates the integrity of the audit process and acts as a written record that provides support for the auditor&rsquo;s opinion. The violation continued over a three-year period.</p>
<p>The DFSA acknowledges Baker Tilly&rsquo;s cooperation in dealing with this matter.</p>
<p>Ian Johnston, Chief Executive of the DFSA, said: &ldquo;When auditors fail to meet their responsibilities, it casts doubt on the integrity of financial reporting. Our action today reminds Registered Auditors that as gatekeepers for DIFC financial markets and financial services businesses, it is critical that they comply with the auditing standards.&rdquo;<i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>A copy of the EU setting out full details of this matter can be found in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dfsa.ae/what-we-do/enforcement/regulatory-actions">Decision Notices &amp; Regulatory Actions&nbsp;</a>section of the DFSA website.</p>

<title>Shanghai Stock Exchange Revises Rules On Reviewing Major Asset Restructurings By Listed Companies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> draft revision, Shanghai Stock Exchange, simplified review, listed companies, market-driven and law-based principles
<br />
Summary:<br />Shanghai Stock Exchange released draft revision to Rules for Review of Major Asset Restructurings to streamline review process for listed companies and promote market-driven principles. <div>
<p>On the evening of September 24, Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) released the draft revision to the&nbsp;<span>Rules for Review of Major Asset Restructurings of Listed Companies</span>&nbsp;(hereinafter referred to as the&nbsp;<span>Rules</span>) to solicit public opinions. The comment period will last until October 9.</p>
<p>The draft revision focuses on four aspects:</p>
<p>I. Specify scope of application of a simplified review</p>
<p>Two transactions types are eligible:</p>
<p>(1) stock-for-stock merger between listed company; or</p>
<p>(2) high-quality companies issue shares to purchase assets without constituting major asset restructuring. (High-quality companies refer to listed companies with a market cap over 10 billion RMB and a A-grade rating on disclosure quality by the SSE in recent two years.)</p>
<p>II. Establish a negative list that does not qualify for simplified review</p>
<p>First, if listed companies, their controlling shareholders, de facto controllers, intermediaries or related personnel have been subject to administrative penalties by China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) or disciplinary actions by trading venues within a certain period, or if they have other issues of serious dishonesty, they will be excluded from the simplified procedures.</p>
<p>Second, if the transaction plan involves serious unprecedented situations, significant public concern, or other highly complex circumstances, it will also be excluded.</p>
<p>III. Set up simplified review mechanism</p>
<p>For restructuring transactions that meet the conditions for simplified review, the SSE will accept the application within 2 working days based on the verification opinions of the intermediaries, and issue a review opinion within 5 working days after acceptance.</p>
<p>The restructuring review institution on the SSE will not conduct inquiries, and the transaction will not be submitted to the M&amp;A and restructuring committee for deliberation.</p>
<p>IV. Reinforce responsibilities of all parties in the simplified review</p>
<p>Listed companies and related parties are required to commit that the transaction meets the criteria for applying simplified review procedures.</p>
<p>The verification and gatekeeping responsibilities of intermediaries should be strengthened. Independent financial advisors are required to give clear, affirmative opinions on whether the transaction complies with the simplified review procedure requirements.</p>
<p>At the same time, to prevent misuse of simplified review procedures, the SSE will strengthen post-event supervision of related restructuring transactions. Any violations of the simplified review requirements will be strictly disciplined in accordance with the applicable rules.</p>
<p>A market insider commented that the revised&nbsp;<span>Rules</span>&nbsp;will streamline the review process and shorten the time needed for review and registration, which is expected to enhance the quality and efficiency of the real economy, vitalize the market and promote quality of listed companies.</p>
<p>The SSE stated that it will continue to follow the decisions made at the third plenary session of the 20th CPC Congress, and fully implement policies set out in Five Major Financial Works (technological finance, green finance, inclusive finance, elderly care finance, and digital finance), the Nine-point Decisions (<span>Several Opinions on Strengthening Supervision, Preventing Risks, and Promoting High-Quality Development of the Capital Market</span>&nbsp;by State Council), STAR Market Eight Measures (<span>Eight Measures on Deepening the Reform of the STAR Market to Serve Technological Innovation and the Development of New Quality Productive Forces</span>&nbsp;by the CSRC). It will uphold market-driven and law-based principles and support market-oriented transaction arrangements and innovative plans established in accordance with regulations. The SSE aims to facilitate the implementation of more exemplary cases, further enhancing the role of the capital market as the main channel for M&amp;A and restructuring cases, which will contribute to improving the quality of listed companies and strengthening the foundation for the healthy development of the market.</p>

<div> Commodity Futures Trading Commission, order filing, Aspire Commodities LLC, spot month speculative position limits, civil monetary penalty
Summary: Aspire Commodities LLC exceeded federal spot month speculative position limits for cash-settled reference contracts, resulting in an $800,000 penalty. The violations occurred on seven occasions from 2022 to 2024.<br /><br /> <div>
<p><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an order filing and simultaneously settling charges against&nbsp;<span>Aspire Commodities LLC</span>&nbsp;(Aspire) for exceeding the federal spot month speculative position limits for cash-settled reference contracts to the New York Mercantile Exchange&rsquo;s (NYMEX) physically-delivered Henry Hub Natural Gas (NG) futures contract on seven occasions from 2022 to 2024.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The order requires Aspire, an energy trading firm with locations in Houston and Dorado Beach, Puerto Rico, to pay an $800,000 civil monetary penalty, and to cease and desist from further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations. Aspire admits the facts in the order.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Case Background</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>From 2022 to 2024, the ICE Futures U.S. Energy Division (IFED) and the Nodal exchanges granted Aspire conditional limit exemptions, which allowed the company to exceed the federal spot month speculative position limit by an additional 8,000 NYMEX NG cash-settled equivalent contracts on each of the exchanges during the NG contract spot month so long as Aspire did not hold or trade positions in the physically-delivered NYMEX NG contract during the final three trading days in the contract&rsquo;s spot month.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This order finds Aspire violated those conditions seven times over a two-year period by exceeding the federal spot month speculative position limits in cash-settled reference NG futures contracts.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The CFTC thanks IFED and Nodal exchanges for their assistance in this matter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this case are James W. Deacon, Carrie Kennedy, James H. Holl, III and Rick Glaser.</span></span></p>

<div> charges, Merrill Lynch Commodities Inc., position limits, natural gas futures, CFTC regulations
Summary:<br />Commodity Futures Trading Commission charges Merrill Lynch Commodities Inc. for exceeding position limits in natural gas futures and swap dealer supervision failures. <div>
<p><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an order filing and settling charges against&nbsp;<span>Merrill Lynch Commodities, Inc.,&nbsp;</span>based in Houston,<span>&nbsp;</span>for exceeding the federal and ICE Futures U.S. position limits in contracts that reference natural gas futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange and for swap dealer supervision and position limit monitoring failures.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>MLCI admits the facts in the order in section II.C.1, Position Limit Violations; acknowledges its conduct in that section violated the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations; and otherwise, neither admits nor denies the findings of fact.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&ldquo;Federal and exchange position limits are important guardrails that help ensure the integrity of our markets and entities must comply,&rdquo; said Director of Enforcement Ian McGinley. &ldquo;Additionally, swap dealers must comply with the business conduct standards in the CEA and CFTC regulations, including diligently supervising their employees and agents and monitoring for position limit violations.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The order requires MLCI to pay a $1.5 million civil monetary penalty, cease and desist from further violations of the CEA and CFTC regulations as charged, and comply with conditions and undertakings specified in the order.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Case Background</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The CFTC established federal speculative position limits for certain physical-delivery referenced contracts, including the NYMEX Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures (NG) contract. The financially settled ICE Henry LD1 Fixed Price Futures (H) contract references the monthly settlement price published by NYMEX for its NG futures contract. The federal speculative position limit for ICE H contracts, as well as the exchange-set limit, is 2,000 NYMEX NG futures equivalents.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The order finds on certain trading days during March and April 2023, MLCI held positions in the April 2023, and May 2023, ICE H futures contract, respectively, that ranged from more than 200 contracts to nearly 1,000 contracts in excess of both the federal speculative position limit and the exchange speculative position limit, and MLCI&rsquo;s positions did not meet the requirements for an exemption under CFTC Regulation 150.3. MLCI also had not been granted an exemption applicable to the relevant positions by the exchange in accordance with ICE&rsquo;s rules during the relevant period.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The order also finds MLCI, a swap dealer registered with the CFTC, did not establish and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to monitor for and prevent violations of applicable federal, exchange, or swap execution facility position limits and to monitor for and prevent improper reliance upon any exemptions or exclusions from such position limits. Additionally, the order finds MLCI did not diligently supervise its employees by lacking an early warning system and written policies and procedures reasonably designed to detect and alert its senior management when position limits were in danger of being breached.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The order acknowledges MLCI&rsquo;s cooperation and its representations concerning its remediation in connection with this matter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The CFTC thanks ICE for its assistance in this matter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this matter are Karin N. Roth, Carrie Kennedy, Gates S. Hurand, Lenel Hickson, Jr., and Manal M. Sultan.</span></span></p>

<title>Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization: Recovery Scams On The Rise</title>

<div> Keywords: recovery scams, fraud, CIRO, protection, CAFC <br />
Summary:<br />
- CAFC and CIRO warn about investment recovery scams targeting previous fraud victims.<br />
- Scams reference legitimate organizations and employees to appear trustworthy.<br />
- Investors urged to verify information, protect personal data, and not pay advance fees.<br />
- CAFC reports doubling of recovery scams, with low reporting rates.<br />
- CIRO provides oversight for investment dealers and publishes resources for investor protection. <br /> <div>
<p>The Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (CAFC) and the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) are warning investors about the increase of &ldquo;recovery scams&rdquo;. In most instances, these are frauds on top of fraud.</p>
<p>In investment recovery scams, fraudsters keep a list and contact previous investment scam victims by telephone, email, social media or use&nbsp;<a href="https://antifraudcentre-centreantifraude.ca/features-vedette/2023/02/tricks-trade-ficelles-metier-eng.htm#:~:text=a%20pop%2Dup-,Search%20engine%20optimization,-How%20does%20a" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_self">search engine optimization</a>&nbsp;and claim to the victim that they can return the funds lost in a previous investment scam. Fraudsters will tell victims that there is a fee for their services and, in some cases, will ask for remote access to their computer or device. In the end, no funds are returned and more funds are potentially stolen.</p>
<p>Some of these scams try to falsely create an air of legitimacy by referencing CIRO or its predecessor organizations, the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) and the Mutual Fund Dealers Association of Canada (MFDA).<br /><br />Lately, some fraudsters are falsely claiming to be employees of the investment regulators. No CIRO employee will ever ask for payment from investors. Do not send any funds and, if in doubt, check with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ciro.ca/office-investor/how-make-complaint" target="_self" title="How to Make a Complaint">CIRO&rsquo;s Complaints &amp; Inquiries team</a>&nbsp;to verify the legitimacy of such claims.</p>
<p>Investors should always independently verify the information they find on the internet. Do not rely on unsolicited information and always check the background, qualifications and disciplinary history of investment advisors registered with CIRO by checking the free&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ciro.ca/office-investor/know-your-advisor-advisor-report" target="_self" title="Know Your Advisor: Advisor Report">Advisor Report for advisors registered with investment dealers</a>, or the Canadian Securities Administrators&rsquo;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/registration/are-they-registered/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_self">National Registrant Search.</a></p>
<h2>How Canadians can protect themselves</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you've been a victim of fraud, fraudsters may target you again with a promise to get your money back.</li>
<li>Never be afraid to hang up the phone.</li>
<li>Never allow an unknown person to gain remote access to your computer/device.</li>
<li>Always have your computer/device serviced by a reputable local business.</li>
<li>Never pay an advance fee to obtain a refund.</li>
<li>Search engine optimization refers to the ability to have websites appear in the first results of an online search. Don't assume that top results mean companies are legitimate.</li>
<li>If you had provided personal information or have granted remote access to your computer, follow&nbsp;<a href="https://antifraudcentre-centreantifraude.ca/scams-fraudes/victim-victime-eng.htm" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_self">these steps</a>&nbsp;to protect yourself from identity fraud.</li>

<title>How We Got Here: A Perspective On Inflation And The Labor Market, Federal Reserve Governor Adriana D. Kugler, At The Mossavar-Rahmani Center For Business And Government, Harvard Kennedy School, Cambridge, Massachusetts</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Monetary policy, inflation, labor market, supply and demand, FOMC <br />
Summary:<br />
Outlook for US economy, inflation moderation, labor market cooling, economic activity slowing, need for monetary policy easing. <div>
<p>Thank you, John, and thank you for the opportunity to speak here today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240925a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;It is good to be back at the Kennedy School and in particular at the Mossavar-Rahmani Center, which has a long tradition of engaging on important policy issues.</p>
<p>In my remarks today, I will provide my outlook for the U.S. economy and the implications for monetary policy. The combination of significant ongoing progress in reducing inflation and a cooling in the labor market means that the time has come to begin easing monetary policy, and I strongly supported the decision last week by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to cut the federal funds rate by 50 basis points. While future actions by the FOMC will depend on data we receive on inflation, employment, and economic activity, if conditions continue to evolve in the direction traveled thus far, then additional cuts will be appropriate.</p>
<p>I will begin by summarizing where we stand on inflation, including details on how the different components of inflation have changed over time, since these facts form the basis for my judgment on where inflation is headed. I will then talk about the recent cooling in the labor market and the forces driving it as well as how shifts on this other side of our mandate fit into the overall economic outlook for the rest of this year. I will conclude with the implications of all this for appropriate monetary policy and our focus on our dual mandate.</p>
<p>Inflation based on personal consumption expenditures (PCE) has come down from a peak of 7.1 percent on a year-on-year basis to 2.5 percent in July. Core PCE inflation, which excludes energy and food prices and tends to be less volatile, has come down from a peak of 5.6 percent to now 2.6 percent. Based on consumer and producer price indexes, I estimate headline PCE and core PCE inflation to be at about 2.2 and 2.7 percent, respectively, in August, consistent with ongoing progress toward the FOMC's 2 percent target. The progress on inflation is good news, but it is important to remember that households and businesses are still dealing with prices for many goods and services that are significantly higher than a couple of years ago. Prices for groceries, for example, are about 20 percent higher than before inflation started rising in 2021, and while earnings have been rising faster than inflation, it may take some time for it to feel as though prices are back to normal.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240925a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a></p>
<p>Inflation data are produced by the Labor Department, and when I served as chief economist at Labor, I delved into the differential effects of inflation on various demographic groups. When inflation was at its peak in 2022, it was more than 1 percentage point higher for lower-income households, for those without a college degree, and for those aged 18 to 29&mdash;all groups that spend a higher share of income on necessities and have less wealth to draw from.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240925a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;Fortunately, research by staff at the Fed shows that disinflation helps close that gap as well, something that only adds to the urgency I feel about returning inflation to the FOMC's 2 percent goal.</p>
<p>Research on the causes of inflation and the subsequent disinflation show that both supply and demand forces have played an important role. In the past two years, specifically, improvements in supply, along with moderation in demand in part due to tighter monetary policy, have both played a role in the disinflationary process.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240925a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;Supply chain bottlenecks as well as the drastic drop in the labor force due to excess retirements and the withdrawal of prime-age workers contributed to the initial rise in inflation, but the resolution of these disruptions and the return of workers to the labor force have also helped rein in inflation. Early on, consumers shifted spending from services to goods, a development that goods producers struggled to accommodate, putting upward pressure on prices. But as the demand shock to goods unwound and consumer spending shifted back to services, goods inflation fell and has been running below zero in recent months. Also, the increased demand due to the fiscal response to COVID-19 in 2020 and 2021 has more recently been roughly neutral on growth, as shown by the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy in their measure of fiscal impact. And, of course, as I will discuss in a moment, tight monetary policy has been and continues to be a moderating force on demand, primarily by raising costs for interest-sensitive goods and services.</p>
<p>As I think about where inflation is headed, I find it helpful to consider how it has evolved over the past several years and in particular how the major components of inflation have behaved, so I want to take a few minutes to walk through those details.</p>
<p>As I have indicated, the big picture is that goods inflation surged early on in 2020 and 2021, followed by prices for services excluding housing, and then housing, with some overlap in those steps. Disinflation has followed that course in reverse. Core goods inflation rose, after almost a year of social distancing shifted spending from services and after production and delivery of goods was disrupted by the pandemic. This was a big change because over the long expansion leading to the pandemic, core goods prices actually fell, slightly but consistently.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240925a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;On a 12-month basis, core PCE goods inflation rose above zero in December 2020, reached a peak of 7.6 percent in February 2022, and fell again below zero at the end of 2023. In July of this year, it was negative 0.5 percent. This recent disinflation offset still-rising prices for services and helped reduce overall inflation. Goods inflation has reverted to its longer-term pattern as demand has moderated and supply chain problems have abated. This is reflected by various indexes of supply chain bottlenecks that showed the supply-side disruptions that contributed early on to surging inflation have now retreated to pre-pandemic levels.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240925a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;Other data show that computer chip supply, which fell far short of demand early in the pandemic, is back to normal conditions as well.</p>
<p>Food and energy prices, always subject to larger ups and downs than other parts of inflation, rose also early on. Food inflation increased in 2020 as shoppers began stockpiling groceries and as warehouses and production facilities had difficulty staffing due to COVID. After Russia's invasion of Ukraine, energy price inflation reached a peak 12-month rate of nearly 45 percent and food inflation reached a peak of 12 percent in mid-2022, highlighting the importance of petroleum and agricultural commodities from that part of the world. Food and energy inflation has moderated over the past two years and are now both running at 12-month rates of 1.4 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively, as supply chain issues have resolved and production in the U.S. and elsewhere has increased. Food and energy expenses represent a sizable share of consumer spending, but the frequent purchase of these goods means that they are highly salient in the public's views on inflation. Research by Francesco D'Acunto and coauthors has shown that the weights that consumers assign to price changes in forming their inflation expectations are not based on the actual share of their expenditures but instead on the frequency of purchases, which happen to be highest for food and energy goods.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240925a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;Thus, the fall in food and energy prices is important because it may feed back into lower inflation in other categories by moderating overall inflation expectations and also real wage expectations in wage bargaining.</p>
<p>Housing services price increases were the last component of inflation to escalate, rising to a peak 12-month rate of 8.3 percent in April 2023 and moderating to a 5.3 percent pace in July. It took time for housing prices to escalate and has taken longer for them to moderate because of both the nature of the rental market and the data collection method from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as I have discussed at length in other speeches.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240925a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;However, new rent increases, which better capture rental price changes in real time, are falling and are the main reason why I expect housing services costs to moderate further.</p>
<p>The final component of inflation is services excluding housing, which accounts for 50 percent of PCE inflation and is heavily influenced by labor markets. On a 12-month basis, this component of inflation rose to a peak of 5.3 percent in December 2021, stayed persistently high until February 2023, and has moderated since then to 3.3 percent in July of this year. Its escalation was driven both by the rise in labor costs and by the transition of demand from goods to services following the pandemic. Labor costs are a substantial share of the total costs for services. For example, labor accounts for between 60 percent to 80 percent of costs in construction, education, and health services.</p>
<p>Among the initial forces driving the escalation in wages were the increase in food and energy prices, as wage demands tend to track closely with the prices of these frequently purchased goods. Data on wage demands from the New York Fed's Survey of Consumer Expectations indeed show a sudden increase early on during the pandemic right after the first bout of food inflation.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240925a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;Importantly, worker shortages likely allowed those higher wage demands to be realized, contributing to the rise in wages. Later, as demand for services quickly rose and employers were creating a large number of jobs in several service sectors, workers were able to be more selective, and the ensuing "Great Resignation" took hold, allowing people to choose different careers. The relatively high demand relative to the supply of workers in some service sectors encouraged workers to move from job to job for higher wages, benefits, and other improvements in working conditions. Evidence from the Atlanta Fed's Wage Growth Tracker suggests that during this period, wages for job switchers grew more than 2 percentage points faster than wages for people staying in the same job, though this wage premium for job switchers disappeared by the second half of last year.</p>
<p>But now inflation for services excluding housing is declining, after a temporary escalation in the first quarter of this year that was likely partly due to residual seasonality. There had been fears that wage increases would drive a wage&ndash;price spiral, as the U.S. experienced in the 1970s, but this did not occur.</p>
<p>To sum up, inflation has broadly moderated as the supply of goods and services has improved, and as producers and consumers have adjusted to the effects of higher prices. Demand has moderated, in part due to tighter monetary policy. And, as I just noted, changes in the pace of wage growth have also played an important role in the ups and downs of inflation, which points me toward a discussion of labor markets, which has recently become a greater focus of monetary policy.</p>
<p>As I have noted, there has been a significant moderation in the labor market recently, but I want to start by pointing to what really has been a remarkable performance of the labor market over the past four years. After the unprecedented job losses early in the pandemic, and even accounting for the quick recovery of a large share of those losses, the recovery of the labor market that followed was historically swift. Unemployment was 7.8 percent in September 2020 and 4.7 percent only 12 months later, and it fell to under 4 percent 3 months after that. That is a more rapid recovery than the U.S. has experienced since the 1960's. What started, at that point, was 30 straight months of unemployment at or below 4 percent, which had not happened during the pre-pandemic period, the boom of the 1990s, or anytime during the 1980s, and it was only exceeded by the strong labor market of the latter half of the 1960s. Something that I think was just as remarkable has been the narrowing of the typical gap between labor market outcomes for less-advantaged groups. For example, there has been a reduction in the unemployment rate between Black and Latino workers, on the one hand, and white workers, on the other hand. There has also been a narrowing of the prime-age labor force participation rate among these groups, and, perhaps most notable of all, wage inequality among them has narrowed, which is not typical during economic expansions, according to research by David Autor and several coauthors.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240925a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;They found that one benefit of the unusually tight labor market of the past few years was that the heightened competition for scarce workers produced more rapid wage gains for workers at the bottom of the wage distribution. The real wage gains for those in the lower quartiles of the distribution and with higher propensities to consume, in turn, likely spurred consumption and helped sustain growth after the pandemic.</p>
<p>After a couple of years in which labor demand exceeded supply, the labor market has come into balance, reflecting an economy that has moderated in part due to tighter monetary policy. On the labor supply side, two forces have contributed to this rebalancing of the labor market. Labor force participation suffered due to the disruptions in work during the pandemic but rebounded strongly in 2022 and 2023 as the labor market tightened and wages rose sharply. The labor force participation rate for prime-age women reached historic highs over the past year and reached yet another historic record high in August. The overall increase in participation among workers aged 25 to 54, in the prime of their working lives, helped offset the loss of many workers aged 55 and over who experienced excess retirements during the pandemic. The second force boosting labor supply has been the large increase in immigration. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that net immigration boosted the U.S. population by close to 6 million people in 2022 and 2023, the majority of them of working age, and, by most accounts, rates of immigration have remained high in 2024.</p>
<p>As a result of improved supply and easing of demand for workers, the labor market has rebalanced. After running at very low levels, unemployment has edged up this year to 4.2 percent in August, still quite low by historical standards. The slowdown in labor demand is most evident in payroll numbers. Job creation averaged 267,000 a month in the first quarter of the year and now stands at an average of 116,000 in the three months ending in August, which is still a healthy pace of job creation. Yet, given recent revisions in the payroll numbers, it is important to continue monitoring additional labor market indicators. In addition, the fall in diffusion indexes suggests that job creation cooling has been broad based, complementing the payroll data in showing rebalances in demand and supply across sectors. Beyond payroll data, voluntary quits, which tend to reflect the rate at which people find a better job, are now back around where they were before the pandemic. The ratio of job vacancies to the number of people looking for work, the V/U ratio, has also fallen close to its pre-pandemic ratio.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240925a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;In summary, after a period of demand exceeding supply, the labor market appears to have rebalanced.</p>
<p>In tandem with the cooling in the labor market, economic activity has slowed but is still expanding at a solid pace. After adjusting for inflation, gross domestic product (GDP) grew 2.5 percent in 2023 and at around a 2 percent annual rate in the first half of 2024. Personal spending, which accounts for the majority of economic activity, has been solid this year, supported by a resilient labor market so far and high levels of household wealth relative to income. But given a rise in credit card and auto delinquencies, a rise in credit card balances, and a cooling labor market, I expect spending to grow at a somewhat more moderate pace moving forward.</p>
<p>Certainly, tight monetary policy has contributed to cool off aggregate demand and slow the economy. It has done so in large part by slowing spending on interest-sensitive expenditures, such as housing, as well as autos and other durable goods. Other spending typically financed with credit, such as business equipment, has also been slower.</p>
<p>Another effect of tight monetary policy is to keep expectations of future inflation in check. And, to the extent that expectations affect decisions by businesses to set prices and by workers to negotiate wages, this has helped put downward pressure on inflation. Survey- and market-based measures of future inflation did increase when inflation surged, but only modestly, and they have moved down in tandem with inflation and have largely returned to their 2019 levels.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I would say that recent economic developments, against the backdrop of the experience of the past four years, have validated the Federal Reserve's focus on reducing inflation and set the stage for the shift in monetary policy that occurred last week. The progress in bringing down inflation thus far, coupled with the softening in the labor market that I have described, means that while our focus should remain on continuing to bring inflation to 2 percent, we should now also shift attention to the maximum-employment side of the FOMC's dual mandate. The labor market remains resilient, but the FOMC now needs to balance its focus so we can continue making progress on disinflation while avoiding unnecessary pain and weakness in the economy as disinflation continues in the right trajectory. I strongly supported last week's decision and, if progress on inflation continues as I expect, I will support additional cuts in the federal funds rate going forward.</p>

The 12-month change in average hourly earnings and the employment cost index have been rising faster than consumer price index inflation for those in the first and second quartiles since 2019 and since 2022, respectively, and for everyone across the distribution for roughly a year.&nbsp;</p>

<div> Extension, Staff, No-action, Reporting obligations, Commodity Futures Trading Commission <br />
Summary:<br />
Commissioner urges addressing OCR rules, not issuing unnecessary rules. No-action position extended, petition not addressed, focus on fixing actual issues. <div>
<p>I support an extension of the staff no-action position in Letter No. 20-30 from certain reporting obligations under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission&rsquo;s<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement092524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Ownership and Control Reports (&ldquo;OCR&rdquo;) final rules.</p>
<p>However, I feel compelled to reiterate what I said last year when Commission staff extended this same relief:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I urge staff and the Commission to develop and issue an OCR proposed rulemaking soon&mdash;so that staff is not compelled to issue yet another extension when this one expires a year from now.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement092524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Yet, here we are in exactly the situation I had hoped we would avoid&mdash;issuing another extension in a seemingly endless series of extensions instead of addressing a known issue head-on.&nbsp; Commission staff has taken a no-action position with respect to certain reporting obligations under the OCR final rules since 2014.&nbsp; But despite a petition to address this issue, we have spent the past decade repeatedly kicking the can down the road.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement092524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Instead of using Commission resources and staff time to issue unnecessary rules codifying existing expectations<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement092524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;or providing guidance to our most sophisticated markets on lightly traded contracts<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement092524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>, maybe it is time to focus on fixing what is actually broken, like the OCR rules which are the subject of today&rsquo;s no-action relief.</p>

<div> no-action letter, reporting obligations, ownership and control reports, compliance difficulties, CFTC enforcement
Summary:
The Division of Market Oversight issued a no-action letter extending reporting obligations under the OCR Final Rule, addressing compliance and enforcement issues. <div>
<p><span><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission&rsquo;s Division of Market Oversight (DMO) today issued a no-action letter that extends the current no-action position for reporting obligations under the ownership and control reports final rule (</span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2013/11/18/2013-26789/ownership-and-control-reports-forms-102102s-4040s-and-71"><span>OCR Final Rule</span></a><span>). The OCR Final Rule, approved in 2013, requires the electronic submission of trader identification and market participant data for special accounts and volume threshold accounts through Form 102 and Form 40.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>DMO is extending its no-action position to address continuing compliance difficulties associated with certain OCR reporting obligations identified by reporting parties and market participants. The position announced today extends DMO&rsquo;s previously provided position under CFTC Letter N</span>o.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/csl/23-14/download">23-14</a><span>, stating that DMO will not recommend the CFTC commence an enforcement action for non-compliance with certain obligations. These obligations include,&nbsp;</span><span>among others, the timing of OCR form filings; certain information required to be reported&nbsp;</span><span>regarding&nbsp;</span><span>trading account controllers and volume threshold account controllers on Form 102; the reporting threshold that triggers the reporting of a volume threshold account on Form 102; the filing of refresh updates for Form 102; and responses to certain questions on&nbsp;</span><span>Form 40.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The no-action position will remain in effect until the later of the applicable effective date or compliance date of a Commission action, such as a rulemaking or order, addressing such obligations.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Detailed information on the mechanics of reporting required by the OCR Final Rule and other relevant OCR Final Rule implementation information is provided on the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/Forms/OCR/index.htm"><span>OCR homepage</span></a><span>.</span></span></span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sifma.org/resources/submissions/testimony-on-financial-institutions-and-monetary-policy/">testimony</a>&nbsp;today, SIFMA president and CEO Kenneth E. Bentsen, Jr. discussed bank capital requirements and the significant impact on the vibrancy of our capital markets and the strength of the broader economy.</p>
<p>The testimony was delivered before the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee Financial Institutions and Monetary Policy Subcommittee.</p>
<p>The testimony notes: &ldquo;while bank capital requirements are an undoubtedly complex subject, there is no question that they have material impacts across the entire economy, affecting the ability of corporations, small businesses, governmental organizations, and consumers to fund their activities and manage all types of risks.&nbsp; Given these impacts, it&rsquo;s crucial that policymakers, including Congress, conduct sufficient analysis and oversight to ensure that bank capital requirements strike the appropriate balance between ensuring financial stability and macroeconomic growth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this context, it is worth noting that the quantity of high-quality capital in the U.S. banking system has increased three-fold since the Global Financial Crisis, while total loss absorbing capacity has increased six-fold and liquidity levels have increased twelve-fold.&nbsp; In other words, it appears that capital levels are already robust and any further proposed increases should be sufficiently scrutinized to determine both the tangible benefits, and costs to the broader U.S. economy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is particularly important that policymakers strike the right balance when it comes to capital requirements affecting the ability of large banking organizations to act as intermediaries in our capital markets, given that those markets fund roughly three quarters of all economic activity in the United States.&nbsp; This contrasts with other major economies where the vast majority of commercial and economic activity is overly reliant on bank balance sheets and we believe the data has proven the U.S. model to be more efficient, resilient and growth oriented.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The testimony noted SIFMA&rsquo;s deep concern with the Basel III Endgame proposal as it was issued last year and highlighted key recommendations while policymakers prepare to issue a re-proposal of the rule:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Addressing the Overlaps with the Stress Tests/Other Capital Requirements:</span>Any re-proposal of the Basel Endgame should account for overlaps with other prudential requirements, particularly overlaps with the stress testing framework, as well as the other pending capital proposals &ndash; i.e., the GSIB surcharge and long-term debt rules.</li>
<li><span>Accounting for the Interactions between the Global Market Shock (GMS) &amp; the FRTB:</span>Regulators should address the overcapitalization of market risk between these two frameworks by, for example, applying the FRTB to banks&rsquo; trading portfolios on a post-GMS shock basis.</li>
<li><span>Diversification:</span>The re-proposal should give greater credit for diversification under both the modeled and standardized FRTB approaches to better align with actual risk exposures and reward good risk management practices.&nbsp; It is crucial that greater diversification recognition be included in the final rule.</li>
<li><span>Internal Models:</span>&nbsp;In the FRTB portion of the proposal, adjustments will need to be made to the capital requirements for modellable risk factors and non-modellable risk factors in addition to the P&amp;L loss attribution test in order to facilitate greater use of internal models approaches.</li>
<li><span>Derivatives:&nbsp;</span>We continue to believe client-facing leg of client-cleared derivatives transactions should be excluded altogether from scope of the CVA. Moreover, we believe that over-the-counter derivatives transactions with commercial end-users need to receive more favorable treatment in the final U.S. rule to bring that treatment into line with the approach adopted by the EU, UK, and other major jurisdictions. different levels of regulation that a bank&rsquo;s financial counterparties are subject to.</li>
<li><span>Securitizations:</span>&nbsp;The Basel III Endgame proposal would create perverse risk incentives that would discourage large banks from engaging in important securitization activities; for example, it would increase the capital requirements for certain senior securitization exposures much more than relatively junior (and thus riskier) exposures. This should be revisited. Capital treatment for securitization exposures in other major jurisdictions is materially less punitive than the U.S. proposal.</li>
<li><span>Securities Financing Transactions (SFT) Haircut Framework:</span>We welcome indications that the proposed SFT haircut framework will not be adopted in the U.S., given the significant adverse effects on the critical securities borrowing and lending markets that it would have.&nbsp; Removing this framework would also align the U.S. with the approach taken by other major jurisdictions.</li>
<li><span>Investment grade counterparties and collateral:</span>We have also advocated for the removal of the so-called public listing requirement, which would penalize credit worthy counterparties that do not have publicly listed securities such as pension funds and municipal issuers.&nbsp; Vice Chair Barr&rsquo;s remarks suggest that this treatment will be revised in line with the approach taken by the EU and the UK, but we will need to review the text of the re-proposal itself.&nbsp; In addition, we would encourage the regulators to recognize the risk mitigation benefits of safe collateral to better reflect counterparty credit risks.</li>
<li><span>Operational Risk:</span>&nbsp;We welcome the apparent decision to revise the operational risk framework to provide for the netting of income and expenses related to fee-based capital markets services. While we will need to review the details, this type of change would better incentivize sound risk management practices and diversified business models.&nbsp; This is particularly important to critical functions such as retail financial advisory services and investment banking.&nbsp; The agencies should address other issues in the framework that arise from the application of standards that are designed for top-tier entities to subsidiaries and unduly penalize the subsidiaries of foreign banking organizations (FBOs).</li>
<li><span>Implementation Timeline:</span>Finally, the agencies should provide clarity around the Basel III implementation timeline in their re-proposal.&nbsp; We have called on the regulators to provide at least 18 months from completion of the final rule for firms to begin implementing the new framework.</li>
</ol>
<p>The testimony also addressed additional important reforms to the stress testing process, GSIB Surcharge and Long-Term Debt Proposals as well as the FDIC&rsquo;s recent proposal to revise the regulations surrounding brokered deposits.</p>

<title>Ontario Securities Commission Research Finds AI-Enhanced Scams Pose Significant Risk To Investors</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) today released&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/investors/artificial-intelligence-and-retail-investing-scams-and-effective-countermeasures"><em>Artificial Intelligence and Retail Investing: Scams and Effective Countermeasures</em></a>&nbsp;that found AI-enhanced scams pose significantly more risk to investors compared to conventional scams.</p>
<p>AI can be used to rapidly spread common investment fraud and make deepfakes and voice cloning investment schemes possible.<span>&nbsp;</span>An online investing simulation that tested investors&rsquo; susceptibility to fraudulent investments found that participants invested 22% more in AI-enhanced scams than in conventional scams.</p>
<p>The experiment also examined strategies that protect investors from AI-enabled fraud. Both the &ldquo;inoculation&rdquo; technique, which involves prior exposure to scams and increasing investor awareness, and a simulated web browser plug-in that flags potential scams, were found to effectively reduce the participants&rsquo; susceptibility. The inoculation technique reduced investment in fraudulent opportunities by 10%, while the web-browser plug-in reduced investment by 31%.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While AI can be utilized in ways that benefit investors, it becomes highly concerning when fraudsters use it to deceive investors,&rdquo; said Leslie Byberg, Executive Vice President, Strategic Regulation at the OSC. &ldquo;Finding promising ways to combat these heightened risks improves investor protection and increases Ontarians&rsquo; confidence in our capital markets."</p>
<p>This research builds on OSC&rsquo;s recently released report&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/investors/investor-research-and-reports/artificial-intelligence-and-retail-investing"><em>Artificial Intelligence and Retail Investing: Use Cases and Experimental Research</em></a>&nbsp;and reinforces the benefit of using behavioural science as a policy tool by regulators. As AI use in scams continues to increase, the OSC will undertake more research to help equip investors and market participants to spot the risks and protect themselves.</p>
<p>The OSC partnered with the&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="http://www.bi.team/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Behavioural Insights Team<span>&nbsp;</span></a><span>(BIT) to conduct this research.</span></p>

<title>SIFMA And SIFMA AMG Publish Master Treasury Securities Clearing Agreement</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sifma-and-sifma-amg-publish-master-treasury-securities-clearing-agreement/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>SIFMA and SIFMA&rsquo;s Asset Management Group (SIFMA AMG) today published the &ldquo;<a href="https://www.sifma.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-SIFMA-Master-Treasury-Securities-Clearing-Agreement-Done-With.pdf" target="_blank">2024 SIFMA Master Treasury Securities Clearing Agreement:&nbsp; Done-With</a>&rdquo; and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sifma.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-SIFMA-Master-Treasury-Securities-Clearing-Schedule-Done-With.docx">Schedule to the Agreement</a>&nbsp;to allow market participants, in connection with the expansion of clearing in the Treasury market, to meet their clearing documentation needs efficiently.&nbsp; As a result of the SEC&rsquo;s rule to require a significant portion of the Treasury cash and repo market to be cleared, many market participants will need to make appropriate arrangements to have their Treasury securities transactions cleared.&nbsp; The SEC&rsquo;s requirement is set to be fully implemented by June 2026.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Firms are planning for the transition to Treasury clearing, and we are encouraging&nbsp; industry participants to identify which transactions they conduct today that are in scope for the clearing mandate, how those transactions will get cleared, how to manage margin risk and payment arrangements for transactions, and above all, to have a transition plan in place, with people, processes, and legal staffing,&rdquo; said Rob Toomey, managing director and head of capital markets at SIFMA.&nbsp; &ldquo;The documents published today are designed to help firms create significant efficiencies as we move toward the effective date of the new clearing rule.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The agreement is the result of six months of work by a cross-section of the market involving broker-dealers and asset managers.&nbsp; The terms represent a starting point for individual negotiations between clearing members and their customers to tailor the terms to their unique commercial, legal, and operational positions and needs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The buy side has embraced the transition of various markets to central clearing, as it is both efficient and mitigates significant risk that was present in the market before the clearing mandate,&rdquo; said Bill Thum, managing director and associate general counsel in SIFMA&rsquo;s Asset Management Group.&nbsp; &ldquo;As we think about the transition of the Treasury market to clearing, we need to ensure that regulatory, accounting, and market structure challenges are successfully resolved and that liquidity is proven in the clearing space to demonstrate readiness for the mandate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both SIFMA and SIFMA AMG have long supported efforts to increase the resiliency of the Treasury market and stressed the need to ensure the Treasury market remains resilient and deeply liquid.&nbsp; SIFMA, SIFMA AMG and its members are pursuing a number of workstreams related to the Treasury clearing mandate to ensure a smooth transition while addressing issues involving regulatory, operations, and other market structure developments and enhancements.&nbsp; The next step will be to develop terms for &ldquo;done away&rdquo; trading to allow for firms to execute transactions with a variety of dealers while clearing through a single entity, and to publish a playbook focused on operational issues that firms can use as they work through the transition.</p>
<p>SIFMA thanks its outside counsel Cleary Gottlieb for leveraging its expertise in U.S. Treasury clearing to support the joint working group in developing the Agreement.</p>

<div> Treasury, Biden-Harris Administration, Voluntary Carbon Markets, Principles, Integrity<br />
Summary:<br />
Treasury's aggressive climate agenda, Principles for VCMs, emphasizing supply, demand, and market integrity, collaboration for market growth. <div>
<p>Thank you, Annette, for the kind introduction. And let me thank the Global Carbon Market Utility, the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (IC-VCM), and the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative for hosting me and this event today.</p>
<p>Over the past three and a half years, the Biden-Harris Administration has pursued an aggressive climate agenda, and Treasury has been proud to play a leading role. We lead the implementation of the many tax provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act, which are driving a record level of private sector investment in clean energy. We published the Principles for Net-Zero Financing and Investment to support financial institutions in pursuing credible and consistent net-zero commitments. And we are working to identify and address climate-related financial risks.</p>
<p>What we know and what all of you know is that this challenge requires all of us&mdash;government, the private sector, nonprofit organizations, experts, and academics. The need for our collaboration is clear when we think about Voluntary Carbon Markets (VCMs).</p>
<p>VCMs have the potential to create both economic and climate opportunities by channeling private capital to high-impact and cost-effective climate projects across technologies, ecosystems, and geographies. But today&rsquo;s markets face significant challenges that are holding back their growth.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why in May, with partners across our government, we launched the Principles for Responsible Participation in Voluntary Carbon Markets. We hope that these Principles can bring us closer to achieving functioning, high-integrity VCMs that live up to both the economic and climate potential we all believe in. I&rsquo;m grateful not only for those of you in this room who helped us form these Principles, but I&rsquo;m also grateful for the work we&rsquo;ve all done to make progress since their release.</p>
<p>The Principles emphasize the importance of supply integrity&mdash;the idea that credits should represent real emissions reductions or removals and avoid harm. In recent months, we&rsquo;ve seen steps taken to improve supply integrity. For example, the IC-VCM has started applying its Core Carbon Principle approved label to several methodologies. And, the CFTC provided final guidance for listing voluntary carbon credits on exchanges. These approvals and regulatory guidance are technical steps. They may lack the luster of a splashy investment announcement. But they are the exact kinds of steps we have to take to achieve the ambitious goals we are aspiring to.</p>
<p>The Principles also emphasize demand integrity&mdash;the idea that companies should make every effort to reduce direct emissions within their own value chains and then pursue carbon credits to complement those efforts. We have been happy to see companies developing transition plans and pursuing other efforts, alongside considering participation in VCMs. Because while VCMs are crucial to our goals, they are not in themselves sufficient, especially in their nascent stage.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Principles emphasize market integrity&mdash;the need to improve a currently fragmented market with more transparency. Increasing transparency around pricing and transaction data would help buyers reduce their risk, developers better predict their revenues, and financiers develop new products. I&rsquo;m glad that you&rsquo;ll get to hear later today from Treasury Under Secretary Nellie Liang on these issues and how we can make progress.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question that we have much more work to do. We at Treasury look forward to continuing to work with counterparts across our government, civil society organizations, the private sector, and international partners&mdash;bilaterally, and through groups like APEC and the G20.</p>
<p>VCMs hold significant potential. But we can only realize their promise if we are willing to take steps to overcome their challenges. I have confidence we can meet the moment because of the creativity, talent, and leadership of those of you in this room.</p>
<p>Thank you again for having me here today; I look forward to being your partner in this work.</p>

<title>CFTC Charges Texas Associated Person With Misappropriation Of Nonpublic Information And Execution Of Fictitious Trades</title>

<div> enforcement action, civil, CFTC, complaint, trading<br />Summary: The CFTC filed a civil enforcement action in Texas against John Cartwright for breaching his duties as a market intermediary. Miller and Classic were also involved. <div>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission announced today it filed a civil enforcement action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas against&nbsp;John Cartwright, a Houston resident.</p>
<p>The complaint charges Cartwright, an associated person of introducing broker Classic Energy LLC, received confidential information from a Classic customer for brokering natural gas block trades and tipped this information to Peter Miller, an individual proprietary trader. Miller, in turn, traded based on this information and shared his trading profits with Cartwright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Market intermediaries play a vital role ensuring markets for energy derivatives are competitive and liquid,&rdquo; said Director of Enforcement Ian McGinley. &ldquo;The CFTC vigorously pursues those who use their positions for personal gain by misappropriating their customers&rsquo; confidential information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The CFTC seeks monetary penalties, disgorgement, restitution, registration and trading bans, and a permanent injunction against further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations.</p>
<p>Case Background</p>
<p>The complaint alleges from at least June 2016 to September 2019, Cartwright, while employed by Classic, disclosed material nonpublic information obtained from his customer in breach of his duties to that customer.</p>
<p>Specifically, when this customer disclosed to Cartwright orders for block trades in natural gas futures, Cartwright disclosed this information only to Miller, who then traded using a spread trading strategy that involved entering into non-arm&rsquo;s length, fictitious block trades in financially settled natural gas futures contracts with the customer; and electronically executing physically-delivered natural gas futures trades for the same quantity and contract month.</p>
<p>By trading in this manner, Miller obtained advantageous prices for his block trades and sequenced his spread trades in a manner that maximized his ability to profit unlawfully. Cartwright provided legitimacy to the block trades by confirming their execution to NYMEX as if they were handled in the normal course of Cartwright&rsquo;s brokerage services. According to the complaint, Miller shared his profits from these trades with Cartwright.</p>
<p>The CFTC previously filed a complaint against Miller and entered an order against Classic for their roles in the scheme. [See CFTC Press Release Nos.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8396-21">8396-21</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8634-22">8634-22</a>]</p>
<p>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this case are Lauren Fulks, Alison Auxter, Thomas Simek, Christoper Reed, Charles Marvine, and former staff member Clem Ashley.&nbsp;</p>

<li>Finalises analytical report on liquidity risk insights from the 2023 banking turmoil.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Paragraph">The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision met virtually on 23&ndash;24 September to take stock of recent market developments and risks to the global banking system, and to discuss a range of policy and supervisory initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>Recent market developments</strong></p>
<p>Committee members discussed the spikes in market volatility in late July and early August. While the episodes were short-lived with no significant impact on the global banking system, they highlighted how the build-up of large, levered positions are prone to quick unwinding. They also underscored the importance of banks and supervisors continuing to vigilantly monitor and assess banks' interconnections with non-bank financial intermediaries.</p>
<p class="Paragraph">The Committee also discussed the series of operational disruptions in July, which resulted in outages across numerous sectors, including some banks. These incidents highlighted the importance of banks'&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d516.htm"><span class="firstword">operational</span>&nbsp;resilience</a>&nbsp;and management of third-party risks, and the systemic risks stemming from the reliance on the same third-party software or service. The Committee is currently consulting on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d577.htm"><span class="firstword">proposed</span></a>&nbsp;<em>Principles for the sound management of third-party risk</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Global systemically important banks</strong></p>
<p>The Committee approved the results of the end-2023 assessment exercise for G-SIBs. The results will be submitted to the Financial Stability Board before it publishes the 2024 list of G-SIBs.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2023 banking turmoil</strong></p>
<p>The Committee finalised an analytical progress report on the lessons learned from the 2023 banking turmoil. As requested by the Brazilian G20 Presidency, the report builds on the Committee's initial&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d555.pdf"><span class="firstword">report</span></a>&nbsp;on the turmoil, with a particular focus on its follow-up analytical work on liquidity risk. The progress report will be submitted to G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors and published next month.</p>
<p>The Committee also discussed progress on its work to strengthen supervisory effectiveness in the light of the lessons learned from last year's turmoil by developing a suite of practical tools to support supervisors in their day-to-day work. This work covers the supervision of liquidity risk and interest rate risk in the banking book, the sustainability assessment of banks' business models, and the importance of effective supervisory judgment.</p>
<p>This forms part of a series of follow-up initiatives by the Committee to last year's banking turmoil.</p>
<p><strong>Climate-related financial risks</strong></p>
<p>The Committee continued to review the comments received on its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d560.htm"><span class="firstword">consultation</span></a>&nbsp;proposing a Pillar 3 disclosure framework for climate-related financial risks.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Background</em></p>
<p class="Paragraph"><em>The Basel Committee is the primary global standard setter for the prudential regulation of banks and provides a forum for cooperation on banking supervisory matters. Its mandate is to strengthen the regulation, supervision and practices of banks worldwide with the purpose of enhancing financial stability. The Committee reports to the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision and seeks its endorsement for major decisions. The Committee has no formal supranational authority, and its decisions have no legal force. Rather, the Committee relies on its members' commitments to achieve its mandate. The Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision is chaired by Tiff Macklem, Governor of the Bank of Canada. The Basel Committee is chaired by Erik Thed&eacute;en, Governor of Sveriges Riksbank.&nbsp;</em></p>

<div> Climate Finance, Capacity Building, Emerging Markets, Global Platform, Coalition Launch
<br />
Summary:<br />
Global Capacity Building Coalition launches Digital Platform to provide climate finance support, doubles membership, and receives support from over 50 organizations worldwide. <div>
<ul>
<li><b><span>Michael R. Bloomberg and Mary Schapiro Announce Beta Launch of Platform to Support Financial Institutions Seeking to Build Climate Finance Technical Capacity and Resources</span></b></li>
<li><i style="font-family: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">Developed by the Global Capacity Building Coalition, the new Digital Platform is designed to be a go-to global resource for financial institutions developing climate action strategies, particularly in emerging markets and developing economies</i></li>
<li><i style="font-family: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">Following its launch at COP28 with 19 founding members, the Coalition&rsquo;s membership has now more than doubled to over 50 organizations</i></li>
</ul>
<p class="signature365-bom3nvt1"><span>At the Bloomberg Global Business Forum, Michael R. Bloomberg, U.N. Secretary-General&rsquo;s Special Envoy on Climate Ambition and Solutions, and Mary L. Schapiro, Chair of the Global Capacity Building Coalition (GCBC), launched the beta version of a new Digital Platform (<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="http://www.capacity-building.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.capacity-building.org</a>). The Digital Platform is designed to significantly increase the availability and effectiveness of climate finance capacity-building resources and programs for financial institutions, finance professionals, and others to support the climate transition around the world &ndash; particularly in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs).</span></p>
<p class="signature365-bom3nvt1"><b><span>Michael R. Bloomberg, U.N. Secretary-General&rsquo;s Special Envoy on Climate Ambition and Solutions said,&nbsp;</span></b><span>&ldquo;To avoid the worst effects of climate change, we need an enormous amount of new investment in clean energy, especially in emerging markets. This platform will give free resources and technical assistance to leaders in developing countries to help them cut emissions, drive economic growth, improve public health, and save lives.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="signature365-bom3nvt1"><span>In addition to developing the platform in its first year, the Coalition continued to grow into a leading global network for coordinating access to climate finance training and capacity-building programs. GCBC&rsquo;s membership has more than doubled, growing from 19 founding members to over 50 organizations. By welcoming the new supporter members, the GCBC is enhancing collaboration among organizations in the fragmented capacity-building ecosystem. The expanded engagement from members of the financial sector exemplifies the continued support and recognized importance of working together to promote economic growth, environmental resilience and public health in EMDEs.</span></p>
<p class="signature365-bom3nvt1"><span>The GCBC proudly encompasses a diverse global membership of more than 50 organizations, who, in the aggregate, work with over 5,000 public and private financial institutions, 160 financial centers and exchanges, 130 central banks and financial regulators, and millions of finance professionals. Our members are headquartered in Asia, Africa, North America and Europe.</span></p>
<p class="signature365-bom3nvt1"><b><span>Mary Schapiro, Chair of the Global Capacity Building Coalition, Chair of the Climate Steering Data Committee, and Vice-Chair of GFANZ said,</span></b><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Supporting emerging markets and developing economies in their transition to net zero is crucial to preventing the worst impacts of climate change. The launch of the beta platform and the addition of new members to the GCBC highlight the Coalition&rsquo;s dedication to this mission and showcase the strength of its collective expertise.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="signature365-bom3nvt1"><span>As the world races to meet critical decarbonization goals, EMDEs will require&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IHLEG-Finance-for-Climate-Action-1.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">$2.4 trillion</a>&nbsp;in annual climate finance by 2030 to build resilient, sustainable economies and enable the global transition to net zero, with around half of this finance expected to come from domestic resource mobilization. Yet for many, the path to mobilizing capital for the climate transition is murky and costly, the business case for action is not well-understood, and best practices are still emerging and developing. Capacity building can help address these challenges, but currently capacity building offerings for EDMEs are fragmented and difficult to navigate. A 2024 GCBC survey found 75% of financial institutions in EMDEs faced issues accessing relevant resources.</span></p>
<p class="signature365-bom3nvt1"><span>With the aim of becoming a world-leading comprehensive platform for tools and training on climate finance, the GCBC has developed a beta version of its online platform to help turbocharge climate and transition finance capacity building in EDMEs. The GCBC Digital Platform has been set up to be a one-stop shop for sharing high-quality climate finance capacity-building and technical assistance resources, focused especially on financial institutions and finance professionals in EMDEs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="signature365-bom3nvt1"><span>The GCBC was&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.bloomberg.org/press/un-agencies-multilateral-development-banks-private-sector-finance-and-philanthropy-leaders-unite-to-scale-climate-finance-capacity-building/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">launched</a>&nbsp;by the U.N. Secretary-General&rsquo;s Special Envoy on Climate Ambition and Solutions Michael R. Bloomberg, alongside senior leaders of multilateral development banks, finance, and international organizations at COP28 in December 2023. While many existing resources for capacity building remain inaccessible and can be costly for users, GCBC&rsquo;s Platform is freely available and removes barriers to critical information. The Coalition is designed to enhance collaboration and respond to growing requests for capacity-building support from financial institutions in EMDEs to meet the aims of the UN and the G20 Sustainable Finance Working Group (SFWG).</span></p>
<p class="signature365-bom3nvt1"><span>Since its launch last year, significant activity has been underway to build and populate the platform with the tools and information vital to improving knowledge of climate finance for financial institutions in EMDEs. The beta version of the platform includes a number of resources and functionality layers, including:&nbsp;</span></p>

</ul>
<p class="signature365-bom3nvt1"><span>The platform is accessible in the six official UN languages, plus Portuguese and Indonesian, to maximize global accessibility and engagement.</span></p>
<p class="signature365-bom3nvt1"><span>Alongside the beta launch, GCBC has also launched a 100-day global&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://imr.intellisurvey.com/pub/inv152022?ls=3" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">consultation</a>&nbsp;seeking user feedback on the Platform and on other activities to catalyze and convene global, regional, and national capacity-building ecosystems.</span></p>

<p class="signature365-bom3nvt1"><b><span>Tracy Vegro OBE, CEO of the Chartered Institute for Securities &amp; Investment (CISI) said: &ldquo;</span></b><span>As an educational charity and professional body with 53,000 global members working in the wealth management, capital markets and financial planning sectors, CISI fully supports the ambitions of the Global Capacity Building Coalition.</span></p>
<p class="signature365-bom3nvt1"><span>&ldquo;Leadership in the mobilisation of climate finance globally to accelerate the transition to sustainable economies is hugely important. As a signatory to the UK Sustainable Finance Education Charter, CISI is working to enhance the skills and knowledge of our finance sector professionals of the impact of climate change, pollution and biodiversity loss, and ultimately of the strategic, commercial and moral imperatives to develop clean, resilient and prosperous economies that work for all.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="signature365-bom3nvt1"><b><span>Scott Morris, Vice President, Asian Development Bank (ADB) said,</span></b><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;The Asian Development Bank recognizes that bolstering the capacity of developing member countries is crucial for helping operations and projects contribute to a net-zero economy.&nbsp;We commend the GCBC Platform as a comprehensive tool for enhancing climate finance capacity across Asia and the Pacific.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="signature365-bom3nvt1"><b><span>Helen Brand, Chief Executive, Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) said,&nbsp;</span></b><span>&ldquo;As a leading global professional accountancy organization ACCA (the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants) is proud to support the Global Capacity Building Coalition. Building capacity is particularly acute for emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) where ACCA, and many of its members and future members, are working hard to make a difference.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="signature365-bom3nvt1"><span>ACCA is aware of the need to address the lack of resources and information to efficiently and effectively finance the transition to net zero. This is why next week (27th September) ACCA is launching a groundbreaking Sustainability Diploma aimed at addressing the sustainability knowledge gap among financial professionals across the globe. Reducing barriers to knowledge and resources remains imperative to financing a global, just transition.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="signature365-bom3nvt1"><b><span>Katherine Stodulka, Chair, Blended Finance Taskforce said,</span></b><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;One of the biggest barriers to scaling climate finance in emerging markets is a lack of capacity &ndash; especially to build pipeline, to validate transition plans and to structure the right financing products. We have seen great examples where capacity building has helped unlock institutional capital for sustainable infrastructure deals &ndash; like Kenya&rsquo;s pension fund consortium which pooled expertise to validate the climate impact of certain transactions.&nbsp; But too often, the approach to capacity building is ad hoc, inconsistent and not locally led, with a lack of clarity about who provides what.&nbsp; I welcome the launch of the Global Capacity Building Coalition and its digital platform as a crucial step in tackling these capacity building gaps.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="signature365-bom3nvt1"><b><span>Lindsay Hooper, CEO, Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership (CISL) said,</span></b><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;We look forward to working within the Global Capacity Building Coalition to enhance capacity building support in parts of the world that are such an essential part of our global success in securing a sustainable future for all.</span></p>
<p class="signature365-bom3nvt1"><span>While predicting the future with certainty is impossible, and no-one can provide a blueprint for guaranteed success, education plays a vital role in enabling leaders to prepare and adapt for disruption and ultimately lead market shifts to enable the financing of the transition to a cleaner, fairer and more prosperous economies.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="signature365-bom3nvt1"><b><span>Mark Gough, CEO, Capitals Coalition said,&nbsp;</span></b><span>&ldquo;By fostering knowledge and capacity, we can empower individuals and organizations to create positive change. The Global Capacity Building Coalition&rsquo;s new Digital Platform is a vital tool for equipping people and directing finance towards what truly matters.&rdquo;</span></p>

<div> remitted, market abuse, transparency, European electricity, gas markets
Summary: ACER's open letter outlines requirements for EU representatives of non-EU market participants and new obligations for persons arranging transactions to comply with revised REMIT. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Regulation on Wholesale Energy Market Integrity and Transparency (REMIT) aims to prevent and protect consumers and businesses against market abuse in the European electricity and gas markets. The rules were revised in May 2024 to ensure they keep pace with evolving market dynamics.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Merrill Lynch And Harvest Volatility Management For Ignoring Client Instructions - SEC Penalizes Firms, Recovers More Than $6 Million Of Excess Fees Tied To Options Trading Strategy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> charges, clients, investment limits, penalties, violations
Summary: Harvest Volatility Management and Merrill Lynch charged for exceeding client investment limits, resulting in higher fees, increased market exposure, and investment losses. They agreed to settlements and penalties. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against Harvest Volatility Management LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc. for exceeding clients&rsquo; designated investment limits over a two-year period beginning in March 2016, which resulted in clients paying higher fees, being subjected to increased market exposure, and incurring investment losses. As part of the separate settlements, Harvest and Merrill have agreed to pay a combined $9.3 million in penalties and disgorgement to resolve the SEC&rsquo;s claims.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the SEC's orders, Harvest was the primary investment adviser and portfolio manager for the Collateral Yield Enhancement Strategy (CYES), which traded options in a volatility index with the aim of generating incremental returns. The SEC&rsquo;s orders find that, starting in 2016, Harvest allowed scores of accounts to exceed the exposure levels that investors designated when they signed up to the CYES strategy, including dozens of accounts that exceeded the limit by 50 percent or more. Merrill and Harvest received larger management fees when investors&rsquo; exposure levels climbed above pre-set levels and exposed investors to greater financial risks. The SEC order as to Merrill finds that it introduced its clients to Harvest and received part of Harvest&rsquo;s management and incentive fees, as well as trading commissions. It also finds that Merrill was aware that investors&rsquo; exposure to CYES was exceeding pre-set exposure levels and failed adequately to inform affected CYES investors, most of whom had existing advisory relationships with Merrill. The SEC&rsquo;s orders also find that Harvest and Merrill neglected to adopt and implement policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that they disclosed all material facts to their clients and alerted them to the excessive exposure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this case, two investment advisers allegedly sold a complex options trading strategy to their clients, but failed to abide by basic client instructions or implement and adhere to appropriate policies and procedures,&rdquo; said Mark Cave, Associate Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Enforcement Division. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s action holds Merrill and Harvest accountable for dropping the ball in executing these basic duties to their clients, even as their clients&rsquo; financial exposure grew well beyond predetermined limits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC's orders find that Harvest and Merrill violated Sections 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-7 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the findings, Harvest and Merrill agreed to be censured, to cease-and-desist orders, and to penalties of $2 million and $1 million, respectively. Harvest will also pay $3.5 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, while Merrill will pay $2.8 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest.</p>
<p>The SEC's investigation was conducted by Bobby Gray, Matthew Finnegan, and Suzanne Romajas, under the supervision of Jeff Leasure and Mr. Cave.</p>

<p>Caroline Elliott-Grey, senior product manager, U.K. and Ireland insurance, for LexisNexis Risk Solutions said: "Historically, smaller brokers have struggled to access and leverage the range and depth of perils data used by insurers, larger brokers and managing general agents (MGAs). However, with severe weather events in recent years, brokers are under pressure to assess property risks more fully for their insurance partners and to be better prepared to explain to their customers some of the property characteristics and environmental factors that go into insurance decisions and secure instant premiums."</p>
<p>In 2022, the U.K. endured a heatwave that pushed temperatures past 40&deg;C for the first time<sup>iii</sup>. This resulted in the equivalent of one new subsidence claim made every 15 minutes<sup><sup>iv</sup>&nbsp;</sup>in the second half of the year. More recently, data from the Association of British Insurers (ABI)<sup>v</sup>&nbsp;shows that subsidence payouts for home insurance claims hit &pound;60 million in the second quarter of 2024 &ndash; the highest quarterly figure on record.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Caroline Elliott-Grey continues: "LexisNexis Geospatial Risks&nbsp;has been developed to give smaller brokers the essential facts about the risk and characteristics of the properties for which they are seeking quotes in a very simplified and efficient way. This has multiple benefits &ndash; consumers will enjoy faster, more accurate quotes; insurance partners will have better visibility of the risks upfront; and brokers will be enabled to work more efficiently, enhance customer satisfaction and improve their insurer relationships."</p>

<div> Easing inflation, global commerce, fiscal challenges, public debt, developing economies <br />
<br />Summary: Easing inflation and resilient global commerce offer reasons for optimism, but fiscal challenges, public debt, and defaults loom large in both advanced and developing economies. <div>
<ul>
<li>Easing inflation and resilient global commerce offer some reasons for optimism but fiscal challenges loom large.</li>
<li>53% of chief economists identify public debt as a major risk to stability in advanced economies; 64% express similar concerns for developing economies.</li>
<li>Almost 40% of experts surveyed expect defaults to rise in developing economies over the next year.</li>
<li>Read the report&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/chief-economists-outlook-september-2024/" target="_blank">here</a></span>. Follow the Sustainable Development Impact Meetings 2024&nbsp;<a href="https://www.weforum.org/events/sustainable-development-impact-meetings-2024/" id="menur6ug" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="https://www.weforum.org/events/sustainable-development-impact-meetings-2024/">here</a>&nbsp;and on social media using #SDIM24.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Easing inflation and strong global commerce are fuelling cautious optimism for recovery but elevated debt levels are becoming a growing concern in both advanced (53%) and developing (64%) economies, according to the latest&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/chief-economists-outlook-september-2024/" target="_blank">Chief Economists Outlook</a><span>&nbsp;published today by the World Economic Forum.</span><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><span>The report, based on a survey of leading chief economists, highlights that debt levels and fiscal challenges are placing significant pressure on economies worldwide leaving them vulnerable to future crises. A growing concern is a potential "fiscal squeeze", where rising debt-servicing costs limit governments to invest in essential sectors such as infrastructure, education and healthcare. In developing economies, 39% of economists expect an increase in defaults over the next year.</span><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><span>&ldquo;The global economy may be stabilizing, but fiscal challenges continue to pose significant risks," said Saadia Zahidi, Managing Director, World Economic Forum. "Addressing these challenges requires coordinated efforts from policy-makers and stakeholders to ensure that economic recovery is not undermined by these pressures. Now is the time for pragmatic solutions that can strengthen both fiscal resilience and long-term growth."</span><br /><br /><img height="455" src="https://mcusercontent.com/6308fe51b420dc9ff3834abc8/images/5d412a86-266e-b07b-e338-456b913f26a6.png" width="500" /><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><strong>Regional outlook: Diverging economic growth and debt risks</strong><br /><span>The global economic outlook varies sharply across regions. In the&nbsp;</span><strong>United States</strong><span>, nearly 90% of chief economists anticipate moderate or strong growth in 2024 and 2025 reflecting confidence in a "soft landing" after a period of tight monetary policy. Some 80% of those surveyed agree that the outcome of the United States election will significantly influence global economic policy, with many citing election-related risks as a major concern for the year ahead.</span><br /><br /><span>In contrast, nearly three-quarters of respondents expect weak growth for the remainder of the year in&nbsp;</span><strong>Europe</strong><span>. Similarly,&nbsp;</span><strong>China</strong><span>&rsquo;s struggles persist, with almost 40% of economists forecasting weak or very weak growth in both 2024 and 2025.</span><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><span>Elsewhere, growth prospects are mixed. In&nbsp;</span><strong>sub-Saharan Africa</strong><span>, a moderate or stronger growth trajectory is anticipated, with expectations improving from 55% in 2024 to 71% in 2025. The&nbsp;</span><strong>Middle East and North Africa&nbsp;</strong><span>region remains uncertain, while&nbsp;</span><strong>Latin America</strong><span>&nbsp;is expected to see modest improvements, with a slight uptick in growth in 2025.&nbsp;</span><strong>South Asia</strong><span>&nbsp;also stands out, with over 70% of economists predicting strong or very strong growth in 2024 and 2025, driven by India&rsquo;s robust performance.</span><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><span>Global inflation continues to ease, with many chief economists expressing optimism for next year. In the US, the share of chief economists expecting high inflation drops from 21% in 2024 to 6% in 2025.

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority: Proposed New Rules To Better Protect Customers Of Payments Firms</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> customers, payments firms, safeguarding, FCA, e-money<br />
Summary: The FCA is proposing stronger safeguarding rules for payments and e-money firms to protect customers if the firms go out of business. <br /> <div>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA is stepping in to better protect customers when payments and e-money firms go out of business.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>Use of payments firms has grown in recent years, but the FCA says it continues to see poor safeguarding practices from firms.</p>
<p>Funds held by payments and e-money firms are not directly protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). Instead, firms must safeguard funds which can mean customers lose money or experience delays to funds being returned if the firm fails.</p>
<p>The FCA wrote to payments and e-money CEOs in March 2023 about their safeguarding and wind-down arrangements and has since opened supervisory cases relating to approximately 15% of firms that safeguard, to address its concerns.</p>
<p>Matthew Long, Director of Payments and Digital Assets, said:</p>
<p>'We&rsquo;re consulting on proposals to make safeguarding rules stronger and clearer for payment and e-money firms so customers get as much of their money back as quickly as possible if the firm goes out of business.'</p>
<p>Under the FCA&rsquo;s proposals, the existing e-money safeguarding regime will be replaced with a client assets (CASS) style regime designed to work with payments firms&rsquo; business models. It will also publish strengthened interim safeguarding rules for firms by the middle of next year.</p>
<p>The FCA&rsquo;s cost benefit analysis (CBA) of its proposals has also been subject to review by the new independent CBA Panel.</p>
<p>Firms can respond to the FCA&rsquo;s consultation by 17 December 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<div> Consolidated Tape, FairCT, Transparency, UK Fixed Income Markets, Collaboration<br />
Summary:<br />
FairCT, a collaborative consolidated tape initiative, aims to enhance transparency, provide timely and accurate data, and lower the cost of data access in the UK fixed income markets. <div>
<p>Ediphy, the fixed income technology provider, together with a roster of industry-leading firms, today announces the launch of fairCT, a collaborative consolidated tape initiative designed to enhance transparency, liquidity and participation in UK fixed income markets.</p>
<p>Co-ordinated by Ediphy, fairCT brings together a diverse group of companies committed to delivering the best possible consolidated tape for the benefit of all industry stakeholders. Operating under the terms set out by the FCA, the&nbsp;consolidated&nbsp;tape&nbsp;provider&nbsp;will be an industry utility, built with an &lsquo;at reasonable cost&rsquo; philosophy.</p>
<p>Participants include well-recognised industry names such as Cboe Global Markets, FactSet, Google Cloud, Norges Bank Investment Management, TP ICAP and UBS. The initiative remains open to engaging with others&nbsp;who, like those above, can meaningfully contribute to the establishment of a consolidated tape provider.</p>
<h4><b>Key Highlights:</b></h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Industry Collaboration:</b>&nbsp;fairCT represents the full spectrum of the financial industry, ensuring a comprehensive and unified approach to market data consolidation.</li>
<li><b>Timely and Accurate Data:</b>&nbsp;The consolidated tape will serve as the official record of trades, bridging the gap between premium proprietary data products and free, non-aggregated, delayed data.</li>
<li><b>Lower Cost of Data Access:</b>&nbsp;fairCT addresses the FCA&rsquo;s priority to lower the costs of accessing trading data and market participation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Bond trading in the UK is currently fragmented, with liquidity spread across numerous trading venues and various lit and dark trading protocols. Despite significant regulatory improvements, the industry still faces challenges in providing timely and accurate information to investors. fairCT shares the FCA&rsquo;s commitment to enhancing market integrity and Consumer Duty and addresses these challenges by offering a consolidated tape that aligns with the&nbsp;spirit of the UK regulatory framework.</p>
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.ediphy.io/meet-ediphy/chris-murphy" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><b>Chris Murphy</b></a><b>, CEO of Ediphy&nbsp;</b>a respected industry expert and early advocate in consolidated tape matters, commented:</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Our approach is fundamentally different from other contenders. First, we aim to return any economic value generated by the consolidated tape provider over its costs and reasonable returns to the users of the tape. Second, we have built this initiative as a collaboration between multiple participants representing all stakeholder groups.</i></p>
<p><i>No other potential tape provider brings this diversity of experience nor delivers as fully on the alignment of product and customer needs, as proposed under the FCA Consumer Duty commitment.&rdquo;</i></p>

<title>ASIC's Vanguard Greenwashing Action Results In Record $12.9 Million Penalty</title>

<div> penalty, Vanguard Investments Australia, misleading claims, ESG exclusionary screens, ASIC

Summary:<br />ASIC orders Vanguard to pay $12.9M penalty for misleading claims about ESG screening. Vanguard misrepresented ethical characteristics, benefiting from misleading conduct. Greenwashing remains an enforcement priority. <div>
<p>The Federal Court today ordered Vanguard Investments Australia to pay a $12.9 million penalty for making misleading claims about environmental, social and governance (ESG) exclusionary screens.</p>
<p>These screens were applied to investments in the Vanguard Ethically Conscious Global Aggregate Bond Index Fund.</p>
<p>ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said, &lsquo;This is an important decision and the penalty imposed is the highest yet for greenwashing conduct. Greenwashing is a serious threat to the integrity of the Australian financial system, and remains an enforcement priority for ASIC.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Vanguard admitted it misled investors that these funds would be screened to exclude bond issuers with significant business activities in certain industries, including fossil fuels, when this was not always the case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is essential that companies do not misrepresent that their products or investment strategies are environmentally friendly, sustainable, or ethical. The size of the penalty should send a strong deterrent message to others in the market to carefully review any sustainable investment claims.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Justice O&rsquo;Bryan said &lsquo;Vanguard&rsquo;s contraventions should be regarded as serious. Vanguard&rsquo;s misrepresentations concerned the principal distinguishing feature of the Fund, being its &ldquo;ethical&rdquo; characteristics. Vanguard developed and promoted the Fund in response to market demand for investment funds having those characteristics.</p>
<p>&lsquo;By its misleading conduct, Vanguard misrepresented the &ldquo;ethical&rdquo; characteristics of the Fund. Approximately 74% of the securities in the Fund by market value were not researched or screened against applicable ESG criteria. Further, Vanguard benefited from its misleading conduct. The misrepresentations enhanced Vanguard&rsquo;s ability to attract investors to the Fund, and enhanced Vanguard&rsquo;s reputation as a provider of investment funds with ESG characteristics, as compared to what would have been the case if Vanguard had accurately disclosed the ESG screening limitations and the Fund&rsquo;s exposure to issuers engaged in the excluded industries.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The claims were made in a range of public communications, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>12 product disclosure statements</li>
<li>A media release</li>
<li>Statements published on Vanguard&rsquo;s website</li>
<li>A Finance News Network interview on YouTube, and</li>
<li>A presentation at a Finance News Network Fund Manager Event which was published online.</li>
</ul>
<p>Investments held by the Fund were based on an index called the Bloomberg Barclays MSCI Global Aggregate SRI Exclusions Float Adjusted Index. Vanguard had claimed the Index excluded only companies with significant business activities in a range of industries, including those involving fossil fuels, but has admitted that certain securities in the Index and the Fund were from issuers that were not researched or screened against applicable ESG criteria.</p>

<div> fine, manipulation, market integrity, Macquarie, ASIC<br />
Summary: Macquarie Bank Limited fined $4.995 million for failure to prevent manipulation in electricity futures market, highest penalty imposed by MDP. ASIC issued multiple alerts to Macquarie regarding suspicious orders. Failure to respond to ASIC's concerns regarding energy market volatility was an aggravating factor in determining the size of the penalty. Macquarie's failure to appreciate the seriousness of its obligations and take ownership of its conduct was noted. Energy markets experienced extreme volatility, creating conditions incentivizing market manipulation in futures contracts. MDP also issued fines to other entities for market gatekeeper failures and manipulation in wheat futures market. Macquarie did not contest the alleged breaches and has paid the fine. Compliance with the infringement notice is not an admission of guilt or liability. <div>
<p>Following an ASIC investigation, the Markets Disciplinary Panel (MDP) has fined Macquarie Bank Limited (Macquarie) a record $4.995 million for failing to prevent suspicious orders being placed on the electricity futures market. This is the highest penalty ever imposed by the MDP.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 50 occasions, from January to September 2022, Macquarie breached market integrity rules by permitting three of its clients to place suspicious orders.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each order displayed characteristics of an intention to &lsquo;mark the close&rsquo;, meaning each order was placed within the last minute of market close, impacting the daily settlement price, in a direction favourable to the client&rsquo;s existing interest in that contract.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>MDP found Macquarie should have suspected each of the 50 orders were submitted with the intention of creating a false or misleading appearance in the market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ASIC Chair Joe Longo said, &lsquo;The record penalty imposed by the MDP reflects the serious, prolonged and potential systemic failures by Macquarie to detect and prevent suspected manipulation in the ASX 24 market for energy derivatives. Macquarie is the largest market participant in energy derivatives and given its role as a gatekeeper, it must ensure suspicious orders are not permitted to be placed on our markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We put Macquarie on notice about suspicious orders placed by its clients on numerous occasions and it repeatedly failed to take timely action to address the conduct of its clients and the gap in its surveillance capability. As a consequence, it permitted further suspicious orders to be placed on the market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The consequences of manipulating energy markets can have a detrimental flow on impact to supplier funding costs, and in turn energy prices. This can lead to higher energy bills for consumers who are already struggling with the cost of living.&rsquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Macquarie&rsquo;s conduct occurred during a period of unprecedented volatility in energy markets globally stemming from supply issues and the Russia and Ukraine war. ASIC contacted Macquarie on six separate occasions to alert it to ASIC&rsquo;s concerns about volatility in energy markets or suspicious trading by Macquarie&rsquo;s clients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The MDP found that Macquarie&rsquo;s failure to respond to ASIC&rsquo;s concerns in the context of the heightened need to monitor the electricity futures market was an aggravating factor in determining the size of the penalty.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further, the MDP found Macquarie had failed to appreciate the seriousness of its obligations as a Market Participant to act promptly and appropriately upon what were obvious risks of deficiencies in its surveillance system and had not at the time, taken full ownership or responsibility for its conduct.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The MDP also noted that Macquarie is responsible and accountable for the conduct of its staff and if matters were not escalated when they should be, it may suggest more systemic issues regarding the culture and reporting within Macquarie.</p>
<h2>Background&nbsp;</h2>
<p>In 2022, energy markets experienced a lengthy period of extreme volatility, creating conditions that can incentivise market manipulation in futures contracts. When a person manipulates the closing price of the daily settlement price of the ASX 24 electricity futures contracts, the person benefits at the expense of others in the market with opposing positions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rule 3.1.2(1)(b)(iii) of the ASIC Market Integrity Rules (Futures Markets) 2017 prohibits a market participant from offering to purchase or sell a contract on account of another person, where taking into account the circumstances of the order, a market participant ought reasonably suspect that the other person has placed the order with the intention of creating a false or misleading appearance of active trading in any contract or with respect to the market for, or the price of, any contract.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those on the other side of the price movement can be exposed to larger variation margin calls or reduced notional profits, which can lead to cost of funding pressures, and has the potential to lead to flow on cost effects to the customers of those impacted. This was especially heightened in circumstances where many Australian energy suppliers and retailers were extremely sensitive to price variations at the time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Market misconduct in energy and commodities derivatives markets was an ASIC enforcement priority in 2023. Macquarie is the largest market participant in the ASX 24 electricity futures market, accounting for approximately 58% of all electricity futures orders placed on the ASX 24 market in 2022.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the MDP fine issued to Macquarie:</p>
<ul>
<li>in May 2024, the MDP fined J.P. Morgan Securities Australia Limited $775,000 for market gatekeeper failures in relation to suspicious orders by its client in the ASX24 wheat futures market (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-093mr-j-p-morgan-securities-775-000-penalty-for-market-gatekeeper-failure/" title="24-093MR J.P. Morgan Securities $775,000 penalty for market gatekeeper failure">24-093MR</a>), and</li>
<li>in July 2024, ASIC commenced civil penalty proceedings against COFCO International Australia Pty Ltd and COFCO Resources SA for alleged manipulation in the ASX24 wheat futures market (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-163mr-asic-sues-cofco-international-australia-pty-ltd-and-cofco-resources-sa-for-futures-market-manipulation/" title="24-163MR ASIC sues COFCO International Australia Pty Ltd and COFCO Resources SA for futures market manipulation">24-163MR</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Macquarie did not contest the alleged breaches of Rule 3.1.2(1)(b)(iii) of the&nbsp;<em>ASIC Market Integrity Rules (Futures Markets) 2017.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Macquarie has complied with the Infringement Notice and paid the fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compliance with the infringement notice is not an admission of guilt or liability and by doing so, Macquarie is not taken to have contravened subsection 798H(1) of the Corporations Act.&nbsp;</p>

<div> Geopolitical tensions, ASEAN, private capital, Singapore, ESG<br />
Summary:<br />
Private markets can drive Asia's growth, with opportunities in ASEAN. Singapore offers an ideal platform, and EESG investments can drive progressive and purposeful capital. <div>
<p>Distinguished guests,<br /><br />Ladies and gentlemen,<br /><br />1.&nbsp;<span> </span>Good morning to all of you.<br /><br />2.&nbsp;<span> </span>I am happy to join all of you here at the SuperReturn Asia conference.</p>
<p>a. Since its debut in Singapore in 2022, SuperReturn Asia has served as a valuable platform for private equity and venture capital professionals to network and discuss investment trends, strategies and opportunities.<br /><br />b. The strong turnout today reflects the value of the event to our investors and fund managers.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;<span> </span>One of the predominant themes across regional and global conferences is that of geopolitical tensions, especially between the US and China.</p>
<p>a. As they are the two largest economies of the world, accounting for about 40% of global GDP,<br /><br />b. Their strategic rivalry has caused significant impact beyond both countries, especially on trade and investment.<br /><br /></p>
<p><span>Asia &ndash; A Region of Opportunities</span><br /><br />4.&nbsp;<span> </span>Despite such geo-economic tension, Asia &ndash; and in particular, ASEAN &ndash; remains a glowing, bright spot.</p>
<p>a. Against the backdrop of a 10% decline in global Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flows, FDI flows to ASEAN held strong, and reached a high of US$230 billion in 2023.<br /><br />b. FDI in financial activities was the highest contributor of inflows to ASEAN last year, increasing by 52% to US$92 billion. This was followed by US$51 billion of manufacturing investments, and US$21 billion of investments in professional, scientific and R&amp;D activities.<br /><br />c. The US was the single largest contributor, accounting for about one-third of the FDI flows. China was third, accounting for 8% of the flows, following an increase of 20%.<br /><br />d. The renewable energy supply chain was a major recipient of FDI in ASEAN.</p>
<p>i. Between 2020 and 2023, renewable energy-related industries attracted an average of more than US$27 billion of investments annually, about 25% of all announced greenfield investment activities.<br /><br />ii. These include critical minerals, extraction and processing, renewables manufacturing, and renewable power generation.</p>
<p>e. Looking ahead, there is good reason to be optimistic about ASEAN, and Asia.</p>
<p>i. Riding on a young and growing population, ASEAN is poised to become the fourth largest economy in the world.<br /><br />ii. And including China and India, Asia is expected to account for 40 &ndash; 50% of global GDP by 2030.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;<span> </span>Private capital has the opportunity to write the next chapter of Asia&rsquo;s growth story, and contribute towards uplifting the lives of generations to come.</p>
<p>a. Over the past five years, private markets have experienced robust growth, with assets under management (AUM) expanding significantly across various asset classes.</p>
<p>i. According to McKinsey&rsquo;s Global Private Markets Review 2024, private markets&rsquo; AUM totalled US$13.1 trillion as of mid-2023, after growing at nearly 20% per annum since 2018.</p>
<p>b. Despite potential headwinds and uncertainties, S&amp;P Global projects that private markets will reach more than US$18 trillion by 2027, propelled by the strong growth of private credit, real assets and secondary markets.</p>
<p>i. However, when broken down by region, we see that more than half of private markets&rsquo; AUM remains invested in North America, while Europe and Asia-Pacific are at just about 20% each.</p>
<p>c. With the anticipated growth of private markets in Asia, there is room for us to diversify and allocate a higher proportion of the AUM in private markets into Asia.<br /><br /></p>
<p>6.&nbsp;<span> </span>Let me share three ways to do this.</p>
<p>a. First, we can channel more private capital to support the growth of enterprises in our region.</p>
<p>i. Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (or MSMEs) play a critical role in the economies of ASEAN member countries.</p>
<p>1. More than 90% of all enterprises in ASEAN are SMEs.<br /><br />2. They contribute about 50% of ASEAN&rsquo;s combined GDP<br /><br />3. And employ about 85% of the total workforce.</p>
<p>ii. However, many of them face challenges in raising capital.</p>
<p>1. In particular, because many of them have less well-established bank relationships compared to multinationals, they face tighter covenant enforcement and tougher credit requirements.</p>
<p>iii. In this regard, private capital can play a catalytic role in unlocking the growth potential of MSMEs, such as through providing the following services -</p>
<p>1. Growth capital funds or venture debt, to help MSMEs expand into new growth markets;<br /><br />2. Expertise in business management, regional expansion, and innovation that MSMEs typically lack; and<br /><br />3. Working capital to manage short-term cashflow challenges, without diluting equity unnecessarily, especially for business owners looking to retain control over their companies.</p>
<p>iv. Let me highlight two such examples.</p>
<p>1. First, Durapower.</p>
<p>a. Durapower is an innovator of lithium-ion cell technology, offering closed-loop, end-to-end energy storage solutions for electric mobility and renewable energy applications.<br /><br />b. They have a presence in more than 20 countries, and they are expanding into Southeast Asia, China, and Europe.<br /><br />c. Private capital can play a role in supporting their growth in markets across the globe, and build a diversified manufacturing base.</p>
<p>2. Next, Commonwealth Capital.</p>
<p>a. They are a leading industry player in Singapore&rsquo;s food sector with significant operations along the value chain from food services to logistics.<br /><br />b. As part of their growth plans, they are looking to expand their logistics business into specialist pharma logistics, and acquiring cold chain logistics players in the region to capture overseas growth opportunities.<br /><br />c. Private capital can play a role in supporting the growth of Commonwealth Capital, by supplementing bank financing in their capital investments.</p>
<p>b. Second, beyond supporting the MSMEs, private capital can play a role in driving the region&rsquo;s green and transition finance needs.</p>
<p>i. Asia accounts for half of global emissions, and there is immense pressure for this to continue growing.</p>
<p>1. Energy demand in Asia is growing by about 3% annually, the highest of any region around the world.<br /><br />2. It is also expected to account for 90% of the world&rsquo;s future growth in energy demand.</p>
<p>ii. We therefore need to facilitate Asia&rsquo;s carbon transition, and do so urgently.</p>
<p>1. This includes investing in renewable energy production, such as in hydropower, solar or low-carbon ammonia or hydrogen.<br /><br />2. This also includes enhancing grid connectivity and the capacity for transmission and storage, so that we can allow for cross-border electricity trading and facilitate the establishment of the ASEAN Power Grid.<br /><br />3. This also includes phasing out Asia&rsquo;s coal-fired power plants, many of which still have a long operational lifespan of at least 30 years.</p>
<p>iii. Private market financing can play a role by directing capital towards ventures that drive decarbonisation, resource efficiency, and responsible infrastructure development.<br /><br />iv. To catalyse commercial capital for transition and marginally bankable green projects, we have set up a blended finance platform called Financing Asia&rsquo;s Transition Partnership or FAST-P, with a target fund size of US$5 billion.</p>
<p>1. We will contribute concessional capital towards this platform, alongside multilateral development banks, development finance institutions and philanthropies.<br /><br />2. In turn, this aims to crowd in commercial capital to achieve a lower blended cost of capital, so as to support transition and decarbonisation projects that may otherwise not be able to obtain commercial funding.<br /><br />3. We hope this will improve the bankability of projects and give confidence to investors to mobilise their private capital into these projects.<br /><br />4. I invite asset owners and lenders to join us in FAST-P, so that together, we can bridge the financing gap in enabling Asia&rsquo;s climate transition.<br /><br />5. This will be critical to mitigating the impact of climate change on lives and livelihoods in Asia.</p>
<p>c. Third, private capital can drive the growth of the digital economy in Asia.</p>
<p>i. ASEAN&rsquo;s digital economy is projected to grow from US$300 billion to US$1 trillion by 2030. We are in the midst of negotiating an ASEAN Digital Economy Framework Agreement, which is projected to double this value contribution to US$2 trillion.<br /><br />ii. From digital payments, to e-commerce, to digital infrastructure, there is huge potential for digital technologies to transform the way people consume information, buy goods and services, and use financial services.<br /><br />iii. We have seen a good number of promising tech start-ups in Asia, in sectors ranging from aquaculture to logistics to fintech.</p>
<p>1. I had the opportunity recently to meet with the co-founder and CEO of Indonesian start-up company eFishery, Mr Gibran Huzaifah.</p>
<p>a. Since its founding in 2013, eFishery has grown to be the largest digital cooperative chain for fish and shrimp farmers, providing affordable financing and fair market access to over 70,000 farmers across Indonesia.</p>
<p>iv. Start-ups like eFishery will need multiple rounds of fundraising to scale.</p>
<p>1. While venture capital funding in Southeast Asia had taken a hit in the past two years in line with global trends, it is expected that the region&rsquo;s strong bench of start-ups will be able to continue to draw in investors.<br /><br />2. More fundamentally, within this community, I hope we can find a structural solution to fill the funding gap that start-ups face between series B and C stages.</p>
<p>a. In particular, there is room for private credit to provide non-dilutive financing that can complement equity and debt financing, by providing flexibility through customised deal structures.</p>
<p>3. Ultimately, we need a variety of funding instruments &ndash; including seed funds, short-term loans, venture debt and equity financing &ndash; to build and sustain the wide range of early- and late-stage companies in the region.<br /><br /></p>
<p><span>Singapore &ndash; A Hub for Enterprises and Financing</span><br /><br />7.&nbsp;<span> </span>Just as how Changi Airport plays a key role as a hub for regional and global air connectivity, Singapore plays a key role in intermediating capital flows and investment opportunities. We have a strong ecosystem here in Singapore, which can help the private markets community tap on and unlock Asia&rsquo;s potential.</p>
<p>a. First, we will continue to maintain a conducive environment for businesses to set up in Singapore.</p>
<p>i. Over the years, we have built up a reputation for our regulatory environment, stable and efficient infrastructure, access to financial intermediation and services, and strong rule of law.<br /><br />ii. We hope this will not only attract more companies in our region to set up in Singapore, but also encourage private equity managers to promote Singapore as a springboard into the region for their portfolio companies.</p>
<p>1. One such example is Straive, which the Partners Group had a majority stake in from 2017 to 2021.<br /><br />2. Under the ownership of Partners Group, Straive transformed from a provider of content services into a technology-driven content, data and EdTech solutions company.<br /><br />3. As part of its transformation, Straive moved its headquarters to Singapore, and now serves over 300 customers in 30 countries worldwide.</p>
<p>b. Second, we will continue to offer various fund structures and investment platforms to reduce costs and improve efficiency for both investors and fund managers.</p>
<p>i. For example, in 2020, we launched the Variable Capital Company (VCC) structure, a flexible corporate structure for investment funds.<br /><br />ii. The VCC has given fund managers greater flexibility, as it allows different investment strategies &ndash; such as real estate, private equity, and public and private credit &ndash; to be employed in different sub-funds, but overseen by a single board of directors.<br /><br />iii. To date, we have more than 1,100 VCCs set up by traditional and private market managers for a variety of use cases and fund strategies.<br /><br />iv. The availability of VCCs also facilitates the co-location of fund vehicles with their Singapore-based manager in the same jurisdiction, which provides greater ease of regulatory compliance and access to tax treaties.</p>
<p>c. Third, we will continue to deepen the pool of investors and asset owners based in Singapore.</p>
<p>i. These range from large institutional investors and sovereign wealth funds, to smaller family offices and high net worth clients.<br /><br />ii. We welcome investors from over the world, including those who set up family offices here, to tap on our investment ecosystem.<br /><br />iii. We are also heartened to see financial institutions enhancing their capabilities in Singapore in order to better seize opportunities here.</p>
<p>1. For example, Blackstone has expanded its Private Equity team in Singapore to support its investments in this region, as they see Singapore as an important centre for institutional and individual capital raising as well as the investment gateway to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>iv. Singapore also offers a diverse base of professional advisors and service providers to support complex transactions, including secondary deals which are highly intermediated and involve multiple counterparties.<br /><br /></p>
<p><span>Conclusion</span><br /><br />8.&nbsp;<span> </span>Let me conclude.<br /><br />9.&nbsp;<span> </span>Even as geopolitical tensions between the US and China cloud the investment climate, Asia &ndash; and in particular, ASEAN &ndash; offers significant potential for growth.</p>
<p>a. In this regard, private capital can play an important role in shaping the future of this region, especially through supporting local enterprises, enabling the carbon and energy transition, and stimulating the growth of the digital economy.<br /><br />b. Singapore, at the heart of Southeast Asia, offers the ideal platform for private market players to make inroads into the region.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp;<span> </span>Many investors assess potential investments on ESG, or environmental, social and governance. I encourage this community here today to explore how we can mobilise private capital for EESG, or environmental, economic and social good.<br /><br />11.&nbsp;<span> </span>This way, we can not only boast of private capital, but also of progressive, productive and purposeful capital.<br /><br />12.&nbsp;<span> </span>With that, I wish you all a fruitful conference and a pleasant stay in Singapore.<br /><br />13.&nbsp;<span> </span>Thank you.</p>

<div> penalty, swaps reporting, CIBC, enforcement, regulations
Summary:<br />Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce fined $1.25 million for late reporting of swap transactions, but received reduced penalty for cooperation and remediation efforts. <div>
<p><span><span><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an order simultaneously filing and settling charges with&nbsp;<span>Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce&nbsp;</span>(CIBC) for repeatedly failing to timely report swap transactions to a registered swap data repository as required by the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC Regulations.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The order imposes a $1.25 million civil monetary penalty and orders CIBC to cease and desist from violating the CEA and CFTC regulations as charged. CIBC also admits the facts detailed in the order.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>&ldquo;Timely swaps reporting is a critical component of the swaps reporting regulatory regime, and it is essential to the overall effectiveness of the swaps reporting system,&rdquo; said Division of Enforcement Director Ian McGinley. &ldquo;Where there is substantial cooperation, including significant voluntary reporting of factual findings and remediation, as was the case here, the CFTC will not hesitate to recognize a swap dealer&rsquo;s engagement and efforts to be in compliance with the law.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Case Background</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The order finds that from at least Jan. 2017 to the present, CIBC was late in reporting various types of data for its swaps transactions, including real time, primary economic terms, confirmation, snapshot and valuation data. CIBC consistently reported swap data outside the time requirements prescribed by Parts 43 and 45 of the regulations regarding millions of required reports. The untimeliness of CIBC&rsquo;s swaps reporting was pervasive over the course of the relevant period and impacted thousands of swaps.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The reduced civil monetary penalty in the order recognizes CIBC&rsquo;s substantial cooperation with the Division of Enforcement&rsquo;s investigation and acknowledges CIBC&rsquo;s representations regarding its remediation efforts, including retaining a consultant, conducting extensive historical analysis and devoting significant resources to remediation.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this matter are Katie Rasor, Alejandra de Urioste, David MacGregor, Lenel Hickson, Jr. and Manal M. Sultan.</span></span></span></span></p>

<div> fraud charges, Baba Nadimpalli, SKAEL Inc., SEC, investors
Summary: The SEC charged Baba Nadimpalli, former CEO of SKAEL Inc., with fraud for falsely inflating revenue and misusing company funds.<br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced fraud charges against Baba Nadimpalli, the co-founder and former CEO of SKAEL Inc., a San Francisco-based private technology company that developed business automation software.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, from January 2021 through February 2022, Nadimpalli raised more than $30 million from investors by falsely claiming that SKAEL had millions of dollars in annually recurring revenue, which was more than 10 times the true amount. The complaint also alleges that Nadimpalli falsely suggested to investors that SKAEL&rsquo;s customers included a number of well-known companies, and, further, that Nadimpalli forged bank statements to show nonexistent payments from customers. Nadimpalli also allegedly spent hundreds of thousands of dollars of SKAEL&rsquo;s money on his own personal expenses, including payments on his house and car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Startup founders cannot fake it until they make it by falsifying revenue metrics shared with investors,&rdquo; said Monique C. Winkler, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s San Francisco Regional Office. &ldquo;While the SEC will continue to aggressively pursue private company executives who use falsehoods to raise money from investors, we also urge those who invest in private companies to remain vigilant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, charges Nadimpalli with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, including a conduct-based injunction, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and an officer-and-director bar.</p>
<p>In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Northern District of California (USAO) today announced criminal charges against Nadimpalli.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Matthew Meyerhofer and Ellen Chen and supervised by Jason H. Lee and Ruth L. Hawley, all of the San Francisco Regional Office. The litigation will be conducted by John Han and Mr. Meyerhofer. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the USAO and the FBI.</p>

<div> Supreme Court, enforcement actions, administrative complaints, futures commission merchant, CFTC registration requirement <br />
Summary: Commissioner Pham criticizes the CFTC for filing enforcement actions before a temporary hearing officer and evading public scrutiny and oversight. <div>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Commissioner Caroline D. Pham today released the following statement on the CFTC&rsquo;s filing of four administrative complaints for enforcement actions before a CFTC temporary hearing officer:</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&ldquo;It is unbelievable that in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court&rsquo;s&nbsp;<i>Jarkesy</i>&nbsp;opinion and the heightened scrutiny of agency administrative proceedings, the Commission is doubling down on bringing enforcement actions before a hearing officer&mdash;not even an Administrative Law Judge. Last year, when the Commission pulled this maneuver at the last minute, I stated that this shotgun approach &lsquo;</span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>flies in the face of decades of Commission standard practice and rules, bypasses federal Article III courts, and is a misuse of the CFTC&rsquo;s adjudication authority</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span>.&rsquo;</span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement092424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a><span><span><span>&nbsp;Worse, the Commission is using these administrative proceedings to advance novel interpretations of the definition of a futures commission merchant (FCM) and the CFTC&rsquo;s registration requirement, all while evading public scrutiny or oversight by the courts. It could not be more clear that the CFTC believes there is no higher authority in the Nation: the CFTC is above the law.&rdquo;</span></span></span></p>

<title>SEC Charges Crypto Companies TrustToken And TrueCoin With Defrauding Investors Regarding Stablecoin Investment Program - Companies Also Charged With Unregistered Offer And Sale Of Securities</title>

<div> fraudulent, unregistered sales, investment contracts, stablecoin, SEC <br />
Summary: TrueCoin and TrustToken settled charges with SEC for fraudulent sales of investment contracts involving stablecoin TUSD, falsely marketing safety and trustworthiness.  <br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against TrueCoin LLC and TrustToken Inc. for their fraudulent and unregistered sales of investment contracts involving TrueUSD (TUSD), a purported stablecoin.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, TrueCoin was an issuer of TUSD and TrustToken was the developer and operator of TrueFi, a so-called lending protocol. The SEC&rsquo;s complaint alleges that from November 2020 until April 2023, TrueCoin and TrustToken engaged in the unregistered offer and sale of investment contracts in the form of the crypto asset TUSD and profit-making opportunities with respect to TrueUSD on TrueFi. The complaint further alleges that TrueCoin and TrustToken falsely marketed the investment opportunity as safe and trustworthy by claiming that TUSD was fully backed by U.S. dollars or their equivalent, when in fact a substantial portion of the assets purportedly backing TUSD had been invested in a speculative and risky offshore investment fund to earn additional returns for the defendants. The complaint alleges that, by approximately March 2022, after the TUSD operations had been sold to an offshore entity, that entity and TrueCoin had invested more than half a billion dollars of the assets purportedly backing TUSD in the speculative fund, and that, by Fall 2022, TrueCoin and TrustToken became aware of redemption problems at the offshore fund but continued to make false statements to investors casting TUSD as backed one-for-one by U.S. dollars. As alleged, by September 2024, 99% of the reserves backing TUSD were invested in the speculative fund.</p>
<p>&ldquo;TrueCoin and TrustToken sought profits for themselves by exposing investors to substantial, undisclosed risks through misrepresentations about the safety of the investment,&rdquo; said Jorge G. Tenreiro, Acting Chief of the SEC&rsquo;s Crypto Assets &amp; Cyber Unit. &ldquo;This case is a prime example of why registration matters, as investors in these products continue to be deprived of the key information needed to make fully informed decisions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without admitting or denying the allegations, TrueCoin and TrustToken have agreed to settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges by consenting to the entry of final judgments enjoining them from violating applicable provisions of the federal securities laws and to pay civil penalties of $163,766 each. TrueCoin has agreed to pay disgorgement of $340,930 with prejudgment interest of $31,538. The settlements are subject to court approval.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation, which is ongoing, was conducted by Michael C. Baker, Michael Friedman, Pasha Salimi, and Bryan Hsueh. The matter was supervised by Michael Brennan, James Connor, and Mr. Tenreiro.</p>

<div> Supreme Court, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, administrative proceedings, unregistered futures commission merchant, dissent<br />
Summary:<br />
The dissent criticizes the use of administrative proceedings to bring unregistered FCM charges without sufficient evidence. It emphasizes the need for careful consideration and thorough evidence. <div>
<p><span><span><span><span>Each of the four &ldquo;Unregistered Entity Sweep&rdquo; matters before the Commodity Futures Trading Commission</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement092424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;today seeks a cease-and-desist order and uses the Commission's administrative process to avoid bringing these charges in the federal courts.&nbsp; I respectfully dissent from the Commission&rsquo;s use of administrative proceedings to bring an unregistered futures commission merchant (FCM) charge without identifying any relevant facts to support that charge.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The recent U.S. Supreme Court decision in&nbsp;<i>SEC v. Jarkesy</i></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement092424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a><span><span><span><span><i>&nbsp;</i>raises the level of scrutiny that any agency, including the Commission, should apply before employing the use of administrative proceedings.&nbsp; In each of these four matters, I am concerned that there is insufficient evidence that the proposed respondent was acting as an FCM.&nbsp; Specifically, while there may be sufficient evidence that the proposed respondent engaged in soliciting or in accepting orders for the relevant types of transactions, there is no evidence that the proposed respondent accepted money, securities, or property (or extended credit in lieu thereof) to margin, guarantee, or secure those trades or contracts.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement092424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>FCMs are vital intermediaries in our markets and serve as critical agents to their customers in facilitating the execution and clearing of derivative transactions.&nbsp; They are distinct from designated contract markets or swap execution facilities which execute derivative transactions, and from derivatives clearing organizations that clear derivative transactions.&nbsp; They are also distinct from other intermediaries, such as commodity pool operators, commodity trading advisors, introducing brokers, and swap dealers.&nbsp; Just because a person or entity may purport to accept money for a derivative transaction does not necessarily mean that it should be registered as an FCM or that an enforcement case should be brought against it if it did not do so.&nbsp; This requires a deeper analysis, and, more importantly, evidence that the person or entity actually engaged or purported to engage in activity that meets the required elements of the FCM definition.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>While I support acting to stop entities from falsely claiming that they are registered with the Commission, I cannot support the unregistered FCM charges in this sweep without additional evidence. &nbsp;Furthermore, when our Division of Enforcement utilizes administrative avenues to bring its cases, it must do so with careful and thorough consideration of the underlying evidence to ensure that any succeeding decisions under those cases by presiding officers or other administrative judges are limited to only those appropriate under the law.&nbsp; Therefore, I dissent.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span>Speaker:&nbsp;</span>Sarah Pritchard, executive director, markets and executive director, international<br /><span>Event:</span>&nbsp;FT Financial Advice Forum, London&nbsp;<br /><span>Delivered:</span>&nbsp;24 September 2024&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>We have a unique opportunity to do things differently and re-draw our regulations for the better of consumers and firms.&nbsp;</li>
<li>This will require open conversations on risk, and the FCA is listening to stakeholder feedback.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Firms should act now, embracing data and digital to innovate and meet the needs of their consumers.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Besides boasting a comprehensive spa, delightful buffet breakfast and impressive 4.5 rating on TripAdvisor, you may have noticed on your way in that The Leonardo Royal Hotel London City is also home to a rare surviving fragment of the London Wall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Built by the Romans around the second century, the Wall was essential for protecting the city.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For centuries, it stood as a sturdy boundary, safeguarding its inhabitants from external threats. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But as time went on, the city evolved. The threats to the people within changed as did their requirements ... so did the Wall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the years, it was adapted. Windows and new gates were added, to reflect the changing needs and habits of the people it served.</p>
<p>Just like the London Wall, the structures and boundaries we put in place over our financial systems must be maintained and respected, but also adapted as our needs and circumstances change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the risks we face evolve, so must the protections we have in place, to ensure they remain relevant and strong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is why the FCA is moving to a less prescriptive and more outcomes-focused approach &hellip; an approach that responds to the environment we are living in, allows for growth and progress, but keeps consumer needs at its heart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In doing so, we must respond to an ever-evolving landscape and &ndash; crucially &ndash; maintain our ability to think ahead, anticipate challenges and seize opportunities. &nbsp;</p>
<p>That means being bold, proactive and embracing change for the better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will require some open and frank conversations on risk and how we balance that &hellip; but all in order that we might reap the rewards. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Regulatory framework</h2>
<p>And now is the right time to be ambitious in our thinking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With our new regulatory framework, we have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to undertake a review of our rules, making sure they match our market and our risk appetite. &nbsp;<br />This won&rsquo;t be change for change's sake. It will be a clear-sighted assessment of what works and what doesn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the way we approach it will be different, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No regulator knows best, but greater collaboration &ndash; with government, with consumer groups and with industry &ndash; is vital as we shape the regulatory regime of the future. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The advice market is one area we know where reform is needed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/financial-lives/financial-lives-2022-survey" title="Financial Lives 2022 survey">2022 Financial Lives Survey</a>&nbsp;showed only 8% of adults reported taking financial advice in the previous year. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And earlier this month, Barclays reported that 13 million people were holding &pound;430 billion cash savings that could be put to better use in investment, potentially boosting their returns and UK growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A lack of confidence may be holding people back &ndash; 43% think investing is too risky, and a quarter that it is too complicated. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/corporate-documents/consumer-investments-strategy" title="Consumer Investments: Strategy and Feedback Statement">Consumer Investments Strategy</a>, published in 2021, set out an ambition of people being able to invest with confidence, understanding the risks they are taking, and the regulatory protections provided. In the strategy, we clearly state that we wanted to see a reduction in the number of consumers with higher risk tolerance holding over &pound;10,000 in cash.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to see a thriving consumer investment market where consumers can make more informed decisions, based on their risk appetite.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are 2 significant pieces of regulatory reform work that will help us deliver that. And alongside that is our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/investsmart/about-campaign" title="About the InvestSmart campaign">InvestSmart campaign</a>&nbsp;which aims to help inexperienced investors make better informed investment decisions based on their appetite for risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The campaign raises awareness of the risks of undertaking high-risk investments and drives consumers to the InvestSmart website which has videos and articles on positive investing principles, like adopting a long-term view.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The latest version of our regular tracking survey, which took place in May, showed 65% of the target audience were able to select 3 positive investment principles from a list when prompted, up from 56% at the start of the campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And 81% of the target audience now say that they would prefer to learn about investing from established sources, up from 63% at the start of the campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me turn now to the ongoing regulatory reform which we hope will drive a more thriving consumer investment market. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Advice Guidance Boundary Review&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The confidence to invest lags because people so often don&rsquo;t have access to the support they need. &nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the reasons for that is firms&rsquo; fear of overstepping the line between guidance and personal recommendation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to see a continuum of help being offered to support consumers, without the cliff edge of the current regulatory framework.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Much like the original Roman wall outside, which has been adapted to suit different circumstances over the centuries, we are re-thinking the boundaries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year, we launched the Advice Guidance Boundary Review (AGBR), jointly with the Treasury, to make sure that consumers get the help they want, when they need it, at a cost that is affordable. Clearly, legislation may be needed to create any new regime as well as regulation. That is why we are working jointly with the Treasury from the start, so that we can then move quickly through legislation and regulation once we have tested what will work in the market and for consumers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/discussion-papers/dp23-5-advice-guidance-boundary-review-proposals-closing-advice-gap" title="DP23/5: Advice Guidance Boundary Review &ndash; proposals for closing the advice gap">policy paper</a>&nbsp;with the Treasury in December last year to set out our early thinking. That paper was positioned around potential solutions &ndash; as we knew from feedback on previous consultations that any new regulatory framework needs to be commercially viable to deliver improvements for consumers. The paper highlighted the depth of interest from industry and consumers on this work, and we are grateful to everyone who offered views.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, we published a piece of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/occasional-papers/op-65-timing-essence-testing-when-engage-uk-pension-customers" title="Occasional Paper 65: Is timing of the essence? Testing when to engage UK pension customers">consumer research</a>&nbsp;which will complement the consumer research we will be doing to inform our regulatory reform. This research used behavioural insights to test how and when to engage UK pension customers in their decision making. It sought to overcome common barriers, like the tendency to focus on the present rather than the future and feeling overwhelmed by too much information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These insights will help us develop our thinking on challenging questions at the heart of the advice guidance review:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>how we build in the appropriate consumer protections &nbsp;</li>
<li>to what extent we need prescriptive versus outcomes-based regulation &nbsp;</li>
<li>balancing firms&rsquo; desire for certainty with the need for space to innovate &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>We will continue to work closely with both industry and consumer groups as we develop our proposals and will look to rely on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/consumer-duty" title="Consumer Duty">Consumer Duty</a>&nbsp;as part of the new regime where it&rsquo;s simplest and clearest to do so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But that does not mean firms should sit on their hands whilst we pursue broader reform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reform takes time but there is no need to wait; we want firms to consider how they can better support their customers now. &nbsp;</p>
<p>That is why in August 2023 we published practical examples of the types of activity that firms can provide without crossing into &lsquo;advice&rsquo; or personal recommendation under the current rulebook. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This should help firms get closer to the current advice guidance boundary and deliver for their clients with confidence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We stand ready to help those with new, genuinely innovative ideas, to bring them to market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, through our digital sandboxes, where new ideas can be safely tested. Many firms are already making use of these, and I would urge you to get involved if you haven&rsquo;t already. You do not need to wait for the AGBR to conclude before testing new solutions in our sandboxes &ndash; innovation that takes place now can help inform the long-term solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Preparing for the future through innovation and embracing the opportunities that data and technology bring, will be key to offering more accessible, affordable and innovative services to consumers. If we get this right, firms will be in a better position to harness technology to reach the underserved, with more accessible financial support products available to a greater number of people. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Before I move on, I wanted to stress that the aims of the AGBR review will only be met if there is a vibrant and sustainable &ldquo;capital A&rdquo; advice market too. We want consumers to be able to access current full advice offerings as well as testing the need for a new simplified advice regime, and better forms of help through targeted support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ambition that consumers have access to the help and guidance that they need, at a cost they can afford, when they need it &ndash; so that they can make informed decisions &ndash; will only be achieved by the market providing a wide variety of offerings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, to the advisers in the room &ndash; don&rsquo;t retire yet, thinking you will be replaced by robots &ndash; we want to see a vibrant and sustainable financial adviser market too, alongside any new regulatory offerings.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Disclosure&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Confidence to invest is also created by having easy-to-understand, clear, reliable information on which to make decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the government&rsquo;s repeal and replacement programme, the Treasury has committed to transfer rule-making powers for the much-loved PRIIPs (packaged retail investment products) and parts of MIFID (UK legislation and rules regulating markets in financial instruments) to the FCA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We acknowledge that current disclosure rules have not necessarily resulted in useful information being available at the right time or in the right place in the consumer journey. &nbsp;<br />We now have a unique opportunity to design flexible and proportionate regulation which is tailored to the UK market. Regulation that supports retail investors to buy products that suit their needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We plan to consult on the new regulatory regime this autumn, and to finalise rules in the first half of 2025. We will lean on the Consumer Duty, where it is most effective and efficient to do so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope we have already signalled the pragmatic way we will approach this work. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In recent months, we and the Government heard clearly from industry that PRIIPs were not working for UK-listed close-ended investment funds. That for some, the rules meant unrepresentative cost disclosure, putting them at a disadvantage. &nbsp;</p>
<p>While we did not previously have the legislative lever to make change, we acted last October to provide investment funds with greater comfort in providing greater context on costs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And last week, following confirmation from government that it will bring forward legislation, we went further by signalling regulatory forbearance until the law is changed.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Collaboration</h2>
<p>We want to take a similar approach as we look to reform:</p>
<ul>
<li>open to feedback</li>
<li>responsive to need&nbsp;</li>
<li>working in close collaboration, whether that is industry, government or consumer representatives</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we have increased our engagement. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year, we attended 29 industry events.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year, over 30 so far, with another 10 in the works. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We are grateful for all the views shared with us through our consultations on replacement rules so far.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a conversation, and we want to hear your views on what&rsquo;s working, what isn&rsquo;t and how we can make regulation work for us all. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Risk/reward&nbsp;</h2>
<p>That conversation is crucial.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because the shifts we are making are fundamentally about an adjustment to risk appetite. &nbsp;<br />The concern regularly expressed is that we have become focused on the chance of loss at the expense of possible return.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we approach change, we must be open and honest &ndash; as we were with our capital markets reforms &ndash; that:</p>
<ul>
<li>change brings with it a different balance of risk, and sometimes greater risk&hellip;&nbsp;</li>
<li>the more people who are supported to invest through accessible help and clearer disclosure, the more people will be affected by the inevitable ups and downs of the market</li>
</ul>
<p>But while we should be clear on those risks, as we design a regulatory regime for the future, we must not lose sight of the fact a low-to-no risk appetite has an opportunity cost. Both for individuals and for the wider economic growth that benefits us all.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Consumer duty and our supervisory expectations&nbsp;</h2>
<p>As we seek to make necessary change, we should also emphasise our unwavering dedication to the underlying principles we as regulators should uphold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, any rule changes will complement the standards set out under our Consumer Duty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will be aware by now that the Duty cuts across all retail financial services and sets a higher standard of care that firms must give to consumers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But importantly it does so by consciously taking an outcomes-based approach &hellip; handing firms scope for flexibility and innovation in determining how best to deliver for their consumers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>That includes allowing smaller firms and sole traders &ndash; who we know often feel regulatory pressures the most keenly &ndash; to take an approach that fits their size, market and clients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So fewer tick boxes, better outcomes for consumers, increased consumer trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great to see how many of you have embraced the Duty and harnessed it to shift culture and improve outcomes already, for example by eradicating jargon and moving clients to less bespoke and cheaper options where that is a better fit. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This is solid progress but there is always room for improvement. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As we set out in our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/correspondence/dear-ceo-letter-fca-expectations-wealth-management-stockbroking-firms.pdf" title="Dear CEO letter: FCA expectations for wealth management and stockbroking firms, 8 November 2023">CEO letter</a>&nbsp;last November, in the wealth and stockbroking sectors, we want firms to be able to assure themselves &ndash; and us &ndash; that their products meet genuine customer need &hellip;&nbsp;that they&rsquo;re well understood and not overly complex, that they represent fair value. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We will provide challenge where we are concerned. But we will also provide support in getting it right. &nbsp;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve been focusing on how firms are embedding the Duty&rsquo;s requirements for consumer support and understanding, so we can identify good practice to help firms.&nbsp;<br />Now that we have entered the second year of the Duty, we are looking at how we can embrace it right across our Handbook. The Duty&rsquo;s outcomes-based approach offers an opportunity to look again at existing more prescriptive rules.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where they cover similar issues to the Duty, and where similar customer outcomes could be achieved with greater flexibility, we can streamline them to help firms and support innovation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So, we have launched a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/review%20fca" title="Review of FCA requirements following the introduction of the Consumer Duty">call for input</a>&nbsp;closing soon on 31 October. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to hear your views. While the Duty sets rules for firms&rsquo; retail conduct, we are also asking for views, across our Handbook, about where we could rely on high-level rules instead of more detailed and prescriptive requirements. Many of you in the room will live day-to-day navigating our rules and guidance and are perfectly placed to help us identify how they could work more effectively. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, where issues you raise fit best within the context of ongoing work on the AGBR and Consumer Composite Investments (CCIs) reform we will link these together.&nbsp;<br />We have upcoming events in Basingstoke and Birmingham on 10 and 11 October where we will launch our updated strategy for the supervision of financial advisers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Here, we&rsquo;re also available to hear your thoughts and feedback firsthand. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to help facilitate a thriving and sustainable future for your profession. We want you to understand our supervisory expectations and priorities. And we want you to take the opportunity of our call for input to tell us where we should revisit aspects of our existing rule set.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The FCA&rsquo;s mindset is changing.&nbsp;Our focus on supporting consumers continues, but we are evolving the way we do this by taking a more outcomes-based approach to regulation.&nbsp;This gives firms the flexibility to innovate in service of their clients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will require collaboration.&nbsp;We have a solid foundation, and with the right mindset and tools, it is in our hands to build something remarkable together that will stand the test of time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now is the time to act, to take some considered risk, and to shape the future. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Opportunities don&rsquo;t wait for those who hesitate; they reward those bold enough to seize them.</p>

<title>ACER Amends The Methodology For The Electricity Market Coupling Algorithm To Mandate Research On Co-Optimisation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In November 2023, ACER received a proposal from Nominated Electricity Market Operators (NEMOs) for amending the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsGBg5SA1JXAUxdVAFXHVYJVwUdUw0GABoGAAVVBVcABgcIVwEdBAVVAgxSBwcdU1sBBh0GDgcHGlRXBlYZBQFVVQAHUwJRXFtYRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ACER&rsquo;s 2020 methodology for the price coupling algorithm and the continuous trading matching algorithm</a>.</p>
<p>The methodology sets the regulatory framework for:</p>
<ul>
<li>the algorithms used for matching orders; and</li>
<li>allocating cross-zonal capacities in the European day-ahead and intraday electricity markets.</li>
</ul>
<p>After consulting with stakeholders and hosting two webinars, ACER made revisions to the NEMOs&rsquo; initial proposal. Today, with its&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsBUFVUAFEBVUwJBFIAHVYKUwYdUwpUUhpQAwMAB1UEAw9SUAYdBAVVAgxSBwcdU1sBBh0GDgcHGlRXBlYZBQFVVQAHUwJRXFtYRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Decision 11-2024</a>, ACER has adopted&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsCCAIGAFdVBkwLAAMCHVYMV1MdUF8CVRoNAAYBAgZQAlQGB1IdBAVVAgxSBwcdU1sBBh0GDgcHGlRXBlYZBQFVVQAHUwJRXFtYRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">the amended methodology</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What&rsquo;s new?</span></p>
<p>The updated methodology, in particular the day-ahead coupling algorithm, enables the investigation of a co-optimised allocation of cross-zonal capacity (&lsquo;co-optimisation&rsquo;). This approach would allow the efficient sharing of the available cross-zonal capacity between energy trading and exchanges linked to balancing services, facilitating the integration of balancing capacity markets.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Research will identify the best co-optimisation approach</span></p>
<p>ACER&rsquo;s Decision requires NEMOs, in collaboration with Transmission System Operators (TSOs), to conduct the necessary research and development (R&amp;D) activities to fully understand the technical feasibility, impacts, and implications of integrating co-optimisation into the price coupling algorithm. This R&amp;D work will be structured around four milestones and is expected to finish in November 2026.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the next steps?</span></p>
<p>After the required R&amp;D activities are finalised, ACER will analyse the findings and discuss their implications with NEMOs and TSOs. Based on these discussions and if required, ACER may request further amendments to the algorithm methodology and related Terms, Conditions and Methodologies (TCMs).</p>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Good morning, Chairman McHenry, Ranking Member Waters, and members of Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today about the work of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<h3>The SEC at 90 Years</h3>
<p>At the SEC, we celebrated our 90th birthday earlier this year.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the 1929 market crash and the frauds, scams, and other observed problems in the securities markets, President Franklin Roosevelt came together with Congress to enact a series of securities laws in the 1930s and set up the SEC. Congress and Roosevelt understood how vital capital markets are to investors, issuers, and a dynamic and growing economy.</p>
<p>Today, the SEC oversees the capital markets and works to deter and prevent fraud and manipulation, as well as helps ensure that investment advisers carry out their duties to their clients, and that companies and entrepreneurs can access the capital they need to succeed. The SEC is also the cop on the beat watching out for the investing public and issuers.</p>
<p>The SEC is a remarkable agency. We serve investors building for a better future and issuers raising money to fund innovation, while overseeing the capital markets where they meet. The essence of this is captured in our three-part mission to protect investors; maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and facilitate capital formation.</p>
<h3>Growth and Change in the Markets</h3>
<p>Today, the more than $100 trillion U.S. capital markets<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;are the deepest, most liquid in the world. To put these figures in context, the assets of the entire U.S. banking system add up to about $23 trillion.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Comprising approximately 40 percent of the world&rsquo;s capital markets,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;U.S. capital markets outpace our roughly 24 percent of the world&rsquo;s economy.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;The U.S. capital markets also play an integral role in the dollar&rsquo;s dominance.</p>
<p>Everyday investors benefit from the U.S. capital markets. Their investment portfolios fund home purchases, college educations, and retirements. About 58 percent of U.S. households own stocks either directly or indirectly.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;More than half of American households, representing nearly 121 million individual investors, own registered funds.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Today, registered investment advisers advise 57 million clients.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;This includes advising on more than $37 trillion in registered funds,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;$27 trillion in private funds,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;and $49 trillion in separately managed accounts.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p>We oversee approximately 40,000 entities&mdash;including approximately 13,000 registered funds, approximately 15,400 investment advisers, about 3,400 broker-dealers, 25 national securities exchanges, 108 alternative trading systems, 10 credit rating agencies, and six active registered clearing agencies, among other external entities. The SEC oversees the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB), and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). In addition, the Commission provides oversight over standard-setting and rulemaking by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).</p>
<h3>SEC Organization and Staff</h3>
<p>To fulfill its mission, the SEC is organized around six divisions and 24 offices located in 11 regional locations<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;as well as our Washington, D.C., headquarters. We currently have 4,893 staff on board,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;representing only a 5 percent increase from 2016 when we had 4,650 staff.</p>
<p>The SEC staff in 2023 rated us among the best places to work in the federal government; we ranked third among midsized agencies for the second year in a row.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;Our attrition this fiscal year is at historically low levels, so far averaging around 3 percent at an annualized rate.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s funding is deficit neutral. While the congressional appropriations process determines the SEC&rsquo;s budget, the SEC collects fees on stock and other securities transactions to offset the appropriations.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></p>
<p>For FY 2024 the SEC budget is $2.15 billion, remaining the same as it was in FY 2023. At the start of FY 2024, we paused nearly all job postings and backfilling for departing staff.</p>
<p>In fiscal years 2021 through 2024, we will have shed 299,000 usable square feet from the SEC&rsquo;s real estate footprint. As a result of these reductions over the last three years, we expect to save approximately $20 million in FY 2025. We will continue looking for opportunities to achieve cost savings across our leasing footprint and in other ways in the years to come.</p>
<p>The rest of this testimony will describe the work of the six divisions. For the programmatic divisions, we will review certain rules that were implemented, adopted, or proposed in the last year.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></p>
<h3>Corporation Finance</h3>
<p>The Division of Corporation Finance seeks to ensure that investors have access to the information they need to make informed investment and voting decisions when a company offers its securities to the public, and on an ongoing basis as companies continue to provide information to the marketplace. The Division also provides interpretive assistance to companies with respect to compliance with SEC rules and forms and makes recommendations to the Commission regarding new rules and revisions to existing rules.</p>
<p>The Division reviews the disclosures and financial statements of reporting companies to monitor and enhance compliance with disclosure and accounting requirements under the federal securities laws and Commission rules.</p>
<p>In FY 2023, there were approximately 7,400 actively reporting issuers subject to oversight by the Division&rsquo;s Disclosure Review Program, of which more than 4,000 were listed on U.S. exchanges.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>&nbsp;Further, in FY 2023, the Division reviewed the filings of more than 3,700 reporting companies and new issuers.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Division has worked on a number of proposed and final rules in the last year.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></p>
<p>In December 2023, rules began to be implemented requiring registrants to disclose material cybersecurity incidents they experience as well as to disclose on an annual basis material information regarding their cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a></p>
<p>In November 2023, as mandated by Congress in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), the Commission adopted rules regarding conflicts of interest in the securitization market.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a>&nbsp;Compliance with these rules is required starting in June 2025.</p>
<p>In July 2024, rules were implemented regarding disclosures by special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), both when going public as well as when engaging in a business combination transaction with a target company (de-SPAC transactions).<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a></p>
<p>In March 2024, the Commission adopted rules to standardize climate-related risk disclosures by public companies and in public offerings.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a>&nbsp;The Commission stayed these rules pending the completion of judicial review.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a></p>
<p>The Commission also has adopted rules related to corporate governance. As mandated by Congress in the Dodd-Frank Act, exchange listing rules on clawbacks of executive compensation were implemented in 2023, with corresponding issuer disclosure requirements beginning in 2024.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a>&nbsp;Updated rules regarding how corporate insiders trade their own company&rsquo;s stock have been phased in starting in April 2023.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a>&nbsp;In October 2023, the Commission adopted rules shortening the deadlines by which beneficial owners must inform the public of their position, with compliance beginning in February 2024.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a>&nbsp;Lastly, in August 2024, consistent with Congress&rsquo;s mandate in the Financial Data Transparency Act of 2022, the SEC, together with eight other federal financial regulators, proposed joint data standards for data submitted to the nine financial regulators to promote the interoperability of financial regulatory data.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a></p>
<h3>Investment Management</h3>
<p>The Division of Investment Management has primary responsibility for administering the Investment Company Act of 1940 and Investment Advisers Act of 1940. In administering the Investment Company Act, the Division develops regulatory policy for investment companies, which include mutual funds, money market funds, closed-end funds, business development companies, unit investment trusts, variable insurance products, and exchange-traded funds.</p>
<p>The Division also develops regulatory policy as applicable to investment advisers, including advisers to registered investment companies, separately managed accounts, and, in certain cases, to private funds.</p>
<p>In FY 2023, Division staff reviewed more than 1,900 filings related to more than 4,400 funds and insurance products. Staff also reviewed annual reports&mdash;including financial statements&mdash;from more than 4,200 funds.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a></p>
<p>The Division worked on a number of rulemakings in the last year.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a></p>
<p>The Commission adopted amendments to Form PF, the confidential reporting form for certain SEC-registered investment advisers to private funds.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a>&nbsp;Rules requiring that large hedge fund and private equity fund advisers make current reports on certain events to the Commission were implemented in June 2024. A joint rule with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to enhance the amount of information the agencies receive from all Form PF filers was adopted in February 2024 and will be implemented in March 2025.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a></p>
<p>In August 2024, the Commission adopted amendments to reporting requirements on Form N-PORT.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a>&nbsp;Funds generally will be required to comply with the amendments for reports filed on or after November 17, 2025, except fund groups with net assets of less than $1 billion have until May 18, 2026.</p>
<p>In May 2024, the Commission finalized amendments to Regulation S-P that will require covered firms to notify their customers of data breaches that might put their personal information at risk.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a>&nbsp;Such covered firms include broker-dealers (including funding portals), investment companies, registered investment advisers, and transfer agents. Larger entities will have to comply in December 2025 and smaller entities in June 2026. The Division of Trading and Markets also worked on these rules.</p>
<p>In July 2023, the Commission adopted amendments to update the regulations for governing money market funds.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a>&nbsp;There is a staggered transition period for funds to come into compliance, with full implementation to be complete in October 2024.</p>
<p>In September 2023, the Commission adopted amendments to the Investment Company Act &ldquo;Names Rule&rdquo; to address fund names that could mislead investors about a fund&rsquo;s investments and risks.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a>&nbsp;Compliance will be phased in based on fund size, with larger funds required to comply in December 2025 and smaller funds in June 2026.</p>
<p>In July 2024, the Commission implemented a Congressional mandate to provide a tailored form to register the offerings of registered index-linked annuities.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a>&nbsp;Filers will have until May 1, 2026, to comply with most of the final amendments, and insurance companies will be able to use the tailored form in September 2024.</p>
<p>Rules regarding the updating of funds&rsquo; shareholder reports were implemented in July 2024.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a></p>
<p>Rules to govern proxy voting information reported on Form N-PX were implemented in August 2024.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a></p>
<p>The Divisions of Investment Management and Trading and Markets are considering recommending that the Commission re-propose rules regarding conflicts of interest in the use of predictive analytics by brokers and advisers.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[39]</a>&nbsp;Further, the Division of Investment Management is considering recommending that the Commission repropose rules regarding the custody of funds or investments of clients as well as changes to regulatory requirements relating to open-end funds&rsquo; liquidity and dilution management.</p>
<p>In May 2024, the Commission and U.S. Department of the Treasury&rsquo;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network jointly proposed rules requiring customer identification programs for Commission-registered investment advisers and exempt reporting advisers.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40">[40]</a></p>
<p>In addition to these rules, the Division also is implementing an initiative to add to the aggregate public data published by the SEC. First, earlier this year, it began publishing the Registered Fund Statistics report, which aggregates data about the registered fund industry.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41">[41]</a>&nbsp;Second, in May, the Division began publishing a new report based on aggregated data filed by investment advisers on Form ADV, providing statistics on the investment advisory industry and showing trends over time.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42">[42]</a>&nbsp;Third, in July, it updated and enhanced public reporting of data regarding hedge funds, private equity funds, and other private funds from Form PF. The report provides the public with information about the leverage, borrowing, and other activities of this rapidly growing sector.</p>
<h3>Trading and Markets</h3>
<p>The Division of Trading and Markets works to maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets. Market monitoring and supervision are essential parts of the Division&rsquo;s activity&mdash;especially during times of market stress. Transaction volume in listed equities has doubled in the last five years and tripled in the last 17 years.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43">[43]</a></p>
<p>The Division oversees 25 national securities exchanges, 108 alternative trading systems, about 3,400 broker-dealers, 53 security-based swap dealers, six active registered clearing agencies, and more than 300 transfer agents, among other entities.</p>
<p>In FY 2023, the Division responded to more than 16,000 public inquiries. In FY 2023, the Division also reviewed more than 660 filings from broker-dealers as well as more than 1,700 self-regulatory organization proposed rule changes and advance notices.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44">[44]</a></p>
<p>In the last year, with respect to rulemaking, the Division was primarily focused on market structure for the equity and Treasury markets as well as implementing rules mandated by Congress through the Dodd-Frank Act.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In terms of equity market structure, last week the Commission adopted amendments to certain rules under Regulation NMS to adopt an additional minimum pricing increment, or &ldquo;tick size,&rdquo; for the quoting of certain NMS stocks, reduce the access fee caps for protected quotations of trading centers, increase the transparency of exchange fees and rebates, and accelerate the implementation of rules that will make information about the market&rsquo;s best priced, smaller-sized orders publicly available.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45">[45]</a></p>
<p>On May 28, 2024, much of the U.S. markets (equities, corporate bonds, municipals, etc.) successfully aligned its settlement cycle with the Treasury markets at T+1.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46">[46]</a>&nbsp;In March 2024, the Commission adopted amendments to Rule 605 that enhance disclosure requirements for order execution quality.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47">[47]</a>&nbsp;Large broker-dealers&mdash;those with more than 100,000 customers&mdash;will have to disclose execution quality to the public. Compliance with these amendments to Rule 605 will begin in December 2025. The Commission also is continuing to review comments on other rule proposals related to the equities markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48">[48]</a></p>
<p>As for Treasury markets, in December 2023 the Commission adopted rules to facilitate additional central clearing for the $27 trillion U.S. Treasury markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49">[49]</a>&nbsp;By March 2025, Treasury clearinghouses must separate proprietary margin from customer margin and further facilitate access to central clearing. Starting at the end of 2025, certain cash transactions will have to be cleared. Starting in June 2026, certain repo and reverse repo transactions must be cleared. In February 2024, the Commission adopted final rules further defining a dealer and government securities dealer.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50">[50]</a>&nbsp;Further, rules are being implemented this month that will update and narrow the circumstances in which broker-dealers are exempt from registering with a national securities association.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51">[51]</a></p>
<p>The Commission also worked to finalize Congressionally mandated Dodd-Frank rules. Entities subject to rules creating a regime for the registration and regulation of security-based swap execution facilities (SBSEFs) were required to begin complying in August 2024.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52">[52]</a>&nbsp;Further, antifraud rules related to security-based swap transactions were implemented in August of 2023.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53">[53]</a>&nbsp;In October 2023, the Commission adopted rules regarding the reporting of short sale&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54">[54]</a>&nbsp;and securities lending related data.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55">[55]</a></p>
<p>The Commission also adopted rules in November 2023 relating to the governance and use of outside service providers by clearinghouses, and compliance will be phased in during December 2024 and December 2025.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56">[56]</a></p>
<p>Finally, rules related to the electronic recordkeeping of broker-dealers were phased in beginning in May 2023, to be completed in November 2024.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57">[57]</a></p>
<h3>Economic and Risk Analysis</h3>
<p>The Division of Economic and Risk Analysis (DERA) includes economists, statisticians, data scientists and engineers, attorneys, accountants, and other staff. These experts provide support to every aspect of the Commission&rsquo;s mission from rulemaking to enforcement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;DERA provides economic analyses that consider the costs and benefits of our rules as well as their effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation. In conducting the economic analysis, DERA staff work closely with staff from the divisions, from the earliest stages of policy development through the finalization of a particular rule.</p>
<p>The Commission receives feedback from the public on these economic analyses, which benefits our rulemaking.</p>
<p>DERA also supports the Commission&rsquo;s examination and enforcement functions by helping to identify securities law violations, quantify harm to investors, calculate ill-gotten gains, and assist enforcement with returning funds to harmed investors.</p>
<p>Finally, DERA assists the Commission in its efforts to identify, analyze, and respond to economic and market issues, including those related to new financial products, investment and trading strategies, systemic risk, and fraud.</p>
<h3>Examinations</h3>
<p>The Division of Examinations serves a critical role in helping firms to comply with the law.</p>
<p>In FY 2023, Division staff conducted more than 3,100 examinations across our tens of thousands of registrants. From investment advisers to broker-dealers to exchanges, the Division helps ensure that registrants are following their legal obligations to customers and clients, including seniors and other vulnerable investors.</p>
<p>Importantly, the Division is the first line of defense for the investing public relying on investment advisers. It is responsible for examining and overseeing a growing registrant population, including more than 15,400 investment advisers and approximately 800 investment company complexes.</p>
<p>The Division issues risk alerts that summarize examination observations and preview potential examination scope areas focusing on compliance with new rules. The Division also promotes compliance by regularly engaging with the industry and investors through its national and regional outreach events.<br /><br />Further, the Division works in parallel with SROs to examine the more than 3,300 broker-dealers with roughly 150,000 branch offices.</p>
<h3>Enforcement</h3>
<p>The work of the Division of Enforcement is central to the SEC&rsquo;s investor protection role. The Division conducts investigations into possible violations of the federal securities laws and litigates enforcement actions in the federal courts and in administrative proceedings. In addition to monetary remedies designed to remove wrongdoers&rsquo; ill-gotten gains and deter future violations, the Commission&rsquo;s enforcement actions protect investors by obtaining remedial injunctions in district court and, similarly, remedial suspensions and bars in administrative proceedings.</p>
<p>In FY 2023, the Division brought 784 enforcement actions that resulted in orders for $4.9 billion in penalties and disgorgement. When feasible, the civil penalties and disgorgement obtained in the Commission&rsquo;s civil enforcement actions are returned to harmed investors, and the SEC distributed $930 million to harmed investors in FY 2023.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/testimony-securities-exchange-commission-united-states-house-representatives-committee-financial?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58">[58]</a>&nbsp;Further, in FY 2023, the SEC received more than 40,000 separate tips, complaints, and referrals from whistleblowers and others, up from about 16,700 in 2019.</p>
<h3>Other Offices</h3>
<p>The SEC has an Office of the General Counsel, which provides legal analysis and advice to the Commission and its divisions and offices on all aspects of the Commission&rsquo;s activities. The other offices include: Office of the Chief Accountant, Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, Office of International Affairs, Office of the Investor Advocate, Office of Credit Ratings, Office of Municipal Securities, Office of the Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation, and Strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to testify today and for the Committee&rsquo;s support of the SEC, its mission, and its people. &nbsp;</p>

<title>IOSCO, IFAC And The IFRS Foundation Co-Host An International Conference On Climate And Sustainability-Related Disclosures During Climate Week NYC</title>

<div> endorsed, sustainability, standards, disclosure, global
<br />
Summary: Almost 100 stakeholders gathered to discuss accelerating adoption of ISSB Standards, integrating sustainability disclosure in regulations, and promoting high-quality assurance for global capital markets.
<br /> <div>
<p>Almost 100 stakeholders involved in global sustainability standard setting, regulation, and accounting came together as part of a high-level international event at the start of Climate Week NYC.</p>
<p>Entitled&nbsp;<strong>&lsquo;Accelerating Climate and Sustainability-Related Disclosures: A Global Perspective&rsquo;</strong>, the focus of discussions centered around how to advance global adoption and use of the ISSB Standards and build an understanding of sustainability disclosure assurance in its early days.</p>
<p>Since IOSCO&rsquo;s endorsement of the Standards in July last year, more than 20 jurisdictions have taken steps to integrate them in their domestic regulatory regime; taken altogether, that is almost 55% of global GDP.</p>
<p>The conference provided a dynamic platform to further advance global standards for sustainability-related reporting and assurance, aligning them with the requirements of capital markets including regulators, investors and corporates, and elevating their maturity to be on a par with financial reporting. This event is an integral part of IOSCO&rsquo;s objective to foster and contribute to a reporting ecosystem that promotes high quality, consistent, comparable sustainability information that is needed by global capital markets to make useful decisions.</p>
<p>Helping its members in their consideration of how to adopt, or be informed by, the ISSB Standards is a key focus for IOSCO. Given it&rsquo;s membership regulates more than 95% of the world&rsquo;s securities markets, IOSCO is well positioned to play this role.</p>
<p><strong>Jean-Paul Servais, Chair of IOSCO</strong>, said: &ldquo;Promoting high-quality sustainability-related reporting is one of the key priorities for IOSCO to protect investors against greenwashing. Global progress towards the introduction of sustainability disclosure requirements has been swift since IOSCO announced its endorsement of the first ISSB Standards in July 2023. IOSCO is committed to collaborate with the ISSB and other global stakeholders to deliver a comprehensive capacity building program to support the wider use of sustainability disclosures.</p>
<p>To underpin the trustworthiness and thus usefulness of the disclosures, IOSCO also encourages the global development of assurance standards by IAASB and IESBA, and welcomes IFAC&rsquo;s work to help all users and practitioners better understand and prepare for what high-quality sustainability assurance will look like.</p>
<p>Our conference demonstrates our joint efforts to contribute to decision-useful sustainability information in the interest of investors.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span><span><span>Case Background</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The order finds that from at least Sept. 2018 to the present, CIBC failed to stop employees, including those at senior levels, from communicating using unapproved communication methods, including messages sent via personal text. CIBC was required to keep certain of these written communications because they related to the firm&rsquo;s CFTC-registered business. These written communications generally were not maintained and preserved by CIBC, and CIBC generally would not have been able to provide them promptly to the CFTC if and when requested.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The order further finds the use of unapproved communication methods violated CIBC&rsquo;s internal policies and procedures, which generally prohibited such communications. Further, some of the same supervisory personnel responsible for ensuring compliance with CIBC&rsquo;s policies and procedures also used non-approved methods of communication to engage in business-related communications, in violation of firm policy</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The order recognizes CIBC&rsquo;s cooperation with the Division of Enforcement&rsquo;s investigation.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Since Dec. 2021, the CFTC has imposed $1.237 billion in civil monetary penalties on 27 financial institutions for their use of unapproved methods of communication, in violation of CFTC recordkeeping and supervision requirements.&nbsp; [See CFTC Press Release Nos.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8470-21">8470-21</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8599-22">8599-22</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8699-23">8699-23</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8701-23">8701-23</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8762-23">8762-23</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8763-23">8763-23</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8794-23">8794-23</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8880-24">8880-24</a>; 8943-24; 89-4524.]</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Related Civil Actions</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The Securities and Exchange Commission also announced today its filing and settling of charges against affiliates of CIBC, and imposed civil monetary penalties for recordkeeping and supervision violations related to the use of unapproved methods of communication.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this matter are Katie Rasor, Alejandra de Urioste, David MacGregor, Lenel Hickson, Jr. and Manal M. Sultan.</span></span></p>

<div> enforcement, compliance, recordkeeping, off-channel communications, securities industry
<br />
The article discusses the challenges of off-channel communications enforcement, the importance of recordkeeping, the need for modernizing recordkeeping rules, client service imperatives, and privacy concerns.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Over the last several years, off-channel communications cases have become more prevalent on the Commission&rsquo;s enforcement docket. We have struggled with these cases. While we supported many of them initially, it was not without deep reservations. Recently, we have objected to the penalties and undertakings in most of these cases. Today&rsquo;s case against Qatalyst Partners LP<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-peirce-uyeda-qatalyst-09242024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;illustrates and confirms the reason for our reservations: it does not appear that firms have an achievable path to compliance. Accordingly, we voted no on Qatalyst Partners LP, and urge our colleagues to reconsider our current approach to the off-channel communications issue.</p>
<p>Recordkeeping by regulated entities is important. The Commission needs to be able to enforce its rules. To do that, it needs access to records about firms&rsquo; activities. Firms that are serious about complying with our rules also need access to records about their business activities. If business is being conducted using communications means that are outside of the reach of firm compliance personnel and Commission staff, both will be hampered in their ability to foster compliance with the rules. The off-channel communications cases arise from a legitimate concern that the compliance efforts both of firm compliance personnel and of Commission staff are impeded by improper recordkeeping practices. As the Commission&rsquo;s Order in the first of these cases stated:</p>
<blockquote>The federal securities laws impose recordkeeping requirements on broker-dealers to ensure that they responsibly discharge their crucial role in our markets. The Commission has long said that compliance with these requirements is essential to investor protection and the Commission&rsquo;s efforts to further its mandate of protecting investors, maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitating capital formation.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-peirce-uyeda-qatalyst-09242024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></blockquote>
<p>That first case involved a &ldquo;widespread failure to implement&rdquo; recordkeeping policies that &ldquo;was not hidden within the firm,&rdquo; &ldquo;was firm-wide, and involved employees at all levels of authority,&rdquo; and &ldquo;impacted the Commission&rsquo;s ability to carry out its regulatory functions and investigate potential violations of the federal securities laws across these investigations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many other cases have followed. The use of off-channel communications&mdash;text messages, smartphone chat applications like WhatsApp, and personal email outside firm-approved systems&mdash;is prevalent across the securities industry. We have an industry-wide problem that we will not solve through enforcement.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s action against Qatalyst illustrates why we cannot enforce our way to compliance. Under the standard applied in this case, even well-intentioned firms could find themselves in the Commission&rsquo;s enforcement queue time and again. Qatalyst has been working to address the off-channel issue for at least sixteen years. The Commission&rsquo;s Order outlines some of the firm&rsquo;s efforts:</p>
<blockquote>As early as 2008, Qatalyst personnel were advised that the use of unapproved electronic communications methods, including on their personal devices, was not permitted, and they should not use personal email, chats or text messaging applications for business purposes, or forward work-related communications to unapproved applications on their personal devices. Qatalyst reinforced its policies at least annually with regular, mandatory training and reinforcement from compliance and senior management. Qatalyst personnel were specifically advised not to list personal phone numbers in email signatures.</blockquote>
<p>Then, &ldquo;beginning in March 2017, Qatalyst provided its personnel with a compliant text-messaging process that could retain business communications&rdquo; and &ldquo;instructed its personnel to use only this process to communicate about Qatalyst&rsquo;s broker-dealer business by text message.&rdquo; &ldquo;<a name="_Hlk177725302">Beginning in 2020, Qatalyst required all personnel to have a firm-issued device on which to conduct Qatalyst business, and encouraged personnel to use firm-issued devices when communicating with both business and personal contacts</a>.&rdquo; Further updates to capture Slack and LinkedIn messages came in 2020 and 2022. Qatalyst trained its employees, monitored communications sent through firm-approved communication methods, and disciplined employees who violated the firm&rsquo;s policies. Even with all that, Qatalyst violated the recordkeeping requirements: &ldquo;Qatalyst collected data from a sampling of broker-dealer personnel and found that . . . several broker-dealer personnel, including at senior levels, had engaged in off-channel communications that concerned the broker-dealer&rsquo;s business as such.&rdquo; At the end of the day, despite Qatalyst&rsquo;s compliance efforts, the Commission&rsquo;s order states that:</p>
<blockquote>Qatalyst . . . failed to implement a system reasonably expected to determine whether all personnel, including supervisors, were following Qatalyst&rsquo;s policies and procedures. While permitting personnel to use approved communications methods, including on personal phones, for business communications, Qatalyst failed to implement sufficient monitoring to ensure that its recordkeeping and communications policies and procedures were&nbsp;<i>always</i>&nbsp;being followed.&rdquo; (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>
<p>This statement sounds to us like one that equates reasonableness with perfection. If we assess reasonableness based on whether policies and procedures always are being followed, firms will never escape our enforcement net. People are not perfect and so compliance will not be perfect&mdash;even at a firm that tries as hard as Qatalyst. Firing up our enforcement machinery every couple years to haul the industry in for headline-making penalties will not make people perfect, so firms will continue to discover violations of firm policies. We cannot enforce to perfection, but there is a way to achieve better compliance.</p>
<p>This case should serve as a catalyst for the Commission. We need to work with the industry and other interested members of the public to develop a pragmatic and privacy-respecting approach that enables firms and the Commission to have the records they need for compliance, examination, and enforcement at a reasonable cost in both financial and privacy terms. As we have this conversation, we ought to bear several points in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>The existing recordkeeping rules are a product of simpler times. The ways in which people communicate have multiplied, and the percentage of communications that are written has risen so firms have more avenues to monitor. Paper documents have given way to e-mail, which has given way to text messages, which have given way to app-based chats. This technological progression poses unique challenges and opportunities in terms of recordkeeping. 
<ul>
<li>How can we modernize the recordkeeping rules to deal with the recordkeeping challenges of the new technology and accompanying shifts in the communication habits of people?&nbsp; How do we identify and take advantage of aspects of these changes that facilitate recordkeeping?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Oral conversations that would not have been captured by recordkeeping rules in the past are now written conversations that are captured. One needs only observe a couple teenagers sitting in a room together who are texting one another rather than talking to each other to realize that texts have taken the place of what would have been oral communications in the past. This shift of communication from verbal to written intensified during the pandemic when colleagues that used to sit next to one another retreated to their own homes. 
<ul>
<li>Should we revisit the recordkeeping rules so that they do not capture the modern-day equivalent of oral chatter?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Client service imperatives drive how firms communicate with their clients. A client of an investment adviser who is also her neighbor wants to be able to send her a WhatsApp message when she needs advice on her investment portfolio, just as she does when she wants advice on her garden. Firms have made a lot of progress on developing tools that allow their employees to capture the business-related messages for recordkeeping purposes. 
<ul>
<li>How can we help firms as they think about seamless ways to accommodate client communication preferences and still meet recordkeeping obligations?</li>
<li>Issuing firm phones is an expensive option. What are best practices for firms that do not have the budget to issue phones or whose employees prefer not to have a work phone?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Firms and their employees have questions about what types of communications are covered by the rules. Certain messages are clearly covered by the rules, but others are not so clear. The lack of clarity stems in part&mdash;but not entirely&mdash;from the different scope of the recordkeeping rules for various types of firms.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-peirce-uyeda-qatalyst-09242024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> 
<ul>
<li>What can the Commission do to provide clarity on the requirements under the existing rules?</li>
<li>Is the scope of the current rules appropriate?</li>
<li>Once we settle on the scope, how can firms effectively train their employees about what needs to be preserved for recordkeeping purposes?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ensuring that employees abide by firm policies implicates privacy concerns. A firm can write excellent policies and procedures that prohibit the use of off-channel communications but ensuring that everybody complies with them is difficult. We see this in enforcement cases like Qatalyst, where the firm had a great set of policies and procedures, but some employees did not comply. Any firm surveillance system has to achieve record retention without subjecting employees&rsquo; personal means of communication to constant surveillance. Doing so is offensive to employees&rsquo; privacy and may have legal implications in some jurisdictions. Firms have developed ways, such as monitoring on-channel communications for indications that other communications are happening off-channel and only then looking at employees&rsquo; personal phones and emails. Firms also have disciplined employees found to be in violation of the policies, which sends a message that such conduct is not tolerated. 
<ul>
<li>What are best practices for training employees and ensuring compliance with off-channel communications policies and procedures?</li>
<li>What are best practices for monitoring compliance with off-channel communication prohibitions?</li>
<li>How do the securities recordkeeping rules interact with other laws, such as employment or privacy laws?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Input from compliance personnel is essential. To develop workable, effective policies, we need to hear from the people who write, implement, and oversee these policies. This issue would be a perfect one to put in front of a Chief Compliance Officer Advisory committee. Compliance personnel understand the importance of maintaining good records, the difficulty of doing so, and have real-world experience in weighing the sometimes-conflicting interests of firms, clients, and employees. 
<ul>
<li>What would an effective Chief Compliance Officer Advisory Committee look like?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The issues laid out above are only a few of the many that deserve discussion outside of the enforcement context. We look forward to working with our colleagues at the Commission and interested members of the public on a more productive path forward.</p>

<div> broker-dealers, investment advisers, recordkeeping, civil penalties, violations
Summary:
12 firms charged with recordkeeping violations by the SEC, ordered to pay civil penalties, and implement compliance improvements. Qatalyst Partners LP will not pay a penalty. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against 12 firms, comprising broker-dealers, investment advisers, and one dually-registered broker-dealer and investment adviser, for widespread and longstanding failures by the firms and their personnel to maintain and preserve electronic communications in violation of recordkeeping provisions of the federal securities laws.</p>
<p>The firms admitted the facts set forth in their respective SEC orders, acknowledged their conduct violated recordkeeping provisions of the federal securities laws, agreed to pay combined civil penalties of $88,225,000 as outlined below, and have begun implementing improvements to their compliance policies and procedures to address these violations. The firms are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Company, Inc. agreed to pay a $35 million penalty;</li>
<li>Invesco Distributors, Inc., together with Invesco Advisers, Inc., agreed to pay a $35 million penalty;</li>
<li>CIBC World Markets Corp., together with CIBC Private Wealth Advisors, Inc., agreed to pay a $12 million penalty;</li>
<li>Glazer Capital, LLC agreed to pay a $2 million penalty;</li>
<li>Intesa Sanpaolo IMI Securities Corp., agreed to pay a $1.5 million penalty;</li>
<li>Canaccord Genuity LLC agreed to pay a $1.25 million penalty;</li>
<li>Regions Securities LLC agreed to pay a $750,000 penalty;</li>
<li>Alpaca Securities LLC agreed to pay a $400,000 penalty;</li>
<li>Focused Wealth Management, Inc. agreed to pay a $325,000 penalty; and</li>
<li>Qatalyst Partners LP will not pay a penalty.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s enforcement actions reflect the range of remedies that parties may face for violating the recordkeeping requirements of the federal securities laws. Widespread and longstanding failures, including where those failures potentially hinder the Commission&rsquo;s investor protection function by compromising a firm&rsquo;s response to SEC subpoenas, may result in robust civil penalties,&rdquo; said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;On the other hand, firms that self-report and otherwise cooperate with the SEC&rsquo;s investigations may receive significantly reduced penalties. Here, despite recordkeeping failures that involved communications by senior leadership and persisted after our first recordkeeping matters were announced in 2021, Qatalyst took substantial steps to comply, self-reported, and remediated and, therefore, received a no-penalty resolution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigations into all the firms except for Qatalyst uncovered pervasive and longstanding use of unapproved communication methods, known as off-channel communications, at these firms. As described in the SEC&rsquo;s orders, the firms admitted that during the periods relevant to each order, their personnel sent and received off-channel communications that were records required to be maintained under securities laws. The failure to maintain and preserve required records deprives the SEC of these communications in our investigations. The failures involved personnel at multiple levels of authority, including supervisors and senior managers.</p>
<p>In contrast, in response to the Commission&rsquo;s recent off-channel enforcement actions, Qatalyst conducted an internal investigation and uncovered that Qatalyst personnel at various levels of authority sent and received off-channel communications, which Qatalyst did not maintain or preserve, that related to its broker-dealer business. Qatalyst will not pay a penalty because it self-reported its recordkeeping violations, cooperated with the staff&rsquo;s investigation, and demonstrated substantial efforts at compliance with the recordkeeping requirements. Two additional firms, Canaccord and Regions, also self-reported their violations and, as a result, will pay significantly lower civil penalties than they would have otherwise.</p>
<p>The firms were each charged with violating certain recordkeeping provisions of the Securities Exchange Act or the Investment Advisers Act or both. In addition, all but one of the firms failed to reasonably supervise their personnel with a view to preventing and detecting those violations. The SEC&rsquo;s order against Focused Wealth also found that the firm failed to adopt and implement policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent the firm and its supervised persons from violating recordkeeping requirements.</p>
<p>Each of the firms was ordered to cease and desist from future violations of the relevant recordkeeping provisions and was censured. Ten of the firms also agreed to retain compliance consultants to, among other things, conduct comprehensive reviews of their policies and procedures relating to the retention of electronic communications found on personal devices and their respective frameworks for addressing non-compliance by their personnel with those policies and procedures.</p>
<p>Separately, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission announced a settlement with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce&nbsp;for related conduct.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigations into Stifel, CIBC, Intesa, Canaccord, Alpaca, and Qatalyst were conducted by Laurel S. Fensterstock, Karolina Klyuchnikova, Austin Thompson, and Alison R. Levine. The SEC&rsquo;s investigation into Focused Wealth was conducted by Bennett Ellenbogen and Michael Paley. Each of these matters was supervised by Thomas P. Smith, Jr. of the New York Regional Office. The SEC&rsquo;s investigation into Invesco was conducted by Melanie Good, Craig Welter, and Nikolay Vydashenko, and supervised by Corey Schuster of the Enforcement Division&rsquo;s Asset Management Unit. &nbsp;The SEC&rsquo;s investigation into Glazer was conducted by Anne Hancock, Samantha Martin, and Christopher Rogers, and supervised by B. David Fraser of the Fort Worth Regional Office. The investigation into Regions was conducted by Katie D. Krysan and Amy S. Cotter, and supervised by Paul A. Montoya of the Chicago Regional Office.</p>

<title>Recent Views On Monetary Policy And The Economic Outlook, Federal Reserve Governor Michelle W. Bowman, At The 2024 Kentucky Bankers Association Annual Convention, Hot Springs, Virginia</title>

<div> Federal Open Market Committee, inflation, monetary policy, economy, labor market<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
Federal Reserve official dissented from recent FOMC decision to lower federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point, prefers more measured approach due to concerns about inflation and labor market. <div>
<p>Good morning. I would like to thank the Kentucky Bankers Association for the invitation to join you today for your annual convention.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240924a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;I appreciate the opportunity to share my views on the U.S. economy and monetary policy before we engage on community banking issues and other matters affecting the banking industry.</p>
<p>In light of last week's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, I will begin my remarks by providing some perspective on my vote and will then share my current views on the economy and monetary policy.</p>
<p><strong>Update on the Most Recent FOMC Meeting</strong><br />In order to address high inflation, for more than two years, the FOMC increased and held the federal funds rate at a restrictive level. At our September meeting, the FOMC voted to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point to 4-3/4 to 5 percent and to continue reducing the Federal Reserve's securities holdings.</p>
<p>As the post-meeting statement noted, I dissented from the FOMC's decision, preferring instead to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 5 to 5‑1/4 percent. Last Friday, once our FOMC participant communications blackout period concluded, the Board of Governors released my statement explaining the decision to depart from the majority of the voting members. I agreed with the Committee's assessment that, given the progress we have seen since the middle of 2023 on both lowering inflation and cooling the labor market, it was appropriate to reflect this progress by recalibrating the level of the federal funds rate and begin the process of moving toward a more neutral stance of policy. As my statement notes, I preferred a smaller initial cut in the policy rate while the U.S. economy remains strong and inflation remains a concern, despite recent progress.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Conditions and Outlook</strong><br />In recent months, we have seen some further progress on slowing the pace of inflation, with monthly readings lower than the elevated pace seen in the first three months of the year. The 12-month measure of core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation, which provides a broader perspective than the more volatile higher-frequency readings, has moved down since April, although it came in at 2.6 percent in July, again remaining well above our 2 percent goal. In addition, the latest consumer and producer price index reports suggest that 12‑month core PCE inflation in August was likely a touch above the July reading. The persistently high core inflation largely reflects pressures on housing prices, perhaps due in part to low inventories of affordable housing. The progress in lowering inflation since April is a welcome development, but core inflation is still uncomfortably above the Committee's 2 percent goal.</p>
<p>Prices remain much higher than before the pandemic, which continues to weigh on consumer sentiment. Higher prices have an outsized effect on lower- and moderate-income households, as these households devote a significantly larger share of income to food, energy, and housing. Prices for these spending categories have far outpaced overall inflation over the past few years.</p>
<p>Economic growth moderated earlier this year after coming in stronger last year. Private domestic final purchases (PDFP) growth has been solid and slowed much less than gross domestic product (GDP), as the slowdown in GDP growth was partly driven by volatile categories including net exports, suggesting that underlying economic growth was stronger than GDP indicated. PDFP has continued to increase at a solid pace so far in the third quarter, despite some further weakening in housing activity, as retail sales have shown further robust gains in July and August.</p>
<p>Although personal consumption has remained resilient, consumers appear to be pulling back on discretionary items and expenses, as evidenced in part by a decline in restaurant spending since late last year. Low- and moderate-income consumers no longer have extra savings to support this type of spending, and we have seen loan delinquency rates normalize from historically low levels during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The most recent labor market report shows that payroll employment gains have slowed appreciably to a pace moderately above 100,000 per month over the three months ending in August. The unemployment rate edged down to 4.2 percent in August from 4.3 percent in July. While unemployment is notably higher than a year ago, it is still at a historically low level and below my and the Congressional Budget Office's estimates of full employment.</p>
<p>The labor market has loosened from the extremely tight conditions of the past few years. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has declined further to a touch below the historically elevated pre-pandemic level&mdash;a sign that the number of available workers and the number of available jobs have come into better balance. But there are still more available jobs than available workers, a condition that before 2018 has only occurred twice for a prolonged period since World War II, further signaling ongoing labor market strength despite the reported data.</p>
<p>Although wage growth has slowed further in recent months, it remains indicative of a tight labor market. At just under 4 percent, as measured by both the employment cost index and average hourly earnings, wage gains are still above the pace consistent with our inflation goal given trend productivity growth.</p>
<p>The rise in the unemployment rate this year largely reflects weaker hiring, as job seekers entering or re-entering the labor force are taking longer to find work, while layoffs remain low. In addition to some cooling in labor demand, there are other factors likely contributing the increased unemployment. A mismatch between the skills of the new workers and available jobs could further raise unemployment, suggesting that higher unemployment has been partly driven by the stronger supply of workers. It is also likely that some temporary factors contributed to the recent rise in the unemployment rate, as unemployment among working age teenagers sharply increased in August.</p>
<p><strong>Preference for a More Measured Recalibration of Policy</strong><br />The U.S. economy remains strong and core inflation remains uncomfortably above our 2 percent target. In light of these economic conditions, a few further considerations supported the case for a more measured approach in beginning the process to recalibrate our policy stance to remove restriction and move toward a more neutral setting.</p>
<p>First, I was concerned that reducing the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point could be interpreted as a signal that the Committee sees some fragility or greater downside risks to the economy. In the current economic environment, with no clear signs of material weakening or fragility, in my view, beginning the rate-cutting cycle with a 1/4 percentage point move would have better reinforced the strength in economic conditions, while also confidently recognizing progress toward our goals. In my mind, a more measured approach would have avoided the risk of unintentionally signaling concerns about underlying economic conditions.</p>
<p>Second, I was also concerned that reducing the policy rate by 1/2 percentage point could have led market participants to expect that the Committee would lower the target range by that same pace at future meetings until the policy rate approaches a neutral level. If this expectation had materialized, we could have seen an unwarranted decline in longer-term interest rates and broader financial conditions could become overly accommodative. This outcome could work against the Committee's goal of returning inflation to our 2 percent target.</p>
<p>I am pleased that Chair Powell directly addressed both of these concerns during the press conference following last week's FOMC meeting.</p>
<p>Third, there continues to be a considerable amount of pent-up demand and cash on the sidelines ready to be deployed as the path of interest rates moves down. Bringing the policy rate down too quickly carries the risk of unleashing that pent-up demand. A more measured approach would also avoid unnecessarily stoking demand and potentially reigniting inflationary pressures.</p>
<p>Finally, in dialing back our restrictive stance of policy, we also need to be mindful of what the end point is likely to be. My estimate of the neutral rate is much higher than it was before the pandemic. Therefore, I think we are much closer to neutral than would have been the case under pre-pandemic conditions, and I did not see the peak stance of policy as restrictive to the same extent that my colleagues may have. With a higher estimate of neutral, for any given pace of rate reductions, we would arrive at our destination sooner.</p>
<p><strong>Ongoing Risks to the Outlook</strong><br />Turning to the risks to achieving our dual mandate, I continue to see greater risks to price stability, especially while the labor market continues to be near estimates of full employment. Although the labor market data have been showing signs of cooling in recent months, still-elevated wage growth, solid consumer spending, and resilient GDP growth are not consistent with a material economic weakening or fragility. My contacts also continue to mention that they are not planning layoffs and continue to have difficulty hiring. Therefore, I am taking less signal from the recent labor market data until there are clear trends indicating that both spending growth and the labor market have materially weakened. I suspect the recent immigration flows have and will continue to affect labor markets in ways that we do not yet fully understand and cannot yet accurately measure. In light of the dissonance created by conflicting economic signals, measurement challenges, and data revisions, I remain cautious about taking signal from only a limited set of real-time data releases.</p>
<p>In my view, the upside risks to inflation remain prominent. Global supply chains continue to be susceptible to labor strikes and increased geopolitical tensions, which could result in inflationary effects on food, energy, and other commodity markets. Expansionary fiscal spending could also lead to inflationary risks, as could an increased demand for housing given the long-standing limited supply, especially of affordable housing. While it has not been my baseline outlook, I cannot rule out the risk that progress on inflation could continue to stall.</p>
<p>Although it is important to recognize that there has been meaningful progress on lowering inflation, while core inflation remains around or above 2.5 percent, I see the risk that the Committee's larger policy action could be interpreted as a premature declaration of victory on our price-stability mandate. Accomplishing our mission of returning to low and stable inflation at our 2 percent goal is necessary to foster a strong labor market and an economy that works for everyone in the longer term.</p>
<p>In light of these considerations, I believe that, by moving at a measured pace toward a more neutral policy stance, we will be better positioned to achieve further progress in bringing inflation down to our 2 percent target, while closely watching the evolution of labor market conditions.</p>
<p><strong>The Path Forward</strong><br />Despite my dissent at the recent FOMC meeting, I respect and appreciate that my FOMC colleagues preferred to begin the reduction in the federal funds rate with a larger initial cut in the target range for the policy rate. I remain committed to working together with my colleagues to ensure that monetary policy is appropriately positioned to achieve our goals of attaining maximum employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent target.</p>
<p>I will continue to monitor the incoming data and information as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy, and I will remain cautious in my approach to adjusting the stance of policy going forward. It is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. My colleagues and I will make our decisions at each FOMC meeting based on the incoming data and the implications for and risks to the outlook guided by the Fed's dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. We need to ensure that the public understands clearly how current and expected deviations of inflation and employment from our mandated goals inform our policy decisions.</p>
<p>By the time of our next meeting in November, we will have received updated reports on inflation, employment, and economic activity. We may also have a better understanding of how developments in longer-term interest rates and broader financial conditions might influence the economic outlook.</p>
<p>During the intermeeting period, I will continue to visit with a broad range of contacts to discuss economic conditions as I assess the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance. As I noted earlier, I continue to view inflation as a concern. In light of the upside risks that I just described, it remains necessary to pay close attention to the price-stability side of our mandate while being attentive to the risks of a material weakening in the labor market. My view continues to be that restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment over the longer run. However, should the data evolve in a way that points to a material weakening in the labor market, I would support taking action and adjust monetary policy as needed while taking into account our inflation mandate.</p>
<p><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong><br />In closing, thank you again for welcoming me here today. It is a pleasure to join you and to have the opportunity to discuss my views on the economy and monetary policy. And given the recent FOMC meeting decision and my dissent, I appreciate being able to provide a more detailed explanation of the reasoning that led me to dissent in favor of a smaller reduction in the policy rate at last week's FOMC meeting.</p>
<p>I look forward to answering your questions and to engaging with your members on bank regulatory and supervisory matters.</p>

<p><span>Speaker:&nbsp;</span>Therese Chambers, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight<br /><span>Event:&nbsp;</span>AFME Annual European Compliance and Legal Conference<br /><span>Delivered:&nbsp;</span>24 September 2024</p>
<h2>Key messages:</h2>
<ul>
<li>We are adapting our approach to enforcement to meet evolving threats and maximise the deterrent effect.</li>
<li>We are making our investigations faster and more focused to nip financial crime in the bud and send timely signals to markets and consumers.</li>
<li>Enforcement is just one of our tools &ndash; industry cooperation, assertive supervision and intervention powers are also key in dealing with harm.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>You could be forgiven for missing the Department for Transport&rsquo;s summer publication on official taxi and private hire statistics.</p>
<p>Not everyone&rsquo;s ideal summer holiday read, I know.</p>
<p>Buried in the report was the revelation that 20% of Private Hire vehicles in England are a Toyota Prius.</p>
<p>For any of us who&rsquo;ve been caught short in a London shower - or just not felt quite brave enough to face the Central Line at rush hour! - that may not come as much of a surprise.</p>
<p>It certainly hasn&rsquo;t escaped the notice of internet sleuths, with entire subreddits devoted to exploring that vital question, &lsquo;Why are there so many Toyota Priuses in London?&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the ubiquitous Prius is just one piece of the puzzle that&rsquo;s seen Toyota grow to become the largest car maker in the world.</p>
<p>Central to the company&rsquo;s success has been the much-lauded &lsquo;Toyota Way&rsquo; of operating, a key part of which is the Japanese philosophy of kaizen. &lsquo;Kai&rsquo; meaning &lsquo;change&rsquo; and &lsquo;zen&rsquo; meaning &lsquo;for the better&rsquo;&hellip;. Change for the better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about embracing self-criticism and challenging the status quo&hellip;</p>
<p>Adapting and evolving to meet new challenges&hellip;</p>
<p>Taking a more efficient approach for better outcomes.</p>
<p>I think we can all learn a little something from Toyota - other car manufacturers are available! - and the philosophy of kaizen.</p>
<p>You could even say that we are applying our own interpretation of kaizen at the FCA:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are improving our processes and embracing innovation&hellip; intervening earlier, acting faster and with more focus.</li>
<li>We are taking a targeted, outcomes-based approach&hellip; not shying away from tough conversations in pursuit of long-term success.</li>
<li>In short, we are raising the bar on ourselves&hellip; enabling a fair and thriving financial services sector for the good of consumers and the economy.</li>
</ul>
<h2>A hard line on financial crime</h2>
<p>Key to securing those positive outcomes is the ongoing fight against financial crime.</p>
<p>Why? Because financial crime does not just hurt individual consumers&hellip; It hurts rule-abiding firms &ndash; not least in the pocket, by adding costs into the system&hellip; And it hurts us all, by damaging the reputation of our markets.</p>
<p>For the UK financial services industry to grow and be competitive, investors and institutions need to have trust in it. And how can we expect them to have that trust, if they don&rsquo;t see system integrity?</p>
<p>That is why reducing and preventing serious harm from financial crime is a focus of our current strategy and will remain a significant pillar in our next, due in 2025.</p>
<p>Enforcement clearly plays a vital role in delivering this aim. Fines, bans and prosecutions are often what the public notice most about our work.</p>
<p>Not surprising when you consider our recent outcomes:</p>
<p>Just this month&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/pwc-fined-failing-alert-fca-suspected-fraudulent-activity-london-capital-finance-plc">we fined PWC &pound;15m</a>&nbsp;for failing to alert us to suspected fraudulent activity at London Capital &amp; Finance&hellip;</p>
<p>We&nbsp;recently brought charges against 9 so called '<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/finfluencers-charged-promoting-unauthorised-trading-scheme">finfluencers</a>&rsquo; for promoting foreign exchange trading schemes on social media without authorisation&hellip;</p>
<p>And we have over 45&nbsp;people currently facing FCA criminal proceedings, covering offences from fraud to forgery, insider dealing to money laundering.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>But enforcement action is not just about dishing out punishment; it&rsquo;s also about educating the whole market on what we expect, and where others have fallen short.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Collaboration</h2>
<p>Collaboration - with both firms and other enforcement agencies - plays an important role.</p>
<p>Take money laundering for example. We supervise around 18,000 firms under the Money Laundering Regulations, and anti-money laundering investigations represent a meaningful portion of our enforcement caseload. Around 15%. Banks play a vital role in helping to detect money laundering in the first place &ndash; supporting the FCA to act earlier to nip financial crime in the bud.</p>
<p>This is really important work that not only helps us reduce and prevent crime, but plays a bigger part in boosting the perception of the UK as a trusted place to do business. That is something all of us here today benefit from, and I strongly urge banks to keep up that good work with us.</p>
<p>The FCA also maintains strong relationships globally. We recently worked with the French regulator, the AMF, to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/h2o-will-pay-250-million-euro-investors-following-fca-investigation">censure asset manager H2O LLP for failures</a>&nbsp;which had left investors unable to access their funds since 2020. As a result of this international collaboration, we were able to&nbsp;secure &euro;250m in redress for the investors who had lost out.</p>
<p>Closer to home, we worked closely with the PRA in successfully&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-fines-cgml-27-million">fining Citigroup &pound;61.6m for failures in the firm&rsquo;s systems and controls</a>&hellip;Failures that had allowed a trader to erroneously sell US$1.4bn of equities in European markets in May 2022 when they should not have. Thanks to excellent collaboration between the regulators, we were able to successfully settle the case within just 23 months.</p>
<p>And I want to touch on a couple of really important takeaways from that particular case:</p>
<p>First, systems need to be designed with real people in mind. Let&rsquo;s be honest, who hasn&rsquo;t blindly clicked &lsquo;Accept&rsquo; on a pop-up without fully reading it? So controls must be robust: recognising and reflecting human behaviour patterns, constantly reviewed to keep pace with changing market conditions.</p>
<p>Second, let&rsquo;s learn the lessons of the past few years - especially on common issues around risk management. Yes, we live in a fragile macro-economic environment. But we all know that; this is a &lsquo;predictable volatility&rsquo;. We must do better, plan better, using all the tools we now have - data and operational - to their full power.</p>
<h2>Data and technology</h2>
<p>And data and technology are certainly playing a growing role in our work at the FCA.</p>
<p>I like to remind people that the name of my division is Enforcement and Market Oversight.</p>
<p>While our enforcement work might grab the headlines, behind the scenes our Market Oversight teams are quietly working away, using sophisticated digital tools to monitor the market and detect misconduct in real time. I may be biased, but I think they&rsquo;re the unsung heroes at the FCA!</p>
<p>We have more than doubled our trading data coverage from 500m to around 1 billion records per day,&nbsp;and&nbsp;our systems can interrogate data across multiple asset classes quickly. But of course it&rsquo;s not enough to just have the data. We also need the tools to use it.</p>
<p>That is where our refreshed analytics come in - helping us spot ever more complex patterns, for example involving organised crime groups.</p>
<p>Our Cyber Forensics Unit is equipped with the latest technology and expertise to handle complex digital forensic tasks, and we are improving those capabilities all the time. Going forwards, our approach will be ever more data - and technology - driven, and I&rsquo;d strongly encourage firms to collaborate with us in this. Because the quicker we can gather accurate information, the quicker we can respond to challenges as they arise... helping us to speed up and stay ahead of the criminals looking to exploit our markets.</p>
<h2>Increased pace and focus</h2>
<p>Because if we want our financial services sector to be competitive, if we want our economy to grow, we must protect and maintain the UK&rsquo;s strong reputation for integrity. High standards of regulation and effective enforcement are critical to that effort. Visibly holding wrongdoers to account gives confidence to consumers, businesses and investors that the UK is a place where high standards are upheld.</p>
<p>We know that the deterrent effect of enforcement action is greater the closer in time it is to misconduct occurring. The longer it takes for outcomes to be determined, the longer it takes for us to send important signals to the markets.</p>
<p>Our data tells us that investigations closed in 2023/24 took an average of 42 months to complete. There are good reasons for these timelines: cases are often highly complex and we, like all enforcement agencies around the world, are adapting to the ever-growing amount of digital evidence that must be analysed. Each case is about 60-70,000 documents! But we believe we can improve on those timelines. We have made significant advances already: 24 outcomes under&nbsp;our belt so far for 2024, compared to 26 for the whole of 2023.</p>
<p>This includes an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-first-enforcement-action-against-firm-enabling-cryptoasset-trading">investigation into&nbsp;Coinbase Group</a>&nbsp;for breaking restrictions and allowing thousands of high-risk customers to make cryptoasset transactions totalling around USD$226m. After an investigation completed in just 16 months, they received a multimillion pound fine.</p>
<p>We have seen some &lsquo;firsts&rsquo; in the crypto space, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-charges-first-individual-running-network-illegal-crypto-atms" title="FCA charges first individual with running a network of illegal crypto ATMs">prosecuting an individual for running a network of illegal crypto ATMs</a>&nbsp;&ndash; a thorough and focused investigation which took 15 months to complete.</p>
<p>We closed 60 operations in the financial year 2023/24, compared to 38 in the previous year - more than 25% of these were less than 2 years old.</p>
<p>And as I speak to you today, my team is actively negotiating settlements in cases where it has taken less than 2 years to complete the investigation.</p>
<p>I am encouraged by these green shoots and we are committed to conducting our investigations at greater pace. Hand in hand with increasing our pace, will be streamlining our caseload and focusing on investigations better aligned to our strategic priorities.</p>
<p>But let me be clear: a reduction in the number of investigations does not mean a reduction in effort. Quite the opposite. It&rsquo;s about making a conscious decision to identify cases where we believe there may be conduct creating the greatest risk of harm, and where an investigation is most likely to drive the greatest deterrence. Neither does it mean going for the low hanging fruit.</p>
<p>We will continue to investigate potential misconduct by individuals and firms, and will never shy away from challenging and complex investigations. So, whilst we may be opening fewer investigations, we expect to see a greater number of outcomes and a greater impact from our enforcement activity.</p>
<h2>Transparency</h2>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s not surprising that accelerating our investigations and adopting a laser focus on cases we pursue has been widely welcomed. But the lightning rod has clearly been proposals for greater transparency on who we are investigating and why.</p>
<p>While consumers groups, whistleblowers and some other regulators welcomed the prospect of greater transparency, the companies we regulate were overwhelmingly against.</p>
<p>So first, let me assure you all: we are listening. We have analysed each and every one of the more than 130 responses to our consultation. And we are not going to rush this.</p>
<p>Amongst the strong feelings on all sides, I want to return for a moment to what it is we&rsquo;re trying to solve, and why.</p>
<p>At the moment, bar &lsquo;exceptional circumstances&rsquo;, we are silent during the period between looking into a potential issue and reaching an outcome. What that has meant in practice, is that &lsquo;exceptional circumstances&rsquo; has usually translated into &lsquo;computer says no&rsquo; in response to requests for further information. We put forward a proposal for greater transparency on our investigations into firms, where it was in the public interest.</p>
<p>We did so on the basis that appropriate openness could:</p>
<ul>
<li>support consumer protection by giving them information that may support their decision-making</li>
<li>improve the market by highlighting concerning conduct, allowing others to course correct sooner, lessening risk</li>
<li>assure those who have potentially vital evidence, including whistleblowers, that we&rsquo;re looking into concerns and our door is open</li>
</ul>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, it could address the odd situation we find ourselves in, where a fellow UK regulator can announce an investigation, but we would be unlikely to be able to announce -&nbsp; also in a factual and measured way&nbsp; - that we too were running enquiries.</p>
<p>That happened in the recent fine for PwC; the FRC was able to announce an investigation running parallel to ours, around 2 years before we confirmed our findings (and that our investigation had existed at all).</p>
<p>But that is not to say our proposals indicated a sudden switch to a blanket &lsquo;computer says yes&rsquo; approach. We are not&nbsp;proposing moving from publicity in zero cases now, to 100% of cases in the future. Rather, a case-by-case approach following assessment of clearly defined criteria - including consideration of the potential impact on the firm and market. But we heard loud and clear that the criteria we consulted on were too high level and lacked specificity.</p>
<p>This autumn, we will intensify our engagement &ndash; meeting with trade associations, firms, those on all sides of the debate &ndash; exploring how we can develop our proposals. As part of this, we recognise the desire for greater definition on any new public interest test.</p>
<p>Later this autumn we plan to provide greater detail on how it could work in practice. To bring this to life, we will publish case studies examining how the criteria might apply and what announcements could look like, as well as more information on the numbers of cases that might be affected.</p>
<p>We heard clearly too the concern that firms felt they would not have sufficient time to make representations, and will respond to the constructive feedback we&rsquo;ve received on this point. Allowing firms time to provide their views on whether, what and when we announce, will be part of any proposal we take forward. So I want to reassure everyone here today that we have heard the strength of feeling on this &ndash; from all sides &ndash; and that this is very much an ongoing conversation.</p>
<p>Since the consultation closed in April, we have been reflecting on the range of serious concerns raised and working to build understanding. We do think the case for a degree more transparency remains strong. But it needs to be seen within the vital context of a focused number of cases likely to deliver the greatest deterrent, and delivered much faster.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are committed to achieving this in the right way for UK consumers and markets, so we won&rsquo;t be rushing into any decisions. We want the right solutions, not the quickest ones. And rest assured, as we work to find those solutions, we will be mindful of all our objectives &ndash; including supporting the international competitiveness of the UK&rsquo;s financial services and the medium to long term growth of the economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So the FCA&rsquo;s approach to enforcement is changing &ndash; but this is not change for change&rsquo;s sake, or change that should be feared.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s change to increase public confidence in financial services.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s change for the better. It&rsquo;s kaizen.</p>
<p>But kaizen can&rsquo;t just be a one-person job; it requires cooperation and commitment from all of us here today, across industry and regulators&hellip;to stop market abuse, keep our markets clean, and to build trust.</p>
<p>This is how we will attract talent to our sector, bring in investment to our shores, and grow our economy.</p>
<p>This is how we will all prosper.</p>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ice-launches-new-suite-of-physical-climate-risk-municipal-indices-integrating-ic/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced that it has launched a new suite of climate risk municipal indices, using the ICE Climate Risk Score, aimed at tracking the performance of securities selected based on exposure to acute climate risks.</p>
<p>The new suite of climate risk municipal indices is a collaboration between ICE&rsquo;s Climate and Index teams. The indices, using ICE Climate Risk data, track the performance of securities issued by obligors with different projected vulnerability to a range of climate risks, including hurricanes, wildfires and floods.</p>
<p>The new index family includes:</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li>ICE US High Physical Climate Risk Municipal Index (MUNIHICR)</li>
<li>ICE US Low Physical Climate Risk Municipal Index (MUNILOCR)</li>
<li>ICE US High Physical Wildfire Risk Municipal Index (MUNIWFCR)</li>
<li>ICE US High Physical Flood Risk Municipal Index (MUNIFLCR)</li>
<li>ICE US High Physical Hurricane Risk Municipal Index (MUNIHRCR)</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;ICE indices have helped market participants capture exposure to some of the most dynamic trends that shape the global economy, and climate risk has increasingly become an important factor in the investment decision-making process,&rdquo; said Preston Peacock, Head of ICE Data Indices, administrator of the new indices. &ldquo;This new suite of climate indices will be an effective tool to track advancements in the repricing of climate risk in bond markets for researchers and investors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ICE Climate Risk Score serves as a singular assessment, ranging from 0.0 to 5.0, amalgamating all the ICE Sustainable Finance Platform's climate hazard models. It provides a comprehensive, relative measure of estimated total property risk stemming from physical climate hazards for a specific location, or a collection of locations related to the obligor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;ICE research shows that, despite accelerating economic damages from severe weather, physical climate risk is not yet being priced into municipal bonds," said Evan Kodra, Head of Climate R&amp;D at ICE. "That lack of pricing signal could obscure the true risk and perpetuate complacency around climate in the market. We are pleased to assist in the launch of new indices that can help address this, giving investors a consistent pulse on the climate-yield relationship and a benchmark for managing portfolio risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These new climate risk municipal indices join ICE&rsquo;s fixed income index offering, which includes approximately 6,000 standard indices tracking more than $100 trillion in debt spanning the global bond markets, with debt represented across 51 currencies.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority: Extension To Motor Finance Complaint Handling Pause Confirmed</title>

<div> Extended deadline, motor finance, discretionary commission arrangements, FCA, complaint response

Summary:
The FCA extends the deadline for motor finance firms to respond to complaints about discretionary commission arrangements, considering a redress scheme. Consumers have extended time to refer complaints to the Ombudsman. 
<br /><br /> <div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has extended the pause to the deadline for motor finance firms to provide a final response to customer complaints regarding discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs) until 4 December 2025.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>On 11 January 2024, the FCA&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/fca-undertake-work-motor-finance-market" title="FCA to undertake work in the motor finance market">announced a review</a>&nbsp;into whether motor finance customers have been overcharged because of the past use of DCAs.</p>
<p>The FCA also paused the 8-week deadline for a final response to relevant customer complaints. The FCA introduced the pause to prevent disorderly, inconsistent and inefficient outcomes for consumers, as well as knock-on effects on firms and the market, while it assessed the issue and determined the best way forward.</p>
<p>On 30 July 2024, the FCA consulted on a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/update-motor-finance-work" title="Update on motor finance work">proposal to extend the DCA complaint handling pause</a>. This was because it had taken the FCA longer than expected to get the data it needed from firms. Barclays Partner Finance has also launched a judicial review of the Financial Ombudsman Service&rsquo;s decision to uphold a complaint relating to its use of a DCA. The judicial review will consider legal issues highly relevant to our work. The hearing will take place in October.</p>
<p>The FCA will set out next steps in its review into the past use of DCAs in May 2025. By then, the FCA expects to have completed its analysis and assessed the outcome of the Barclays judicial review and other relevant cases in the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/policy/ps24-11.pdf" title="ps24-11.pdf">extended pause</a>&nbsp;allows the FCA time, if necessary, to introduce an alternative way of dealing with DCA complaints, such as a consumer redress scheme. It is too early to say if the FCA will intervene in this way, but based on its work so far, it is more likely than when the FCA started its review.</p>
<h2>Making a complaint</h2>
<p>While firms have longer to deal with DCA complaints, consumers should be aware you can still complain to your provider and there are time limits for doing so.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/car-finance-complaints" title="Car finance complaints">Check if the FCA's work applies to you and how to complain</a>.</p>
<p>The FCA has also confirmed consumers have until the later of 29 July 2026 or 15 months from the date of their final response letter from the firm, to refer a DCA complaint to the Financial Ombudsman (instead of the usual 6 months). This is so consumers will not have to decide whether to refer their complaint to the Financial Ombudsman before the FCA announce next steps.</p>

<div> GFCI 36, Global Financial Centres Index, New York, London, Hong Kong<br />
Summary: New York remains the top financial centre, with geopolitical challenges identified as the greatest risk, but confidence remains strong. <div>
<h4>GFCI 36 Headlines</h4>
<ul>
<li>The 36th edition of the Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI 36) was published today by Z/Yen Group in partnership with the China Development Institute (CDI). The launch event for GFCI 36 was held in Busan at an international symposium hosted by Busan Finance Center. </li>
<li>New York held onto the top position in the index and has now been in first place since GFCI 24, published in September 2018. </li>
<li>London remains second, and Hong Kong has regained third position, overtaking Singapore in fourth position. </li>
<li>San Francisco remains at number five, with Chicago and Los Angeles overtaking Shanghai to place sixth and seventh, with Shanghai now in eighth position. Shenzhen and Frankfurt complete the top 10. </li>
<li>There is little change in the ranking of the leading centres, with only Dublin improving more than four rank places - up 11. This continues to suggest no major changes in the economic outlook across the leading economies in the world, with slow but continued growth and inflation falling. </li>
<li>The average rating across all centres was down 0.42%, suggesting little change in confidence in the financial sector, with the average rating for centres in Latin America &amp; The Caribbean up 0.65% - the only region in which ratings increased. </li>
<li>New York retains its leading position in the Fintech ranking, followed by London. Shenzhen overtook San Francisco to take third position by just one rating point. </li>
<li>Hong Kong has joined Washington DC, Los Angeles, Chicago, Singapore, and Seoul in the top 10 FinTech centres, replacing Shanghai, which has dropped to 15th position. </li>
<li>For this edition of the GFCI, we have researched the key challenges facing international financial centres in the medium term. Geo-Political challenges are clearly seen as the most important risk, mentioned by over 20% of respondents. Competition from other centres and regulatory requirements were mentioned by 15% and 14% of respondents respectively. </li>
</ul>
<p><span>The top 20 centres in GFCI 36 are shown in the table below:</span></p>
<p><span><img alt="GFCI_36" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/GFCI_36.jpg" title="GFCI_36" /><br /></span></p>

<p><strong><i>Mike Wardle, Chief Executive of Z/Yen, said: &ldquo;Geo-political risks are identified as the greatest challenge facing financial centres and their development. However, confidence in leading international financial centres remains strong, and many leading financial centres improved or maintained their rating in GFCI 36, with a high degree of stability in the rankings.&rdquo;</i></strong></p>

<title>Securities Commission Malaysia: National Sustainability Reporting Framework To Enhance Sustainability Disclosures</title>

<div> Framework, Malaysia, Sustainability, Reporting, Standards
<br />
The National Sustainability Reporting Framework (NSRF) enhances sustainability disclosures in Malaysia by adopting IFRS® Sustainability Disclosure Standards, addressing stakeholder needs and implementing phased reporting requirements. 
<br /><br />Summary: 
The National Sustainability Reporting Framework (NSRF) in Malaysia aligns with IFRS Sustainability Standards, addresses stakeholder needs, and implements phased reporting requirements. <div>
<p>The National Sustainability Reporting Framework (NSRF), developed by the Advisory Committee on Sustainability Reporting (ACSR)<sup>1</sup>, is set to enhance the state of sustainability disclosures in Malaysia.</p>
<p>The NSRF addresses the use of the IFRS<sup>&reg;</sup> Sustainability Disclosure Standards issued by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) as the baseline for companies in Malaysia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The aim is to enhance transparency and accountability of how businesses manage sustainability risks and opportunities, improve business resilience and contribute to the nation&rsquo;s broader sustainability agenda.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NSRF also addresses the needs of stakeholders especially investors for consistent, comparable and reliable disclosures.</p>
<p>Following the launch of the NSRF by Finance Minister II YB Senator Datuk Seri Amir Hamzah Azizan at the Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) today, Malaysia joins more than 20 jurisdictions<sup>2</sup>, which have decided or are taking steps to use the standards.</p>
<p>Developed through extensive public consultations with various stakeholders, including local and foreign investors, various industry and professional associations, the NSRF meets the growing demand for sustainability information.</p>
<p>The SC Chairman Dato&rsquo; Mohammad Faiz Azmi emphasised that the NSRF aligns with both investor expectations and the need to act on the climate crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a major trading country and an open economy that has an important role in the global supply chain, it is important we adopt these requirements in an open way to reap the benefit of being an adopter&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Listed issuers on Bursa Malaysia&rsquo;s Main and ACE Markets, as well as large non-listed companies (NLCos) with annual revenue of RM2 billion and above will have to comply with the new reporting requirements in a phased approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Large-listed issuers on the Main Market with market capitalisation of RM2 billion and above will begin using the ISSB Standards in 2025 (Group 1); </li>
<li>This will extend to other Main Market listed issuers in 2026 (Group 2), followed by; </li>
<li>Listed issuers on the ACE Market as well as large NLCos in 2027 (Group 3).</li>
</ul>
<p>In relation to climate disclosures, the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD) which are incorporated in the Bursa Malaysia Listing Requirements are fully embedded in the ISSB&rsquo;s standards for climatedisclosures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ISSB standards builds on the same pillars of the TCFD i.e. governance, strategy, risk management, as well as metrics and targets. Thus, listed issuers have a degree of familiarity with the disclosure requirements under the standards.</p>
<p>Subject to further consultations and engagements, the ACSR aims to mandate reasonable assurance of sustainability information commencing in 2027.<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>To support implementation of the NSRF, the ACSR&rsquo;s PACE (Policy, Assumptions, Calculators and Education) initiative will offer capacity building programmes, resources and toolkits to help preparers, including those which are focused on addressing the needs of medium and smaller companies.</p>
<p>Following the launch of the NSRF, Bursa Malaysia has also issued a public consultation on the proposed amendments to align its Listing Requirements. Further information on the NSRF is available at <a href="http://www.sc.com.my/nsrf">www.sc.com.my/nsrf</a><a href="http://www.sc.com.my/nsrf">,</a> and any queries can be directed to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="mailto:nsrf@seccom.com.my" title="nsrf@seccom.com.my">nsrf@seccom.com.my</a></span>. &nbsp;</p>

<li>The ACSR is a national inter-agency committee formed with the endorsement of the Ministry of Finance and chaired by the SC. Members comprise of representatives from the Audit Oversight Board of the Securities Commission Malaysia, Bank Negara Malaysia, Companies Commission of Malaysia, Bursa Malaysia Berhad, and the Financial Reporting Foundation.</li>

<title>Exchange Innovation To Attract SMEs To List Shows Differing Levels Of Success Globally – WFE Research</title>

<div> exchanges, SMEs, platforms, market capitalization, listing segments
<br />
Exchanges are offering SME listing platforms with reduced requirements, but effectiveness varies. Growing market capitalization in emerging economies calls for tailored exchange and ecosystem support.
<br /><br />Summary: <br />Exchanges are adapting requirements for SMEs, but effectiveness varies. Market capitalization in emerging economies calls for tailored support. <div>
<p>The majority of public markets now offer dedicated Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) listing platforms or segments and provide additional support for them to list and access affordable finance, according to research by the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE), the global industry association for exchanges and CCPs. However, these initiatives are met with varying levels of success, which depend on the manner, and level, of regulatory and government support.<br /><br />More than two thirds (68%, 49 out of 72 exchanges polled) of member exchanges now offer specialized SME listing platforms or segments, featuring innovative listing and regulatory requirements, reduced fees and profitability prerequisites, or smaller issuances.&nbsp;<br /><br />They are doing so in response to the needs of investors, by providing access to information and the ability to allocate capital to these businesses, and for SMEs by responding to the significant challenges around accessing finance and, in some markets, to a decline in listings.&nbsp;<br /><br />Of the different benefits that SME platforms offer to issuers, the most frequent are exemptions from the minimum profitability requirement (57%), a less frequent reporting schedule (33%), no minimum free-float requirement (30%), and no historical financial statements requirement (7%).&nbsp;<br /><br />The survey results published today provide a snapshot of the initiatives exchanges have introduced to attract and enable SMEs to access public markets, and where these initiatives are working best.<br /><br />Additional key findings from the research:</p>
<ul>
<li>Of the world&rsquo;s SME public equity markets, those in advanced economies remain the world&rsquo;s largest by market capitalisation (79%).</li>
<li>Emerging and developing countries have seen the number of listings nearly double from 2012 to 2022, primarily driven by the developing countries in the East Asia and&nbsp;Pacific region which account for 49% of global SME listings.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Conversely, the number of listings in the North America and Latin America and&nbsp;Caribbean regions has&nbsp;been decreasing during the same period.</li>
<li>In emerging and developing countries, the market capitalisation of SMEs has increased thirteen-fold since 2012, reaching roughly USD 2.13 trillion in 2022. The East Asia and&nbsp;Pacific region also dominates, accounting for 90% of the total market capitalisation, surpassing USD 2.41 trillion by the end of 2022.</li>
<li>SME markets generally exhibit lower liquidity compared to main markets making it challenging for SMEs to raise capital and attract investors.</li>
<li>Volatility in SME markets has increased post-Covid, with policies like stimulus packages amplifying market fluctuations, especially in SME markets dominated by retail investors.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />While the initiatives by exchanges to attract more SMEs have shown some success, particularly in emerging and developing countries, the impact varies significantly across different regions. While exchange initiatives are beneficial, their effectiveness is often amplified when supported by a vibrant and widely-supported financial ecosystem, implying that a combination of tailored exchange initiatives and broader financial ecosystem action is necessary to drive substantial growth in SME listings.<br /><br />In the survey, exchanges reported that the three most important issues SMEs cited as concerns about going public were:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Losing the control of the firm</li>
<li>More onerous reporting and disclosure obligations</li>
<li>Difficulty in attracting investors</li>
</ol>
<p><br />To address these concerns the WFE states that the following actions should be taken:</p>
<ol>
<li>Regulators must put on an educational programme for SMEs to highlight the benefits of listing and explain the different ownership structures on offer.</li>
<li>Regulators must recognise the needs of SMEs and work alongside exchanges to develop particular platforms or segments with less onerous obligations for SMEs.</li>
<li>Exchanges should continue to encourage investors to invest in SMEs by introducing reduced fees, research coverage, and investor training/education programmes.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p><br /><strong>Pedro Gurrola-Perez, Head of Research at the WFE commented:&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;Rapidly raising funds for SMEs in the capital market is crucial for their development and prosperity. Adopting these initiatives for specific platforms or venues provides an alternative access to capital previously closed to SMEs and benefits the financial market as a whole, with a greater degree of transparency and more investment opportunities than if these businesses stayed private.&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong>Nandini Sukumar, CEO at the WFE commented:</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;Exchanges are recognising the needs of SMEs and are finding ways of adapting listing requirements to match those needs, while keeping the adequate levels of transparency to ensure efficient markets. Only when the whole financial ecosystem takes action will we see global prosperous SME markets. Policymakers need to consider how best they can enhance the attractiveness of their domestic exchanges through initiatives such as tax incentives or the simplification of listing regimes.&rdquo;<br /><br />The full paper can be read&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://world-exchanges.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=48ddcbc11eb58f141a51219ea&amp;id=a603e7e2cc&amp;e=979576350c" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<title>Strategic Political, Corporate Leadership Needed For Africa's Net Zero Transition - Popoola, NGX Group Boss</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: Africa, net zero transition, leadership, sustainability, value chain <br />
Summary: Africa needs a robust, export-driven strategy to address net zero transition challenges, with strong leadership and corporate responsibility to drive sustainable growth and development. <div>
<p>Africa must adopt a robust, export-driven strategy to meet the challenges of the net zero transition, according to Mr. Temi Popoola, Group Managing Director and CEO of Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX). Speaking at a side event during the UN Climate Week, organized by Africa Foresight Group and KfW DEG, Popoola emphasized the critical need for strong, coordinated leadership across both political and corporate sectors.</p>
<p>Popoola cautioned against repeating the mistakes of Nigeria&rsquo;s crude oil sector, often dubbed the &ldquo;resource curse,&rdquo; as the continent navigates the rising electric vehicle and smartphone industries. &ldquo;We must ensure Africa captures the full value of its resources, rather than merely exporting raw materials,&rdquo; he stated.</p>
<p>He noted the varying levels of commitment among Nigerian companies toward sustainability initiatives. While some corporations are investing significantly to reduce their carbon footprints and engage in transparent reporting, many others remain behind. Popoola also highlighted the growing threat of greenwashing, which could undermine real efforts toward sustainability.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the broader geopolitical context, particularly shifts in climate priorities in the United States, Popoola warned that strong leadership is vital for building a comprehensive value chain capable of addressing these challenges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To succeed in the global net-zero agenda, Africa needs a focused strategy that aligns with the realities of this evolving landscape,&rdquo; Popoola concluded.</p>
<p>As Africa seeks to define its place in the global economy, integrated leadership and corporate responsibility will be key to driving sustainable growth and development.</p>

<p><span><span>UK startups attracted a total of $10.1 billion in venture capital (VC) funding through 673 deals announced during January-August 2024.

<title>Nordic Baltic Crisis Simulation Exercise, 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/nordic-baltic-crisis-simulation-exercise-2024/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/nordic-baltic-crisis-simulation-exercise-2024/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Exercise, Authorities, Crisis management, Communication, Collaboration
Summary: Nearly 450 authorities from Nordic-Baltic countries and EU participated in a crisis management exercise to test communication and collaboration. Lessons learned will enhance crisis preparedness in the region.<br /><br /> <div>
<div class="editor-content">
<p>Nearly 450 participants took part in the exercise, representing authorities from Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, and Sweden, as well as the relevant European Union authorities: European Commission, ECB, Single Resolution Board (SRB) and European Banking Authority (EBA). A staff member of the International Monetary Fund was also invited to participate as an observer.</p>
<p>The purpose of the exercise was to test communication, information sharing and collaboration between the authorities during crisis management in a highly uncertain and time pressured environment. The exercise was designed in line with a crisis scenario where the fictitious banks went through three phases that could be foreseen in a bank crisis management process: 1) the transition from normal business to recovery including addressing liquidity issues, 2) the movement from recovery to resolution, with resolution authorities assuming control of the bank and 3) after resolution, the return of the restructured bank to the market. During the exercise, authorities applied the tools and powers at their disposal according to the EU regulatory framework for banking supervision and crisis management.</p>
<p>Following the successful conclusion of the exercise, authorities will document and share the lessons learnt, and will integrate them into their existing crisis management routines. This will strengthen their crisis preparedness and further enhance the crisis management framework in the Nordic-Baltic region.</p>
<p><em>A preparation team established under the Nordic Baltic Stability Group (NBSG) and led by the Danish resolution entity Finansiel Stabilitet was formed in 2023 to prepare the exercise. The NBSG consists of government ministries, central banks, supervisory authorities, and resolution authorities in the eight Nordic and Baltic countries. In the context of the NBSG, the Nordic and Baltic authorities have agreed to conduct regular financial crisis simulation exercises.</em></p>

<title>ASIC Extends Reportable Situations Relief And Personal Advice Record Keeping Requirements</title>

<div> Instruments, relief, reporting, requirements, ASIC
Summary:<br /><br />ASIC extends relief and requirements for reportable situations regime in Commonwealth legislation for five years. Submissions support and raise concerns on the proposal.
ASIC extends relief and requirements for reportable situations regime in Commonwealth legislation for five years. Submissions support and raise concerns on the proposal. Two legislative instruments are made to extend requirements and relief. Six submissions are received in response to public consultation. <div>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul>
<li>ASIC currently modifies Commonwealth legislation to provide relief from reporting requirements for the reportable situations regime, and to prescribe record keeping requirements for personal advice situations.</li>
<li>We will extend this relief and requirements, on the same terms, for five years (October 2029).</li>
<li>We will continue to consider whether additional reportable situations regime relief is appropriate, having regard to submissions received as part of our consultation process.</li>
</ul>
<p>ASIC has made two legislative instruments &mdash;&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2024L01202/asmade/text">ASIC Corporations and Credit (Breach Reporting&ndash;Reportable Situations) Instrument 2024/620</a></em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2024L01201/asmade/text">ASIC Corporations Record-Keeping Requirements for Australian Financial Services Licensees when Giving Personal Advice) Instrument 2024/508</a>.</em></p>
<p>The instruments extend requirements and relief provided under&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2021L01128/latest/text"><em>ASIC Corporations and Credit (Breach Reporting&mdash;Reportable Situations) Instrument 2021/716</em></a><em>,&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2021L01364/latest/text"><em>ASIC Credit (Breach Reporting&mdash;Prescribed Commonwealth Legislation) Instrument 2021/801</em></a><em>,</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2014L01237/latest/text"><em>ASIC Class Order 14/923 Record-keeping obligations for Australian financial services licensees when giving personal advice</em></a>&nbsp;(<strong>the Former Instruments</strong>)<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>ASIC assessed that the Former Instruments, which are due to expire in October 2024, were operating efficiently and effectively, and continue to form a necessary and useful part of the legislative framework.</p>
<p>On 7 August 2024, ASIC announced our intention to extend the operation of the Former Instruments and&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/news-items/asic-proposes-to-extend-the-operation-of-three-legislative-instruments/?altTemplate=betanewsroom">sought feedback</a>&nbsp;on the proposal prior to 4 September 2024.</p>
<p>We received six submissions in response to our public consultation. The submissions generally supported our proposal to extend the operation of the relief and requirements. Accordingly, we proceeded to remake the relief and requirements, consolidating the relief in ASIC Instruments 2021/716 and 2021/801 into one instrument as proposed.</p>
<p>There were two main areas where submissions raised concerns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Four submissions advocated wider relief from the reportable situations regime that ASIC will consider. If ASIC determines that wider relief is appropriate it will seek feedback on our proposal for wider relief.</li>
<li>Two submissions advocated for migration of the relief and/or requirements to the primary law. ASIC has drawn this feedback to the attention of the Commonwealth Treasury.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ASIC is Australia&rsquo;s corporate, markets and financial services regulator.</strong></p>

<div> prohibition order, Monetary Authority of Singapore, fraud, Nech Capital Pte Ltd, trader <br />
Mr Pan Qi received a 5-year prohibition order from MAS due to his fraudulent trading activities at Nech Capital, resulting in a conviction under the SFA.<br />Under the prohibition order, Mr Pan is restricted from engaging in regulated activities and managing capital markets services firms due to his fraudulent trading activities at Nech Capital. <br />Summary: <div>
<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has issued a 5- year prohibition order (PO) against Mr Pan Qi, a former representative of fund management company Nech Capital Pte Ltd (NCPL). The PO was issued following Mr Pan&rsquo;s conviction in the State Courts for engaging in a course of business that operated as fraud under the Securities and Futures Act.</p>
<p>2.<span> </span>Under the PO, which took effect from 24 September 2024, Mr Pan is prohibited from performing any regulated activity and from taking part in the management, acting as a director, or becoming a substantial shareholder, of any capital markets services firm under the Securities and Futures Act (SFA).</p>
<p>3.<span> </span>Between 4 January 2019 and 24 July 2020, Mr Pan worked as a trader at NCPL where his responsibility was to trade using NCPL trading accounts to make a profit for a fund managed by NCPL. He executed trades in several securities counters between NCPL trading accounts and accounts belonging to his relatives. Mr Pan&rsquo;s trades were conducted in a manner that profited him (controlling his relatives&rsquo; accounts) at the expense of NCPL<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/regulation/enforcement/enforcement-actions/2024/mas-issues-prohibition-order-against-mr-pan-qi-for-dishonest-conduct#1">[1]</a></span>.</p>
<p>4.<span> </span>On 25 April 2023, Mr Pan was convicted of one count of section 201(b) of the SFA, with two other counts of section 201(b) of the SFA taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. He was sentenced to five weeks&rsquo; imprisonment and a fine of $120,000.</p>
<p>5.<span> </span>Mr Pan&rsquo;s conviction and contraventions have given MAS reason to believe that he will not perform capital markets services honestly. While Mr Pan is no longer an appointed representative in Singapore, the PO was issued against him to safeguard the integrity of and trust in Singapore&rsquo;s financial sector.</p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority: KiwiSaver Passes Milestone Of $100 Billion Of Funds Under Management</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-kiwisaver-passes-milestone-of-100-bil/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> KiwiSaver, investments, growth, fees, retirement
Summary:<br />KiwiSaver reaches $100 billion milestone, 19.3% increase in funds. Fees increase in line with funds. Growth funds becoming more popular. Promotion of fair KiwiSaver market. <div>
<p>The FMA&rsquo;s latest KiwiSaver Annual Report for the year to 31 March 2024 shows that KiwiSaver investments are working well for New Zealanders, passing the significant milestone of its first $100 billion of funds under management. Ending the financial year on&nbsp;$111.8 billion, there was a 19.3% increase from last years $93.6 billion funds under management.</p>
<p>John Horner, FMA Director Markets, Investors and Reporting, said, &ldquo;Breaking through the $100 billion mark is something to celebrate; for a relatively small country like New Zealand, it represents a coming of age of KiwiSaver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s growth was due to a combination of strong investment returns of $13.1 billion, and the inflow of $11.2 billion into KiwiSaver through contributions of members, their employers and the Crown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For many New Zealanders, KiwiSaver may be their first or only investment and a large part of their retirement savings and ultimate financial security. KiwiSaver is designed with the purpose of improving individuals&rsquo; well-being and financial independence, particularly in retirement, and it was pleasing to see individual contributions through salaries and wages were up to an all-time peak of $5.9 billion this year.</p>
<p>Total fees, charged by KiwiSaver providers have increased, 18.9% - from $664.1 million in 2023 to $789.6 million in 2024. This is in line with the increase in total funds under management and shows that fees have not increased per dollar invested, but they have not decreased either.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While we have seen a gradual decrease in fees as a percentage of funds under management over the last 10 years, this wasn&rsquo;t continued in the 2024 data. As KiwiSaver grows, I expect to see the benefits that come with economies of scale shared with KiwiSaver members.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over the last four years the overall investment profile of KiwiSaver has skewed toward growth, driven by more investors making active choices that are in line with their long-term retirement goals.</p>
<p>There are now 3.3 million people invested in KiwiSaver, representing approximately 62% of the total population. Of those, almost three million have selected their own provider and fund. The rest are default allocated scheme members, who have been automatically enrolled into one of the six default funds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Growth funds now represent 46% of total funds under management, with $51.4 billion invested, and a total of 1.53 million investors selecting a growth fund,&rdquo; says Mr. Horner. &ldquo;This has grown rapidly over recent years, more than doubling from $24.5 billion in 2021.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Contrasting this year&rsquo;s report to previous years, we can see how investor behaviour has changed over time, together with the profile of the funds being selected. The FMA has said for some time that younger investors, saving for retirement, should consider funds with more growth assets, as these are more suited to a longer investment horizon. With KiwiSaver in its 17th&nbsp;year, investors have become more comfortable with the long-term nature of KiwiSaver. We believe this is why almost half of all KiwiSavers have moved towards more growth-oriented funds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are proud to report on KiwiSaver data annually. Promoting a fair, efficient and transparent KiwiSaver market is a priority for the FMA. This starts with us ensuring that all providers are focused on the best interests of their members,&rdquo; concludes Horner.</p>

<title>CFTC Announces Four Orders Granting Whistleblower Awards – Marking the Most In A Single Day</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-announces-four-orders-granting-whistleblower-awards-marking-the-most-in-a/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced awards totaling approximately $4.5 million for whistleblowers who, collectively, provided information that led to the success of multiple enforcement actions</span></span></span><span><span><span>, brought by the CFTC and another authority<span>. The four&nbsp;</span>orders granting awards, to a total of seven whistleblowers,&nbsp;<span>are the most the CFTC has issued on a single day.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The orders recognize the award recipients for their distinctive contributions:</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Four whistleblowers who, as victims of fraud, significantly contributed to the resolution of both a CFTC action and a related criminal action, providing insight into the broad scope of the misconduct and enabling the identification of additional victims.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>A separate whistleblower victim whose tip alerted the CFTC to a new fraud by a repeat offender, and whose ongoing assistance helped uncover additional evidence of misconduct</span></span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;that&nbsp;<span>led to additional charges.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>A market participant whistleblower</span></span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;whose<span>&nbsp;information led the CFTC to&nbsp;</span>look into&nbsp;<span>different conduct as part of an existing investigation, and which led directly to important evidence supporting the CFTC&rsquo;s charges.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>A whistleblower who, as an employee with compliance/internal audit responsibilities, reported violations internally, then waited at least 120 days to contact the CFTC after no meaningful remedial action was taken. The award for this whistleblower is the&nbsp;second involving the CFTC&rsquo;s 120-day safe harbor provision for such employees, following the first such award earlier this year [See CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;</span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8878-24"><span><span>8878-24</span></span></a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span><span><span>]</span></span></span></span><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span><span><span><span><a name="_Hlk138248337"><span><span><span>&ldquo;Whistleblowers provide information from a variety of vantage points that helps preserve market integrity and fairness,&rdquo; said&nbsp;</span></span></span></a><span><span><span>Director of Enforcement&nbsp;<span>Ian McGinley. &ldquo;The multiple awards the CFTC is granting today serve as a warning to would-be wrongdoers across the markets we oversee that anyone may blow the whistle on their misconduct.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a name="_Hlk138248526"><span><span><span><span>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s awards illustrate the CFTC&rsquo;s Whistleblower Program is open to nearly anyone who voluntarily provides original information about a violation, including victims, witnesses, insiders, market participants, and employees,&rdquo; said Whistleblower Office Director Brian Young. &ldquo;Our Whistleblower Program remains committed to rewarding meritorious whistleblowers expeditiously for their information and assistance.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>With today&rsquo;s four orders, the CFTC has issued&nbsp;</span></span></span></span><span><span><span>12<span>&nbsp;orders granting whistleblower awards this fiscal year, the most on record.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Whistleblower Office staff responsible for these awards are Counsel to the Director William Durbin, Senior Attorney Advisor Laurence Tai, and Attorney Advisor Rachel Anderson Rynders.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>About the CFTC&rsquo;s Whistleblower Program</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The Whistleblower Program was created under Section 748 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. Since issuing its first award in 2014, the CFTC has granted whistleblower awards amounting to approximately $380 million.&nbsp;<a name="_Hlk141096127"></a>Those awards are associated with enforcement actions that have resulted in monetary sanctions totaling nearly $3.2 billion. The CFTC issues awards related not only to the agency&rsquo;s enforcement actions, but also in connection with related actions brought by other domestic or foreign regulators, if certain conditions are met.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) provides confidentiality protections for whistleblowers. Regardless of whether the CFTC grants an award, the CFTC will not disclose any information that could reasonably be expected to reveal a whistleblower&rsquo;s identity, except in limited circumstances. Consistent with this confidentiality protection, the CFTC will not disclose the name of the enforcement action in which the whistleblower provided information or the exact dollar amount of the award granted.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Whistleblowers may be eligible to receive between 10 and 30 percent of the monetary sanctions collected. All whistleblower awards are paid from the CFTC&rsquo;s Customer Protection Fund, which was established by Congress, and is financed entirely through monetary sanctions paid to the CFTC by violators of the CEA. No money is taken or withheld from injured customers to fund the program.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>* * * * *</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Anyone with information related to potential violations of the CEA or the CFTC&rsquo;s rules and regulations can submit a tip electronically by filing a&nbsp;</span></span></span></span><span><a href="https://whistleblower.gov/overview/submitatip"><span><span>Form TCR</span></span></a></span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;(Tip, Complaint or Referral) online</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against Texas-based registered investment adviser Atom Investors LP for its failure to maintain and preserve off-channel communications in violation of the recordkeeping provisions of the federal securities laws. The Commission did not impose a penalty because Atom Investors self-reported the conduct, promptly remediated the violations, and provided substantial cooperation to Commission staff in an investigation of another entity.</p>
<p>According to the order, in 2021, the Commission staff issued a subpoena to Atom Investors for documents in connection with an investigation into a third party. In responding to the subpoena, Atom Investors discovered that, over a more than three-year period, it had failed to preserve records subject to the recordkeeping requirements of the federal securities laws, including records that were responsive to the Commission staff&rsquo;s subpoena. This included communications by personnel at senior levels of the firm. Some of these records related to recommendations and advice to purchase or sell securities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This enforcement matter highlights the risk to investors when firms don&rsquo;t comply with their recordkeeping obligations: because of Atom Investors&rsquo;s longstanding failures to preserve required communications, including communications by Atom Investors&rsquo;s senior personnel, we were hampered in our investigation into a third party,&rdquo; said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;At the same time, this resolution shows that the full benefits of cooperation are available in recordkeeping matters. Atom Investors&rsquo;s self-reporting and prompt remedial efforts weighed heavily in the Enforcement Division&rsquo;s decision to recommend that the Commission not impose a penalty, which the Commission accepted. This resolution should serve as a model for other investment advisors that are not currently in compliance with federal recordkeeping requirements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that Atom Investors violated the recordkeeping provisions of the federal securities laws. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, Atom agreed to cease and desist from further violations of the securities laws and to a censure.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Wendy E. Pearson and Sarah S. Nilson, assisted by Stephen Kam, and supervised by Finola H. Manvelian, all of the Los Angeles Regional Office.</p>

<div> order, NTC, CFTC, supervision, fraud
Summary: 
The CFTC fined NTC $750,000 for inadequate supervision of account handling in response to a statutory restraining order, resulting in losses of over $200,000. 
<br /><br /> <div>
<p><span><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an order filing and settling charges against&nbsp;<span>NinjaTrader Clearing, LLC dba NinjaTrader, Tradovate and TransAct Futures (NTC)</span>, a registered Futures Commission Merchant that operates out of Deer Park, Illinois.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN">The CFTC order finds NTC failed to have adequate policies and procedures governing the emergency handling of accounts and did not exercise sufficient oversight over its employees&rsquo; handling of accounts in response to a statutory restraining order issued in&nbsp;</span><i><span>CFTC v. Patel</span></i><span>, Case No. 22-cv-80092 (S.D. Fla. 2022)</span><span lang="EN">.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The CFTC order requires NTC to pay a $750,000 civil monetary penalty, cease and desist from further violations of CFTC regulations, and pay restitution in the amount of $233,425 to the court-appointed receiver for distribution to the victims of the fraud prosecuted in that action.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN">Case Background</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN">The CFTC order finds that from at least&nbsp;</span><span>Dec. 31, 2020, to the present, NTC failed to diligently supervise its employees&rsquo; handling of accounts that needed to be frozen, disabled, or otherwise restricted on an emergency basis.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Specifically, in January 2022, NTC failed to diligently supervise its employees&rsquo; handling of accounts NTC held or managed under the name Rajiv Patel. NTC did not have adequate policies and procedures and did not adequately oversee its employees to ensure NTC implemented the SRO entered by the court in connection with the fraud perpetrated by Patel and his company, Bluprint LLC.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>As a result of these deficiencies, NTC failed to take diligent steps to understand and implement the SRO. These failures resulted in positions in the Patel accounts remaining open for several days after the SRO was served, during which time they&nbsp;<span>lost</span>&nbsp;more than $200,000&nbsp;<span>in value.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this matter are Elsie Robinson, Monique McElwee, Jeff Le Riche, Christopher Reed, and Charles Marvine.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<div> settlement order, CFTC, investigation, violation, recordkeeping<br />
Summary:<br />
Commissioner Pham disputes the lack of evidence for CFTC violation and the agency's double-dipping on SEC violations. <div>
<p>Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Commissioner Caroline D. Pham today released the following statement on the CFTC&rsquo;s settlement order regarding Piper Sandler Hedging Services LLC:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once again, the CFTC has no evidence that a violation of CFTC recordkeeping rules for introducing brokers (IBs) actually occurred.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement092324?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;And, this case also piggybacks off the SEC&rsquo;s investigation and swerves out of the CFTC&rsquo;s lane into the securities markets. Records relating to securities or other business activities of a parent company or affiliate under other agencies&rsquo; rules are out-of-scope for the CFTC&rsquo;s jurisdiction and rules for IBs. That is why other agencies have their own enforcement authority over their own statutes and their own registrants. I must respectfully dissent because of the lack of evidence that a CFTC violation occurred and because I cannot support the CFTC&rsquo;s double-dipping on SEC violations.&rdquo;</p>

<div> Enforcement, Commission, Regulation, Recordkeeping, Settlement
Summary:
Commissioner dissents from enforcement action, calls for clearer recordkeeping guidance to ensure compliance and reduce industry consolidation. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p><span><span><span><span>I respectfully dissent from the Commission&rsquo;s</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement092324?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;enforcement action settling charges against Piper Sandler Hedging Services, LLC (&ldquo;Piper Sandler&rdquo; or &ldquo;Respondent&rdquo;).</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Despite the Commodity Futures Trading Commission imposing more than $1.1 billion in offline communication-related civil monetary penalties across more than 20 recent actions</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement092324?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a><span><span><span><span>, I fear this particular case sends the message that&nbsp;<i>everything</i>&nbsp;is a business record, even if such a conclusion has no foundation in the Commodity Exchange Act (&ldquo;CEA&rdquo;) or CFTC regulations.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Enforcement is one of many tools available in our regulatory toolbox to promote a culture of compliance with our regulated entities.&nbsp; Our policy divisions can conduct targeted examinations, issue guidance, and work with our self-regulatory organizations on their compliance efforts. &nbsp;Our enforcement authorities should not be our default tool and should only be wielded after ensuring our expectations for compliance with our regulations are clearly communicated to impacted entities.&nbsp; Only after the Commission fulfills that fundamental responsibility should we use our enforcement function to pursue those who either have no interest in complying or who have failed in their attempts to comply.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>As I have said before, regulation through enforcement is the antithesis of regulatory clarity and transparency.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement092324?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; Unfortunately, without providing additional clarity into how our Division of Enforcement is approaching recordkeeping requirements, including those in Regulation 1.35 which are implicated in today&rsquo;s settlement, regulated entities and their associated persons are left to determine what constitutes a violation under the looming threat of a visit from our enforcement attorneys</span></span><span>.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Transaction-Related Records Should Be Preserved</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>I do not dispute that business related records identified under the CEA and CFTC regulations must be preserved to facilitate an effective regulatory and enforcement program, and I have approved other offline communication cases when the surrounding circumstances warrant such support.&nbsp; However, the mere existence of business-related communications occurring through unofficial channels is not necessarily a violation.&nbsp; The threshold inquiry is whether an entity failed to preserve a record they were&nbsp;<i>required</i>&nbsp;to preserve.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Conclusory statements in settlement orders that business related communications occurred via unofficial channels offer no explanation on how a particular respondent violated the CEA or CFTC regulations.&nbsp; More importantly, these statements fail to offer any guidance to other similarly situated entities on compliance with these requirements to avoid becoming the next respondent in a CFTC enforcement matter.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Recordkeeping Requirements Are Not One Size Fits All</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The CEA and CFTC regulations do not require&nbsp;<i>every</i>&nbsp;record of&nbsp;<i>every</i>&nbsp;business activity to be preserved.&nbsp; Instead, Congress developed a recordkeeping framework which varies based on the category of the entity.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement092324?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this umbrella, the Commission and its staff have developed recordkeeping requirements tailored to respective market participants.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>For example, Section 4g(a) of the CEA requires introducing brokers (IBs), to &ldquo;keep books and records pertaining to&nbsp;<span><i>such transactions and positions&nbsp;</i></span>&hellip;<span><i>&nbsp;as may be required by the Commission.</i></span>&rdquo;</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement092324?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span><span><span><span>Compare that to Section 4n of the CEA, which requires registered commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisors to &ldquo;maintain books and records and file such reports in such form and manner as may be prescribed by the Commission.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is significant that Section 4g of the CEA, the section at issue in today&rsquo;s enforcement action, is limited to records pertaining to transactions and positions, whereas Section 4n of the CEA lacks such limitation.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement092324?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span><i>Regulation 1.35 - Tailored Transactional Records</i></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The Commission has consistently respected these statutory distinctions when adopting numerous modifications to Regulation 1.35, its principal recordkeeping rule for intermediaries, including IBs.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Regulation 1.35 imposes categorical recordkeeping requirements on futures commission merchants, retail foreign exchange dealers, IBs and designated contract market and swap execution facility members.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement092324?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; In fact, the basic provisions of Regulation 1.35 have remained in place since as early as 1938.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement092324?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;<span><span><span><span>&nbsp;Importantly, Regulation 1.35 requires preservation of records&nbsp;<i>related to transactions</i>&nbsp;and has never, or at least for the past 86 years, contained a general mandate to preserve&nbsp;<i>all</i>&nbsp;records.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement092324?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Regardless of intermediary, Regulation 1.35 identifies two major types of records required to be maintained: (1) transaction records (consisting of both &ldquo;commodity interest and related records" and &ldquo;original source documents&rdquo;); and, (2) pre-trade communications (both &ldquo;oral&rdquo; and &ldquo;written&rdquo;).</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement092324?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; All of the key record types defined in Regulation 1.35 are framed around the statutory construction discussed above and therefore, must be related to&nbsp;<span>transactions</span>&mdash;in a commodity interest and any related cash or forward transactions.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement092324?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; Furthermore, Regulation 1.35(a) requires the records, except for pre-trade communications, to be &ldquo;kept in a form and manner that allows for the identification of a&nbsp;<i>particular transaction</i>.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement092324?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Commission first added the &ldquo;particular transaction&rdquo; provision to the regulation, it stated the purpose of the rule would be satisfied &ldquo;when a market participant can identify those records that pertain to a particular transaction,&rdquo;</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement092324?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;versus requiring that all records on all transactions be maintained in a specific manner.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The rule has been expanded several times as both new registrants have been added to the Commission&rsquo;s jurisdiction and as technological changes have necessitated revised requirements.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement092324?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; In each case, the Commission has carefully balanced the application of these requirements, not only on different market participants and intermediaries, but also by size and type within certain categories.&nbsp; These revisions were done to acknowledge that for certain intermediaries, particularly IBs, the burden and costs associated with complying with Commission&rsquo;s recordkeeping requirements may be significant without substantial benefit.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement092324?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Most importantly in this regard, small IBs &ndash; those earning less than $5 million in aggregate gross revenue over a three-year period - have been specifically carved out of certain recordkeeping requirements in Regulation 1.35.&nbsp; Again, this was done citing the Commission&rsquo;s concerns &ldquo;regarding costs and the availability of relevant technology,&rdquo; and further noting such a balancing would, &ldquo;achieve the Commission&rsquo;s objectives and the benefits of promoting market integrity and protecting customers albeit at lower cost.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement092324?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Like many rules in Part 1 of the CFTC&rsquo;s regulations, Regulation 1.35&rsquo;s requirements vary by entity size and type, reflect the Commission&rsquo;s long history of carefully weighing the cost and benefits of recordkeeping requirements, and strategically balance these policy considerations.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Any action by the Commission should respect these important considerations made when adopting our rules around recordkeeping requirements.&nbsp; Recognizing that our rules must evolve as technology and businesses evolve, the Commission&rsquo;s approach to this evolution should be clear and should only occur in a public and transparent manner.&nbsp; Using enforcement to influence that change is the opposite of clarity and transparency.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The Pitfalls of Interpreting Settlements</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Despite statutory and regulatory intricacies, of the more than 20 recent settlements related to violations of both Section 4g of the CEA and Regulation 1.35, most of these settlement orders</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement092324?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;include essentially the same boilerplate language in the legal discussion section of the order. &nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The sole application of law to facts in the legal discussion section of these orders is or closely mirrors the following, &ldquo;[a]s a result of the widespread use of unapproved methods of communication by [firm or their] employees, which communications were not preserved and maintained, [respondent[s]] failed to keep full, complete, and systematic records of all transactions relating to its business of dealing in commodity interests, in violation of Section 4g of the Act and Regulation 1.35.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement092324?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Unfortunately, neither the fact nor the summary sections of these orders facilitate a greater understanding of the regulation, the alleged violation, or how the regulation has been applied in the settlement. &nbsp;Furthermore, these orders refer to &ldquo;business-related communications&rdquo;, &ldquo;messages related to [ the respondent&rsquo;s] business as a Commission registrant&rdquo;, &ldquo;unapproved communication methods &hellip; to engage in firm business&rdquo;, and &ldquo;conducted firm business via unapproved methods.&rdquo; &nbsp;These generic references, such as &ldquo;business&rdquo; and &ldquo;firm&rdquo;, fail to describe the substance of the communications at issue or to explain the kind of record that serves as the basis for the alleged violation.&nbsp; Without more information and context, others subject to the same regulations have limited ability to understand potential compliance risks and costs when deciding whether to remain in or to exit a line of business subject to CFTC regulation.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>No doubt, the inability to accurately gauge compliance risks and the costs of records management systems could lead to further consolidation in the industry, a trend we are already witnessing.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>A Clearer Path Forward</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Without additional context or further clarification by the Commission, entities subject to Section 4g of the CEA and Regulation 1.35 are left with little insight into how the Division of Enforcement construes violations when settling these matters.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Unfortunately, I cannot support further settlements with IBs concerning offline communications violations until such time as the Commission as a whole, not just the Division of Enforcement, uses the actual words of the statute and the implementing regulation to clarify how an IB can properly comply with recordkeeping requirements.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</span></span></span></span></p>

<title>CFTC Orders Piper Sandler To Pay $2 Million For Recordkeeping And Supervision Failures For Firm-Wide Use Of Unapproved Communication Methods</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item">
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an order simultaneously filing and settling charges against&nbsp;Piper Sandler Hedging Services LLC, an introducing broker, for failing to maintain and preserve records that were required to be kept under CFTC recordkeeping requirements, and failing to diligently supervise matters related to its business as a CFTC registrant.</p>
<p>The order requires Piper Sander to pay a $2 million civil monetary penalty; to cease and desist from further violations of recordkeeping and supervision requirements; and to engage in specified remedial undertakings. Piper Sandler admits the facts detailed in the order.</p>
<p>Cases Background</p>
<p>The order finds that from at least 2019 to the present, Piper Sandler employees, including those at senior levels, communicated using unapproved communication methods, including messages sent via personal text. The firm was required to keep certain of these written communications because they related to the firm&rsquo;s business as a CFTC registrant. These written communications generally&nbsp;were not maintained and preserved by Piper Sandler, and the firm generally would not have been able to provide them promptly to the CFTC if and when requested.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The order further finds the use of unapproved communication methods violated Piper Sandler&rsquo;s internal policies and procedures, which broadly prohibited business-related communication taking place via unapproved methods. Further, some of the same supervisory personnel responsible for ensuring compliance with the firm&rsquo;s policies and procedures themselves used non-approved methods of communication to engage in business-related communications, in violation of firm policy.</p>
<p>Since December 2021, the CFTC has imposed $1.207 billion in civil monetary penalties on 26 financial institutions for their use of unapproved methods of communication, in violation of CFTC recordkeeping and supervision requirements. [See CFTC Press Release Nos.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8470-21">8470-21</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8599-22">8599-22</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8699-23">8699-23</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8701-23">8701-23</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8762-23">8762-23</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8763-23">8763-23</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8794-23">8794-23</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8880-24">8880-24</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8943-24">8943-24</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8945-24">8945-24</a>]</p>
<p>Related Civil Actions</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission recently announced entry of an order filing and settling charges against a Piper Sandler affiliate and imposing a civil monetary penalty for recordkeeping and supervision violations related to the use of unapproved methods of communication.</p>

<p>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for these actions are Devin Cain; Alejandra de Urioste; R. Stephen Painter, Jr.; Lenel Hickson, Jr.; and Manal M. Sultan.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On September 23, ISDA, the Alternative Investment Management Association (AIMA),&nbsp;the European Banking Federation (EBF), the European Fund and Asset Management Association (EFAMA) and FIA sent a letter urging the European Commission and European supervisory authorities to clarify that market participants are not required to implement the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR 3.0) Level 1 provisions prior to the date of application of the associated Level 2 regulatory technical standards (RTS).</p>
<p>In the letter, the associations state this is to avoid firms being required to implement the requirements of EMIR 3.0 twice&mdash;first, to comply with the Level 1 provisions once EMIR 3.0 enters into force and then when the associated Level 2 RTS becomes applicable.</p>

<div> Dubai, Santander Private Banking, DIFC, wealth management, Middle East<br />
Summary:<br />
Santander Private Banking opens office in DIFC to serve HNWIs in rapidly growing Dubai and MEASA region with world-class infrastructure and regulatory environment. <div>
<p>Santander Private Banking, has established a new office in Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), the leading global financial hub in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia (MEASA) region, reinforcing Dubai&rsquo;s strategic position as a premier hub for private banking operations.</p>
<p>Authorised by Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA), the independent regulator of financial services conducted in or from DIFC, Santander Private Banking, opened its first headquarters for regional private banking in DIFC.</p>
<p>Santander Group&rsquo;s capabilities and international private banking platform, combined with DIFC&rsquo;s world-class infrastructure, access to top talent, and legal and regulatory framework will allow Santander Private Banking to house a significant team of elite private bankers in DIFC. This team will serve current clients and extend the bank&rsquo;s range of bespoke wealth management services to the rapidly growing high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth communities across Dubai and the region.</p>
<p>To formally welcome the bank to DIFC, Arif Amiri, Chief Executive Officer, DIFC Authority, recently met with Alfonso Castillo, Global Head of Santander Private Banking. Other executives that attended the meeting included Antonio Costa, Chief Executive Officer of Banco Santander International SA, Switzerland; Masroor Batin, Chief Executive Officer Middle East of Banco Santander International SA DIFC Branch, UAE; and Ahmed Al Aulaqi, Vice President, Banks &amp; Capital Markets, DIFC Authority.</p>
<p><span>Alfonso Castillo, Global Head of Santander Private Banking</span>, said: &ldquo;Entering the Middle East aligns with our relentless dedication to providing exceptional financial services, cultivating long-term partnerships, and delivering unparalleled value to our clients. We are delighted to have established our Branch in DIFC, and we look forward to forging trusting partnerships, fostering growth, and achieving remarkable milestones together.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Salmaan Jaffery, Chief Business Development Officer, DIFC Authority</span>, said: &ldquo;DIFC is delighted to welcome Banco Santander International SA to the Centre. Their status as the number one private bank in Spain and credentials for being relationship focussed, coupled with DIFC&rsquo;s position as the Middle East, Africa and South Asia&rsquo;s leading financial centre provides a perfect foundation for accessing opportunities from the USD 8trn of private wealth in the region.

<div> Blockchain, DTCC, UST Collateral Network Pilot, tokenized assets, DLT applications<br />
Summary:<br />
- Successful pilot of UST Collateral Network using tokenized assets<br />
- Enhanced collateral mobility, liquidity, and transactional efficiency<br />
- Real-world complex transactions proven feasible<br />
- Collaboration demonstrates blockchain's potential in financial transactions<br />
- Infrastructure, applications, and connectivity provided by Digital Asset and DTCC <br /> <div>
<p>Digital Asset, a leading provider of blockchain solutions, in collaboration with The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC), today announced the results of the U.S. Treasury (UST) Collateral Network Pilot, an initiative focused on leveraging DLT applications to support market connectivity across the collateral management lifecycle to enhance mobility, liquidity and transactional efficiency of tokenized assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the pilot, Digital Asset, four investors, four banks, two central counterparties, three custodians/collateral agents, and a central securities depository operated fourteen Canton nodes, connecting four types of cross-application transactions through ten distributed applications, leveraging DTCC&rsquo;s LedgerScan solution to support dynamic tracking and governance of the assets involved in the pilot transactions. Participants successfully executed 100 transactions, demonstrating tokenized collateral assets' robust functionality and potential. This pilot builds on the successful Canton Network Pilot completed in December 2023, which established the foundation for composable applications across a global economic network.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The successful completion of this pilot proves that tokenized assets could be leveraged to optimize collateral,&rdquo;&nbsp;<b>said Kelly Mathieson, Chief Business Development Officer at Digital Asset</b>. &ldquo;In addition to the liquidity and operational efficiencies gained, the pilot demonstrates how tokenized collateral can improve market transparency, legal certainty of ownership in seizure/close out scenarios, and significant real-world benefits, including faster collateralization and enhanced regulatory oversight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This pilot successfully demonstrated the power of tokenization &ndash; and its potential to enhance collateral mobility and unlock liquidity,"&nbsp;<b>said Nadine Chakar, Global Head of DTCC Digital Assets</b>. "The collaborative effort behind this innovative pilot reinforces DTCC&rsquo;s commitment to partnering with the industry to harness DLT&rsquo;s capabilities to advance a scalable and resilient infrastructure that ultimately drives increased value for our clients and the industry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The UST Collateral Network Pilot, conducted in June and July, proved the feasibility of more complex real-world transactions, including the creation of a digital twin of USTs, utilizing the tokenized UST assets in real-time to satisfy margin calls, completing asset recalls, and evidencing secured party control over the assets in closeout scenarios.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Creation of Digital Twin for USTs</span>: Investors directed custodians/collateral agents to create digital twins of USTs in their portfolios, updating holdings instantly and setting aside equivalent real-world assets.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Margin Call Delivery</span>: Secured parties made margin calls, and USTs were used as collateral, with real-time transaction status updates and instant settlement, ensuring legally enforceable collateral.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Margin Call Return</span>: Investors called for the return of margin, with collateral released and transactions settled instantly, significantly improving liquidity and collateral optimization.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Closeout Due to Default</span>: In hypothetical default scenarios, secured parties seized pledged assets, transferring ownership in atomic transactions, ensuring legal certainty and control.</li>
</ul>
<p>"Most blockchain pilots focus on initiating or completing transactions, but in this pilot, that lifecycle was extended to include default. This is crucial because collateral isn't just about mitigating risk&mdash;it ensures that in the event of a default, secured parties can take legal possession of the collateral. This demonstrates blockchain&rsquo;s potential to support the full lifecycle of financial transactions, beyond just execution,&rdquo;&nbsp;<b>said Jenny Cieplak, a partner at global law firm Latham &amp; Watkins.</b></p>
<p>&ldquo;Article 12 and the revisions to Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code start to establish a framework for using distributed ledgers to represent securities interests in the indirect holding system, which is where the vast majority of securities transactions take place today. Blockchain represents the next step in the evolution of securities books and records maintained by broker-dealers, much the way record-keeping previously evolved to cloud-based platforms,"&nbsp;<b>said Cieplak.</b></p>
<p>Digital Asset and DTCC provided the necessary infrastructure, applications, and connectivity for market participants to test complex business scenarios. The pilot leveraged existing registry and margin applications from the Canton Network, with the network&rsquo;s Global Synchronizer ensuring synchronization and enabling atomic transactions across applications and parties.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority: Senior Independent Director Review Into Whistleblowing Concerns</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-senior-independent-director-review-into-whistleb/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-senior-independent-director-review-into-whistleb/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Allegation, Whistleblowing, Review, Policy, Confidentiality
Summary:<br /><br />Former FCA employees allege chair did not keep their whistleblowing confidential. Internal review finds chair acted reasonably, policy to be updated.<br /> <div>
<p>In August 2024, a former employee who left the FCA some years ago made an allegation publicly that, in the course of whistleblowing, their identity was not kept confidential by the chair of the FCA, Ashley Alder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the first public allegation, a second former employee of the FCA, who also left some years ago, came forward with a similar allegation as to the handling of their whistleblowing communication to the chair.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In line with the corporate governance of the FCA, the board&rsquo;s senior independent director, Richard Lloyd, carried out an internal review of the handling of the two individuals&rsquo; whistleblowing communications by the chair.&nbsp; Mr Lloyd obtained assurances that there were no other cases that should be brought within the scope of his review.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/corporate/outcome-internal-whistleblowing-communications-review-independent-director.pdf" title="outcome-internal-whistleblowing-communications-review-independent-director.pdf">review published today</a>, Mr Lloyd concludes that while the FCA&rsquo;s chair did not follow our existing policy to the letter in handling two complex cases, he had sought to ensure the concerns raised, if appropriate, were acted on. The FCA&rsquo;s chair, Ashley Alder, therefore consulted senior colleagues confident they would treat the information with the utmost care. Mr Lloyd also concludes the chair reasonably took the view that he was providing information of which those colleagues were already aware.</p>
<p>Mr Lloyd has made recommendations to further strengthen our internal whistleblowing policy. This includes making clear in the rare instances of whistleblowing requiring escalation to non-executives, communications will need to be shared with appropriate internal or external expert advisers on a confidential 'need to know' basis so they can be reviewed fully.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These changes will be made as part of a review of the internal whistleblowing policy, which was already underway. A revised policy is due to be published shortly. In the meantime, board members and senior colleagues have been reminded of our existing policy.</p>
<p><span>In response to Mr Lloyd&rsquo;s review, Ashley Alder, the FCA&rsquo;s chair, says:</span></p>
<p>'I take our responsibilities to whistleblowers very seriously.</p>
<p>'These were unusual and complex cases involving two employees who had left the FCA some years ago and who have raised a range of issues over an extended period of time, in one case through multiple public channels. I wanted to ensure that, as non-executive chair, I was in the best position to act on the concerns of both individuals.</p>
<p>'To do so, I needed to consult an extremely limited number of senior colleagues and, while I did not follow the policy to the letter, I knew that they would treat all information with utmost care, and there would be no risk of prejudice to the individuals involved.</p>
<p>'The board was already overseeing work to update our whistleblowing policy to ensure it best serves our objectives and all employees who rely on it.</p>
<p>'This review will help us update those aspects which concern information handling, including making crystal clear that, in circumstances similar to these two cases, non-executive directors must be able to access internal senior advice at the outset.</p>
<p>'I remain committed to ensuring that all FCA employees retain the utmost confidence in our whistleblowing policy.'</p>

<div> Keywords: Nasdaq Verafin, Targeted Typology Analytics, AI, financial crime, terrorist financing, drug trafficking<br />
Summary: Nasdaq Verafin enhances AI-based Targeted Typology Analytics to detect terrorist financing and drug trafficking, reducing false positives and optimizing AML/CFT programs.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Today, Nasdaq Verafin&reg;, leading provider of crime fighting technology, announces enhancements to its robust suite of artificial intelligence (AI) based Targeted Typology Analytics, with new detection capabilities for terrorist financing and drug trafficking activity. These destructive crimes are fueling trillions of dollars in illicit flows globally, with 2023 estimates topping&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$11 billion</span>&nbsp;for terrorist financing and nearly&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$800 billion</span>&nbsp;connected to drug trafficking, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nasdaq.com%2Fglobal-financial-crime-report&amp;esheet=54125243&amp;newsitemid=20240923679164&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Nasdaq+Verafin%26%238217%3Bs+Global+Financial+Crime+report&amp;index=1&amp;md5=6497c5da7df7bea0e049f7219f8e350d" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Nasdaq Verafin&rsquo;s Global Financial Crime report</a>. Leveraging more than 20 years of deep domain expertise in anti-money laundering (AML), countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) and fraud detection technology, Nasdaq Verafin continues to deliver innovative new approaches to help banks improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their AML/CFT programs and ultimately safeguard the global financial system from the multi-trillion-dollar epidemic of financial crime.</p>
<p>Different illicit activities have unique characteristics and red flags that are indicative of risk of the specific underlying crime. Nasdaq&nbsp;<span class="xn-org">Verafin</span>&nbsp;applies advanced AI techniques to risk-rate multiple pieces of evidence based on specific indicators of the financial crime typology to more effectively detect suspicious activity. This approach helps banks stay ahead of evolving threats and manage increasing regulatory expectations to align their programs to national AML/CFT priorities, including terrorist financing, drug trafficking, human trafficking, fraud and other critical money laundering risks.</p>
<p>Targeted Typology Analytics address an industry-wide pain point of high volumes of false positive alerts that result from conventional rules-based AML systems. In developing new analytical solutions, Nasdaq Verafin applies its proven approach from its highly performant analytics for Elder Financial Abuse and Human Trafficking that have proven to be more effective in identifying suspicious activity associated with specific crime typologies. Nasdaq Verafin&rsquo;s targeted analytic to identify human trafficking activity delivers exceptional performance, with as few as one in four alerts resulting in a case investigation, and one in seven alerts resulting in a bank filing a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR).</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are committed to delivering innovative solutions to help banks more efficiently and effectively fight evolving financial crime threats, while navigating an increasingly complex regulatory environment,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Stephanie Champion</span>, EVP and Head of Financial Crime Management Technology, Nasdaq Verafin. &ldquo;Our approach provides a step change towards disrupting some of the most nefarious crimes that have deep economic and societal impacts and are severely impacting the financial industry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new Targeted Typology Analytic for terrorist financing alerts financial institutions to the risk of funding for terrorist activities or organizations, by leveraging Nasdaq Verafin&rsquo;s unique consortium data to identify shell companies used to move illicit funds. Following an extensive Beta program, the release of the terrorist financing analytic is expected to be released to its customer base of more than 2,500 financial institutions later this year. To further bolster coverage of threats, Nasdaq Verafin is currently partnering with Beta customers to develop a Targeted Typology Analytic to identify potential drug traffickers and leveraging its advanced link analysis capabilities to uncover drug trafficking networks.</p>
<p>Benefits of Targeted Typology Analytics:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Delivers high quality results</span>&nbsp;<span>with fewer false positives</span>&nbsp;compared to conventional approaches and broad rules-based systems, so investigators can focus on truly suspicious activities.</li>
<li><span>Uncovers patterns of criminal activity</span>&nbsp;with exceptional analytical performance by analyzing a wide range of behavioral, transactional, and third-party data, as well as insights from Nasdaq Verafin&rsquo;s unique consortium data set of more than 2,500 banks.</li>
<li><span>Contextualizes activity with visual investigation tools</span>&nbsp;by providing investigators with the key data and context-rich insights needed to determine risk and expedite decisioning.</li>
<li><span>Contributes to higher quality SARs&nbsp;</span>by providing investigators with data and insights to enrich reporting of actionable intelligence to law enforcement.</li>
<li><span>Optimizes efficiency with integrated generative AI</span>&nbsp;<span><span class="xn-org">Entity Research</span>&nbsp;copilot</span>&nbsp;capabilities to reduce time spent on manual research tasks and expedite the alert review process.</li>
<li><span>Integrates into existing AML systems to deliver risk-scored alerts through API&nbsp;</span>or as part of Nasdaq Verafin&rsquo;s intelligent investigation solution with integrated case management capabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;As an industry, we continuously need to challenge the status quo for how we fight financial crime and money laundering schemes &ndash; conventional broad approaches are no longer adequate to keep ahead of financial crime risk. Our AML approach maximizes efficiency with compliance automation, allowing banks to redirect resources on higher-value activities and more effectively fight financial crime with Targeted Typology Analytics,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Rob Norris</span>, SVP and Head of Product Strategy, Financial Crime Management Technology, Nasdaq Verafin. &ldquo;That is the future of AML, and this new suite of detection capabilities represent the beginning of the next generation of detection capabilities on our roadmap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Nasdaq Verafin introduced new generative AI capabilities with the launch of its integrated&nbsp;<span class="xn-org">Entity Research</span>&nbsp;copilot to help banks optimize compliance workflows and improve operational efficiency. With Targeted Typology Analytics, Nasdaq Verafin further builds on its proven track record of delivering banks&rsquo; innovative solutions to more efficiently and effectively fight financial crime.</p>

<div> meeting, Ibero-American Federation of Exchanges, capital markets, Deputy Minister of Economy, technological advancements
Summary:<br />Annual meeting of Ibero-American Federation of Exchanges in Buenos Aires, with 200+ attendees. Discussions on capital markets, economy, and technological advancements. Deputy Minister of Economy's positive outlook for Argentina's future. Future FIAB Annual Meeting in Madrid in 2025. <div>
<p><span>In the presence of the Deputy Minister of Economy, Jos&eacute; Luis Daza, the annual meeting of the Ibero-American Federation of Stock Exchanges was held on 19th and 20th September at the Sofitel Recoleta Hotel.</span><br /><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The meeting was attended by more than 200 people who took advantage of the various presentations that offered a broad overview of the markets, finance and financial markets.</span></p>
<p><span>The Ibero-American Federation of Exchanges (FIAB) held its 51st General Assembly in Buenos Aires on Thursday 19 and Friday 20 September at the Sofitel Recoleta Hotel.&nbsp; Prominent national and international speakers addressed an audience of more than 200 people on all aspects of stock exchange activity in particular and capital markets in general.</span></p>
<p><span>During the opening of the event, the head of the BCBA, Adelmo Gabbi, reflected that &lsquo;in Latin American countries, the dissemination of capital markets is a difficult task&rsquo;, and added: &lsquo;The mission of the stock exchanges is to share knowledge and technologies; to seek common spaces that allow us to look to the future, to the development of our countries&rsquo;. In another vein, Gabbi observed: &lsquo;It is no coincidence that the societies with the best education have the greatest economic development. Hopefully, in the years to come, we will be able to continue educating Ibero-American countries in the field of capital markets.</span></p>
<p><span>For his part, the CEO of Bolsas y Mercados Espa&ntilde;oles (BME) and president of the FIAB, Javier Hernani, reflected: &lsquo;It has been a long and fruitful assembly. We must have done something right to get this far, with 50 years of history&rsquo;, and said: &rsquo;The FIAB is an irreplaceable instrument. The management that has been done in the region after the economic crisis, after the pandemic, is exceptional&rsquo;. In this sense, Hernani pointed out: &lsquo;Despite the financial drought in the world, we continue to attract companies to the region. And we are perfectly aligned with what the world is asking for: sustainable development'.</span></p>
<p><span>In his first speech as National Secretary for Economic Policy, Jos&eacute; Luis Daza assured that &lsquo;in the next 30 years there will be no country in the world that will be as successful as Argentina&rsquo;, and remarked: &lsquo;The government inherited an atomic bomb, with a total distortion of prices, on the verge of hyperinflation. The current economic programme will be complemented by a series of structural reforms&rsquo;. Finally, the Deputy Minister of Economy said: &lsquo;There is no politician in the world who has had the audacity that Javier Milei had when he won the elections, saying what Argentina needs to do, and doing it, that is, reducing the size of the State&rsquo;.</span></p>
<p><span>Throughout the two days of the FIAB Annual Meeting, new technologies, alternative instruments, communication, cyber resilience, thematic bonds, artificial intelligence, regulations, and other topics of interest to market players were discussed. The Federation also welcomed the members of its Executive Committee: Jorge Alegr&iacute;a, CEO of the Mexican Stock Exchange; Miguel &Aacute;ngel Zapatero, General Manager of the Lima Stock Exchange; and Andr&eacute;s Restrepo, General Manager of the Colombian Stock Exchange. In 2025, the FIAB's Annual Assembly and General Meeting will be held in Madrid.</span></p>

<div> investors, thematic investing, sustainability, asset allocation, renewable energy
Summary:
Investors remain committed to thematic investing, showing increased interest in sustainability and private markets, focusing on renewable energy, AI, and healthcare innovation.<br /><br /> <div>
<p><span>Despite challenging headwinds, investors remain committed to thematic investing</span><sup><a href="https://mailhost.mondovisione.com/WorldClient.dll?Session=QGPZ61ZAAQSMI&amp;View=BlankMessageBody#footnote-light-1" id="footnote-marker-light-1-1">[1]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;with the percentage of those currently investing or planning to invest increasing since 2020</span><span>, according to&nbsp;the third&nbsp;<strong><em>Thematics Barometer</em></strong>published by BNP Paribas Asset Management (&lsquo;BNPP AM&rsquo;) and BNP Paribas CIB (Corporate &amp; Institutional Banking), in partnership with Coalition Greenwich.</span></p>
<p><span>For its third edition, the&nbsp;</span><span>thematic investing research report&nbsp;covers almost 200 institutional investors and intermediary distributors in Europe, Asia&nbsp;and North America. The survey&nbsp;aims to provide the global investment community with robust, credible and regular information about the key trends evolving within thematic investment.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Key findings of the latest survey</span></strong><sup><a href="https://mailhost.mondovisione.com/WorldClient.dll?Session=QGPZ61ZAAQSMI&amp;View=BlankMessageBody#footnote-light-2" id="footnote-marker-light-2-1">[2]</a></sup><strong><span>&nbsp;include:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>A vast majority of respondents (89%) are familiar with thematic investing, its adoption, however, is more nuanced, as institutional investors show increased interest (+10%) with further plans to invest, whereas intermediaries note a slight decrease in current usage (-4%).&nbsp;<strong>European investors lead the way and show an increase in adoption of thematic investing from 46% to 61% since 2020</strong>.</span></li>
<li><span>Equity allocation remains the preferred asset class, but investors developing&nbsp;<strong>thematic offering in private markets has risen 11% vs 2023</strong>, buoyed by interest from institutions. Likewise, thematics investors largely prefer a global perspective when selecting a thematic strategy in traditional asset classes, whereas in private markets, they note a preference for a more regional point of view.</span></li>
<li><span>For nearly&nbsp;</span><span>two&nbsp;thirds<strong>&nbsp;</strong>of investors,&nbsp;<strong>achieving positive impact</strong>&nbsp;and contributing to sustainable outcomes is the leading objective for their thematic allocations, followed by&nbsp;<strong>improved investment returns</strong>&nbsp;(63%).&nbsp;An innovative and disruptive approach to thematic investing&nbsp;(43%) is also a growing trend driven by a strong interest in artificial intelligence.</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Renewable &amp; Clean Energy</span></strong><span>&nbsp;continues to be the leading sustainability theme in demand (56% in 2023 to 60% in 2024), pulling focus away from most other categories. Regarding innovation and disruption themes,&nbsp;<strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>&nbsp;is the favourite (74%) followed by healthcare innovation.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span>Renewable energies and mobility driving sustainability themes</span></strong></p>
<p>Achieving a positive impact and contributing to sustainable outcomes is the main overall objective in using thematic investing, with enhancing investment returns the second most important objective. Interest in&nbsp;<strong>Renewable &amp; Clean Energy</strong>&nbsp;continues to grow (+15% since 2020), while the focus on SDGs<sup><a href="https://mailhost.mondovisione.com/WorldClient.dll?Session=QGPZ61ZAAQSMI&amp;View=BlankMessageBody#footnote-light-3" id="footnote-marker-light-3-1">[3]</a></sup>&nbsp;continues to slip. APAC is the region most interested in renewable energy, while Europe focuses more on&nbsp;<strong>climate change</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Net Zero, Demographics &amp; Health and well-being</strong>&nbsp;remain stable topics of interest (20%), broadly balanced between Intermediaries and Institutions, while&nbsp;<strong>Water</strong>, remains popular, ranked higher in Europe with an increasing interest from distributors (29% in 2023 to 38% in 2024) .Adaptation and Resilience were added as new themes of interest this year given their increased inter-relation to other ESG themes including physical climate risk.</p>
<p><strong>Mobility</strong>&nbsp;is a growing interest growing globally (6% in 2023 to 11% in 2024, almost doubled), highly supported in North America. And while&nbsp;<strong>Diversity &amp; Equality</strong>&nbsp;appeal decline globally, it remains an area of internet in North America.</p>
<p><strong><span>AI and healthcare lead the Innovation &amp; Disruption themes</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Artificial intelligence</strong>&nbsp;is by far the favourite topic (74%) regarding most appealing Innovation and disruption themes for portfolios, followed by Healthcare Innovation (54%), although down slightly between 2023 and 2024.&nbsp;North America shows a strong interest in&nbsp;<strong>Biotech</strong>&nbsp;while Asia had the higher preference for&nbsp;<strong>Robotics</strong>&nbsp;amongst all respondents.</p>
<p><strong><span>Asset allocation to thematic investing: the rise of private markets</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Target growth areas for thematic investing are expected in most asset classes and regions &ndash;but in Asia for equity investing and&nbsp;<strong>Private Markets</strong>. Indeed,&nbsp;<strong>active equities</strong>&nbsp;remain the assets most invested in thematic strategies, but private markets also make up a considerable share of allocations to thematics (+11% from 2023) as nearly 60% of institutional investors plan to increase focus on this asset class while investing in thematics.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Pieter Oyens, Global Chief Marketing Officer at BNPP AM, comments:</span></strong></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;With the increasing pace of change in the economy, investors have told us in this survey that they continue to commit capital to thematic investments driven by the search for impact and investment returns. Thematic investments provide an alternative to traditional strategies and</em><em>are a compelling way for investors to align portfolios with the trends shaping the future.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong><span>Constance Chalchat,&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>Chief Sustainability Officer, BNP Paribas CIB and Global Markets,&nbsp;comments:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;</span><em><span>The results demonstrate how investors continue to be increasingly interested in sustainability thematics. The ongoing thematic focus of investors on renewables and clean energy, alongside an evolving interest in resilience, water, adaptation, AI and demographics in this years&rsquo; survey, highlights the importance investors place on these issues. The opportunities these themes present as a performance driver also provide important insights on the investment horizon ahead.</span></em><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;</span></p>
<p><span>BNPP AM and BNP Paribas CIB jointly sponsored the Thematics Barometer. It was conducted by Coalition Greenwich, who interviewed 180 institutional investors and intermediary distributors between April and June 2024. The previous survey was conducted in 2020 in Europe and Asia but excluded North America.</span></p>

<p>Eurex is a pioneer in the futurization of traditional OTC traded financial products and is now expanding its global offering for trading and clearing of Credit Index Futures. As of 23 September, Eurex is launching futures on the Bloomberg US Corporate Index and the Bloomberg US High Yield Very Liquid Index and will be the first exchange with a truly global offering of Credit Index Futures.</p>
<p class="p--heading-3"><strong>Global product suite across geographies and currencies</strong></p>
<p>Eurex has been building its global Credit Index Futures product suite since 2021. These standardized, exchange-traded contracts utilize an established derivatives structure, widely used in the equity index futures market, to allow market participants to hedge or take synthetic long exposures to global credit markets. The current product suite includes the EURO Investment Grade, EURO High Yield, USD Emerging Markets and GBP Investment Grade index futures based on Bloomberg&rsquo;s established fixed income index family.</p>
<p>​​The new Eurex contracts will cover the US Investment Grade and US High Yield corporate bond markets. Together with the Euro, British Pound, and Emerging Market Sovereign Indices, they enable Eurex market participants to hedge or gain exposure to a global set of benchmark investment strategies.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p--heading-3"><strong>Risk management efficiencies</strong></p>
<p>With these new additions to Eurex&rsquo;s Credit Index Futures product suite, investors can trade global benchmark index futures and benefit from significant margin savings through the Eurex Clearing Prisma risk management system. Eurex also plans to enhance its margin optimization processes by allowing margin offsets between Fixed Income Futures and Credit Index Futures.</p>
<p>Lee Bartholomew, Global Head of FIC ETD Product Design: &ldquo;For our Credit Index Futures product suite we have decided to go for a global approach for a one-stop shop to building out this new asset class. Combining this product suite with our other fixed income futures will add further efficiencies for market participants from a margin and capital perspective.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p--heading-3"><strong>Growing demand from asset managers</strong></p>
<p>Demand for Credit Index Futures has been growing steadily in Europe mainly fueled by end clients looking for versatile investment vehicles which are liquid, transparent, and cost efficient. Monthly traded notional in all Credit Index Futures at Eurex stood at over EUR 26.7 billion in August 2024 with a total outstanding Notional of EUR 1.8 billion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Umesh Gajria, Global Head of Index Linked Products, Bloomberg Index Services Limited: &ldquo;Demand for credit derivatives is driven by the end user and we see real money, multi strategy, asset managers and pension funds who want to allocate additional beta or hedge risks on a tactical basis. We're proud Eurex has chosen to expand their global portfolio of credit futures with our indices in order to address these investor needs."</p>
<p>Eurex listed U.S. dollar Credit Index Futures have been approved by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to be traded by U.S.-based investors.</p>

<div> Bitcoin, thematic ETFs, US Treasuries, Japanese market, interest rates
<br />
Bitcoin inverse ETP, thematic ETF growth, Chinese SOE ETF, Japanese market expansion, US Treasury ETFs for interest rate cycle opportunities.
<br /><br />Summary: 
Bitcoin inverse ETP and thematic ETFs bring new asset classes to Hong Kong market. Chinese SOE and Japanese market ETFs offer growth opportunities. US Treasury ETFs allow positioning for interest rate cycle. <div>
<p>Listings of Exchange Traded Products (ETPs), including Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and Leveraged &amp; Inverse (L&amp;I) products, have seen a remarkable surge in Hong Kong this year. As at 16 September 2024, 28 new products have debuted, exceeding the total number of ETP listings in 2023 and taking the total number of ETPs to 192.</p>
<p>The pickup in listings has broadened the choices for investors and contributed to the liquidity of the Hong Kong ETP market &ndash; in August, the newly listed products accounted for HK$62.6 million of average daily turnover. In the following paragraphs we will introduce some of the new ETPs that are bringing new asset classes to the Hong Kong market.</p>
<h4>New Products for Crypto and Tech Exposure</h4>
<p>One of the standout additions is Asia&rsquo;s first Bitcoin inverse product, which listed on HKEX in July, offering a new tool for investors to take advantage of the price movements of Bitcoin. Following the listings of Asia&rsquo;s first batch of six Spot Virtual Asset (VA) ETFs in April, together with the three future-based VA ETFs listed in December 2022 and January 2023, market capitalisation of the Hong Kong VA ETF market has increased to over HK$3.2 billion as at the end of August, indicating positive reception from investors and strong potential for future growth. There are currently 10 VA ETPs available for trading at HKEX.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hong Kong&rsquo;s thematic ETF sector continues to grow, with new ETFs focusing on AI and automation, digital payments, and Web3 coming onto the market. The thematic ETF segment, which was almost non-existent a few years ago, now has an average daily turnover exceeding HK$2.1 billion year to end-August and assets under management of HK$63.1 billion as at 31 August.</p>
<h4>Access Growth Opportunities in Asia</h4>
<p>Among the &ldquo;firsts&rdquo; in this year&rsquo;s listings is an ETF that tracks China&rsquo;s state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The ETF, which focuses on high dividend stocks of SOEs, covers various sectors such as energy, communication services, industry, utilities and healthcare. This listing underscores the significance of Hong Kong&rsquo;s role as a &ldquo;superconnector&rdquo; serving as an international financing platform to attract more capital from across the globe and invest in high-quality Hong Kong-listed SOEs.</p>
<p>The Japanese market has also garnered significant attention this year. The Hong Kong ETF market has broadened its offerings with the introduction of broad-based Japanese equity ETFs and L&amp;I products. Benchmarked on the Nikkei 225 Index and the TOPIX 100 Index. These additions provide investors with more options to capitalise on the fluctuations of the Japanese market.</p>
<h4>Position for Next Interest Rate Cycle</h4>
<p>From a macroeconomic perspective, the Fed&rsquo;s rate cut cycle has been the focal point of the market. In tandem with this, the Hong Kong ETF market has seen an uptick in US Treasury ETF listings this year, including six new products that provide exposure to US Treasuries of various maturities; the last listing of US Treasury ETF was in 2019. The new listings arrive at an opportune moment, allowing investors to adjust their exposure in line with their predictions for interest rates and the broader market. Long-term bond ETFs are especially appealing for investors looking to capitalise on the potential for price appreciation in response to the anticipated rate cuts.</p>
<p>The surge in ETF listings this year has diversified investment choices in Hong Kong with innovative products such as the Bitcoin inverse product and thematic ETFs in tech. This reflects Hong Kong&rsquo;s growing significance as a premier ETF hub in Asia, offering investors new avenues for growth and exposure to various asset classes.</p>

<p>The Comisi&oacute;n Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia (CNMC) has imposed a &euro;1 million fine on En&eacute;rgya VM Gesti&oacute;n de Energ&iacute;a, S.L.U. for manipulating the Spanish gas market.</p>
<p>This penalty comes under the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsDUAcDAlQGUkwABAVTHVYBVAMdUFhXAxoGUQoGVwJTAVNUAQcdWVVRWFsOBFYdAAFXBh0GWwRTGlcEV1MZAgFVVAYECARUVFRXRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">REMIT Regulation (EU) No&nbsp;1227/2011</a>, which prohibits market manipulation and seeks to protect the integrity and transparency of the EU&rsquo;s wholesale energy markets.</p>
<p>In its decision, CNMC found that En&eacute;rgya VM Gesti&oacute;n de Energ&iacute;a had breached Article 5 of REMIT, specifically Article 2.2.a.ii, in artificially setting the price by marking the reference &lsquo;precio &uacute;ltimo diario&rsquo; (last daily price) for the Mibgas Spanish product D+1 across 32 trading sessions from 1 September to 31 December 2022.</p>
<p>The investigation revealed that En&eacute;rgya VM Gesti&oacute;n de Energ&iacute;a placed purchase orders without the intention of executing them, with bids entered between 0 and 7 seconds before the trading session&rsquo;s closing. This behaviour minimised the risk of the En&eacute;rgya VM Gesti&oacute;n de Energ&iacute;a bids being matched by other market participants.</p>
<p>As a result of En&eacute;rgya VM Gesti&oacute;n de Energ&iacute;a&rsquo;s actions, in the 32 trading sessions reported the closing bid-ask spread was reduced, impacting the calculation method of the last daily price that resulted artificially inflated.</p>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/nasdaq-helsinki-welcomes-sanomas-social-bond-as-the-first-corporate-social-bond/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Nasdaq (Nasdaq: NDAQ) today announced that Sanoma Corporation (ticker: SANOMA) has listed its inaugural social bond on the Nasdaq Sustainable Debt Market at Nasdaq Helsinki. The bond notional is EUR 150 million with a maturity of three years. Sanoma Corporation is the first corporate issue to list a social bond on the Nasdaq Sustainable Debt Market at Nasdaq Helsinki.</p>
<p>The funds Sanoma raises through the issuance of the social bond will be used according to Sanoma&rsquo;s Social Bond Framework to finance or refinance expenditures aimed at improving access to essential education services. The Framework covers the development and maintenance of inclusive learning solutions, such as printed and digital learning materials, digital learning and teaching platforms, and acquisitions of learning content businesses related to the target population of all K12 (i.e. primary, secondary and vocational education) students in Sanoma&rsquo;s operating countries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Education is a fundamental human right and key to achieving sustainable development. Sanoma&rsquo;s businesses have a positive impact on the lives of millions of people every day and our learning products and services enable and support teachers and schools to develop the talents of about 25 million students to reach their potential. With the issuance of our first social bond, we are offering investors the opportunity to support equal access to education and to contribute to the UN SDGs, especially Goal 4 Quality Education. We are very pleased with the issuance and listing of our bond to Nasdaq Helsinki,&rdquo; says Alex Green, CFO of Sanoma Corporation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With over 600 instruments from 144 issuers listed on Nasdaq Sustainable Debt Market today, we have witnessed remarkable growth and impact. The Nordic region continues to demonstrate leadership in sustainable finance, with sustainable bonds now accounting for 36% of all new corporate bond listings on our Nordic exchanges, a significant increase from 30% in the same period in 2023. While green bonds have become a key component of the Nordic Corporate Bond Market, socially themed bonds have mainly been issued by governmental agencies. We welcome Sanoma&rsquo;s groundbreaking transaction and hope to see more social corporate bonds made available to Nordic investors in the future,&rdquo; said Axel Anderstedt-Holm, Head of European Debt Listings and Sustainable Bonds at Nasdaq.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are excited to welcome Sanoma&rsquo;s social bond to Nasdaq Helsinki Sustainable Debt Market as our first social corporate bond in Finland,&rdquo; said Henrik Husman, President of Nasdaq Helsinki. &ldquo;We have now 29 sustainable bonds listed on Nasdaq Helsinki, and we look forward to seeing additional issuers following this trend.&rdquo;</p>

<div> Family Office, Malaysia, SC, incentive scheme, tax rate<br />
Summary:<br />
The Securities Commission Malaysia welcomes the new Family Office incentive scheme in Malaysia offering a 0% tax rate. It aims to attract regional and Malaysian families. <div>
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) welcomes the Government&rsquo;s announcement on the new Family Office incentive scheme, which is aimed at enhancing investment landscape in Malaysia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This comes after the Prime Minister Dato&rsquo; Seri Anwar Ibrahim&rsquo;s announcement last year on policies to encourage establishment of family offices in Malaysia to draw a larger pool of investors that will widen the financing support for SMEs and the new economy.</p>
<p>Minister of Finance II, Senator Datuk Seri Amir Hamzah Azizan announced the Single Family Office scheme as part of incentive packages for the Forest City Special Financial Zone on Friday (20 September 2024). The SC has been tasked with coordinating the Single Family Office incentive scheme.</p>
<p>The incentive provides for a 0% concessionary tax rate on income generated by eligible investments from the Single Family Office Vehicle (SFOV<a href="file://C:/Users/HLS/Downloads/23%20Sept%202024%20-%20SC%20Outlines%20Family%20Office%20Incentive%20Scheme.pdf#_ftn1"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Forest City will be the first location in Malaysia to offer a 0% tax rate incentive for Family Offices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The incentives offered are subjected to several conditions. They include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Location: Establish and operate a registered office in Pulau 1, Forest City Special Financial Zone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Duration: 20 years, covering the initial period of 10 years and additional/subsequent 10 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>To qualify for Initial Period (10 years):  
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;The SFOV must be a new investment holding company incorporated in Malaysia and seek pre-registration with the SC on the eligibility of the tax incentives;</li>
<li>&nbsp;Management company or SFO<a href="file://C:/Users/HLS/Downloads/23%20Sept%202024%20-%20SC%20Outlines%20Family%20Office%20Incentive%20Scheme.pdf#_ftn1"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a><span> which is a related company of SFOV to be set up and operate out of Pulau 1, Forest City Special Financial Zone with at least one investment professional with minimum monthly salary of RM10,000.</span></li>
<li>Hold AUM of at least RM30 million; meet minimum local investment in eligible and promoted investments of at least 10% of asset under management (AUM) or RM10 million whichever is lower;</li>
<li>SFOV to spend operating expenditure (OPEX) locally a minimum of RM500,000 annually;</li>
<li>Employ a minimum of two full-time employees of whom at least one is an investment professional, with minimum monthly salary of RM10,000;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To qualify for Additional Period (additional 10 years):  
<ul>
<li>Hold AUM of at least RM50 million; meet minimum local investment in eligible and promoted investments of at least 10% of asset under management (AUM) or RM10 million whichever is higher;</li>
<li>SFOV to spend OPEX locally (30% higher than Initial Period) a minimum of RM650,000 annually;</li>
<li>Employ a minimum of four full-time employees.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The SFO or management company may not need to get certain licenses under the Capital Markets and Services Act 2007 (CMSA), such as for fund management, as long as it only provides services for its related corporation, the SFOV.</p>
<p>The SC Chairman Dato&rsquo; Mohammad Faiz Azmi said that this move taps on the rising trend of Family Offices globally, providing comprehensive wealth management solutions, while leveraging on Malaysia&rsquo;s robust regulatory environment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Establishing the SFO Scheme positions Malaysia to enhance its investor base by attracting regional and Malaysian families to manage their wealth from Malaysia,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The projected economic multiplier of this initiative from the local substance requirements is estimated to range from RM3.9 billion to RM10.7 billion, which also includes the positive effects on creation of skilled employment and the demand for other ancillary services,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Eligible SFOVs may apply to the SC for certification for purposes of the tax incentives, subject to the SFOVs demonstrating that it has complied with the relevant conditions.</p>
<p>The SC is currently working with the relevant stakeholders to operationalise the scheme by the first quarter of 2025.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

- Decline in deal volume in China, Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, and New Zealand
- M&amp;A deals down by 6.1% in APAC
- Resilience in India and Japan makes APAC a focal point for global investors. <div>
<p><span><span>A total of 9,228 deals (mergers &amp; acquisitions (M&amp;A), private equity and venture financing) were announced in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region during January to August 2024 period. This was a year-on-year (YoY) decline of 8.1% compared to the announcement of 10,046 deals during the same period in 2023, according to&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.b00YhNV2Nr0-2BaZn7eVNAdXV19MDZH7kb0yQVOf6WtC8eObQvQmU18OGm4LpUDS-2BPm4wb_awSuR00uK8EZood8su7v4ItMFr0d7S5MNR1CcvAHRb7u8JiSB5Axp3o6-2Brp7TTn9jFAQeaiwuDUNp6ED3yPnAlc8P6BYb9FHuDe9ygxt5VZvNiU-2BtRuLsvHWqjkM9T7CikSH-2BsrEBYcWVpdtgkTcoQAG2Uy-2F3cBJUflSsACproaYS-2F-2BucATT5HSKCfO5gfUPfLBihyxLexEAp0D5IKg9ySt3EJiwUgJVN0n7AmaCtMnivtewIiN7YIQro86CcSkNdQeP6bGljaJvkBuetB389dB1A72tkREFAvWGercj9OBUHE5m-2FkXTSWzbQRWrlMbNQ7a5UA0pqtZCWqW7AzAd3Q8PmowIHDbDHWv2tYZFvFM-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GlobalData</span></span></span></a><span>, a leading data and analytics company.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Aurojyoti Bose, Lead Analyst at GlobalData, comments: "APAC region's deal-making landscape has contracted, but it continues to be of interest due to its relatively better performance compared to other regions. The varied country-specific performances, with notable improvements in India and Japan, suggests that the impact of economic headwinds on deal activity is uneven across the region."</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><img alt="GlonalData_APAC_Deal_Landscape_Jan-Aug-23-24" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/GlonalData_APAC_Deal_Landsc.jpg" title="GlonalData_APAC_Deal_Landscape_Jan-Aug-23-24" /><br /></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Deal activity across several key markets within the APAC region remained a mixed bag. China, Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, and New Zealand reported YoY decline in deal volume by 22.4%, 22.5%, 10%, 17.1%, 30.4%, and 8.8%, respectively, during the review period, whereas India and Japan demonstrated an uptick in respective deal volume by 6.1% and 11.7%. Deal volume for Australia and South Korea remained mostly flat.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Meanwhile, the number of M&amp;A deals announced in the APAC region declined by 6.1% during January-August 2024 compared to the same period in previous year whereas private equity, and venture financing deals volume experienced a YoY decline of 24.3% and 9.6%, respectively.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Bose concludes: &ldquo;The resilience shown by markets like India and Japan suggests that APAC remains a key focal point for global investors. While markets such as China and Singapore face significant headwinds, this divergence in performance presents both challenges and opportunities. Investors who strategically navigate these variations can still find value, particularly in emerging sectors and markets with stable economic outlooks.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<title>SGX RegCo To Start Incorporating IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards Into Climate Reporting Rules</title>

<div> enhanced, sustainability reporting, greenhouse gas emissions, IFRS sustainability disclosure standards, climate-related disclosures
<br />
Summary:<br />SGX RegCo will require issuers to report Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions, incorporate IFRS standards, with a phased approach and transition relief. Issuers must also disclose primary components of a sustainability report. Timeline for disclosure of Scope 3 GHG emissions set for FY 2026. <div>
<p>Singapore Exchange Regulation (SGX RegCo) has enhanced its sustainability reporting regime and will start incorporating the latest international standards into its sustainability reporting regime following broad support from respondents to a public consultation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beginning with financial year (FY) 2025, SGX RegCo will require all issuers to start reporting Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Their climate-related disclosures must also start incorporating the climate-related requirements in the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards issued by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB)<a>.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>Requiring the use of the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards builds on the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) that SGX RegCo has mandated in a phased approach since FY 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most respondents to the consultation supported the move for all issuers to carry out mandatory climate-related reporting versus the current requirement for only certain sectors to do so. But they also highlighted challenges, particularly for smaller issuers, in relation to the evolving measurement and reporting methodologies for Scope 3 GHG emissions. This is notwithstanding the one-year transition relief for the disclosure of Scope 3 GHG emissions in the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards.</p>
<p>SGX RegCo will therefore review issuers&rsquo; experience and readiness before establishing the implementation roadmap for reporting Scope 3 GHG emissions. The current plan is to prioritise larger issuers by market capitalisation with the intention that they report Scope 3 GHG emissions from FY 2026<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn1">[1]</a>. Issuers will be provided with ample notice before the effective date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The changes to our rules mark the culmination of the efforts of the Sustainability Reporting Advisory Committee to prepare issuers for a low-carbon future. The disclosure of Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions is an important step to enable larger issuers to report their Scope 3 GHG emissions. SGX RegCo on our part will continue to facilitate capacity building to assist issuers on their climate reporting journeys,&rdquo; said Mr Tan Boon Gin, CEO of SGX RegCo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a positive step towards more globally consistent and comparable sustainability-related disclosures, which will enable SGX-listed companies to demonstrate resilience against climate risks as well as seize opportunities in our transition to a low-carbon economy,&rdquo; said Mr Lim Tuang Lee, Assistant Managing Director (Capital Markets), Monetary Authority of Singapore.</p>
<p>To provide time for issuers to focus on these climate-related disclosures in FY 2025, the other primary components of a sustainability report (other than climate-related disclosures) will be mandated from FY 2026<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn2">[2]</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Issuers that do not conduct external assurance on their sustainability reports must issue their sustainability reports together with their annual reports from FY 2026.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Issuers that do conduct external assurance on their sustainability reports will continue to have up to five months after the end of their financial year to issue their sustainability reports. The extra month is aimed as a transitional measure to encourage issuers to conduct external assurance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For ease of reference, a summary table of the amendements is set out as follows:</p>
<div class="widget-rich-text-table-container">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><span>Timeline</span></td>
<td><span>Baseline Reporting Practice&nbsp;</span></td>

<p>Climate reporting on a mandatory basis that starts incorporating the climate-related requirements in the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards; the key difference with the climate-related requirements in the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards is that the requirement on Scope 3 GHG emissions is under review and not yet implemented&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other primary components of a sustainability report to be disclosed on a &lsquo;comply or explain&rsquo; basis</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Primary components of a sustainability report to be disclosed on a mandatory basis</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sustainability report to be issued with the annual report, or where the issuer has conducted external assurance on the sustainability report, no later than 5 months after the end of the financial year</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Expectation that large issuers will be required to report on Scope 3 GHG emissions and thus the content in their climate reporting will be aligned with the climate-related requirements in the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards</p>
</td>
<td>2027</td>
</tr>

<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;This is the timeline for disclosure of Scope 3 GHG emissions if the climate-relevant requirements of the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards were fully implemented in FY 2025, due to the in-built one-year transition relief.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;The other primary components of a sustainability report are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Material ESG factors;</li>
<li>Policies, practices and performance;</li>
<li>Targets;</li>
<li>Sustainability reporting framework; and</li>
<li>Board statement and associated governance structure for sustainability practices</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;An issuer must issue a sustainability report for its financial year, no later than 4 months after the end of the financial year, or where the issuer has conducted external assurance on the sustainability report, no later than 5 months after the end of the financial year.</p>

<div> fraud, securities, offering, investors, SEC
Summary:
Defendants found liable for securities fraud, misrepresentation of investor funds, and unregistered securities sales. SEC committed to holding fraudsters accountable. <div>
<p class="xxx"><em>Today, after a 10-day trial and just over two hours of deliberation, a jury in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California found Michael P. Owens, Dawson L. Davenport, Robert A. Gunton, Andrea J. Lindstrom, and Julie A. Yale liable for securities fraud. The jury also determined that Owens, Gunton, and Yale violated the securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws, and that Owens violated the broker-dealer registration provisions of the federal securities laws.</em></p>
<p><span>Statement by SEC Division of Enforcement Director Gurbir S. Grewal:</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;We are pleased with the jury verdict holding these defendants liable for their roles in fraudulent securities offerings that raised more than $67 million from investors. Defendants Owens, Davenport, and Lindstrom set up and controlled a boiler room that cold-called investors to solicit private investments in an aerospace start-up, but misrepresented how the investor funds would be used: they concealed that significant investor funds were spent on sales commissions to unregistered brokers, that nearly a third of the invested funds were spent on offering costs, and that most of these offering costs went to Owens and entities he controlled. The jury also found all of the defendants liable for a separate fraudulent scheme to conduct unregistered offers and sales of securities to generate more illicit profits for Owens. As this trial demonstrates, the SEC is committed to protecting investors and holding fraudsters accountable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The SEC&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2021/comp25193.pdf">filed its civil complaint</a>&nbsp;on Sept. 1, 2021.</p>

Summary:<br />Commodity Futures Trading Commission issued temporary no-action letter extending CFTC Staff Letters for nonbank swap dealers in EU and UK. Expires by December 31, 2026. <div>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission&rsquo;s Market Participants Division (MPD) today announced it issued a temporary no-action letter extending CFTC Staff Letters No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/csl/21-20/download" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">21-20</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/csl/22-10/download" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">22-10</a>&nbsp;to certain nonbank swap dealers (SDs) domiciled in the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK) that are the subject of pending CFTC reviews for comparability determinations regarding capital and financial reporting requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the capital and financial reporting requirements for nonbank SDs, the CFTC adopted a substituted compliance framework that permits certain nonbank SDs to rely on compliance with home-country capital and financial reporting requirements in lieu of meeting all or parts of the CFTC&rsquo;s capital adequacy and financial reporting requirements, provided the CFTC finds the home-country requirements comparable to the CFTC&rsquo;s requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through CFTC Staff Letter No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/csl/24-13/download" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">24-13</a>, issued today, MPD is extending a no-action position to eligible nonbank SDs domiciled in the EU and the UK that are not covered by existing CFTC orders addressing capital and financial reporting requirements. The no-action position is conditioned upon the nonbank SDs remaining in compliance with applicable home-country capital and financial reporting requirements and submitting certain financial reporting information to the CFTC.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The no-action position will expire by December 31, 2026 or the effective date of any final CFTC action addressing the comparability of capital and financial reporting requirements applicable to the relevant nonbank SDs.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Statement By Federal Reserve Governor Michelle W. Bowman On Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) Decision</title>

<div> Labor market, inflation, federal funds rate, dissent, policy stance
Summary:
- Dissent on federal funds rate decrease
- Strong economy and labor market
- Concerns about inflation
- Advocating for measured pace in policy adjustment
- Commitment to shared goals
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>On Wednesday, September 18, 2024, I dissented from the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) decision to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point to 4-3/4 to 5 percent. As the Committee's post-meeting statement notes, I preferred to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 5 to 5-1/4 percent.</p>
<p>Given the progress we have seen since the middle of 2023 on both lowering inflation and cooling the labor market, I agree that at this meeting it was appropriate to recalibrate the level of the federal funds rate and begin the process of moving toward a more neutral policy stance. In my view, however, a smaller first move in this process would have been a preferable action.</p>
<p><strong>The U.S. Economy Remains Strong</strong><br />The U.S. economy remains strong, with solid underlying growth in economic activity and a labor market near full employment. Although hiring appears to have softened, layoffs remain low. I see the normalization in labor market conditions as necessary to help bring wage growth down to a pace consistent with 2 percent inflation given trend productivity growth. My reading of labor market data has become more uncertain due to increased measurement challenges and the inherent difficulty in assessing the effects of recent immigration flows. I am also taking signal from continued solid growth in the spending data, especially consumer spending, reflecting a healthy labor market.</p>
<p><strong>Despite Progress, Inflation Remains a Concern</strong><br />Inflation remains above our 2 percent goal, as core personal consumption expenditures prices are still rising faster than 2.5 percent from 12 months earlier. Higher prices have an outsized impact on lower- and moderate-income households. Accomplishing our mission of returning to low and stable inflation at our 2 percent goal is necessary to foster a strong labor market and an economy that works for everyone in the longer term.</p>
<p>Although it is important to recognize that there has been meaningful progress on lowering inflation, while core inflation remains around or above 2.5 percent, I see the risk that the Committee's larger policy action could be interpreted as a premature declaration of victory on our price stability mandate.</p>
<p>We have not yet achieved our inflation goal. I believe that moving at a measured pace toward a more neutral policy stance will ensure further progress in bringing inflation down to our 2 percent target. This approach would also avoid unnecessarily stoking demand.</p>
<p><strong>Shared Goals for the Future</strong><br />Despite my dissent at our recent meeting, I respect and appreciate that my colleagues preferred to begin the reduction in the federal funds rate with a larger initial reduction in the target range for the policy rate. I remain committed to working together with my colleagues to ensure that monetary policy is appropriately positioned to achieve our goals of maximum employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent target.</p>

<title>CFTC: Federal Court Orders New York Man To Pay Over $36 Million For Forex And Digital Asset Fraud - Defendant Admitted To Falsifying Financial Documents, Providing Investors False Account Statements And Diverting Investor Funds For Personal Luxuries</title>

<div> Order, Fraud, Restitution, Monetary relief, Enforcement action
Summary:<br /><br />The CFTC obtained a $36 million monetary relief against William Koo Ichioka for his fraudulent forex and digital asset scheme. Ichioka was also charged with wire fraud and tax fraud. He was sentenced to 48 months in prison and ordered to pay restitution. The CFTC advises caution and provides resources for reporting suspicious activities and potential violations of commodity trading laws. Whistleblowers may be eligible for a reward. <div>
<p><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced Judge Vince Chhabria of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California entered an order Sept. 19 assessing monetary relief totaling over $36 million against&nbsp;<span>William Koo Ichioka,&nbsp;</span>a New York resident formerly of San Francisco. The order requires Ichioka to pay $31 million in restitution to defrauded victims and a $5 million civil monetary penalty in connection with his fraudulent foreign currency (forex) and digital asset fraud scheme.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>On Aug. 14, 2023, the court entered an initial consent order of permanent injunction against Ichioka, prohibiting him from future violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations and banning him from trading in any CFTC-regulated markets and from registering with the CFTC. This initial consent order and the order entering monetary relief announced today resolve the CFTC&rsquo;s enforcement action against Ichioka. [See CFTC Press Release No.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8727-23">8727-23</a>]</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Additionally, the initial consent order found the defendant engaged in a fraudulent scheme beginning in 2018 in which he accepted investment funds from participants with false claims of a 10% return every 30 business days. Although Ichioka invested some funds in forex and digital asset commodities, he commingled participant money with his own funds and used participant funds for his own personal expenses, including, among other things, rent for his personal residence, jewelry, including watches, and luxury vehicles. To conceal his fraudulent activity, Ichioka overstated the value of assets he held by generating false financial documents and presenting false account statements to participants.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Parallel Criminal Action</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>On June 22, 2023, the Department of Justice charged Ichioka with one count of wire fraud, two counts of preparing false tax returns, one count of fraud in connection with the purchase and sale of securities and one count of commodities fraud, all based on the same conduct alleged in the CFTC&rsquo;s complaint. [<i>United States v. William Koo Ichioka,&nbsp;</i>Case No. 23-cr-00190-VC (N.D. Cal. June 22, 2023).] Ichioka pled guilty to these charges the same day. Ichioka subsequently was sentenced to 48 months in prison, given an additional term of 5 years of supervised release, and ordered to pay a $5 million fine, and $31,330,715.86 in restitution to victims.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Northern District of California, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation, and the Securities and Exchange Commission.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this case are Susan B. Padove, Joseph Patrick, Elizabeth M. Streit, Scott Williamson and Robert Howell and former CFTC employee David Terrell.</span></span></p>

<title>Canadian Securities Regulators And CIRO Provide Update On SEC Adopting Amendments To Rules Regarding Minimum Pricing Increments And Trading Fee Caps</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/canadian-securities-regulators-and-ciro-provide-update-on-sec-adopting-amendment/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Securities regulatory authorities, SEC Final Rules, Canadian equity market, minimum pricing increments, transparency of odd-lot orders<br />
Summary: The Canadian securities regulators and CIRO are working on amendments to harmonize Canadian market rules with the finalized SEC rules.<br /><br /> <div>
<p>The securities regulatory authorities of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nunavut, Northwest Territories and Yukon and the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) today provided an update on their work related to the recent rule changes announced by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These rule changes follow the SEC consultations launched on December 14, 2022, on four proposals to change certain fundamental elements of U.S. market structure (<strong>SEC Proposed Amendments</strong>).</p>
<p>On September 18, 2024, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-137" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SEC announced its final rules</a>&nbsp;with respect to two elements of the SEC Proposed Amendments, specifically (i) minimum pricing increments applicable to all trading and quoting of National Market System (NMS) stocks equal to or greater than USD $1.00 per share, and (ii) reduced access fee caps for NMS stocks (together,&nbsp;<strong>SEC Final Rules</strong>). At the same meeting, the SEC approved rules regarding transparency of certain odd-lot orders. The SEC Final Rules will come into force on November 3, 2025.</p>
<p>Following the announcement of the SEC Proposed Amendments, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) and CIRO commenced a process to consider their impact on the Canadian equity market structure, and in October 2023, proactively sought feedback from stakeholders in joint&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asc.ca/-/media/ASC-Documents-part-1/Regulatory-Instruments/2023/10/6119086-CSACIRO-Staff-Notice-23-331-Final.ashx">CSA/CIRO Staff Notice 23-331</a>. Twelve comment letters were received;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asc.ca/-/media/ASC-Documents-part-1/Regulatory-Instruments/2024/09/6179951-CSA-Notice-23-331-Summary-of-Comments-re-SEC.ashx">a summary of comments</a>&nbsp;is available.</p>
<p>With respect to the SEC Final Rules, commenters were generally of the view that, given the interconnectedness of U.S. and Canadian equity markets, Canadian trading increments for inter-listed securities, contained in CIRO&rsquo;s Universal Market Integrity Rules (<strong>UMIR</strong>), should be harmonized with the finalized SEC minimum pricing increments. Commenters also supported harmonizing Canadian equity trading fee caps, contained in National Instrument 23-101&nbsp;<em>Trading Rules</em>, with those finalized by the SEC.</p>
<p>The participating securities regulatory authorities and CIRO are currently finalizing work on their respective rule amendments and will publish them for comment. This is to ensure trading in Canadian inter-listed securities remains competitive, in light of the adoption of the SEC Final Rules.</p>
<p>With respect to the SEC Final Rules regarding transparency of certain odd-lot orders, commenters expressed little support for a similar change in Canada as such information is already sufficiently available. Accordingly, the CSA and CIRO are not considering changes to transparency rules at this time.</p>
<p>The British Columbia Securities Commission did not participate in this media advisory due to publication restrictions related to the upcoming B.C. provincial election.</p>
<p>The CSA, the council of the securities regulators of Canada&rsquo;s provinces and territories, co-ordinates and harmonizes regulation for the Canadian capital markets.</p>
<p>CIRO is the pan-Canadian self-regulatory organization that oversees all investment dealers, mutual fund dealers and trading activity on Canada&rsquo;s debt and equity marketplaces.</p>

<div> meeting, U.S. Treasury, China's Ministry of Finance, economic relationship, cooperation
Summary:<br />U.S. and China held productive EWG meeting, discussed economic policies, concerns, and areas for cooperation, emphasizing stability in bilateral economic relationship.<br /> <div>
<p>The United States and the People&rsquo;s Republic of China held the fifth meeting of the Economic Working&nbsp;Group (EWG) on September 19-20 in Beijing.&nbsp; This was the second EWG held in China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over two days of meetings, senior officials from the U.S. Department of the Treasury and China&rsquo;s Ministry of Finance convened for a set of productive discussions and were joined by participants from other agencies.&nbsp; The two sides opened the discussions by exchanging views on policies that support balanced growth in the domestic and global economies.&nbsp; U.S. officials also continued discussions related to issues of concerns raised during Secretary Janet L. Yellen&rsquo;s visit to China in April, including signs of increasing overcapacity in certain sectors of the Chinese economy,&nbsp;China&rsquo;s non-market policies and practices&nbsp;and their impact on U.S. workers and firms, as well as Chinese firms&rsquo; support for Russia&rsquo;s war in Ukraine.&nbsp; The meeting sessions concluded with the two&nbsp;sides sharing views on domestic macroeconomic outlooks and discussions on areas of cooperation, including debt issues and financing challenges in emerging and developing economies.</p>
<p>While in Beijing, the Treasury delegation also met with Vice Premier He Lifeng, where they emphasized&nbsp;that Secretary Janet L. Yellen is pleased with the role the EWG plays in maintaining stability in the bilateral economic relationship by providing a resilient channel of communications on both areas of concern and areas for further cooperation.</p>
<p>The EWG is one of two working groups formed by Secretary Yellen and Vice Premier He Lifeng of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China last September. The EWG is co-led by Jay Shambaugh, Under Secretary for International Affairs at the U.S. Treasury, and Liao Min, Vice Minister of Finance at China&rsquo;s Ministry of Finance. The EWG reports directly to Secretary Yellen and Vice Premier He.&nbsp;</p>

<div> Guidance, Voluntary Carbon Credits, CFTC, Derivative Contracts, VCC<br />
Summary: The CFTC's guidance on Voluntary Carbon Credit Derivative Contracts is unnecessary and promotes political ideologies rather than regulatory clarity and transparency. <div>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Today&rsquo;s non-binding guidance</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement092024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;to designated contract markets (&ldquo;DCMs&rdquo;) regarding listing of voluntary carbon credits (&ldquo;VCCs&rdquo;) derivative contracts is a solution in search of a problem.&nbsp; The Commodity Futures Trading Commission</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement092024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;has no shortage of topics that warrant our immediate attention.&nbsp; But instead of addressing those, we are issuing guidance on an emerging class of products that have very little open interest and comprise a miniscule percentage of trading activity on CFTC-regulated DCMs.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement092024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>In addition to issuing the VCC Guidance, the Commission has held multiple &ldquo;convenings,&rdquo; and the Division of Enforcement established a task force and issued a Whistleblower Office alert.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement092024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; I question whether any other class of derivative products has received the outsized attention that VCC derivative contracts have received from the CFTC.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Guidance can play an important role in providing clarity and fostering transparency regarding rules that are complex and open to interpretation.&nbsp; That is why the Commission published existing guidance to DCMs through Appendices B and C to Part 38 of the Commission&rsquo;s regulations.&nbsp; But this new VCC Guidance on a singular class of derivatives contracts does very little to provide clarity, and it most certainly does nothing to foster transparency.&nbsp; Because the VCC Guidance is just guidance, it &ldquo;does not establish new obligations for DCMs.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement092024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; So why are we engaged in a non-binding exercise that does little to provide clarity, does not foster transparency, and does not establish new obligations?&nbsp; It seems the only explanation is to set the stage for the Commission to promote a political agenda.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The VCC Guidance includes veiled attempts to propagate controversial political ideologies best left to debate by voters and elected officials.&nbsp; Specifically, the VCC Guidance states that, &ldquo;a DCM may determine that it is appropriate, when addressing quality standards in connection with derivative contract design, to consider whether the crediting program for underlying VCCs has implemented measures to help ensure that credited mitigation projects or activities&nbsp;<i>(i) meet or exceed best practices on social and environmental safeguards, and (ii) would avoid locking in levels of [greenhouse gas] emissions, technologies or carbon intensive practices that are incompatible with the objective of achieving net zero [greenhouse gas] emissions by 2050.&rdquo;</i></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement092024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Environmental and Social Governance (ESG) compliance and Net Zero goals are completely immaterial to the ability of the listed derivatives products to meet their regulatory obligations.&nbsp; Focusing on ESG and Net Zero in evaluating derivatives contracts is a backdoor attempt to inject and memorialize certain political ideologies into CFTC regulatory decisions.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The Commission should evaluate VCC derivative products as we would any other derivative product listed by a DCM, and we should regulate a DCM listing VCC derivative products the same way we regulate DCMs listing other derivatives products.&nbsp; Our outsized focus on the VCC derivative products and the underlying VCC markets looks a lot more like promotion of ideology than simply offering guidance.&nbsp; For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<div> derivatives, voluntary carbon credits, Commission guidance, VCMs, climate risk

Summary:
The U.S. CFTC issues guidance for VCC derivatives, reflecting input from diverse stakeholders and promoting integrity, transparency, and market effectiveness. 
This public-private partnership emphasizes the importance of recognized standards and complements global efforts to enhance market structure and financial integrity. 
The guidance outlines factors for Contract Markets to consider and highlights VCC characteristics to promote accurate pricing and reduce susceptibility to manipulation. 
The guidance aims to strengthen market integrity, transparency, and liquidity for derivatives with underlying voluntary carbon credits, consistent with existing statutory and regulatory requirements. 
The CFTC's unique mission and expertise position it at the forefront of addressing the global nexus between financial markets and decarbonization efforts. 
Summary: <div>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The Commission&rsquo;s final guidance for designated contract markets (DCMs or Contract Markets) that list derivatives on voluntary carbon credits (VCCs) as the underlying commodity is a critical step in support of the development of high-integrity voluntary carbon markets (VCMs). For the first time ever, a U.S. financial regulator is issuing regulatory guidance for contract markets that list financial contracts aimed at providing tools to manage risk, promote price discovery, and foster the allocation of capital towards decarbonization efforts.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The publication of this final guidance marks the culmination of over five years</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/behnamstatement092024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;of work with a diverse group of market participants, including agricultural stakeholders, ranchers, foresters, landowners, commercial end users, energy market stakeholders, emission-trading focused entities, carbon-credit rating agencies, crediting programs, CFTC-registered exchanges and clearinghouses, public interest groups, academics, and others. This guidance also represents a whole-of-government approach in coordination with our partners across the U.S. federal complex.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Each step has been intentional. I sponsored the Market Risk Advisory Committee&rsquo;s Climate-Related Market Risk Subcommittee, which issued a first-of-its-kind report on Managing Climate Risk in the U.S. Financial System in September 2020, that identified pricing carbon as a fundamental element for financial markets to efficiently allocate capital to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs).<a name="_ftnref1"></a></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/behnamstatement092024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;I established the CFTC&rsquo;s Climate Risk Unit in March 2021 to support the Commission&rsquo;s building of subject matter expertise through external engagement, cooperation, and coordination regarding the role that climate-related derivatives play in pricing and managing climate-related financial risk.<a name="_ftnref2"></a></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/behnamstatement092024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;I hosted two Voluntary Carbon Markets Convenings in June 2022 and July 2023 to&nbsp;<span>gather information from a wide variety of market participants to&nbsp;better understand the potential role of the official sector in these markets, particularly as we began to see the emergence of listed futures products that reference underlying VCC cash markets</span>.<a name="_ftnref3"></a></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/behnamstatement092024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;The CFTC issued a Request for Information on Climate-Related Financial Risk in June 2022 that received 80 comments on ten priority areas of interest including VCMs and product innovation.<a name="_ftnref4"></a></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/behnamstatement092024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;The Commission then issued proposed guidance with a request for public comment in December 2023, that received over 85 comments,</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/behnamstatement092024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;the majority of which generally supported the proposal. I have also testified before Congress on several occasions specifically on the role of financial markets in addressing the climate crisis and my views on the CFTC&rsquo;s role in supporting market-based solutions.<a name="_ftnref5"></a></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/behnamstatement092024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The primary takeaway from this research, public engagement, and consultation is clear; the Commission should act, consistent with its statutory authority under the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), to strengthen market integrity, transparency, and liquidity for derivatives with underlying voluntary carbon credits that are real, additional, permanent, verifiable, and each represent a unique metric ton of GHG emissions reduced or removed from the atmosphere.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>While VCC derivatives are a comparatively new and evolving class of products, Contract Markets must ensure that any listed derivatives comply with the CEA and Commission regulations. The guidance outlines factors that Contract Markets may consider in connection with the VCC derivative contract design and listing process including: Core Principle 3, which requires Contract Markets to list only contracts that are not readily susceptible to manipulation; Core Principle 4, which requires Contract Markets to have the capacity and responsibility to prevent manipulation, price distortion, and other market disruptions through market surveillance, compliance, and enforcement practices and procedures; the Commission&rsquo;s regulations promulgated for these Core Principles; and the product submission provisions set forth in CEA section 5c(c) and Part 40 of the Commission regulations.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The guidance is not intended to modify or supersede existing statutory or regulatory requirements, or existing Commission guidance that addresses a Contract Market&rsquo;s listing of derivative contracts, such as Appendix C to Part 38 of the Commission&rsquo;s regulations. Instead, the guidance outlines VCC characteristics for a Contract Market to consider in connection with the contract design and listing process for VCC derivatives to address certain requirements under the CEA and the Commission&rsquo;s rules.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>These voluntary carbon credit characteristics are: (i) transparency, additionality, permanence and accounting for the risk of reversal, and robust quantification of emissions reductions or removals, for consideration when addressing quality standards; (ii) governance, tracking mechanisms, and measures to prevent double counting, for consideration when addressing delivery procedures; and (iii) third-party validation and verification, for consideration when addressing inspection or certification procedures. A Contract Market&rsquo;s consideration of these characteristics in connection with the design of the contract and the listing process should promote accurate pricing, reduce susceptibility of the contract to manipulation, help prevent price distortions, and foster confidence in the voluntary carbon credit contracts. Consistent with the current statutory and regulatory requirements, Contract Markets would retain reasonable discretion to comply with the DCM Core Principles and the Commission&rsquo;s regulations.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>This guidance is the product of a strong public-private partnership that I have strived to achieve with both the CFTC&rsquo;s traditional stakeholders, as well as a variety of new stakeholders, including carbon market participants to support transparency, liquidity, market integrity, and ultimately scale in these markets. Today&rsquo;s guidance outlines well-researched VCC commodity characteristics that build on several mature private sector and multilateral initiatives that have made great strides to strengthen VCC credit integrity standards through technical analysis, expertise, and broad coalition building. With the benefit of public comment, the CFTC&rsquo;s final guidance specifically recognizes that private sector recognized standards for high-integrity VCCs can serve as tools for CFTC Contract Markets in connection with their consideration of the VCC commodity characteristics.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Recognizing the global nature of derivatives markets, the VCC guidance complements the important work underway by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) through its Sustainable Finance Task Force&rsquo;s Carbon Market Workstream, which I am leading with Verena Ross, the Chair of the European Securities and Market Authority. While this Commission guidance focuses on what Contract Markets may consider in designing and monitoring their proprietary listed VCC derivative contracts, IOSCO&rsquo;s work over nearly three years has been focused on how regulators can promote sound market structure and enhance financial integrity in the VCMs so that high-quality carbon credits can be traded in an orderly and transparent way. IOSCO is hard at work reviewing the many helpful comments received in response to the December 2023 VCM Consultation Report. I am looking forward to the next deliverable of that workstream, which is expected later this year.<a name="_ftnref6"></a></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/behnamstatement092024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The CFTC&rsquo;s unique mission focused on risk mitigation and price discovery puts us on the front lines of the now global nexus between financial markets and decarbonization efforts. Leveraging the CFTC&rsquo;s personnel and expertise demonstrates our commitment to taking a thoughtful and deliberate step toward building a financial system that provides effective tools in achieving emission reductions.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I thank my fellow commissioners for enabling the Commission to issue this final guidance. I greatly appreciate the expertise and the tremendous work done by staff in the Division of Market Oversight, the Office of the General Counsel, and in my office on this final guidance.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today approved final guidance regarding the listing for trading of voluntary carbon credit derivative contracts. The guidance applies to designated contract markets (DCMs), which are CFTC-regulated derivatives exchanges, and outlines factors for DCMs to consider when addressing certain Core Principle requirements in the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations that are relevant to the listing for trading of voluntary carbon credit derivative contracts. The guidance also outlines factors for consideration when addressing certain requirements under the CFTC&rsquo;s Part 40 Regulations that relate to the submission of new derivative contracts, and contract amendments to the CFTC.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&ldquo;The Commission&rsquo;s final guidance announced today is the product of a strong public-private partnership that I have strived to achieve with both the CFTC&rsquo;s traditional stakeholders as well as a variety of voluntary carbon market stakeholders to support transparency, liquidity, and market integrity in the VCC derivatives markets as well as ultimately drive standardization and efficient capital allocation to scale the underlying cash market for high integrity VCCs,&rdquo; said CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam. &ldquo;The CFTC&rsquo;s unique mission focused on risk mitigation and price discovery puts us on the front lines of the now global nexus between financial markets and decarbonization efforts. Leveraging the CFTC&rsquo;s personnel and expertise demonstrates our commitment to taking a thoughtful and deliberate step toward building a financial system that provides effective tools in achieving emission reductions.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The CFTC&rsquo;s guidance recognizes that outlining factors for a DCM to consider in connection with the contract design and listing process may help to advance the standardization of voluntary carbon credit derivative contracts in a manner that fosters transparency and liquidity. The guidance reflects insight the CFTC gained from public comment on the proposed guidance and marks the culmination of over five years of collaboration with a diverse group of market participants. These include agricultural stakeholders, ranchers, foresters, landowners, commercial end users, energy market stakeholders, emission-trading focused entities, CFTC-registered exchanges and clearinghouses, carbon-credit rating agencies, crediting programs, public interest groups, academics, and others key stakeholders in the voluntary carbon market.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<title>Derivatives Service Bureau Data Shows Industry Ready For UK UPI Reporting - UPI Reporting In The UK Comes Into Force On 30 September 2024</title>

<div> DSB, UPI, OTC derivatives, UK EMIR rules, regulatory reform
<br />
The Derivatives Service Bureau (DSB) indicates UK readiness for UPI reporting under revised EMIR rules, with increasing global implementation and regulatory reform. 
<br /><br />Summary: 
The DSB reports UK readiness for UPI reporting, with global implementation following US and EU, showcasing regulatory reform emphasis. <div>
<p><span>The Derivatives Service Bureau (DSB), the global golden source of reference data for OTC derivatives,&nbsp;<span>today released data indicating industry readiness for the start of UK UPI (Unique Product Identifier) reporting on 30 September 2024 under revised UK EMIR rules.&nbsp;</span>The UPI is reported to trade repositories so regulators can<span>&nbsp;</span>monitor the build-up of systemic risk across the OTC derivatives market.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>The UK will be the third jurisdiction to implement UPI reporting following the US and EU which went live on 29 January and 29 April 2024 respectively. The FCA and Bank of England published their&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.fca.org.uk%2Fpublication%2Fpolicy%2Fps23-2.pdf/1/010201920e3b64fb-c7a92422-3bcc-4057-9a31-1532f40f8ae2-000000/iEakf9ke4VMFSVxeP-iYsv4AQyI=392" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>joint rules on the revised derivatives reporting framework under UK EMIR</span></a><span>&nbsp;in February 2023 with general alignment between the UK and EU approach, meaning the OTC ISIN is reported where the EMIR scope aligns with MiFIR, and the UPI reported for derivatives that fall under the wider scope of EMIR. Due to the complementary design of the two identifiers, the UPI is included in the OTC ISIN record to ensure global alignment.<br /></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The DSB&rsquo;s user onboarding data reveals a large number of UK headquartered firms joined the UPI&nbsp;</span><span>Service in readiness for the US and EU mandates coming into effect, with over 90% leveraging their OTC ISIN connectivity to streamline UPI integration. As a result of the advanced preparation, the DSB is noticing lower uptake in onboarding in the weeks leading up to the UK mandate.&nbsp;<br /></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To date</span><span>,&nbsp;</span><span>over 390&nbsp;</span><span>firms have subscribed to the UPI Service on a fee-paying basis, including&nbsp;</span><span>157&nbsp;</span><span>programmatic users.&nbsp;</span><span>Approximately 15</span><span>% of those organisations are UK headquartered. Quarterly updates on UPI user numbers are published on the&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.anna-dsb.com%2Fupi-fee-model-variables%2F/1/010201920e3b64fb-c7a92422-3bcc-4057-9a31-1532f40f8ae2-000000/ibguWF-SKpN3jxmNz3BLFQMJXcE=392" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>DSB&rsquo;s website</span></a><span>. In relation to UPI volumes, UPI generation has increased over the last few weeks, a similar trend seen in advance of the US and EU mandates coming into effect. There are approximately 1.2 million UPIs with over 8,000 new codes generated per week, up from the average of 5,000 per week. Identifier metrics are also published on the&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.anna-dsb.com%2Fidentifier-metrics%2F/1/010201920e3b64fb-c7a92422-3bcc-4057-9a31-1532f40f8ae2-000000/rZ1Jk7uWnFnLmN8Ip4CiY-SAPwY=392" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>DSB website</span></a><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></span></span></p>
<p><span>Implementation of the UPI brings to fruition a G20 commitment to improve global oversight of OTC derivatives markets following the financial crisis. Australia and Singapore UPI regulatory reporting comes into effect on 21 October 2024, followed by Japan on 7 April 2025 and Canada on 25 July 2025. Hong Kong has consulted on a start date of 29 September 2025 and further jurisdictions, such as Korea and Saudi Arabia, are also actively preparing to introduce the UPI.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>
<p><span>With the UPI Service still in its inaugural year of live operation, the increasing number of jurisdictions taking such steps for UPI implementation underscores the continued emphasis G20 authorities place on driving OTC derivative regulatory reform.&nbsp;</span></p>

<title>Shenzhen Stock Exchange Held A Symposium On Promoting High-Quality Development Of ETF Market And CSI A500 ETF</title>

<div> symposium, ETF market, CSI A500, SZSE, high-quality development
Summary:
- SZSE organized a symposium to discuss promoting high-quality development of the ETF market and the long-term allocation value of CSI A500 product. They aim to enhance market services and support long-term investment. <div>
<p>To thoroughly study and implement the guiding principles of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee and the new "Nine National Rules", SZSE organized a symposium on September 12. The meeting focused on promoting the high-quality development of the ETF market and building a "long-term capital, long-term investment" market system. Discussions were also held on the long-term allocation value of CSI A500 product. Representatives from 25 institutions, including funds, brokerage firms, banks, and insurance companies, attended the event. A representative from SZSE was present and delivered a speech.</p>
<p>Recently, the CSRC approved the CSI A500 Index and related ETF product. This is the first core broad-based index after the release of the new "Nine National Rules". It provides a comprehensive portrayal of leading companies in China's capital market, covering both new quality productive forces and traditional industries. Among the constituent stocks&nbsp;of CSI&nbsp;A500, 253 are SZSE-listed companies, accounting for more than half of the total, fully reflecting the "innovation-driven and high-growth" characteristics of SZSE-listed companies. Participants agreed that CSI A500 ETF provides an ideal tool for investors to tap into new quality productive forces and invest in leading companies in emerging sectors, and provides diversified options for medium- and long-term capital to seize opportunities during China's high-quality economic development phase.</p>
<p>The SZSE representative stated that SZSE is following the unified deployment by the CSRC and is making continuous efforts across the front, middle and back ends to create an environment more suitable for medium- and long-term capital entry into the market, thereby accelerating the high-quality development of the ETF market. Firstly, we are improving the product lineup to support the development of new quality productive forces. This involves establishing an index methodology system and product development system that better aligns with the requirements of these new quality productive forces, guiding capital into relevant areas to help the capital market better serve the transformation and upgrading of the real economy. Secondly, we are vigorously developing financial products represented by ETFs. The goal is to provide investors with more convenient tools and accessible channels to share the fruits of economic development.

<title>Nothing To See - Nothing To Say: Statement On Recent Whistleblower Awards, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, SEC Commissioner Mark T. Uyeda, Sept. 19, 2024</title>

<div> whistleblower, Commission, redaction, confidentiality, scrutiny
Summary:<br /> The Securities and Exchange Commission issued whistleblower awards totaling $122,000,000, with redacted information raising questions about transparency and accountability. The redaction decisions are questioned. The whistleblower program requires scrutiny. Effective public scrutiny of the awards is hindered. The extent of the redactions limits public information. scrutinizing the integrity of the whistleblower program is essential. 

Summary: <div>
<p>The Commission recently issued two whistleblower award determinations awarding an aggregate $122,000,000 among four claimants.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-whistleblower-091924#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;We did not support these determinations, but we are unable to explain our reasons because the public final orders determining the awards redact certain information necessary to the explanation. The text surrounding the redactions describes how the Commission calculated the total amount collected for purposes of determining the award amount.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-whistleblower-091924#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;We did not believe that the redactions were necessary or appropriate under the relevant statutory authority because the redacted information could not reasonably be expected to reveal the whistleblowers&rsquo; identity. As an inadvertent result of these redactions, the legal reasoning in final orders of the Commission determining that $122,000,000 should be paid from the Investor Protection Fund at the Treasury of the United States is immunized from effective public scrutiny. These awards illustrate why the Commission&rsquo;s redaction decisions are consequential not only for whistleblowers, but also for oversight of the Commission&rsquo;s operation of the whistleblower program.</p>
<p>Whistleblowers are important, and confidentiality is important to whistleblowers. To that end, the whistleblower provisions in the Securities Exchange Act provide that &ldquo;the Commission and any officer or employee of the Commission shall not disclose any information, including information provided by a whistleblower to the Commission, which could reasonably be expected to reveal the identity of a whistleblower.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-whistleblower-091924#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;This confidentiality directive, however, is not absolute. The statute protects only a limited category of information&mdash;that &ldquo;which could reasonably be expected to reveal the identity of a whistleblower&rdquo;&mdash;and even that information can be disclosed in certain circumstances.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-whistleblower-091924#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>In accordance with statutory directives, our public final orders determining awards should not disclose whistleblower-identifying information. But what information is that? As noted, the statute prohibits disclosing &ldquo;any information,&rdquo; including &ldquo;information provided by a whistleblower to the Commission,&rdquo; if the information &ldquo;could reasonably be expected to reveal&rdquo; the whistleblower&rsquo;s identity. Neither the statute nor any Commission rule delimit what specific information &ldquo;could reasonably be expected to reveal the identity of a whistleblower.&rdquo; Whether a particular piece of information fits that category, in the end, comes down to an exercise of judgment.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-whistleblower-091924#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Despite the undeniable importance of the information the Commission includes as part of its public final orders, the Commission&rsquo;s releases, statements, and labyrinthian whistleblower rules are silent on how the Commission determines what information it can and cannot disclose. From the public&rsquo;s perspective, as evidenced by the appearance on the Commission&rsquo;s website of heavily redacted award determinations, someone at the Commission determines that this or that information should be redacted. The public is left with only limited, curated information to consider when assessing whether the award determination raises potential legal issues related to the interpretation and application of the whistleblower statutes and whether the Commission is applying its rules in a reasonable and consistent matter when it awards substantial sums of money from the public fisc.</p>
<p>Unnecessary redaction of final award determinations in the name of whistleblower confidentiality limits public information about the awards, and that, in turn, insulates the awards from scrutiny. And the whistleblower program needs scrutiny. Most direct participants in the program share a common incentive&mdash;to maximize awards. Whistleblowers have incentives to obtain the largest award possible; the Division of Enforcement has an incentive to maximize awards as an inducement for whistleblowers to come forward; and the Commission has an incentive to maximize awards as a metric to illustrate the success of the program. Ensuring that the Commission&rsquo;s public final award determinations disclose, to the greatest extent possible, the facts supporting the determination and articulate the legal reasoning underpinning the Commission&rsquo;s interpretation and application of the whistleblower statute and rules is a necessary and helpful check on the potential negative consequences of such an alignment of incentives. The whistleblower program is important to the Commission, so we should do everything possible to protect its integrity, including allowing appropriate outside scrutiny.</p>

<div> Keywords: Scarlett Johansson, romcoms, artificial intelligence, systemic risk, capital markets
Summary: The use of AI in finance, as seen in the movie "Her," could lead to systemic risk, requiring new regulatory thinking.
Summary: <br /><br />Regulators need to consider the dependencies of financial institutions on AI models and data aggregators to prevent future financial crises. <div>
<p>This video can be viewed at the below&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/xYhkdO1esMM">link</a>.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-transcript-systemic-risk-artificial-intelligence-091924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a></p>
<p>



</p>
<p>What might Scarlett Johansson and romcoms teach us about artificial intelligence and systemic risk in our capital markets?</p>
<p>There was a movie back in 2013 called &ldquo;Her&rdquo; in which Scarlett Johansson plays Samantha, an AI-powered virtual assistant. Samantha forms a romantic bond with Theodore, a human played by Joaquin Phoenix.</p>
<p>Late in the movie, Theodore is shaken when he gets an error message: &ldquo;Operating System Not Found.&rdquo; Upon Samantha's return, he asks if she's interacting with others. Yes, she responds with 8,316 others. And shortly thereafter she goes offline for good.</p>
<p>Well, what might this have to do with our economy? Well, what we've seen in our economy is how one or a small number of tech platforms can come to dominate a field. We all know this. Search engines, retail platforms, cloud providers and on.</p>
<p>We're bound to see the same develop with artificial intelligence. In fact, the three largest cloud providers are already affiliated with the leading generative AI companies.</p>
<p>What does this mean for finance? Well, AI is already being used for call centers, account openings, compliance programs, trading algorithms, sentiment analysis, and more. It has fueled a rapid change in the field of robo-advisers and brokerage apps.</p>
<p>Thousands and thousands of financial entities are looking to build downstream applications, relying on what is likely to be but a handful of base models upstream. A base model or data aggregator thus may send a similar signal to many individual actors, like Samantha, leading many of them to make similar decisions, like Theodore. Such network interconnectedness, such monocultures, are the classic problems that lead to systemic risk.</p>
<p>That brings me back to Samantha and Her. Imagine it wasn't Scarlett Johansson, but it was some base model or some data source on which 8,316 financial institutions were relying. That's what we may face in finance. Thus, if they go offline or they send a signal that everybody relies upon, AI may play a central role in the after-action reports of a future financial crisis.</p>
<p>The challenges to financial stability that AI may pose in the future will require a lot of new thinking. Regulators, market participants, I believe, need to think about what it means to have the dependencies of potentially 8,316 brokenhearted financial institutions on an AI model or data aggregator.</p>
<p>Let's do our best to keep that heartbreak out of our capital markets.</p>

<title>FinCEN Publishes Beneficial Ownership Reporting Outreach And Education Toolkit</title>

<div> requirements, FinCEN, toolkit, small business owners, reporting
Summary:
FinCEN issues toolkit for small businesses to understand and comply with reporting requirements. Filing is free, quick, and not an annual requirement.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury&rsquo;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has issued another&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fincen.gov/boi/toolkit">resource</a>&nbsp;to familiarize small business owners with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fincen.gov/boi">beneficial ownership reporting</a>&nbsp;requirements. These reporting requirements are mandated by the Corporate Transparency Act, a bipartisan law enacted to curb illicit finance by supporting law enforcement efforts. This law requires many small businesses to report basic information to the Federal government about the real people who ultimately own or control them.</p>
<p>The toolkit contains templates and sample content that has been structured to allow private, public, and non-profit organizations to share and amplify this important information. The toolkit includes general background on the reporting requirements, as well as templates for newsletters, websites, and emails; sample social media posts and images; and information on how to contact FinCEN.</p>
<p>The toolkit furthers FinCEN&rsquo;s outreach efforts to inform small businesses of the reporting requirements. To date, FinCEN has issued&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fincen.gov/boi/small-entity-compliance-guide">guidance</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fincen.gov/boi-faqs">FAQs</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@fincentreasury" rel="noopener" target="_blank">videos</a>, and other materials to make compliance as easy as possible. In addition, senior FinCEN officials&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/august-2024-beneficial-ownership-reporting-outreach-activities-and-preview">continue to meet</a>&nbsp;with small business owners and other key stakeholders nationwide to help small businesses fulfill their reporting requirements.</p>
<p>Filing is quick, secure, and free of charge. It is not an annual requirement&mdash;unless a company needs to update or correct information, it only needs to file once. FinCEN expects that most companies will be able to file without the help of an attorney or accountant, and that the filing process for those with simple ownership structures may take 20 minutes or less. Companies that existed before 2024 have until January 1, 2025 to file, while companies created or registered in 2024 must file within 90 days of receiving creation/registration notice. More information, along with FinCEN&rsquo;s E-Filing System, is available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fincen.gov/boi">https://www.fincen.gov/boi</a>.</p>

<div> enforcement actions, OCC, national banks, federal savings associations, individuals<br />
Summary:<br />
OCC released enforcement actions against banks and individuals. Actions relate to unsafe practices, financial crimes, and theft of bank funds. <div>
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today released enforcement actions taken against national banks and federal savings associations (banks), and individuals currently and formerly affiliated with banks the OCC supervises.</p>
<p>The OCC uses enforcement actions against banks to require the board of directors and management to take timely actions to correct the deficient practices or violations identified. Actions taken against banks are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span><a href="https://www.occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/eaAA-CE-2024-62.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Formal Agreement</a>&nbsp;with First Federal Savings Bank of Kentucky,</span>&nbsp;Frankfort, Kentucky, for unsafe or unsound practices, including those related to strategic planning and budgeting, succession planning, liquidity risk management, and interest rate risk management. (Docket No. AA-CE-2024-62)</li>
<li><span><a href="https://www.occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/eaAA-ENF-2024-72.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Formal Agreement</a>&nbsp;with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.,</span>&nbsp;Sioux Falls, South Dakota, for deficiencies related to the bank&rsquo;s financial crimes risk management practices and anti-money laundering internal controls in several areas. Refer to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2024/nr-occ-2024-99.html" title="OCC Issues Enforcement Action Against Wells Fargo Bank">OCC News Release 2024-99</a>. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2024-72)</li>
</ul>
<p>The OCC uses enforcement actions against an institution-affiliated party (IAP) to deter, encourage correction of, or prevent violations, unsafe or unsound practices, or breaches of fiduciary duty. Enforcement actions against IAPs reinforce the accountability of individuals for their conduct regarding the affairs of a bank. The term &ldquo;institution-affiliated party,&rdquo; or IAP, is defined in 12 USC 1813(u) and includes bank directors, officers, employees, and controlling shareholders. Orders of Prohibition prohibit an individual from any participation in the affairs of a bank or other institution as defined in 12 USC 1818(e)(7). Actions taken against IAPs are:</p>

<title>Hello And Farewell, But Not Goodbye: Remarks At The Meeting Of The SEC Investor Advisory Committee, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, Washington D.C., Sept. 19, 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> members, fiduciary, panel, shareholders, SEC<br />
Summary: 
The SEC welcomes new and says goodbye to outgoing Investor Advisory Committee members. It discusses fiduciary duty and shareholder rights.<br />
Summary: <div>
<p>Thank you, Brian [Schorr]. And good morning and welcome to all of you, especially our six newest IAC members. Our new class of members brings a wonderfully eclectic mix of skills and experiences. Thank you for putting them at the disposal of the Investor Advisory Committee.&nbsp; Welcome Alvin, Andrea, Amy, Craig, George, and Jennifer.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-iac-091924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Today also marks the final meeting for seven sitting members whose terms expire in November:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jamila Abston-Mayfield</li>
<li>Cambria Allen-Ratzlaff</li>
<li>Brian Hellmer</li>
<li>Sandra Peters</li>
<li>Paul Sommerstad</li>
<li>Alice Stinebaugh, and</li>
<li>Joanne Yoo</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for your willingness to give us four years out of your busy lives. I have enjoyed learning from you. I hope and trust that you will, even in your post-IAC lives, reach out to me if you have suggestions about the Commission&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s agenda consists of two panels, which should allow for broad discussions involving many Committee members. The first panel relates to fiduciary duty in different contexts. The Institute for the Fiduciary Standard has dubbed September &ldquo;Fiduciary September,&rdquo; so the timing of this discussion is apt.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-iac-091924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;The fiduciary topic, though, is hot all year round. I look forward to hearing the panel&rsquo;s views on what this term means in the different contexts it is used, particularly in the provision of investment advice by SEC-registered advisers. As the Commission has explained, when the fiduciary standard applies, we are able to take a principles-based approach to regulation that allows an investment adviser latitude to use her own judgment in meeting the standard.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-iac-091924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;This principles-based approach is at the heart of the Investment Advisers Act.</p>
<p>The second panel concerns the relationship between shareholders and public companies.&nbsp; With respect to a shareholder&rsquo;s right to sue for a material misstatement or omission in a registration statement, a unanimous Supreme Court has spoken definitively regarding traceability, which is one subject of the panel.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-iac-091924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;Shareholder proposals are still very much a live issue, so I have a question for your consideration: How do we make sure that the voices of non-proposing shareholders are heard in conversations about shareholder proposal thresholds? This group of investors bears the bulk of the cost when companies spend time and management attention to deal with shareholder proposals. Non-proponent shareholders may not enjoy proportionate benefits. The proponent&rsquo;s motivation may derive not from her ownership of the company at issue, but from a concern that transcends (or is divorced from) that particular company. Thus, the benefits of her engagement with the company may not inure to the benefit of other shareholders.</p>
<p>Both panels have members with a variety of talents and views, representing practitioners, industry representatives, and theorists, all of which should lead to lively give-and-take. Thank you to Cristina Martin-Firvida, Danielle Specce, and the other dedicated staff in the Office of the Investor Advocate for making today&rsquo;s meeting possible.</p>

<div> amendments, continuous disclosure, investment funds, behavioral insights, regulatory burden
Summary:<br />The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) proposed amendments to modernize the continuous disclosure regime for investment funds, including a new Fund Report, exemptions from conflict of interest reporting, and reference to Fund Expense Ratio (FER). The CSA aims to streamline disclosure requirements and enhance the quality of information available to investors. The 120-day comment period is open until January 17, 2025. The CSA is also making minor revisions to the simplified prospectus form. The British Columbia Securities Commission (BCSC) is not publishing the proposed amendments for comment at this time, with anticipation of doing so following the provincial general election. <div>
<p>The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) have published for comment a series of proposed amendments aimed at modernizing the continuous disclosure regime for investment funds. These proposals are designed to provide investors with more focused and valuable disclosure while reducing the regulatory burden on investment fund managers.</p>
<p>The CSA proposes to replace the existing annual and interim Management Report of Fund Performance (MRFP) with a new annual and interim Fund Report. The proposed Fund Report was developed using behavioural insights research, which provides information on how people think, behave and make decisions. This included carrying out rigorous investor testing aimed at comparing the effectiveness of several alternative proposed versions of the Fund Report against a sample MRFP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These amendments reflect our commitment to ensuring that investors have access to disclosure that includes appropriate information that is more likely to be read and understood and is easier to apply when making investment decisions,&rdquo; said Stan Magidson, CSA Chair and Chair and CEO of the Alberta Securities Commission. &ldquo;By streamlining disclosure requirements, we aim to reduce the regulatory burden on investment fund managers while enhancing the overall quality of information available to investors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two other continuous disclosure-related proposals being made are to:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide exemptions from certain conflict of interest reporting requirements in securities legislation if other similar requirements are satisfied.</li>
<li>Eliminate some required class- or series-level disclosures from investment fund financial statements that are not required by International Financial Reporting Standards.</li>
</ul>
<p>The CSA is also making two additional proposals to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reference the term Fund Expense Ratio (FER), which combines the management expense ratio and the trading expense ratio of an investment fund, in the Fund Facts and the ETF Facts.</li>
<li>Make minor editorial and other revisions to the simplified prospectus form (SP Form).</li>
</ul>
<p>The CSA invites comments on these proposals, which can be found on CSA members&rsquo; websites. The 120-day comment period closes on January 17, 2025.</p>
<p>The investor testing report that outlines the results of the behavioural insights research is being published separately and can be accessed on the CSA Secretariat&rsquo;s website and the websites of some CSA members.</p>
<p>The British Columbia Securities Commission (BCSC) is not publishing the proposed amendments for comment at this time. BCSC Staff anticipate doing so following the British Columbia provincial general election.</p>
<p>The CSA, the council of the securities regulators of Canada&rsquo;s provinces and territories, co-ordinates and harmonizes regulation for the Canadian capital markets.</p>

<title>ISDA Publishes Results Of DC Review Consultation</title>

<div> Consultation, Credit Derivatives Determinations Committees, Governance, Transparency, Market support
<br />
Establishing a separate governance body, appointing independent members, reducing the number of dealer and non-dealer members, transparency proposals, and market support for changes.
<br /><br />Summary: 
-Establish separate governance body
-Appoint up to 3 independent members
-Reduce dealer/non-dealer members
-Transparency proposals
-Market support for changes <div>
<p>ISDA has published the results of a market-wide consultation on proposed changes to the structure and governance of the Credit Derivatives Determinations Committees (DCs).</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://assets.isda.org/media/30e17e83/9d6c7ae2.pdf">consultation, conducted by Boston Consulting Group (BCG)</a>, was based on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/a/lS1gE/DC-Review-Report-042924.pdf">recommendations proposed by Linklaters LLP</a>&nbsp;as part of an independent review on the composition, functioning, governance and membership of the DCs. This is the latest in a series of steps to identify amendments that could be made to improve the structure of the DCs and maintain their integrity in changing economic and market conditions.</p>
<p>The consultation indicates there is broad market support to implement many of the recommendations, including establishing a separate governance body, implementing certain transparency proposals relating to the publication of DC decisions and appointing up to three independent members of the DCs. Some of the proposals received a significant minority of objections, indicating that more industry input would be required to address the concerns raised. ISDA will work with its members to identify a package of practical changes that can be made to the DC rules and will present them to the DCs, which are solely responsible for agreeing and implementing any amendments.</p>
<p>The measures that were consulted on include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establish a separate governance body, with responsibility for overseeing the operation of the DCs (including reporting to market participants and obtaining feedback from them) and making changes to the DC rules from time to time (in lieu of the DCs).</li>
<li>Allow the governance body to appoint independent auditors to audit DC members&rsquo; compliance procedures under the DC rules.</li>
<li>Reduce the number of dealer members of the DCs to eight and the number of non-dealer members to four (in addition to central counterparties and any independent members).</li>
<li>Reduce the eligibility threshold to serve as a non-dealer DC member from the current $1 billion in credit default swap (CDS) notional outstanding referencing a single reference entity.</li>
<li>Allow non-dealers to volunteer for membership of individual DCs, rather than having to join all the DCs.</li>
<li>Remove the provisions relating to consultative dealer and non-dealer members.</li>
<li>Allow eligible market participants to present statements of case within certain parameters.</li>
<li>Require the DCs and the DC secretary to provide adequate reasons (stated on the DC website) for all material decisions they take.</li>
<li>Disclose any material step taken in the DC process (including any request to convene a DC, any statement of case submitted, and any public information provided or obtained by the DC in connection with a DC question) on the DC website as soon as is reasonably practical.</li>
<li>Appoint up to three independent members of the DCs (with one acting as DC chairperson).</li>
<li>Enhance the minimum requirements on DC members&rsquo; compliance procedures.</li>
<li>Enable the DCs, by a simple majority, to refer DC questions to an independent panel for a decision.</li>
<li>Develop a new model to adequately fund the operations of the DCs and the other solutions for addressing the other recommended changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;The consultation showed there is broad market support for key changes that will improve the governance, efficiency and transparency of the DC process. The DCs are a critical part of the CDS markets and making these changes will ensure they continue to function robustly. ISDA will now work with industry participants and policymakers over the next year to put flesh on the bones of these proposals to show how they can be implemented in practice, before presenting these solutions to the DCs,&rdquo; said Scott O&rsquo;Malia, ISDA&rsquo;s Chief Executive.</p>
<p>The DCs were introduced in 2009 as a centralized decision-making body to enable a standardized auction settlement process and ensure central clearing could be implemented for CDS. Although ISDA does not control the DC rules and is not involved in the decision-making process or administration of the committees, ISDA has an interest as a global trade association for over-the-counter derivatives in ensuring the DCs continue to function robustly.</p>
<p>The DCs are industry committees currently comprising up to 10 sell-side and five buy-side voting firms. More information about the DCs and the decision-making process is available on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdsdeterminationscommittees.org/">DC website</a>.</p>

<title>Bank Of England - Asset Purchase Facility: Gilt Sales – Market Notice 19 September 2024</title>

<div> auctions, gilts, Bank, maturity sectors, sales <br />
Summary: The MPC will reduce the stock of gilts held in the APF by £100 billion and will schedule auctions to evenly reduce gilts across maturity sectors.<br /> <div>
<h4>Market Notice&nbsp;</h4>
<p>At its September 2024 meeting, the MPC voted to reduce the stock of gilts held in the APF by &pound;100 billion over the period from October 2024 to September 2025, to a total of &pound;558 billion.</p>
<p>The Bank set out in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/market-notices/2022/september/apf-gilt-sales-market-notice-1-september-2022">consolidated APF gilt sales Market Notice</a>&nbsp;published on 1 September 2022 that it would publish a quarterly schedule for the sales of gilts held in the APF for monetary policy purposes. The details and schedule for the Q4 2024 sales of such gilts are set out in this Market Notice, which covers the period from 7 October 2024 to the week commencing 21 October 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As set out in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/market-notices/2023/december/apf-gilt-sales-market-notice-15-december-2023">15 December 2023 Market Notice</a>, the Bank will set a schedule of auctions in order to continue to reduce the APF as evenly as possible across maturity sectors, measured in initial proceeds terms. The maturity sectors are defined as gilts with a residual maturity of between: 3-7 years (short), 7-20 years (medium) and over 20 years (long).</p>
<p>The Bank will continue to hold auctions in each quarter over the next twelve months. However, due to the high amount of gilt holdings that are maturing throughout the year, a lower number of auctions is required in each quarter to meet the MPC&rsquo;s target reduction of the APF, compared to previous years. The Bank will schedule these auctions towards the start of each quarter.</p>
<p>To reduce the APF as evenly as possible across maturity sectors, measured in initial proceeds terms, over the year, the size and number of auctions will vary across maturity sectors in each quarter. The Bank expects to hold one auction in each of the maturity sectors in each of the first three quarters, while the final quarter (Q3 2025) is likely to consist of only short and medium maturity sector auctions, depending on the movement in gilt prices and the realised distribution of sales throughout the year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accordingly, in Q4 2024, the Bank will sell short maturity sector bonds across one auction of &pound;800 million, medium maturity sector bonds across one auction of &pound;750 million, and long maturity sector bonds across one auction of &pound;600 million. Further details are outlined in the table below.</p>
<p>Other than as amended in this Market Notice, the detailed operational parameters and participation requirements set out previously will apply to these gilt sales.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bank will continue to monitor the impact of its gilt sales programme on market conditions, and reserves the right to amend its schedule, including the gilts to be sold and the size of its auctions, or any other aspect of its approach at its sole discretion.</p>
<p>The Bank expects to announce the sales schedule for Q1 2025 at 4.30pm on 20 December 2024.</p>

<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published its Q2 2024 quarterly Risk Dashboard (RDB), which discloses aggregated statistical information for the largest EU/EEA institutions.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>EU/EEA banks&rsquo; return on equity (RoE) remained nearly unchanged on a yearly basis, reaching 10.9%, 10bps lower than one year ago. On a quarterly basis the RoE increased by 30bps, mainly driven by a rise in other operating income.</li>
<li>The net interest margin (NIM) declined slightly (1.68% in Q2 vs. 1.69% in Q1, 1.60% one year ago), indicating that it might have reached its peak in Q1 2024. As volume growth could not compensate for the negative impact from the NIM, net interest income declined slightly on a quarterly basis.</li>
<li>EU/EEA banks&rsquo; common equity tier&nbsp;1 (CET1) ratio rose on a fully loaded basis by 10bps to 16.1% in Q2 2024. The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) similarly rose in the second quarter (from 161.7% to 163.2% and from 127.3% to 127.8%, respectively). In the LCR&rsquo;s numerator, the share of cash and reserves held by EU/EEA banks further decreased, while the share of central government assets increased.</li>
<li>Loans to households and non-financial corporates slightly increased over the quarter. Sovereign exposures increased since the end of last year by around EUR&nbsp;200bn (+5.5%), accompanied by a rise of the share of exposures recognised at fair value, and a rise of the share of shorter-term maturities. The non-performing loan (NPL) ratio remained stable at 1.9%, with material divergences across segments.</li>

<div> Securities and Exchange Commission, Investor Advisory Committee, fiduciary obligations, investment advisers, shareholder proposals
<br />
Summary:<br />
SEC Chair speaks to Committee about fiduciary duty and shareholder proposals, emphasizing the importance of aligning interests of advisers and shareholders. <div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Good morning. I am pleased to speak with the Investor Advisory Committee. As is customary, I&rsquo;d like to note that my views are my own as Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and I am not speaking on behalf of my fellow Commissioners or the staff.</p>
<p>I want to thank the Committee members who will be leaving in November. We as a Commission have benefitted from your insights, and I wish you all the best.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also like to welcome the new members to the Committee. I thank each of you for your willingness to serve, and for providing the Commission with important perspectives on behalf of investors.</p>
<p>I understand you will have two discussions today, one with regards to investment advisers&rsquo; fiduciary obligations, and another with regards to investors&rsquo; shareholder proposals and Section 11 claims.</p>
<p>One hundred years ago, in 1924, Edward Leffler, a salesman of pots and pans, invented the mutual fund. After the stock market crash of 1929 and in the midst of the Great Depression, Congress asked the then-newly formed SEC for recommendations dealing with risks in this new field.</p>
<p>In 1940, SEC Commissioner Robert Healy told Congress that, left unchecked, these risks and conflicts had produced a &ldquo;shocking&rdquo; number of abuses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too often, investment trusts and investment companies were organized and operated as adjuncts to the business of the supervisors and insiders to advance their personal interest at the expense of and to the detriment of their stockholders,&rdquo; Healy said. He added, &ldquo;It is perhaps not too much to say that the disregard of fiduciary standards lies at the root of many investment company problems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In response, Congress passed the Investment Advisers Act, establishing duties of care and loyalty to clients of investment advisers. Twenty years later, the Supreme Court addressed fiduciary duty in the seminal 1963 case,<i>&nbsp;SEC v. Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc.</i><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-iac-091924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>While today&rsquo;s panel is focused on differences between fiduciary obligations under various federal and state laws, there is a common theme across all these fiduciary standards. To put it plainly, fiduciary duty comes down to an obligation to put the interests of clients ahead of the investment adviser. Here at the SEC, we are committed to holding advisers accountable for meeting that standard.</p>
<p>I understand the Committee also will discuss shareholder proposals and Section 11 claims under the Securities Act of 1933.</p>
<p>I think President Roosevelt and Congress understood the importance of aligning the interests of managers with those of shareholders in crafting the federal securities laws and the SEC to oversee them.</p>
<p>When shareholders buy stock in a public company, they own a piece of the company, which comes with certain rights under state law. That includes the right to elect directors to the company&rsquo;s board and the right to make proposals to the management team for consideration by fellow shareholders.</p>
<p>In the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Congress included provisions about shareholder participation in the proxy process. For decades, there have been debates about which shareholder proposals must be included in the proxy for consideration by other shareholders and which can be excluded.</p>
<p>In 1942, the SEC first adopted a version of what is now Rule 14a-8, and it has been amended from time to time since. In essence, the existing rule outlines the 13 substantive bases on which companies may exclude shareholder proposals from their proxy materials.</p>
<p>With regards to the Committee&rsquo;s discussion of Section 11 claims, I would like to emphasize that this Section is an important part of our federal securities law architecture. In Section 11 of the &rsquo;33 Act, Congress imposed on directors and officers liability for inaccurate registration statements. These gatekeepers provide an essential function to police fraud and ensure the accuracy of disclosure to investors.</p>
<p>I thank the Committee and their panelists for contributing on these matters.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Advisory Firm Macquarie Investment Management Business Trust With Fraud - Firm To Pay Nearly $80 Million In Connection With Overvaluing Assets And Engaging In Unlawful Cross Trades</title>

<div> settlement, overvaluation, collateralized mortgage obligations, cross trades, retail mutual funds
<br />
Registered investment adviser MIMBT to pay $79.8 million for overvaluing CMOs and favoring certain clients in cross trades. SEC investigation ongoing.
<br />
Summary: <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced registered investment adviser Macquarie Investment Management Business Trust (MIMBT) will pay a total of $79.8 million to settle charges for overvaluing approximately 4,900 largely illiquid collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) held in 20 advisory accounts, including 11 retail mutual funds, and for executing hundreds of cross trades between advisory clients that favored certain clients over others.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, from January 2017 through April 2021, MIMBT managed the Absolute Return Mortgage-Backed Securities strategy, a fixed-income investment strategy primarily invested in mortgage-backed securities, CMOs, and treasury futures. Strategy investments included thousands of smaller-sized, &ldquo;odd lot&rdquo; CMO positions that traded at a discount to institutional, larger-sized positions. MIMBT valued the odd lot CMOs using prices obtained from a third-party pricing service that were intended for institutional lots only. The pricing service did not provide separate valuations for odd lots.&nbsp; The order finds that MIMBT had no reasonable basis to believe it could sell the odd lot CMOs at the pricing vendor&rsquo;s valuations, and thousands of odd lot CMO positions were marked at inflated prices. This resulted in MIMBT overstating the performance of client accounts holding the overvalued CMOs.</p>
<p>The order further finds that MIMBT attempted to minimize losses to redeeming investors by arranging cross trades with affiliated accounts, rather than selling the overvalued CMOs into the market. In one instance, MIMBT executed 465 internal cross trades between a selling account and 11 retail mutual funds above independent current market prices. These trades resulted in the retail mutual funds absorbing losses that otherwise would have been borne by the selling account in a market sale. MIMBT also arranged for approximately 175 dealer-interposed cross trades in which MIMBT temporarily sold odd lot CMO positions to third-party broker-dealers and then repurchased those same positions for allocation to one or more affiliated client accounts, providing liquidity to redeeming investors in an otherwise illiquid market, often at above-market prices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is alarming that a fiduciary took advantage of retail mutual funds it advised and executed unlawful cross trades to mitigate its overvaluation of fund assets,&rdquo; said Eric I. Bustillo, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Miami Regional Office. &ldquo;Utilizing a third-party pricing service does not negate an investment adviser&rsquo;s obligation to value assets accurately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that MIMBT violated the antifraud and compliance provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and certain provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, MIMBT agreed to a censure, to cease and desist from further violations of the charged provisions, and to pay a $70 million penalty and disgorgement and prejudgment interest, totaling an additional $9.8 million. MIMBT also agreed to comply with certain undertakings, including retaining a compliance consultant to conduct a comprehensive review of its policies and procedures relating to, among other things, valuation of CMOs and associated liquidity risks, and cross trading.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s ongoing investigation is being conducted by Christine Lynch and Crystal Ivory, under the supervision of Jessica M. Weissman, Fernando Torres, and Glenn S. Gordon, of the SEC&rsquo;s Miami Regional Office.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Advisory Firm Inspire Investing With Misleading Investors Regarding Its Investment Strategy</title>

<div> charged, misleading statements, compliance failures, investment adviser, SEC
Summary:
Inspire Investing charged by SEC for misleading statements and compliance failures in its investment strategy, fined $300,000 and ordered to retain a compliance consultant. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Idaho-based investment adviser Inspire Investing LLC with making misleading statements and for compliance failures related to the execution of its &ldquo;biblically responsible investing&rdquo; strategy.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, Inspire Investing represented that it used a data-driven methodology to evaluate companies and that it would not invest in companies that had &ldquo;any degree of participation&rdquo; in certain enumerated business practices that Inspire determined did not align with biblical values. However, the SEC&rsquo;s order finds, from at least 2019 to March 2024, Inspire Investing in fact relied on a manual research process and did not typically perform research on individual companies to evaluate them for eligibility under its investing criteria. According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, Inspire Investing also lacked written policies and procedures setting forth a process for evaluating companies&rsquo; activities as part of its investment process, which at times resulted in inconsistent application of its investment criteria. As a result, Inspire Investing invested in companies engaged in activities that did not align with Inspire Investing&rsquo;s own stated criteria and in which the advisory firm represented that it would not invest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Investors must be able to rely on advisers acting consistently with their represented investment process or strategy,&rdquo; said Corey Schuster, Co-Chief of the Asset Management Unit in the Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;Here, Inspire Investing&rsquo;s investment screening process was not what it represented to investors, resulting in it making investments that were contrary to its stated investment criteria.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inspire Investing consented to the entry of the SEC&rsquo;s order finding that it violated the antifraud provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, Inspire Investing agreed to a censure and cease-and-desist order, to pay a $300,000 penalty, and to retain an independent compliance consultant.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Jonathan I. Katz, with assistance from Joan Price, and was supervised by Jeffrey A. Shank, Mr. Schuster, and Andrew Dean of the Enforcement Division&rsquo;s Asset Management Unit.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Financial inclusion and growth need not be mutually exclusive.</li>
<li>There cannot be genuine financial inclusion without digital inclusion.</li>
<li>This will require a change in mindset, a different conversation about risk and innovation, and a systemwide effort - not just for government and regulators, but also for employers and schools.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>It&rsquo;s great to be here for my second time at&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.stepchange.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">StepChange<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>. Thank you Vikki for inviting me and for all you and your team do to protect vulnerable consumers.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m delighted that the FCA, like StepChange, has become a major employer in Leeds. With an office on Queen Street since 2022, we are now expanding by a further 100 colleagues - up from 225 today.</p>
<p>It has transformed how we engage with StepChange and the financial community here up North. And what better backdrop for today than the stunning Aspire building?</p>
<p>As you entered, you might have spotted the blue plaque commemorating this building as the Yorkshire Penny Bank Head Office. A bank founded by Colonel Edward Akroyd in the mid-1800s. His vision? Let anyone open an account &ndash; even with a penny.</p>
<p>When the Victorian working class faced crushing poverty and little hope, Akroyd offered something revolutionary - financial inclusion for all:</p>
<ul>
<li>He promoted financial literacy, opening the world&rsquo;s first school bank to inspire healthy financial habits.</li>
<li>He established a pension scheme, supporting workers&rsquo; financial resilience.&nbsp;</li>
<li>And above all, he listened to customers, introducing cheque books for tradesmen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Akroyd grasped that financial inclusion isn&rsquo;t just a moral issue, but also an economic one.</p>
<p>Today, I would like to explore the links between financial inclusion and growth. And the idea that financial inclusion, approached thoughtfully, can actually catalyse productivity and growth.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The FCA&rsquo;s work to support consumers</h2>
<p>Before I do, let me talk about the FCA&rsquo;s support for consumers over a tough few years.</p>
<p>In April, I visited&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://moneyadvicetrust.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Money Advice Trust<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;in Birmingham. I spoke with advisers, listened to calls, directly hearing the pressure some consumers face. And while regulation can&rsquo;t insulate consumers from economic stress, we hope the FCA has helped mitigate the worst impacts.</p>
<p>During the pandemic we introduced temporary Guidance, making clear how lenders could support customers in difficulty. Guidance that is now incorporated into rules, permanently strengthening protections.</p>
<p>And in May, we&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-fines-hsbc-6-million-over-treatment-customers-financial-difficulty" title="FCA fines HSBC &pound;6.2 million over treatment of customers in financial difficulty">fined HSBC &pound;6.2m</a>&nbsp;for historic failures in treatment of customers in arrears or difficulty, and ensured that 1.5 million of their customers were compensated by around &pound;185m.</p>
<p>Our price cap introduced in 2015 for high-cost short-term credit saved consumers around &pound;150m per year, and we have simplified overdraft charges and tackled high unarranged overdraft fees, saving consumers nearly &pound;1 billion.</p>
<p>In 2023, we banned debt advice providers from receiving&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/financial-watchdog-bans-referral-fees-debt-packagers-help-struggling-consumers" title="Financial watchdog bans referral fees for debt packagers to help struggling consumers ">referral fees</a>&nbsp;from debt solution providers. Thanks to StepChange for your valuable input.</p>
<p>This stopped egregious business models that incentivised debt packagers to recommend options that made them more money, rather than serving customer interests. The ban will save consumers thousands in unnecessary fees and ensure they receive better advice.</p>
<p>Let me also be clear. We want a credit market that serves a wide range of people; affordable credit helps consumers manage finances and short-term or unexpected cash flow issues.</p>
<p>So we continue to work with the Government and&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://fair4allfinance.org.uk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fair4All Finance<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;on initiatives for consumers who struggle to access credit.</p>
<p>Our most recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/financial-lives/jan-2024-recontact-survey-summary" title="Financial Lives cost of living (Jan 2024) recontact survey - Summary">Financial Lives Survey</a>&nbsp;showed that almost a third of adults had used Deferred Payment Credit &ndash; or &lsquo;Buy Now Pay Later&rsquo; - in the year to January 2024. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite not yet regulating BNPL firms, we have already secured changes to unfair contract terms and warned firms about misleading advertising, and stand ready to make new rules once the law allows us to.</p>
<p>As you can see, we are using all the tools at our disposal, but ultimately need to tackle the root causes which prompted this regulatory activity. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Consumer Duty and Call for Input</h2>
<p>That is where the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/consumer-duty" title="Consumer Duty">Consumer Duty</a>&nbsp;comes in.</p>
<p>Unabashedly focused on good consumer outcomes. Putting the onus on firms to communicate well and be proactive, innovative and data-driven &ndash; responsive to vulnerable customers&rsquo; needs. Providing protections that enable consumers to take responsibility for their decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>StepChange and other consumer organisations supported the Duty, and we will maintain ongoing dialogue about its impact on credit and debt advice markets.</p>
<p>The Consumer Duty entails a change in philosophy and fewer new rules. &nbsp;</p>
<p>With it now fully in force, it is timely to consider whether there are rules we should review to reduce burdens and duplication, delivering good outcomes whilst maintaining appropriate protection. Acknowledging tensions between the prescription previously necessary, and what a fast-digitising financial services market now requires.</p>
<p>To explore this, we launched a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/calls-input/review-fca-requirements-following-introduction-consumer-duty" title="Review of FCA requirements following the introduction of the Consumer Duty">Call for Input</a>&nbsp;in July and would welcome your feedback by the end of October.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Financial inclusion and growth</h2>
<p>Alongside that launch, we reported on our new secondary international competitiveness and growth objective.</p>
<p>So how do we reconcile this objective with consumer protection, market integrity, competition and goals like financial inclusion? &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />We are proud of the FCA&rsquo;s work over recent years to support consumers.</p>
<p>We must now go further and look at fixing the foundations of our economy and financial system that made these interventions necessary.</p>
<p>Take financial inclusion. Published research suggests a causal link - it appears both ways - between improving financial inclusion and economic growth. To date, this research has been limited and focussed on developing economies.</p>
<p>But improving financial inclusion and capability can help mitigate barriers to, and possibly catalyse, growth. Links between over-indebtedness and mental health can impair productivity at work or even leave people unable to work.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.moneyandmentalhealth.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Money and Mental Health Policy Institute<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;have argued these issues can be long-lasting, with not just devastating human costs, but avoidable taxpayer costs too.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://web-archive.oecd.org/temp/2021-11-14/613888-supporting-financial-resilience-and-transformation-through-digital-financial-literacy.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">G20/ OECD-INFE<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;report argues that greater individual and household resilience can contribute to national economic resilience and economic development.</p>
<p>And some evidence suggests economic growth and wealth creation can in turn bolster financial inclusion. Singapore tops the Global Financial Inclusion Index - a successful global financial centre and financially inclusive economy can go hand-in-hand.</p>
<p>Noting the caveats inherent in such indices, the UK lags in 7th place, despite hosting the second largest global financial centre. So there appears to be a link between higher economic growth and increasing financial inclusion, with gaps in our understanding of how that link works and its direction.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s further interesting work to be done to inform the debate.</p>
<h2>Change in mindset and a new conversation about risk</h2>
<p>But a fundamental change in mindset will be needed.</p>
<p>Focusing not just on products, but on what customers actually need and putting systems in place that deliver those in the long term.</p>
<p>For example, through our recent work on the provision of banking services, we pressed firms to build greater awareness of Basic Bank Accounts, and make the application journey easier. To reduce the estimated 1.1 million people without a bank account. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/new-fca-rules-protect-access-cash-already-having-impact" title="New FCA rules to protect access to cash already having an impact">new rules</a>&nbsp;came into force requiring banks and building societies to assess and fill gaps in cash access &ndash; a concern for the 3 million people relying on cash for most, or all, purchases.</p>
<p>But what we cannot change is the rapid shift towards digital payments.</p>
<p><a class="ext" href="https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">UK Finance<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;project cash will constitute just 6% of payments by 2033 and FCA research indicates it is likely that more than half of UK adults now use digital wallets, up from 14% in 2017. So while access to bank accounts and cash is important, what we&rsquo;re hearing now and what the City Minister reinforced last week, is that it&rsquo;s also about access to wider services, including savings and credit products.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about access to what you need to live your life. And these needs are not static. As markets digitise, what is needed to be a full economic participant will keep changing.</p>
<p>So to sustain a growing economy, and if we want a step change in financial inclusion, we will need to adapt too. That will require:</p>
<ul>
<li>a willingness to take more risk and to experiment, accepting that not every idea will work</li>
<li>and a determination from everyone with a part to play to improve outcomes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Financial literacy and education</h2>
<p>This will involve tackling the root causes of financial exclusion, not just symptoms.</p>
<p>Without a sustained commitment to financial and digital literacy alongside numeracy, we face an uphill battle. As consistently highlighted by many, including the&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.ft.com/ft-seasonal-appeal" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FT&rsquo;s Financial Literacy and Inclusion Campaign<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>, and in the last Parliament, the Education Select Committee issued a significant report on financial education.</p>
<p>It shone a light on how children use money at ever younger ages, and their vulnerability to online marketing.</p>
<p>Financial apps are now available for children as young as 6, whilst 8% of 13-16 year olds own high risk cryptoassets, sometimes confusing gambling, trading, investing and entertainment.</p>
<p>Submissions to the Committee unanimously argued that financial education in English schools is inadequate and must be improved urgently. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A problem amplified by 40% of school leavers not passing GSCE Maths this year, and 1 in 7 16-24 year olds not in education or employment - the highest level of inactivity for a decade. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In short - effective financial education needs to begin early. Potentially even at primary level, as the Select Committee called for, and should now be considered in the Government&rsquo;s curriculum review.</p>
<p>With its financial literacy levels, it is no surprise that Singapore scores as highly as it does on financial inclusion, showing an economic dividend. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So as one commentator said this week &ndash; we simply cannot afford a lost generation. But that&rsquo;s not to say financial education begins and ends in the classroom.</p>
<p>The UK scores weakly in the Global Financial Inclusion Index on employer support with only 7% of firms having a mature approach to financial wellbeing.</p>
<p>Auto-enrolment has been impactful. 85% of eligible private sector employees participate in workplace pensions, up from 41% in 2012. Good progress, and the FCA is working with the Government on its pensions review. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But should we go further?&nbsp;Take workplace saving.</p>
<p><a class="ext" href="https://www.nestinsight.org.uk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NEST Insight<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;has been assessing workplace savings auto-enrolment trials. An opt-out approach &ndash; where employees automatically start saving unless they actively decline &ndash; led to numbers of savers increasing by around 50%.</p>
<p>Such schemes were also almost universally approved of, 93% respondents liked them. With an estimated 1 in 3 working age people not having access to &pound;1000 of cash savings to help with unexpected life events, this could be a game changer.</p>
<p>Any reforms would need to be balanced with the risk of overburdening employers, but the data suggests a huge potential for appropriately-backed schemes to help promote a saving culture at scale.</p>
<p>Even opt-in schemes may bolster engagement, as a major supermarket has reportedly found with its new workplace savings app. And as financial education is something that continues throughout life, we know that the advice and guidance market in the UK does not work well.</p>
<p>Working with Government, it is our hope to reform the system so consumers get the help they want, when they need it, and at an affordable cost. This could improve support for making pension decisions or choices with long-term savings and investments.</p>
<h2>The demonisation of digitisation</h2>
<p>But financial literacy won&rsquo;t be enough &ndash; digital literacy, and inclusion too, help secure financial inclusion.</p>
<p>Just as Colonel Akroyd adapted to tradesmen&rsquo;s needs by introducing cheques centuries ago, we must recognise that to be included financially, requires inclusion digitally.</p>
<p>That means access to devices and data, and the confidence to use them. Yet&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/about-ofcom/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ofcom<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;statistics show that around 1.5 million households didn&rsquo;t have broadband as of March 2023, with lower-income and financially vulnerable households being least likely to have internet access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And only around 5% of the 4 million households estimated to be eligible for broadband social tariffs had actually taken them up.</p>
<p>Could financial services providers be more active in nudging customers towards a social tariff? What about employers? &nbsp;Or public service providers?</p>
<p>While those who can&rsquo;t use digital services need to be supported, they need not remain digitally excluded.</p>
<p>India&rsquo;s unique biometric ID system &lsquo;Aadhaar&rsquo; has enabled over 85% of India's underserved communities access financial services through Aadhaar-enabled payment systems.</p>
<p>Including through AI-powered voice access, targeting those with limited literacy and internet access.</p>
<p>The Brazilian Central Bank&rsquo;s instant payment service &lsquo;Pix&rsquo;, with free interbank transactions for millions of customers, has revolutionised financial inclusion.</p>
<p>And closer to home, the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority has a scheme with Lloyds, Vodafone and Assurant, which provides participants with a free Android tablet and six months of free mobile connectivity. This includes in-person training, helping people build the confidence to maximise their newfound digital freedom.</p>
<p>So digital inclusion can foster financial inclusion, if we take an innovative and proactive approach.</p>
<p>And we are well positioned to do so, with the UK ranked joint first globally with the US for the presence and quality of fintechs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA has already supported around 200 firms developing solutions to encourage inclusion, including Finexos, who are working on increasing availability of affordable credit, and Noggin, who produce an alternative credit score that aims to more accurately describe consumers with limited credit history.</p>
<p>In Edinburgh, one fintech told me of the benefits they had seen of anonymous chatbots providing debt advice, helping to reduce the associated stigma. We want safe and responsible use of AI to drive beneficial innovation.</p>
<p>But also an open conversation about the risks and trade-offs. For example, AI-enabled hyper-personalisation of insurance could benefit many by providing more tailored premiums, but at the same time runs the risk of rendering some customers &lsquo;uninsurable&rsquo;, or even potential discrimination. &nbsp;</p>
<p><a class="ext" href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Citizens Advice<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;have long argued for better data sharing between creditors but run into privacy concerns. The recent controversy surrounding dynamic pricing for Oasis concert tickets shows the need for vigilance. Just because something can be done, doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean the public will accept it. Not everyone will 'Roll With It'!</p>
<p>Do we accept that the risk of a few experiments failing or some people not benefiting from innovation, is outweighed by the potential benefit to the majority of consumers, and long-term growth and productivity improvements?</p>
<p>I freely admit that we don&rsquo;t yet have full estimates of the benefits of inclusion to growth and productivity. But experience elsewhere suggests that resolving foundational issues could have big impacts.</p>
<p>For example, a recent calculation by NESTA suggested that simply fixing wi-fi on trains could deliver benefits equivalent to one third of the London-Birmingham leg of HS2.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s open up this debate and be willing to experiment and learn. And that includes experimenting with our processes and rules. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Some argue that our affordability rules might discourage lending to groups who can&rsquo;t otherwise access finance - maybe even inhibiting entrepreneurs&rsquo; access to microfinance - while others suggest that more prescriptive rules would improve outcomes for consumers.</p>
<p>We will engage on these concerns, balancing rules on consumer protection and financial crime with access to basic services.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It's not surprising that when he died in 1887, 15,000 mourners paid their respects at Edward Akroyd&rsquo;s funeral, to a man who cared deeply about his fellow citizens and the morality of financial inclusion, but understood the social and economic benefits too.</p>
<p>So here today in the Aspire building, let&rsquo;s think about the kind of society and economy we aspire to. We often find ourselves dealing with the symptoms of financial exclusion. But we also need to confront the causes:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving financial literacy, and digital literacy and inclusion - from schools through to the workplace.</li>
<li>Embracing digitalisation and technological innovation.</li>
<li>And being more ready to experiment and take some measured risk to deliver better long-term economic outcomes. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>That includes the FCA being ready to rethink some of our rules and regulatory approaches, and we would ask for your support as we do.</p>
<p>Because this will require a broader coalition to work together &ndash; government, industry, regulators, schools, employers, organisations such as StepChange &ndash; with candour, determination and dynamism. Financial inclusion is not a target to be met but an evolving journey.</p>
<p>We must evolve too, working together, educating, enfranchising and empowering every single person. Because that is the way our society will thrive, our economy will grow, and how we will ultimately protect consumers in the long-term.</p>

<div> investment, Carbonfuture, CDR, ecosystem, SIX <br />
Summary: 
SIX leads Series A funding in Carbonfuture for reliable, scalable carbon removal ecosystem. Strong partnership supports new asset class expansion. <div>
<p class="lead">SIX leads the Series A funding round in Carbonfuture to jointly develop a reliable, scalable and integrity-driven durable Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) ecosystem. This strategic investment marks the entry of SIX into the growing carbon removal market and an expansion into a new asset class.</p>
<div></div>
<div class="fig"></div>
<p>Carbonfuture specializes in managing the entire lifecycle of CDR credits, from initial project support and due diligence to comprehensive digital tracking and independent third-party verification. Using its data-driven digital infrastructure, Carbonfuture provides monitoring, reporting, and verification (Carbonfuture MRV+) services to ensure the integrity, transparency, and reliability of CDR credits. By offering de-risked &nbsp;CDR credit portfolios through multi-year purchase agreements, Carbonfuture has gained the trust of both suppliers and buyers, including multiple major companies. &nbsp;Carbonfuture, founded in 2020, is headquartered in Freiburg, Germany, with offices in Zurich and San Francisco.</p>
<p>The expansion into the carbon removal market aligns with the broader strategy of SIX to expand into new asset classes and complements its recent ESG offerings. Through the strategic partnership with Carbonfuture, SIX aims to jointly develop the carbon removal ecosystem and supports Carbonfuture in scaling its infrastructure solutions. Furthermore, by providing high-quality, durable CDR credits through the Carbonfuture platform, we help our clients on their journey towards achieving &bdquo;net zero&ldquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our investment in Carbonfuture represents a significant step into an emerging new asset class, reflecting our confidence in their ability to build the essential digital infrastructure for the carbon removal market with the highest standards of integrity and scalability. Carbonfuture is the ideal partner, thanks to their unique business model that spans the entire value chain and has earned the trust of both the suppliers and buyers,&rdquo; stated Bj&oslash;rn Sibbern, Global Head Exchanges and SIX Executive Board Member.</p>
<p>Hannes Junginger-Gestrich, CEO of Carbonfuture added &ldquo;With SIX&rsquo;s support, we are expanding our Carbonfuture MRV+ solution to drive market maturity and make carbon removal more reliable, scalable, and tradable. With our future-proof and comprehensive approach, serving both the voluntary carbon market and compliance markets, Carbonfuture is uniquely positioned as the infrastructure backbone of the industry, delivering de-risked, high-quality CDR credits that companies can trust to meet their climate goals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Durable carbon removal refers to the technological process of permanently removing CO<span>2</span>&nbsp;from the atmosphere. This is achieved by locking carbon away for thousands of years in geological formations, deep ocean layers, soil, or certain other materials. It involves technologies such as Biochar Carbon Removal, Direct Air Capture and Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage, but does not include the natural absorption of CO<span>2</span>&nbsp;that occurs without human intervention. Project developers use established processes within the carbon removal market (such as independent MRV, third-party verification, and certification) to convert the CO<span>2</span>&nbsp;removed by their projects into carbon removal credits. Buyers can then purchase these credits and retire them to offset parts of their CO<span>2</span>&nbsp;footprint in order to meet their net-zero targets.</p>
<p>Carbonfuture will remain an independent venture with a significant minority investment from SIX. The Series A funding round was supported by follow-on investments from Carbonfuture&rsquo;s current investors. Further terms of the transaction have not been disclosed.</p>

<h2>Monetary Policy Summary, September 2024</h2>
<p>The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. The MPC adopts a medium-term and forward-looking approach to determine the monetary stance required to achieve the inflation target sustainably.</p>
<p>At its meeting ending on 18 September 2024, the MPC voted by a majority of 8&ndash;1 to maintain Bank Rate at 5%. One member preferred to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 4.75%. The Committee voted unanimously to reduce the stock of UK government bond purchases held for monetary policy purposes, and financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, by &pound;100 billion over the next 12 months, to a total of &pound;558 billion.</p>
<p>Monetary policy decisions have been guided by the need to squeeze persistent inflationary pressures out of the system so as to return CPI inflation to the 2% target both in a timely manner and on a lasting basis. Policy has been acting to ensure that inflation expectations remain well anchored. As set out at the time of the August Monetary Policy Report, the Committee&rsquo;s deliberations have been supported by the consideration of a range of cases, to which different probabilities and different risks can be attached.</p>
<p>In the first case, the unwinding of the global shocks that drove up inflation and the resulting fall in headline inflation should continue to feed through to weaker pay and price-setting dynamics. The persistence of inflationary pressures would therefore dissipate with a less restrictive stance of monetary policy than in other cases.</p>
<p>In the second case, a period of economic slack, in which GDP falls below potential and the labour market eases further, may be required in order for pay and price-setting dynamics to normalise fully. Domestic inflationary persistence would then be expected to fade away, owing to the opening up of slack from a more restrictive stance of monetary policy relative to the first case.</p>
<p>In the third case, the economy may be subject to structural shifts such as changes in wage and price-setting following the major supply shocks experienced over recent years. The degree of restrictiveness of monetary policy may be less than embodied in the Committee&rsquo;s latest assessment, meaning that monetary policy would have to remain tighter for longer.</p>
<p>Since the MPC&rsquo;s previous meeting, global activity growth has continued at a steady pace, although some data outturns suggest greater uncertainty around the near-term outlook. Oil prices have fallen back, reflecting in large part weaker demand. Market-implied paths for policy rates across major advanced economies have declined.</p>
<p>There has generally been limited news in UK economic indicators relative to the Committee&rsquo;s expectations in the August Monetary Policy Report. Headline GDP growth is expected to return to its underlying pace of around 0.3% per quarter in the second half of the year. Twelve-month CPI inflation was 2.2% in August, and is expected to increase to around 2&frac12;% towards the end of this year as declines in energy prices last year fall out of the annual comparison. Services consumer price inflation remained elevated at 5.6% in August. Private sector regular average weekly earnings growth declined to 4.9% in the three months to July.</p>
<p>At this meeting, the Committee voted to maintain Bank Rate at 5%.</p>
<p>In the absence of material developments, a gradual approach to removing policy restraint remains appropriate. Monetary policy will need to continue to remain restrictive for sufficiently long until the risks to inflation returning sustainably to the 2% target in the medium term have dissipated further. The Committee continues to monitor closely the risks of inflation persistence and will decide the appropriate degree of monetary policy restrictiveness at each meeting.</p>

<h2>Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 18 September 2024</h2>
<p>1: Before turning to its immediate policy decisions, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices.</p>
<h3>The international economy</h3>
<p>1: UK-weighted global GDP was estimated to have grown by 0.5% in 2024 Q2, broadly in line with the projection in the August Monetary Policy Report, and consistent with steady growth over recent quarters. US GDP had grown more strongly than had been anticipated, while GDP growth had moderated in the euro area and in China in the second quarter.</p>
<p>2: In the third quarter, euro-area GDP growth was expected to be a little weaker than had been anticipated in the August Report, and US GDP growth was expected to moderate somewhat, in line with previous expectations. Activity indicators such as PMIs suggested ongoing weakness in the manufacturing sector in both economies over recent months, while the services sector had continued to expand.</p>
<p>3: Labour market outturns in the United States had been softer in July and August relative to previous months. Unemployment in the euro area had remained low, pointing to some continuing tightness. Wage growth had continued to moderate across both regions.</p>
<p>4: Headline consumer price inflation had declined further towards central bank targets in the euro area and in the United States. In the euro area, 12-month HICP inflation had been 2.2% in August, while core inflation had ticked down to 2.8%, in line with market participants&rsquo; expectations. US CPI inflation had fallen to 2.5% in August, while core CPI inflation had remained unchanged at 3.2%, also in line with market expectations. Annual services price inflation had remained elevated in both economies, although higher frequency measures pointed to some easing over recent months.</p>
<p>5: There were tentative signs of a shift in the balance of risks to global activity towards the downside. Consistent with that, since the MPC's previous meeting, the Brent spot oil price had declined by around 6%, to $75 per barrel. Market contacts had ascribed the moves largely to weaker demand in China, as indicators of domestic demand there had continued to be soft.</p>
<h3>Monetary and financial conditions</h3>
<p>6: Since the MPC&rsquo;s previous meeting, government bond yields had fallen across major advanced economies in response to the softening in US labour market data and associated FOMC communications. Market-implied paths for policy rates across economies had generally ended the period lower. Coupled with UK data releases in that period having been largely in line with market expectations, that meant UK interest rate movements had been driven primarily by developments in the United States. Nevertheless, the UK market-implied path had fallen by less than in the United States. That had been associated with an appreciation of sterling against the dollar of 3%, which had accounted for most of the 1% increase in the sterling effective exchange rate since the previous MPC meeting.</p>
<p>7: Movements in yields across major advanced economies had been particularly pronounced early in August, alongside large moves in asset prices more generally. Market-specific factors including seasonally low market liquidity were likely to have exacerbated reactions to news. While these early August moves had unwound quickly, yields across countries had nevertheless ended the period lower. In contrast, UK equity prices had been little changed since the MPC&rsquo;s previous meeting and the S&amp;P 500 and Euro Stoxx 50 had both increased somewhat.</p>
<p>8: At its meeting on 12 September, the ECB Governing Council had reduced its key policy rate by 25 basis points, in line with market expectations. In its statement, the Governing Council had reiterated its data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach, focused on the inflation outlook and strength of policy transmission. At its meeting ending on 18 September, the FOMC was expected to reduce the federal funds rate by either 25 or 50 basis points.</p>
<p>9: In the United Kingdom, Bank Rate expectations implied by market pricing had continued to suggest that the next 25 basis point cut would occur in November. That was consistent with the Bank&rsquo;s latest Market Participants Survey (MaPS). Beyond November, while the median MaPS profile implied a slightly slower pace of reduction in Bank Rate than the market-implied path, both pointed to much more gradual reductions than were expected in the United States and to a lesser extent in the euro area.</p>
<p>10: Regarding credit conditions, it was too soon to assess fully the extent to which the Bank Rate reduction in August had passed through to the relevant saving and borrowing rates facing households and corporates. Nevertheless, as had been anticipated, mortgage rates had fallen since the MPC&rsquo;s previous meeting broadly in line with declines in risk-free reference rates.</p>
<p>11: The share of two-year fixed-rate mortgages within new secured household lending had been increasing since 2023 Q1, despite rates on these mortgages being above five-year fixed rates over this period. That had reversed the previous trend whereby longer-duration mortgage fixes had increased in popularity since 2016, probably reflecting household expectations of lower interest rates. Slow mortgage stock turnover meant that the share of five-year fixed-rate mortgages in outstanding lending had remained historically high.</p>
<p>12: Household saving preferences had also adjusted over the past year, as rates offered on time deposits had become relatively less attractive, reflecting the declines in risk-free reference rates. Deposit flows had shifted into sight deposits and ISAs, many of which were instant access. Household deposits had continued to be the main driver of aggregate sterling broad money growth. The latter had increased to 1.6% on an annual basis in July, but had remained weak by historical standards.</p>
<h3>Demand and output</h3>
<p>13: UK GDP had increased by 0.6% in 2024 Q2, 0.1 percentage points lower than had been expected in the August Monetary Policy Report. That had followed 0.7% growth in Q1, but Bank staff judged that the underlying pace of growth had been somewhat weaker during the first half of the year.</p>
<p>14: Within the expenditure components of Q2 GDP, household consumption had risen by 0.2% on the quarter, while business and housing investment had both declined by 0.1%. Real government expenditure had increased by 1.6%, and there had continued to be some evidence of greater-than-projected central government spending in recent public sector finances data.</p>
<p>15: GDP had been unchanged on the month in both July and June but had grown by 0.5% on a three-month-on-three-month basis in July. Slightly weaker-than-expected output in July had been concentrated in the manufacturing and professional services sectors.</p>
<p>16: Bank staff now expected GDP growth of 0.3% in 2024 Q3, marginally weaker than the 0.4% rate that had been incorporated in the August Report. That was broadly in line with estimates of the underlying growth rate that had been extracted from models based on a range of business survey indicators and on disaggregated GDP data. The latest intelligence from the Bank&rsquo;s Agents suggested that improving real incomes, the August Bank Rate reduction and anticipated further cuts in interest rates had underpinned improved sentiment and expectations of increased activity across most sectors around the turn of the year.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk176874140"></a>17: There had been little news from most indicators of consumer spending, although housing market data had strengthened somewhat. Retail sales volumes had been volatile, around a very gradually rising trend since the start of the year. GfK consumer confidence had been unchanged in August. Forward-looking indicators in the housing market had continued to point to a recovery in home buyer enquiries and prices, while mortgage approvals for house purchase had increased to their highest level since September 2022.</p>
<p>18: The Committee discussed the near-term outlook for activity and the evolution of the output gap. Although uncertainties surrounded this assessment, overall demand and supply were judged to have been broadly in balance over recent quarters. A continuation of the current pace of underlying GDP growth would, given the Committee&rsquo;s view of potential supply growth, be consistent with little change in the output gap through the end of this year. That path was a little stronger than the August Report projections, however, in which demand growth had been expected to slow at the end of this year and a significant margin of spare capacity had been projected to open up over time. That projection in part reflected the previously announced medium-term tightening in the stance of fiscal policy, prior to the upcoming Budget. The Committee would also continue to monitor closely how the different channels of the monetary transmission mechanism were interacting with the dynamics of the household saving ratio, and in turn the outlook for consumer demand.</p>
<h3>Supply, costs and prices</h3>
<p>19: Labour market data quality issues continued to be an area of concern. Very low achieved sample sizes meant Labour Force Survey (LFS)-based estimates of labour market dynamics remained subject to considerable uncertainties. This was making it difficult to gauge the underlying state of labour market activity. The MPC had, for some time, utilised a wide range of data to inform its judgements on the labour market, including official data, business surveys and intelligence from the Bank&rsquo;s Agents.</p>
<p>20: A Bank staff indicator model of underlying employment continued to point to growth of around 0.2% per quarter, broadly in line with population growth. There was greater dispersion among outturns from individual employment indicators. The KPMG/REC/S&amp;P Global UK Report on Jobs had continued to point to a contraction in employment while the Lloyds Business Barometer suggested an expansion.</p>
<p>21: In line with softening labour demand, vacancies had continued to fall back gradually, although at a slower pace than in 2023 and they had remained above pre-pandemic levels. The REC Report and Agents&rsquo; intelligence signalled a continued easing in recruitment difficulties, with the latter suggesting improved job retention in some sectors. The vacancies-to-unemployment ratio had returned to its pre-pandemic average at the start of 2024 Q2. A Bank staff indicator model suggested that underlying unemployment had increased steadily over the past few quarters, in contrast to more volatile LFS data.</p>
<p>22: Indicators of households&rsquo; inflation expectations had largely normalised to close to their historical averages. The Bank of England/Ipsos Inflation Attitudes Survey&rsquo;s measure of median short-term inflation expectations had fallen to 2.7% in August. The corresponding measure of medium-term expectations had remained close to, but below, its historical average. The Citi/YouGov indicator of households&rsquo; short-term inflation expectations had increased slightly to 3.1% in August from 2.7% previously, possibly owing to media reports of a rise in the Ofgem utility price cap in October. Businesses&rsquo; own price expectations, as reported in the DMP Survey, had remained at slightly more elevated levels, although on a continued downward path.</p>
<p>23: This normalisation in inflation expectations, as well as, to a lesser extent, the easing in labour market tightness, had supported continued moderation in pay growth. Annual private sector regular average weekly earnings growth had eased to 4.9% in the three months to July from 5.3% in the three months to June, broadly in line with August Monetary Policy Report projections. Other surveys suggested that wage growth would continue to moderate, although remain above inflation target-consistent levels, with the DMP Survey indicating a fall to approximately 4% over the next year. The latest Agents&rsquo; intelligence indicated that pay settlements over the second half of the year were, as expected, coming in at lower rates compared to H1, and 2025-expected settlements might be in a 2 to 4% range. There remained the possibility of some upside risk to pay growth depending on the trajectory of the National Living Wage (NLW) in the first half of next year.</p>
<p>24: Twelve-month CPI inflation had been 2.2% in August and July, slightly lower than August Report expectations. Consumer core goods and food price inflation had remained subdued as the cost pressures from previous global shocks had unwound further, and producer price levels had been broadly flat. Energy prices had continued to drag on CPI inflation.</p>
<p>25: Services price inflation had increased to 5.6% in August compared to 5.2% in July and 5.7% in June. This was slightly lower in August than had been expected at the time of the August Report. There had been volatility in a number of services sub-components in the July and August outturns, including accommodation and catering prices and airfares.</p>
<p>26: The Committee discussed momentum in services price inflation and price-setting behaviour in firms. Strength in services price inflation was supported by evidence from the DMP Survey which showed firms&rsquo; own-price inflation continuing to fall, but to a lesser extent among services firms. July CPI microdata pointed to a higher proportion of services prices being raised each month than was the case pre-Covid, though with some easing in catering services where food input costs had moderated. The monthly annualised inflation rates of a seasonally adjusted services price measure, which excluded indexed and volatile components, rents and foreign holidays, had averaged around 4% in the three months to August, close to its average since the end of 2023. Although it had fallen from its peak level, the apparent stability in this measure suggested further pass-through from lower labour costs and easing inflation expectations was still to come. Accordingly, Bank staff expected services inflation to ease slightly further in Q4.</p>
<p>27: CPI inflation was expected to increase somewhat over the remainder of this year, owing to the smaller drag on 12-month inflation from domestic energy bills. The announced uptick in utility prices to take effect in October was likely to be offset somewhat by the recent decrease in petrol prices.</p>
<h3>The immediate policy decisions</h3>
<p><a id="_Hlk173249353"></a>28: The Monetary Policy Committee sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. The MPC adopts a medium-term and forward-looking approach to determine the monetary stance required to achieve the inflation target sustainably.</p>
<p>29: Monetary policy decisions had been guided by the need to squeeze persistent inflationary pressures out of the system so as to return CPI inflation to the 2% target both in a timely manner and on a lasting basis. Policy had been acting to ensure that inflation expectations remained well anchored. As set out at the time of the August Monetary Policy Report, the Committee&rsquo;s deliberations had been supported by the consideration of a range of cases, to which different probabilities and different risks could be attached.</p>
<p>30: In the first case, the unwinding of the global shocks that had driven up inflation and the resulting fall in headline inflation should continue to feed through to weaker pay and price-setting dynamics. The persistence of inflationary pressures would therefore dissipate with a less restrictive stance of monetary policy than in other cases.</p>
<p>31: In the second case, a period of economic slack, in which GDP fell below potential and the labour market eased further, might be required in order for pay and price-setting dynamics to normalise fully. Domestic inflationary persistence would then be expected to fade away, owing to the opening up of slack from a more restrictive stance of monetary policy relative to the first case.</p>
<p>32: In the third case, the economy might be subject to structural shifts such as changes in wage and price-setting following the major supply shocks that had been experienced over recent years. The degree of restrictiveness of monetary policy might be less than embodied in the Committee&rsquo;s latest assessment, meaning that monetary policy would have to remain tighter for longer.</p>
<p>33: The Committee continued to monitor the accumulation of evidence from a broad range of indicators, with a focus on the extent to which it was possible over time to use developments in data series to assess the various cases.</p>
<p>34: Since the MPC&rsquo;s previous meeting, global activity growth had continued at a steady pace, although some data outturns suggested greater uncertainty around the near-term outlook. Oil prices had fallen back, reflecting in large part weaker demand. Market-implied paths for policy rates across major advanced economies had declined.</p>
<p>35: There had generally been limited news in UK economic indicators relative to the Committee&rsquo;s expectations in the August Monetary Policy Report. Headline GDP growth was expected to return to its underlying pace of around 0.3% per quarter in the second half of the year. Based on a broad set of indicators, the MPC judged that the labour market continued to loosen but that it remained tight by historical standards.</p>
<p>36: Twelve-month CPI inflation had been 2.2% in August, and was expected to increase to around 2&frac12;% towards the end of this year as declines in energy prices last year fell out of the annual comparison. Services consumer price inflation had remained elevated at 5.6% in August. Private sector regular average weekly earnings growth had declined to 4.9% in the three months to July. Households&rsquo; inflation expectations had largely normalised to close to their historical averages, although businesses&rsquo; inflation expectations had remained at slightly more elevated levels.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk173249898"></a><strong>Bank Rate decision</strong></p>
<p>37: Different members took different views on the probabilities and risks associated with the various cases that the Committee was considering, which were informing their votes on Bank Rate.</p>
<p>38: Eight members preferred to maintain Bank Rate at 5% at this meeting. Wage and price-setting had continued to normalise and UK activity growth had been broadly in line with expectations, although there was some greater uncertainty around the near-term global outlook. There was a range of views among these members on the degree to which the unwinding of past global shocks, the normalisation in inflation expectations and the current restrictive policy stance would lead underlying domestic inflationary pressures to continue to unwind, or whether these pressures could prove more entrenched, possibly as a result of more structural factors or greater momentum in demand. Despite these differences of view, the current policy stance was judged to be appropriate. For most members, in the absence of material developments, a gradual approach to removing policy restraint would be warranted.</p>
<p>39: One member preferred a 0.25 percentage point reduction in Bank Rate at this meeting. Bank Rate needed to become less restrictive now to enable a smooth and gradual transition in the policy stance, and to account for lags in transmission. CPI inflation had been on a firm downward trajectory for some time. Data developments remained consistent with CPI inflation staying sustainably at target, given the further easing in the labour market, continued falls in inflation expectations and forward-looking indicators of pass-through, and the subdued outlook for demand.</p>
<p>40: Monetary policy would need to continue to remain restrictive for sufficiently long until the risks to inflation returning sustainably to the 2% target in the medium term had dissipated further. The Committee continued to monitor closely the risks of inflation persistence and would decide the appropriate degree of monetary policy restrictiveness at each meeting.</p>
<p>41: The MPC would make a full assessment of recent and prospective developments as part of its forthcoming November forecast round.</p>
<p><strong>Annual decision on the pace of reduction in the stock of UK government bond purchases held for monetary policy purposes</strong></p>
<p>42: As set out in the minutes of its August 2022 meeting, the MPC had committed to review the reduction in the Asset Purchase Facility (APF) annually and, as part of that, to set an amount for the reduction in the stock of purchased UK government bonds (gilts) over the subsequent 12-month period. Box A of the August 2024 Monetary Policy Report had set out an assessment of the process of quantitative tightening over the previous year.</p>
<p>43: The Committee continued to judge that reducing the size of the APF had the benefit of reducing the risk of a ratchet upwards in the size of the Bank&rsquo;s balance sheet over time, and thus should increase the headroom and flexibility available to the Bank to use its balance sheet in the future if needed.</p>
<p>44: The appropriate pace of gilt stock reduction would continue to be guided by a set of key principles, which the MPC had first outlined in the August 2021 Monetary Policy Report. First, the Committee intended to use Bank Rate as its active policy tool when adjusting the stance of monetary policy. Second, sales would be conducted so as not to disrupt the functioning of financial markets. Third, to help achieve that, sales would be conducted in a gradual and predictable manner over a period of time.</p>
<p>45: As set out in the Box in the August 2024 Report, the Committee judged that quantitative tightening had continued to proceed smoothly. There was no evidence of a negative impact of gilt sales on market functioning across a range of financial market measures. In particular, measures of gilt market liquidity had further improved. APF reduction was likely to have had some tightening effect on yields, which, while difficult to measure precisely, was judged to have been modest. That was in line with the MPC&rsquo;s previous expectations, and was broadly consistent with findings from other empirical studies and central banks. The Committee would continue to learn from monitoring developments as the process progressed.</p>
<p>46: While it remained hard to measure precisely the marginal effect of quantitative tightening on the economy, the MPC&rsquo;s forecasts were conditioned on asset prices that incorporated announced and expected APF reductions. The MPC had therefore taken this effect into account when setting the desired monetary policy stance using Bank Rate. Any tightening effect from the reduction in the APF would have led to a slightly lower path for Bank Rate, all else equal. Given that the impact of APF reduction was judged to have been modest, this was unlikely to have made a material difference to the appropriate path for Bank Rate over the past year.</p>
<p>47: The Committee considered the case to maintain the pace of gilt stock reduction at &pound;100 billion over the 12 months ahead, of which &pound;87 billion would be maturing APF gilt holdings. Bank staff had briefed the MPC on the current state of economic and market conditions. The Financial Policy Committee (FPC) had also been briefed on the MPC&rsquo;s deliberations.</p>
<p>48: All members of the MPC agreed at this meeting that the Bank of England should reduce the stock of UK government bond purchases held for monetary policy purposes, and financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, by &pound;100 billion over the 12-month period from October 2024 to September 2025, comprising both maturing gilts and sales.</p>
<p>49: The MPC also reaffirmed that there would be a high bar for amending the planned reduction in the stock of purchased gilts outside a scheduled annual review. That was in order to remain consistent with the principles that Bank Rate should be the active policy tool when adjusting the stance of monetary policy, and that APF reduction should be predictable. In judging whether that bar was met, the FPC would also have a role through its assessment of financial stability.</p>
<p>50: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the propositions that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bank Rate should be maintained at 5%; and</li>
<li>The Bank of England should reduce the stock of UK government bond purchases held for monetary policy purposes, and financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, by &pound;100 billion over the next 12 months, to a total of &pound;558 billion.</li>
</ul>
<p>51: Eight members (Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Megan Greene, Clare Lombardelli, Catherine L Mann, Huw Pill, Dave Ramsden and Alan Taylor) voted in favour of the first proposition. Swati Dhingra voted against this proposition, preferring to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 4.75%.</p>
<p>52: The Committee voted unanimously in favour of the second proposition.</p>
<p><strong>Operational considerations</strong></p>
<p>53: On 18 September 2024, the stock of UK government bonds held for monetary policy purposes was &pound;659 billion.</p>
<p>54: At this meeting, the MPC had voted to reduce the stock of UK government bond purchases held for monetary policy purposes by &pound;100 billion over the 12-month period from October 2024 to September 2025. The details of the first quarter of the associated gilt sales programme, covering 2024 Q4, were set out in a Market Notice accompanying these minutes. The Bank would continue to set auction sizes each quarter, to meet the MPC&rsquo;s annual target as closely as practicable.</p>
<p>55: The following members of the Committee were present:</p>
<p>Andrew Bailey, Chair</p>
<p>Sarah Breeden</p>
<p>Swati Dhingra</p>
<p>Megan Greene</p>
<p>Clare Lombardelli</p>

<title>Lending Standards Board To Develop A First-Of-Its-Kind Code To Break Down Barriers To Finance For Ethnic Minority-Led Businesses</title>

<div> developing, inclusive, Code, Ethnic Minority-Led Businesses, financial services<br />
<br />
LSB is creating an inclusive Code to improve access to finance for Ethnic Minority-Led Businesses, addressing barriers and driving economic growth.<br />
Summary: <div>
<ul>
<li>New Code will drive financial services inclusion and address key barriers to finance faced by Ethnic Minority-led Businesses<b>&nbsp;</b></li>
<li>Code will be open to lenders, investors and others, and is set to be available early in 2025<b></b></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.lendingstandardsboard.org.uk/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">The Lending Standards Board</a>&nbsp;(LSB) is developing a first-of-its-kind inclusive Code to drive essential improvements in access to finance for Ethnic Minority-Led Businesses (EMBs). The Code&rsquo;s development follows the publication of the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.lendingstandardsboard.org.uk/unlocking-untapped-potential-lsb-launches-report-on-financing-for-ethnic-minority-led-businesses/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">LSB&rsquo;s 2023 report</a>&nbsp;on the barriers to finance faced by EMBs, which also underscored the crucial role that financial institutions can play in unlocking these businesses&rsquo; untapped potential.</p>
<p>As highlighted by the LSB&rsquo;s 2023 report, ethnic minority entrepreneurs, including those from Black, Asian, and other minority groups, contribute an estimated &pound;25 billion to the UK economy annually.</p>
<p>Despite their significant economic impact, the LSB&rsquo;s report found that EMBs face barriers when seeking access to financial support, including a lack of understanding of religious or cultural differences by financial institutions.</p>
<p>Emma Lovell, Chief Executive of the LSB, says: &ldquo;The UK&rsquo;s EMBs have a significant role to play in driving sustainable, equitable economic growth, but all too often they face barriers to accessing finance. Failure by the sector to embrace the change needed to resolve this will mean EMBs&rsquo; vast potential risks going unrealised. The new Code will be designed to enable the financial services sector to provide EMBs the specific help they need to thrive and grow &ndash; and to power growth in the wider UK economy too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last year, we found that EMBs felt lenders didn&rsquo;t cater for their specific needs and that, for example, lenders seemed unaware of the different business models and growth journeys that EMBs adopt compared to the wider business community. This can discourage EMBs from seeking finance in the first place, or mean that EMBs don&rsquo;t tick typical lending criteria boxes. This might lead to opportunities to back exciting, innovative entrepreneurs being missed. The new Code will drive a consistent, tailored approach to EMB access to finance across the financial services sector.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Firms signing up to the Code will be leading the way on inclusion and innovation, and will be at the forefront of much-needed changes that will boost trust between the financial services sector and EMBs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The LSB&rsquo;s development of a new Code for EMBs is supported by Diana Chrouch, Special Advisor to the 2019-24 All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Ethnic Minority Business Owners and Chair of National Ethnic Minority Business Policy for the Federation of Small Businesses. The APPG itself backed the LSB&rsquo;s development of a new lending Code earlier in 2024.</p>
<p>Diana Chrouch says: &ldquo;The development of an inclusive Code by the LSB is a major milestone in ensuring the financial services sector better serves the UK&rsquo;s diverse multi-ethnic business communities. Given its role in the sector and its track record, the LSB is very well-placed to lead the development of this Code, and I look forward to seeing what the Code &ndash; and its future signatories &ndash; can do to extend protections for EMBs and break down fundamental barriers that we face when accessing finance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new Code is expected to be available in early 2025, and is intended be open to firms across the financial services sector, including lenders, investors, and others. More details on the proposed new Code and its scope will be available in due course.</p>

<p><b>Clear and honest communication to guard against greenwashing label</b></p>
<p><b>Maria Bogdanova, Senior Product Manager for Sustainability at Euromonitor International, said</b>&nbsp;that the effectiveness of sustainable products hinges on clear and honest communication to guard against claims of greenwashing.</p>
<p>"While 'natural' remains the leading sustainability claim in value sales, its vague nature has raised concerns about greenwashing, particularly in the Beauty, Personal Care and Pet Care industries, where 39% and 37% of products respectively, feature 'natural' claims in 2023.

<p><b>Top Three Value Sales Claims by Industry &ndash; Organic, No GMO, Vegan/Vegetarian</b></p>
<p>Beyond Natural, clean labels such as Organic and No GMO and diet claims like Vegan and Vegetarian ranked among the top three in value sales across packaged food, beauty and personal care, pet care and consumer health.</p>
<p><b>Bogdanova</b>&nbsp;said: "Breakfast Cereal leads the way, with over 20% of all products featuring a vegetarian claim followed by Sweet Biscuits, Snack Bars and Fruit Snacks with only 9%. The share of these clean products is expected to grow, driven by aggressive investments from global retailers like Tesco, Walmart, Albert Heijn, Carrefour, and Lidl. "</p>
<p><b>Spotlight on Zero Waste and B Corp Claims</b>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zero Waste and B Corp are the most frequently recurring claims among the top five fastest-growing sustainability value sales claims. Zero Waste commits companies to take the opportunity to reduce raw material use and minimise waste.</p>
<p><b>Bogdanova&nbsp;</b>said that B Corp certification, which signifies a company's commitment to social and environmental performance, is also gaining traction. Obtaining a B Corp certification is a lengthy process.</p>
<p>The Beauty industry leads the number of B Corp certified products with brands like The Body Shop, Dr Hauschka and Elemis embracing certification. The number of SKUs in staple foods and snacks with B Corp claim has increased by 49% and 40% over the last two years.&nbsp;</p>

<div> Government, FCA, UK retail disclosure rules, investment trusts, PRIIPs Regulation
Summary:<br />The Government and FCA plan to reform UK retail disclosure rules, exempting investment trusts temporarily. New regime to be in place by 2025. <div>
<p><span>The Government and FCA announce plans to reform UK retail disclosure rules, and will temporarily exempt investment trusts from assimilated EU law requirements.</span></p>
<p>The Government and Financial Conduct Authority (<abbr title="Financial Conduct Authority">FCA</abbr>) are committed to the ongoing reform programme to reinvigorate the UK&rsquo;s capital markets. Ensuring retail investors can make informed investment decisions is an important part of ensuring healthy capital markets. As part of this, the Government and&nbsp;<abbr title="Financial Conduct Authority">FCA</abbr>&nbsp;are committed to replacing EU-inherited consumer disclosure regulation with a new framework tailored to UK markets and firms.</p>
<p>The Treasury consulted on replacing the EU-inherited Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products (<abbr title="Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products">PRIIPs</abbr>) Regulation with a new framework for Consumer Composite Investments (<abbr title="Consumer Composite Investments">CCIs</abbr>). HM Treasury will lay legislation as soon as possible to provide the&nbsp;<abbr title="Financial Conduct Authority">FCA</abbr>&nbsp;with the appropriate powers to deliver this reform. The new&nbsp;<abbr title="Consumer Composite Investments">CCI</abbr>&nbsp;regime will deliver more tailored and flexible rules which will address concerns across industry with current disclosure requirements, including for costs.</p>
<p>The UK&rsquo;s new retail disclosure regime is expected to be in place in H1 2025, subject to Parliamentary approval and the&nbsp;<abbr title="Financial Conduct Authority">FCA</abbr>&nbsp;consultation process. The&nbsp;<abbr title="Financial Conduct Authority">FCA</abbr>&nbsp;intends to consult on proposed rules for the&nbsp;<abbr title="Consumer Composite Investments">CCI</abbr>&nbsp;regime this autumn.</p>
<p>The UK&rsquo;s new framework for&nbsp;<abbr title="Consumer Composite Investments">CCIs</abbr>&nbsp;will support investors to better understand what they are paying for and the value they are receiving through the distribution chain. The&nbsp;<abbr title="Financial Conduct Authority">FCA</abbr>&rsquo;s consultation process will provide an opportunity for a full range of stakeholders to provide feedback on the new regime, to ensure it works as intended.</p>
<p>The intent is that the new&nbsp;<abbr title="Consumer Composite Investments">CCI</abbr>&nbsp;framework will be proportionate and will allow more bespoke arrangements to address concerns that have been raised with the current&nbsp;<abbr title="Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products">PRIIPs</abbr>&nbsp;framework.</p>
<p>The Government and&nbsp;<abbr title="Financial Conduct Authority">FCA</abbr>&nbsp;also welcome the feedback from the investment trust sector regarding the operation of current cost disclosure requirements and how they might be impacting the investment trust sector specifically.</p>
<p>Investment trusts are a well-established type of investment vehicle in the UK representing over 30% of the FTSE 250 and investing in over &pound;260 billion in assets in total&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/reforms-to-financial-services-retail-disclosure-requirements?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=govuk-notifications-topic&amp;utm_source=41f1bdbe-7520-4854-bd0b-2a5b4b4b859e&amp;utm_content=immediately#_ftn1">[1]</a>. They can be a valuable source of investment funding for both conventional and emerging asset classes. The valuations and discounts of investment trusts may be influenced by many factors, independent of regulation, including investment performance, overall market sentiment and the interest rate environment.</p>
<p>In response to the feedback from the sector, the Government will lay legislation to exempt listed investment trusts from the current&nbsp;<abbr title="Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products">PRIIPs</abbr>&nbsp;Regulation, as well as make other necessary amendments to other EU-assimilated law.</p>
<p>This approach is intended as an interim measure, and investment trusts will be included within the scope of the future UK retail disclosure framework. The proposed new&nbsp;<abbr title="Consumer Composite Investments">CCI</abbr>&nbsp;regime is intended to better cater for a variety of products and investment vehicles, including investment trusts, while still ensuring consumers receive appropriate information to allow them to make meaningful choices between investment opportunities about composite consumer investments.</p>
<p>In light of this announcement, the&nbsp;<abbr title="Financial Conduct Authority">FCA</abbr>&nbsp;will immediately apply new forbearance to provide certainty for firms ahead of this legislation taking effect.&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/forbearance-relation-investment-trust-disclosure-requirements" rel="external">Read the&nbsp;<abbr title="Financial Conduct Authority">FCA</abbr>&nbsp;forbearance statement</a>. From 19 September until the legislation to amend the&nbsp;<abbr title="Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products">PRIIPs</abbr>&nbsp;regulation for investment trusts comes into force, the&nbsp;<abbr title="Financial Conduct Authority">FCA</abbr>&nbsp;will not take supervisory or enforcement action if an investment trust chooses not to follow the requirements of the&nbsp;<abbr title="Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products">PRIIPs</abbr>&nbsp;regulation and associated technical standards, and/or the requirements of Article 50(2)(b) and Article 51 of the MiFID Org Regulation. This is an interim measure, pending longer term reform.</p>

Neter&rsquo;s strategy focuses on educating market participants and developing financial instruments that more closely align nature-based assets with capital markets to achieve financial and nature-positive returns.</span></p>
<p><span>Mandated Net Zero targets for 2030 and 2050, ESG obligations, and other regulations require industries and businesses to demonstrate positive action with respect to mitigating environmental (climate) threats. Beyond reporting on, and offsetting, carbon emissions there is an equally pressing imperative to protect Earth&rsquo;s biosphere from continuing degradation and potentially irrevocable damage.</span></p>
<p><span>Neter&rsquo;s strategy will leverage fiscal policies and regulatory frameworks and mandates to influence and drive adoption of new financial mechanisms for capital investment that have a direct, positive impact on the environment. &nbsp;By expounding the value and benefits of nature as an investable asset, Neter aims to work with capital markets partners to unlock innovative financing solutions and create investment opportunities aimed at the collective financial markets community beyond &lsquo;green&rsquo; investors.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Seth Elliott, CEO of Neter,</span>&nbsp;said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more than Net Zero. There are a multitude of declining environmental and natural assets that could be preserved, protected, and improved with greater capital markets engagement and support.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Economic and market forces continue to inflict enormous damage on the natural world - and adjacent communities - in the pursuit of financial gain. Outside of carbon reduction targets and emissions reporting, there is a growing imperative to mobilise global capital markets to more directly align with nature-positive funding and investment opportunities. Neter aims to be at the forefront of this transformative movement and moment in capital market development.&rdquo;</span></p>

<div> charged, Ruwan, fraud, investments, SC
Summary:<br />SC charged Ruwan for fraudulently obtaining investments totaling RM201,000 and for unlicensed capital market activities. Ruwan faces up to 10 years in jail and RM10 million fine. Investors cautioned to verify authorized entities via SC Investment Checker.<br /> <div>
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) yesterday charged Ruwan Amaresh Shaun Ponniah (Ruwan) at the Kuala Lumpur Sessions Court for defrauding investors into depositing monies totaling RM201,000 for shares investments.</p>
<p>The SC also charged Ruwan for an offense relating to unlicensed capital market activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ruwan, 35, was an associate director of Debt Capital Markets at CIMB Investment Bank when the offences took place between October 2018 and June 2020.</p>
<p>Ruwan faced 10 charges under section 179(b) of the Capital Markets and Services Act 2007 (CMSA) for falsely representing to seven individuals that he would invest their monies in shares listed on the Malaysian and foreign stock exchanges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If convicted, Ruwan faces a jail term not exceeding 10 years and a fine of not less than RM1 million.</p>
<p>Ruwan also faced one charge under section 58(1) CMSA for holding himself out as carrying on a business in fund management without being licensed or a registered person for fund management under the CMSA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fund management is a regulated activity under Schedule 2 of the CMSA, thus any person carrying out this activity must be licensed by the SC.</p>
<p>The offence carries a maximum fine of RM10 million or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or both, if convicted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ruwan claimed trial to all 11 charges in three separate courts and was imposed with a total bail sum of RM210,000.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before Sessions Court judge Puan Hamidah binti Mohamed Deril, Ruwan was charged with three charges under section 179(b) CMSA. He was granted bail of RM30,000 with one Malaysian surety and similar additional bail conditions.</p>
<p>The SC reminds investors to exercise caution before parting with their monies and when considering investment opportunities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The public is urged to refer to the SC Investment Checker, a one-stop portal available on the SC&rsquo;s website -<a href="http://www.sc.com.my/investment-checker"> </a><a href="http://www.sc.com.my/investment-checker">www.sc.com.my/investment</a><a href="http://www.sc.com.my/investment-checker">-</a><a href="http://www.sc.com.my/investment-checker">checker</a><a href="http://www.sc.com.my/investment-checker"> </a>- to verify if an individual and/or entity is authorised by the SC to offer, promote, or sell any capital market products and services in Malaysia.</p>

<title>ASIC Receives New Powers Under Financial Market Infrastructure Reforms</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> financial market infrastructure, ASIC, regulation, stability, Australian Parliament
Summary:<br />ASIC welcomes new FMI laws enhancing its powers for regulation and stability. The new laws strengthen the regulatory regime for FMIs. Royal Assent received. <div>
<p>ASIC welcomes the new Australian financial market infrastructure (FMI) laws, which introduce new powers essential to ensuring a stable and efficient Australian financial system.</p>
<p>Financial market infrastructures (FMIs) are the key entities that enable, facilitate, and support trading in Australia&rsquo;s capital markets. FMIs include financial market operators, benchmark administrators, clearing and settlement (CS) facilities, and derivative trade repositories.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>Treasury Laws Amendment (Financial Market Infrastructure and Other Measures) Bill 2024&nbsp;</em>strengthens the existing regulatory regime, ensuring ASIC and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) (together, the Regulators) have strong and dependable powers to monitor, manage and respond to risks related to FMIs.</p>
<p>ASIC Commissioner Simone Constant said: &lsquo;The new laws ensure we have a fit-for-purpose regulatory regime for critical financial market infrastructure. The reforms significantly enhance ASIC&rsquo;s regulatory toolkit for FMIs, clarify the scope of the Australian licensing regime for overseas markets and CS facilities, and empower us to make rules to promote the fair and effective provision of services by licensed CS facilities. Collectively, these new powers help ASIC ensure the Australian financial system is supported by resilient, efficient, and stable FMIs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are reviewing our approach to the regulation and supervision of FMIs to ensure that we make the most effective and efficient use of our expanded powers. We will work closely with the RBA and industry to develop and provide information and guidance on the use of our new powers across this multi-year program of change.&rsquo;</p>
<p>ASIC will now plan and implement the new FMI regulatory regime and update its website with further publications and information, including the development of updated regulatory guidance to assist industry to comply with the enhanced regulatory framework for FMIs.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The Australian Government introduced the&nbsp;<a href="https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/legislation/bills/r7176_aspassed/toc_pdf/24042b01.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf"><em>Treasury Laws Amendment (Financial Market Infrastructure and Other Measures) Bill 2024</em></a>&nbsp;(Cth) into the Australian Parliament on 27 March 2024.</p>
<p>The Bill implements the&nbsp;<a href="https://oia.pmc.gov.au/sites/default/files/posts/2021/06/fmi_regulatory_reforms_-_cfr_advice_to_government.pdf"><em>Financial Market Infrastructure Regulatory Reforms: Advice to Government from the Council of Financial Regulators, July 2020</em></a>&nbsp;which made sixteen recommendations to Government.</p>
<p>The Bill will:</p>
<ul>
<li>introduce a crisis management and resolution regime</li>
<li>enhance ASIC and the RBA&rsquo;s licensing, supervisory and enforcement powers, which will provide ASIC with more capacity to monitor the ongoing conduct of FMI entities, identify risks as they emerge, and take appropriate action to prevent those risks from escalating, and</li>
<li>streamline and transfer roles and responsibilities between the Minister, ASIC and the RBA.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Bill passed Parliament on 9 September 2024 and received Royal Assent on 17 September 2024.</p>

<div> greenwashing, ethical investment, transparency, FMA, market integrity
Summary: The FMA emphasizes the importance of transparency in ethical investing to maintain market integrity, prevent greenwashing, and build investor trust.<br /><br /> <div>
<p>E ngā mana, e ngā waka, e ngā reo, e rau Rangatira mā,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tēna koutou katoa,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks for having me along to speak to you today, and a big thank you to Estelle Parker, Dean Hegarty, and the other RIAA staff for hosting this event. It&rsquo;s a pleasure to be here, and to speak on this issue of great importance to the FMA &ndash; why? Because it is essential that investors clearly know what they&rsquo;re buying. When it comes to ethical or sustainable investment, preventing greenwashing is crucial. Greenwashing &ndash; misrepresenting a product&rsquo;s ethical or environmental impact &ndash; damages trust in the market and can mislead investors into making decision based on false claims.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Impact of Greenwashing in Markets</h3>
<p>Greenwashing erodes confidence in the market and undermines trust in sustainable investment products. Transparency and preventing misleading practices, like greenwashing, are central to maintaining the integrity of New Zealand&rsquo;s financial markets. Many of you will be familiar with last year&rsquo;s Responsible Investment Benchmark Report revealing that responsible investment funds reached a record $183 billion in 2022, ahead of traditional funds for the first time.&nbsp; Demand is growing and maturing. According to RIAA&rsquo;s 2024 report, more consumers support responsible investing than ever before. Now, more than three quarters of Kiwis (77%) surveyed agree or agree strongly with the statement &ldquo;I expect my KiwiSaver or investment fund will be managed ethically and responsibly&rdquo;, an increase of 3% from last year. More than half of the respondents say they would consider moving their fund if it was investing in companies that engage in activities that do not reflect their values (57%).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our own internal estimates show that virtually all KiwiSaver and three-quarters of other funds under management now adhere to some form of ethical investment policy. This trend points to increased interest in ethical and sustainable investment options. However, it also emphasises the need for transparency and openness to ensure these funds&rsquo; claims align with what fund managers are doing in practice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet, people are still finding the category difficult to navigate. We commissioned a survey in 2022 of New Zealanders about their experience with ethical investments. We found that people find the category filled with difficult language they feel isn&rsquo;t designed for non-professionals. We heard that many people find exploring ethical funds &lsquo;impenetrable,&rsquo; &lsquo;daunting,&rsquo; &lsquo;overwhelming&rsquo; and feel that they lack support &ndash; largely unaware of the resources available to help them. Some people tackle this head-on &ndash; knuckle down and get into it, while others look for simple signpost language to help them, and others simply procrastinate. The upshot from these findings is a clear demand for greater clarity and transparency around disclosures.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What we&rsquo;re seeing in the NZ Market</h3>
<p>Last week, we published a short document setting out what we&rsquo;d seen in the market and the work we&rsquo;ve done in this space since our thematic report two years ago. As we&rsquo;ve done in other recent publications such as our financial advice monitoring report, we talked about both the good and the bad. That&rsquo;s deliberate, because we know from speaking to industry that firms and senior leaders want to know where to improve, but also learn from best practice. So, what did we find?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, there has been both a rise in interest in ethical investing but also confusion among investors over the terms and claims used by firms. The people who provide you with the capital to invest rely heavily on you to deliver on their promises but often struggle to find good information to support their decision to make an ethical investment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>While we haven&rsquo;t found misuse of ethical labelling warranting enforcement action, our view is that there remains a need for greater clarity and certainty regarding disclosures. Issuers must be clear about their ethical commitments, deliver on them, and report transparently on their progress, even when challenges arise. This level of transparency is key to building trust from the outset and avoid the risk of significant negative consequences when ethical claims fall short.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Challenges Faced by Regulated Entities&nbsp;</h3>
<p>All of us in this room know that complying with ethical investment regulations can present challenges. Investing ethically is complex, and there are no universal standards. That is one of the reasons why the FMA&rsquo;s approach is as it is: to engage with firms proactively to address issues as they arise, and to provide updates and guidance as needed to assist the market.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our dealings with firms, I know many are making significant efforts to promote transparency and embed ethical investment principles in their products. The industry&rsquo;s commitment is encouraging.&nbsp; However, as the market grows, so does the need for vigilance to ensure that our efforts align with the expectations of investors and broader society.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>FMA&rsquo;s Role in Responding to and Preventing Greenwashing</h3>
<p>So, what are we looking for moving forward? All the research we see tells us that ethical investing is important to investors &ndash; it&rsquo;s a factor that influences their investment decisions.&nbsp; This means it&rsquo;s important that fund managers are clearly and truthfully describing their ethical investment policies. As ethical investing continues to develop, maintaining high standards of disclosure will be essential to preserving trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Response to greenwashing is a relatively undeveloped area and I accept there are significant differences in approach, practice and terminology used by both regulators and market participants in different jurisdictions. The FMA&rsquo;s preference is to work with market participants to provide clear and consistent information that helps New Zealand&rsquo;s investors to make their decisions.&nbsp; Where we see firms trying to achieve this, our first choice is to support them to manage any issues that arise through engagement and feedback, without the need to escalate further. Where we see cynical misuse of ethical labels and descriptions, or no real effort to provide good information for investors, we will take a quite different approach, and we must and will use our enforcement and other regulatory tools where we see serious misconduct.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are also closely following global trends. As greenwashing and ethical investing become increasingly prominent issues globally, New Zealand cannot afford to lag. Our regulatory approach must align with international standards while reflecting our unique market conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the definition and standardisation of terms like &lsquo;sustainable&rsquo; and &lsquo;ethical&rsquo; investments evolve both nationally and internationally, we will assess their impact on New Zealand&rsquo;s market. Additionally, we will consider any material developments from the Sustainable Finance Taxonomy under development by the Ministry for the Environment, which aims to help investors identify sustainable activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are risks in taking a too prescriptive approach, which could put New Zealand out of step with other comparable jurisdictions or industry practice. That is why it&rsquo;s important that the FMA continues to improve ethical investing disclosure as ethical investing is a high trust relationship.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, what are we doing next? We will be updating our 2020 ethical guidance following engagement with the market. This will be a longer-term project, where we will seek views and insights from across the financial sector before drafting any proposed guidance. Ethical claims need to be clear, concise and effective in fund manager&rsquo;s disclosure documents. We will continue to review ethical investing practices, both proactively and in response to any complaints received.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Maintaining trust in ethical investing requires the same vigilance and collaboration that guided the creation of the FMA and the introduction of the FMC Act. Just as we were established to protect everyday investors from the harms exposed during the Global Financial Crisis, our shared responsibility now is to ensure that today&rsquo;s financial products&mdash;especially those marketed as ethical or sustainable&mdash;are transparent and trustworthy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our preference is to guide people in understanding their obligations and supporting the market get it right from the outset. By setting clear expectations and helping people grasp what&rsquo;s required, we can prevent issues before they arise.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>By working together, issuers, third-party providers, and regulators can build a market where investors confidently choose products that align with their values. The FMA remains committed to supporting the industry in this journey. We encourage you to engage with us, adopt best practices, and stay informed about emerging regulatory trends. Upholding transparency, standards, and preventing greenwashing are critical to maintaining the trust and integrity of New Zealand&rsquo;s financial markets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The monthly data on holdings of long-term securities, as well as the monthly table on Major Foreign Holders of Treasury Securities, reflect foreign holdings of U.S. securities collected primarily on the basis of custodial data.&nbsp; These data help provide a window into foreign ownership of U.S. securities, but they cannot attribute holdings of U.S. securities with complete accuracy.&nbsp; For example, if a U.S. Treasury security purchased by a foreign resident is held in a custodial account in a third country, the true ownership of the security will not be reflected in the data.&nbsp; The custodial data will also not properly attribute U.S. Treasury securities managed by foreign private portfolio managers who invest on behalf of residents of other countries.&nbsp; In addition, foreign countries may hold dollars and other U.S. assets that are not captured in the TIC data.&nbsp; For these reasons, it is difficult to draw precise conclusions from TIC data about changes in the foreign holdings of U.S. financial assets by individual countries.</p>

<p>I think it is fair to say that equity market structure contains multitudes,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-regulation-nms-091824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;and in that poetic spirit today the Commission will vote on amendments that can be broken into several components: (1) reducing the tick size for certain stocks, (2) reducing the maximum fees that exchanges may charge investors for execution against protected quotations (or &ldquo;access fee caps&rdquo; for short); and (3) requiring exchange fees and rebates to be determinable at the time of the execution.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-regulation-nms-091824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;In addition, today&rsquo;s amendments will accelerate the implementation of the &ldquo;round lot&rdquo; and &ldquo;odd-lot information&rdquo; definitions from the Market Data Infrastructure Rule<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-regulation-nms-091824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3">[3]</a>&nbsp;and add a new &ldquo;best odd-lot order&rdquo; data element (or &ldquo;BOLO&rdquo;) as part of the odd-lot information definition.</p>
<p>As I noted during the proposal phase, many market participants have suggested that trading in tick-constrained stocks would benefit from a smaller minimum tick size, though the specifics of the suggestions have varied.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-regulation-nms-091824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4">[4]</a>&nbsp;In addition, data analysis has shown that it would be easier and less costly for investors to transact in these stocks if they were allowed to quote at increments smaller than one penny.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-regulation-nms-091824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5">[5]</a>&nbsp;Today&rsquo;s amendment addresses this issue by adding a new tick size of a half-penny for these stocks. This will benefit investors and market participants by allowing such stocks to be priced more efficiently and competitively.</p>
<p>The second component of the amendments will reduce the access fee caps for certain NMS stocks. Currently, many exchanges charge the maximum fee and then pay out nearly all of it as a rebate to compensate liquidity providers.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-regulation-nms-091824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6">[6]</a>&nbsp;Though the exchanges retain a small amount for themselves, this practice distorts the price that is actually available to investors.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-regulation-nms-091824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7">[7]</a>&nbsp;Therefore today&rsquo;s amendment, which reduces the access fee, will allow exchanges to retain that same net capture for executions they were already keeping and continue to use rebates.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-regulation-nms-091824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8">[8]</a>&nbsp;Reducing the distortions in the market associated with the fee/rebate models that have developed under the higher access fee cap should help improve market quality and preserve the integrity of displayed prices, which will reduce costs for investors.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-regulation-nms-091824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9">[9]</a>&nbsp;It remains to be seen whether it will be helpful enough.</p>
<p>The third component of the amendments will require exchange fees and rebates to be determinable at the time of execution. In recent years, the exchanges have developed complex fee and rebate schedules, many of which include tiers or other incentives based on a broker-dealer&rsquo;s trading volume.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-regulation-nms-091824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10">[10]</a>&nbsp;One of the issues with this model is that because the fees are calculated based on monthly volume, broker-dealers and their customers do not know what the fees are until after the month&rsquo;s end.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-regulation-nms-091824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11">[11]</a>&nbsp;I think we can all agree that it is preferable to know what you&rsquo;re paying up front. Here, customers&rsquo; lack of timely information and certainty about their fees and rebates can impact their choices. The amendments will provide much needed transparency.</p>
<p>Finally, the last part of today&rsquo;s amendments will accelerate and build upon certain common-sense changes that the Commission adopted in the Market Data Infrastructure Rule. This aspect of the amendments will improve information available to investors and other market participants about better prices available in the market, resulting in more transparent pricing.</p>
<p>Thank you again to the staff of the Division of Trading and Markets, the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, and the Office of the General Counsel for all their hard work on this release. These amendments are an important step forward and I&rsquo;m pleased to support them.</p>

<title>SEC Charges DeFi Platform Rari Capital And Its Founders With Misleading Investors And Acting As Unregistered Brokers - Rari Capital Also Charged For Engaging In Unregistered Crypto Offerings</title>

<div> settled charges, Rari Capital, DeFi protocol, unregistered broker activity, blockchain-based investment platforms

Summary:
SEC settles charges against Rari Capital, co-founders for misleading investors and unregistered broker activity related to blockchain-based investment platforms.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against Rari Capital, Inc., a supposed decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, and its co-founders, Jai Bhavnani, Jack Lipstone, and David Lucid, for misleading investors and engaging in unregistered broker activity in connection with their operation of two blockchain-based investment platforms that, at their peak, collectively held crypto assets worth more than $1 billion. Rari Capital also settled SEC charges that it conducted unregistered offerings of three securities tied to those platforms. In a separate order, Rari Capital Infrastructure LLC, which took over operations from Rari Capital in 2022, settled charges that it engaged in unregistered securities offerings and unregistered broker activity.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Rari Capital offered two investment products, Earn pools and Fuse pools, which functioned like crypto asset investment funds, allowing investors to deposit crypto assets in lending pools, either managed by Rari (Earn) or user-created (Fuse), and earn returns from their investments. The SEC&rsquo;s complaint alleges that investors in the pools received a token representing their interest in the pools and the right to receive profits earned by the pools. Certain Earn pool investors also received a governance token, called the Rari Governance Token, or RGT. By selling interests in these pools and RGT, the complaint alleges, Rari Capital conducted unregistered offers and sales of securities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the SEC&rsquo;s complaint alleges that Rari Capital and its co-founders falsely told investors that the Earn pools would automatically and autonomously rebalance their crypto assets into the highest yield-generating opportunities available when, in reality, the rebalancing mechanism often required manual input, which Rari Capital sometimes failed to initiate. The SEC also alleges that Rari Capital and its co-founders misleadingly touted the high annual percentage yield that investors would earn, but they failed to account for various fees and, ultimately, a significant percentage of Earn pool investors lost money on their investments.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the SEC alleges that Rari Capital and its co-founders engaged in unregistered broker activity through their operation of the Fuse platform.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s separate order against Rari Capital Infrastructure finds that it took over operations of the Fuse platform around March 2022 and continued the unlawful offer and sale of Fuse pool interests as well as the performance of unregistered broker activities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We allege that Rari Capital and its co-founders misled investors about both the features and profitability of certain of the crypto asset investments Rari Capital offered, and acted as unregistered brokers,&rdquo;&nbsp;said Monique C. Winkler, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s San Francisco Regional Office. &ldquo;We will not be deterred by someone labeling a product as &ldquo;decentralized&rdquo; and &ldquo;autonomous,&rdquo; but instead will look beyond the labels to the economic realities, as we did here, and hold the individuals behind crypto products and platforms accountable when they harm investors and violate the federal securities laws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, charges Rari Capital, Bhavnani, Lipstone, and Lucid with various violations of the securities offering registration and antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the broker registration provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. To settle the Commission&rsquo;s charges, Rari Capital and the three co-founders, without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s allegations, consented to the entry of final judgments ordering various forms of relief, including permanent injunctions, conduct-based injunctions, civil penalties, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and equitable officer-and-director bars against the co-founders for a period of five years. The settlements are subject to court approval. The separate SEC order finds that Rari Capital Infrastructure violated the securities offering registration provisions of the Securities Act and the broker registration provisions of the Exchange Act. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, Rari Capital Infrastructure agreed to the entry of a cease-and-desist order against it.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Madiha M. Zuberi and Erin E. Wilk of the Division of Enforcement&rsquo;s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit and was supervised by Jason H. Lee and David Zhou of the San Francisco Regional Office.</p>

<title>My Take On Tick: Statement On Adoption Of Regulation NMS: Minimum Pricing Increments, Access Fees, And Transparency Of Better Priced Orders, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, Sept. 18, 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Commission, final rule, tick-constrained stocks, market quality, access fee cap <br />
Summary:<br /> The final rule addresses tick size increments and access fee caps for stocks, with concerns about procedural shortcuts and potential market effects. <div>
<p>The final rule before the Commission today is a significant improvement over the proposal. It replaces an overly granular set of minimum pricing increments with a more reasonable single additional increment at a half-penny; it replaces a one-month review period for determining each security&rsquo;s appropriate tick size with a more generous three-month review period and makes adjustments to the minimum tick size for each stock only twice a year, rather than once each quarter. It abandons an ill-advised proposal to mandate minimum trading increments across exchange and off-exchange transactions. It provides a longer implementation period and commits the Commission to conducting a study of the rule&rsquo;s effects and outlines how the Commission will determine whether the rule has achieved the Commission&rsquo;s objectives.</p>
<p>Together, these changes should reduce operational complexity and potential investor confusion, allow tick-constrained stocks to trade at prices more closely approximating their natural levels, permit continued competition across exchange and non-exchange trading platforms, and lower investors&rsquo; costs of trading. Moreover, the accelerated implementation of certain provisions of the market data infrastructure rule, which will bring additional transparency to odd-lot orders, should improve investors&rsquo; ability to attain better pricing for certain orders. Because the final rule represents an incremental step toward addressing a problem&mdash;tick-constrained stocks&mdash;that appears to be broadly recognized by market participants, I support it.</p>
<p>I am not entirely happy, however, with the path we took to get here. Procedural short-cuts leave me less certain about the outcome than I would like to be. Although I supported the proposal, I did so with reservations. Many commenters expressed their own deep misgivings over the needlessly complicated nature of the proposed rule and the difficulty of predicting how multiple, overlapping changes would affect the behavior of market participants, including their willingness to provide liquidity on exchanges. Although the final rule is dramatically simpler than what we proposed nearly two years ago (and thus less likely to result in the harms commenters predicted of the proposal), we would have benefited from another round of comments and a public roundtable on a rule that more closely resembled the final rule we are considering today. Alternatively, the rule could have phased in its requirements over time to lower the risk of significant market disruption from making too many changes at once. Another step in the rulemaking process is painful, but making sure we get such a consequential rule right warrants a little pain.</p>
<p>I am willing to support the final rule notwithstanding these concerns. After extensive conversations with the staff, I am persuaded that the final rule is an appropriate response to the problem of tick-constrained stocks. In addition, the adopting release, as I have already noted, commits the Commission to performing a review that will help provoke reflection by the Commission and vigorous debate both within and outside the Commission about the actual effects of the rule and make it more likely that the Commission will make any necessary adjustments to the rule. I hope this is a step toward a more rigorous and consistent habit of establishing at the outset of the rulemaking process clear metrics by which we plan to measure a rule&rsquo;s success.</p>
<p>I would like to thank staff in the Division of Trading and Markets, the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, and the Office of General Counsel for your hard work on addressing commenters&rsquo; concerns and developing a recommendation that represents a reasonable step forward. I do have a few questions.</p>
<p class="text-align-center">***</p>
<ol>
<li>Several commenters strongly urged the Commission to delay adopting this rule, along with the still outstanding best execution and order competition rules, until Rule 605 is fully implemented.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-regulation-nms-091824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Waiting to see the updated Rule 605 data would allow us to determine whether the remaining rules were actually necessary, and would allow for a more reliable comparison of the changes effected by each rule.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-regulation-nms-091824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Why isn&rsquo;t the right course of action here to delay finalizing this rule until after the Rule 605 amendments are fully implemented and we have a year&rsquo;s worth (or perhaps two) of data?</li>
<li>Some commenters suggested a phased approach to implementing the different changes: implementing market data infrastructure changes first, followed by tick size changes, and only then implementing access fee caps.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-regulation-nms-091824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;Such an approach would allow the Commission to assess each of these changes independently of the others. Why doesn&rsquo;t the final rule take such an approach? Will the Commission be able to determine the independent effect of each of these changes, particularly if market quality worsens after implementation?</li>
<li>At least one commenter suggested that the Commission&rsquo;s rationale in proposing to lower access fee caps is inconsistent with its rationale in pursuing the transaction-fee pilot a few years ago.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-regulation-nms-091824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;In that release, the Commission stated that &ldquo;it &lsquo;lacks the data necessary to meaningfully analyze the impact that exchange transaction fee-and-rebate pricing models have on order routing behavior, market and execution quality, and our market structure generally.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-regulation-nms-091824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;What has changed six years after the Commission approved that pilot that makes adopting the access fee cap reductions reasonable?</li>
<li>Many commenters argued that the Commission should not define tick-constrained solely in terms of average quoted spread. One commenter recommended a multi-factor test that looked to other characteristics of the stock, namely &ldquo;quoted spread, quote-size-to-trade-size ratio, and notional turnover ratio.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-regulation-nms-091824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;Others suggested other tests that also would look at other factors beyond just average quoted spread.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-regulation-nms-091824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;It appears that the general consensus among these commenters is that even under a multi-factor analysis a stock should not be classified as tick-constrained unless its average quoted spread was 1.1 cent or less.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-regulation-nms-091824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;The final rule defines tick-constrained as a stock with a time weighted average quoted spread of 1.5 cents or less; it does not look to any of the other factors suggested by commenters. Can you walk me through why you are recommending this approach? What empirical analysis underlies the decision to make an average quoted spread of 1.5 cents or less the sole component of this definition? Are you concerned that there may be thinly-traded securities that fall within this simpler definition of tick-constrained and the execution quality of which might decline when assigned to the half-penny minimum quoting increment?</li>
<li>The final rule reduces the access fee cap for stocks with shares priced one dollar or more from 30 mils to ten. I understand that it does this primarily to avoid distortion of quoted prices, but why ten mils and not fifteen, or five, or, for that matter, twelve or eight?</li>
<li>I am uncomfortable with the Commission being in the rate-setting business. Let&rsquo;s envision a world without an Order Protection Rule. Is it unrealistic to allow competitive market forces to determine what access fee for a particular exchange is reasonable?</li>
<li>How do you expect the rule to affect on-exchange and off-exchange trading? Do you expect to see a higher proportion of trading volume occurring on lit exchanges?</li>
<li>I understand that the adopting release assumes that exchanges will be able to maintain what we estimate to be their net capture of approximately 2 mils per share and thus not adversely affect their business models. This view seems to rest on several assumptions, including that we will not see a significant shift in transaction volume from exchanges to other trading platforms (for example, because lower exchange rebates are less attractive to liquidity providers), or that exchanges will not need to increase rebates to an amount higher than the access fee caps (perhaps subsidizing them from other revenue streams) to attract liquidity. National securities exchanges play a key role in our markets. Let&rsquo;s assume that their net capture from access fees diminishes significantly. How might this affect the structure of our markets and the ability of exchanges not only to provide trade execution services but to continue innovating as well?</li>
<li>Do you expect that the rule will narrow spreads for retail investors? For institutional investors? Please walk me through how potential fragmentation of liquidity across additional ticks affects your view of changes in execution quality after the rule is implemented.</li>
<li>What will the Commission be looking at in the study it is committing to conduct on this rule? How will we know, based on this study, that the final rule has been a success?</li>
<li>The rule contains no express provision that would allow the Commission to reverse any of these changes absent another rulemaking. If it becomes apparent that the rule is having an adverse effect on market quality, what can the Commission do to address any problems quickly?</li>

<div> reform, exchanges, fees, transparency, market 
Summary:<br />Reforms aim to reduce transaction costs, improve market quality, increase transparency of fees, and provide better information on small orders. <div>
<p>The Commission is reforming how exchanges quote individual stock prices, the fees investors pay to access orders on exchanges, and the price transparency of smaller orders. In a change from the status quo, the amendments will also provide real-time disclosure of exchanges&rsquo; access fees and rebates. The rules governing current market practices have not been updated in almost two decades, but the Commission&rsquo;s reforms will result in lower transactions costs that benefit all investors.</p>
<p>Reducing the minimum increment for stocks that currently have a price difference at or near one cent for the highest purchase price and lowest selling price, or spread, will improve market quality. This change will address pricing inefficiencies caused by artificially wide spreads that could be lower if they were set by market forces.</p>
<p>Reducing access fee caps will increase the transparency of stock prices on exchanges. The total costs of listed stocks, including fees, are not currently transparent. High access fees also create potential conflicts of interest between firms and their customers. Firms have an incentive to route orders to exchanges either to take advantage of higher rebates or to avoid higher fees.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s reforms will diminish this incentive and provide greater transparency to customers about costs at the time of trade.</p>
<p>Lastly, the reforms will increase transparency and availability of information regarding better priced small orders in the market.</p>
<p>I am pleased to support today&rsquo;s reforms, designed to strengthen market quality, increase price transparency, and foster competition that will benefit retail investors and all market participants.</p>

<div> indicators, economic activity, inflation, employment, monetary policy
Summary:
The Federal Reserve has lowered the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point due to slowing job gains and elevated inflation. The Committee will continue to monitor economic conditions. <div>
<p>Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low. Inflation has made further progress toward the Committee's 2 percent objective but remains somewhat elevated.</p>
<p>The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. The Committee has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent, and judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.</p>
<p>In light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point to 4-3/4 to 5 percent. In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.</p>
<p>In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.</p>
<p>Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Thomas I. Barkin; Michael S. Barr; Raphael W. Bostic; Lisa D. Cook; Mary C. Daly; Beth M. Hammack; Philip N. Jefferson; Adriana D. Kugler; and Christopher J. Waller. Voting against this action was Michelle W. Bowman, who preferred to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point at this meeting.</p>

<title>Statement On Adoption Of Rule Regarding Regulation NMS: Minimum Pricing Increments, Access Fees, And Transparency Of Better Priced Orders, SEC Commissioner Mark T. Uyeda, Sept. 18, 2024</title>

<div> Securities, National Market System, Tick Size, Access Fee Caps, Transparency
<br />
The Commission adopts changes in tick size, access fee caps, and transparency requirements for NMS stocks to enhance market structure.
<br /><br />Summary: The Commission revisits tick size, reduces access fee caps, and enhances transparency for NMS stocks, aiming to improve market structure. <div>
<p>Thank you, Chair Gensler. Today, the Commission is adopting a change in the required minimum pricing increments&mdash;also known as the &ldquo;tick size&rdquo;&mdash;for expressions of trading interests in national market system (NMS) stocks.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-regulation-nms-091824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;In addition, the Commission is reducing access fee caps and requiring more transparency of certain better priced orders. As the Commission observed when it originally adopted Regulation NMS, a minimum tick size can encourage the provision of liquidity by constraining the ability of market participants to gain an execution priority over pre-existing orders by providing an economically insignificant improvement in the bid or ask. However, if a tick size is too large, it can discourage price competition on national securities exchanges and cause market participants to seek out other venues that might lower transaction costs. Given that optimal tick size can depend on the characteristics of the market and the security being traded and may be affected by changes in technology and communications, the question of the required minimum pricing increment is one that should be revisited on a regular basis. It has been nearly 20 years since the Commission last did so. I am pleased that the Commission has now undertaken this effort.</p>
<p>The comment process regarding this proposal has allowed for substantive feedback from stakeholders and market participants to inform the final rule. One part of the proposal would have required minimum pricing increments on trade executions, in addition to requiring them on expressions of trading interest. This would have constituted a dramatic change in how NMS stocks are traded. Indeed, one significant concern expressed in the comments was that such a change might undermine price improvement opportunities for investors. This part of the proposal is not included in the final rule.</p>
<p>Another part of the proposal introduced four separate tick sizes, based on different ranges of &ldquo;time weighted average quoted spreads.&rdquo; Commenters raised concerns that this approach increased the complexity and potential cost. In the final rule, a more incremental approach is being adopted, with the Commission not moving forward on this highly complicated approach and instead adopting only one additional minimum pricing increment of a half-penny. The final rule contains a number of other adjustments, including a longer implementation period for market participants to make systems changes with respect to the increased transparency requirements for certain better priced orders.</p>
<p>Access fee caps, which place a ceiling on the fee for accessing a national best bid or offer, will be lowered. Despite the comments, it is difficult to determine&nbsp;<i>ex ante</i>&nbsp;whether traders will enjoy lower overall transactions costs in light of this change. Determining a specific cap for the access fee is not a simple proposition. I have concerns whether the Commission has selected the correct threshold. However, I have been assured by the staff, which is reflected in the release, that they will be studying the effects of this change and reporting back to the Commission.</p>
<p>The final rule accelerates the implementation of certain odd lot and round lot information in order to enhance transparency in the market. For the most part, these changes were already included in the final rule on Market Data Infrastructure, that was adopted by the Commission under the leadership of then-Chairman Jay Clayton on December 9, 2020.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-regulation-nms-091824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;While the availability of this information may, in some situations, require adjustments in broker-dealer business models to better serve investors, I have been advised by the staff that there is unlikely to be any substantial unintended consequences or costs regarding this change.</p>
<p>To conclude, this is an important rulemaking for our market structure. By its very nature, market structural issues are fraught with uncertainties when estimating the impact of regulatory changes. Across time, the Commission needs to continue to re-examine, and potentially re-calibrate, as to whether we have properly gauged these changes.</p>
<p>I thank the staff in the Divisions of Trading and Markets and Economic and Risk Analysis as well as the Office of General Counsel for their efforts.</p>

<div> Equity markets, rules, Commission, Regulation NMS, minimum quotation increment
Summary:<br /><br />The Commission is updating rules for equity markets to enhance competition, efficiency, and fairness, benefitting investors and capital formation. It addresses changes in technology, pricing, fee caps, and order definitions to improve market transparency, fairness, and efficiency. <div>
<p>Today, the Commission will consider updating rules for the $55 trillion equity markets. I am pleased to support these rules because they would enhance competition, efficiency, and fairness, benefitting investors and capital formation alike.</p>
<p>In 1975, Congress tasked the Securities and Exchange Commission with responsibility to facilitate the establishment of the national market system and enhance competition in the securities markets, including the equity markets. Based on these new authorities, starting in 1978 and through 2005, the Commission has taken a number of actions promoting efficiency and competition in the equity markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-statement-regulation-nms-091824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>A lot has changed&mdash;in technology and business models&mdash;since we last took a comprehensive review of the national market system rules (Regulation NMS) in 2005.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-statement-regulation-nms-091824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>First, transaction volume in listed equities has doubled in the last five years and tripled in the last 17 years.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-statement-regulation-nms-091824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;Second, the markets have moved to overwhelmingly trade electronically. Third, stocks representing approximately 74 percent of share volume are currently being quoted at less than 1.5 pennies. This compares to 2005 when 54 percent of stocks traded at less than 1.5 pennies.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-statement-regulation-nms-091824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;Fourth, a large and growing portion of the market is being transacted off-exchange in what many call the dark markets. As of 2023, approximately 45 percent of share volume was executed in the dark markets,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-statement-regulation-nms-091824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;up from 25 percent in 2009.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-statement-regulation-nms-091824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;Lastly, there has been a significant increase in everyday investor participation in the markets. Per Federal Reserve statistics, about 58 percent of American households own stocks.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-statement-regulation-nms-091824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>Thus, I think it&rsquo;s incumbent upon us to update our national market system rules. I believe the updates we&rsquo;re considering today will help drive greater efficiency, competition, and fairness in our equity markets.</p>
<p>The updated rules would relax the one-penny minimum quotation increment first adopted in 2005. For many stocks, under the updated rule, the new minimum would be half a penny. Reducing what&rsquo;s known as the &ldquo;tick size&rdquo; will benefit investors and market participants by allowing stocks to be priced more efficiently and competitively. This will lower costs for investors as well as improve liquidity, competition, and price efficiency in the markets.</p>
<p>When I started on Wall Street, markets were quoted in fractions of dollars as they had been all the way back to the 18<span>th</span>&nbsp;century. By the 1990s, though stock exchanges had shifted their rules to allow quotes in sixteenths of a dollar, investors were clamoring for lower quote increments. Such wide spreads may have benefited brokers and dealers, but investors benefit when quoted spreads are tighter.</p>
<p>Thus, in 2000, the SEC required the exchanges<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-statement-regulation-nms-091824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;to move to decimalization.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-statement-regulation-nms-091824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;Market participants would be allowed to decide a minimum quote as long as it was in decimals. In doing so, the Commission stated that it &ldquo;believes that decimal pricing could benefit investors by enhancing investor comprehension, facilitating globalization of our markets, and potentially reducing transactions costs, depending on the minimum price variant used.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later, in proposing Regulation NMS in 2004, the SEC observed that &ldquo;the move to decimals (and specifically the move to a penny MPV [minimum price variation] for equity securities) also has reduced spreads, thus resulting in reduced trading costs for investors entering orders&mdash;particularly smaller orders&mdash;that are executed at or within the quotations.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-statement-regulation-nms-091824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p>The Commission also observed that while the benefits justified decimal pricing, there were potential costs when some market participants use de minimis quotes, stepping ahead of existing limit orders. Resting limit orders provide what economists call liquidity to the markets. To address this concern, when the Commission adopted Regulation NMS, it included the so-called &ldquo;sub-penny rule&rdquo; setting a minimum quotation increment of one penny.</p>
<p>A lot has changed since 2005.</p>
<p>First, I think it&rsquo;s time to relax that limit on the market. The one-penny minimum has become outdated and too wide for many stocks in today&rsquo;s markets. As I mentioned, in 2023 approximately 74 percent of share volume is being quoted at less than 1.5 pennies. While the Commission sought public comment on possibly reducing the tick size even further, I think it&rsquo;s appropriate to take this incremental step in allowing trading centers to quote down to half a penny.</p>
<p>Second, in light of relaxing the minimum for quoting increments, it also is appropriate to lower the maximum fee that can be charged to access the best bid or best offer on an exchange. As part of Regulation NMS in 2005, the Commission set a cap of three-tenths of a penny on the fees that exchanges could charge for access. As the Commission said in 2005, for quotations to be fair and useful, &ldquo;there must be some limit on the extent to which the true price for those who access quotations can vary from the displayed price.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-statement-regulation-nms-091824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p>Over the years, the Commission has received many requests to lower the cap to both address market distortions and reflect changes in the market since 2005.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-statement-regulation-nms-091824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;As further discussed in today&rsquo;s release, market participants have raised at least five concerns with the current level of the access fee cap. It: 1) undermines price transparency 2) introduces unnecessary complexity 3) adds to market fragmentation 4) raises potential conflicts of interest between brokers and their customers, and 5) benefits sophisticated market participants at the expense of other market participants.</p>
<p>Lowering the access fee cap from three-tenths to one-tenth of a penny, together with the changes to the minimum quoting increment, will lower costs for investors.</p>
<p>Third, the updated rule would ensure that traders can determine, at the time of executing a trade, any rebates of the access fee that may be paid to them on that trade. This transparency on rebates along with lowering of the access fee caps would promote efficiency, competition, and fairness in our markets.</p>
<p>Fourth, the final rules would implement an updated definition of a round lot. The current definition for round lots, 100 shares, is more than 120 years old. It no longer reflects today&rsquo;s markets, particularly given the high prices at which many stocks trade. This matters because, under the Order Protection Rule adopted in 2005, only orders in round lots are provided price protection across the markets. Further, the updated definition of round lots would bring more quotes into the National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO), potentially leading investors to benefit from better pricing.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the final rules would implement a more flexible definition for round lots. Under this definition, a round lot&rsquo;s size will be tiered (to 100, 40, 10, or 1 share), depending on the price of the share.</p>
<p>Finally, today&rsquo;s updated rules will provide investors greater transparency on quotes for orders smaller than a round lot (so-called &ldquo;odd lots&rdquo;). Odd-lots comprise a growing percentage of market transactions, particularly for everyday investors.</p>
<p>The reforms we&rsquo;re considering today will help promote greater transparency, competition, fairness, and efficiency in our $55 trillion equity markets. That goes to the heart of the SEC&rsquo;s mission. The reforms are pro-investors. They are pro-capital formation.</p>

Also on January 26, 1978, the Commission issued a statement declaring its intention to encourage, if not mandate, the prompt development of comprehensive market linkage and order routing systems among the various markets, brokers, and dealers in qualified securities (Exchange Act Release No. 14416 (January 26, 1978), 43 FR 4354 (February 1, 1978). The Commission provisionally approved the &ldquo;ITS Plan&rdquo; on April 14, 1978 (Exchange Act Release No. 14661 (April 14, 1978), 43 FR 17419 (April 24, 1978)).</p>
<p>Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, the Commission approved a number of self-regulatory organization rules to improve the markets. These included requiring mandatory participation by Nasdaq market makers in the Small Order Execution System (Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34-25791 (June 9, 1988)), 53 FR 22594 (June 16 1988), and prohibiting Nasdaq market makers holding customer limit orders from trading ahead of those orders (Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34279 (June 29, 1994), 59 FR 34883 (July 7, 1994) ("Manning I"); Securities Exchange Act Release No. 35751 (May 22, 1995), 60 FR 27997 (May 26, 1995) ("Manning II").</p>
<p>In the 1990s, the Commission believed that further regulatory initiatives were warranted. It adopted rules to require enhanced disclosure of payment for order flow practices (Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34902 (October 27, 1994)), 59 FR 55006 (November 2, 1994) (&ldquo;Payment for Order Flow Release&rdquo;), the &ldquo;Display Rule&rdquo; and amendments to the &ldquo;Quote rule&rdquo; (collectively known as the &ldquo;Order Handling Rules&rdquo;, Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34&ndash;37619A (September 6, 1996), 61 FR 48290 (September 12, 1996), and Regulation ATS (Securities Exchange Act Release No. 40760 (Dec. 8, 1998), 63 FR 70844 (Dec. 22, 1998).</p>
<p>The Commission continued to take actions to improve the national market system in the early 2000s by ordering the exchanges and Nasdaq to move to decimalization and adopt rules to improve the disclosure of order execution and routing practices (Securities Exchange Act Release 34-44060 (March 9, 2001) 66 FR 15028 (March 15, 2001). These actions culminated in the adoption of Regulation NMS (Securities Exchange Act Release No. 51808 (June 9, 2005), 70 FR 37496 (June 29, 2005)). Most notably, Regulation NMS included the &ldquo;Order Protection Rule&rdquo;, &ldquo;Access Rule&rdquo;, &ldquo;Sub-Penny Rule&rdquo;, and amendments to Market Data Rules.</p>

<div> Decrease, Stable, Foreclosures, Modifications, Residential<br />
Summary: 97.3% of mortgages were current, stable delinquency rate, decrease in new foreclosures, 5.5% decrease in modifications, report covers 11.3 million loans totaling $2.8 trillion.<br /> <div>
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) reported on the performance of first-lien mortgages in the federal banking system during the second quarter of 2024.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>OCC Mortgage Metrics Report, Second Quarter 2024</em>&nbsp;showed that 97.3 percent of mortgages included in the report were current and performing at the end of the quarter, a decrease from the 97.4 percent in first quarter 2024, and unchanged from the 97.3 percent a year ago.</p>
<p>The percentage of seriously delinquent mortgages&mdash;mortgages that are 60 or more days past due and all mortgages held by bankrupt borrowers whose payments are 30 or more days past due&mdash;remained stable from the previous quarter and a year ago.</p>
<p>Servicers initiated 6,295 new foreclosures in the second quarter of 2024, a decrease from the previous quarter and from a year earlier.</p>
<p>Servicers completed 7,488 modifications during the second quarter of 2024, a 5.5 percent decrease from the previous quarter&rsquo;s 7,926 modifications. Of these 7,488 modifications, 6,809, or 90.9 percent, were &ldquo;combination modifications&rdquo;&mdash;modifications that included multiple actions affecting the affordability and sustainability of the loan, such as an interest rate reduction and a term extension.</p>
<p>The first-lien mortgages included in the OCC&rsquo;s quarterly report comprise 21.3 percent of all residential mortgage debt outstanding in the United States or approximately 11.3 million loans totaling $2.8 trillion in principal balances.</p>
<p>This report provides information on mortgage performance through June 30, 2024, and is available on the OCC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.occ.treas.gov/publications-and-resources/publications/mortgage-metrics-reports/index-mortgage-metrics-reports.html" title="Mortgage Metrics Reports">website</a>.</p>

<title>B.C. Securities Commission To Return Additional Funds To Investor Of Illegally Distributed Securities</title>

<p>The B.C. Securities Commission (BCSC) will&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/-/media/PWS/New-Resources/Decision-and-Orders/Decisions/2024/2024-BCSECCOM-407.pdf" target="_blank">return</a>&nbsp;an additional $178,750 to an investor who lost money as a result of an illegal distribution of securities.</p>
<p>The investor provided $1.75 million to Bracetek Industries Group Ltd. after obtaining a $2 million mortgage. She was assisted in the investment by Geoffrey Rajay Sidhu, the son of Bracetek&rsquo;s sole officer and director.</p>
<p>Bracetek did not file a prospectus, a formal document providing details of an investment. The company did not have an exemption to sell securities without a prospectus, nor was the investor eligible for a non-prospectus securities purchase.</p>
<p>Sidhu&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/about/media-room/news-releases/2022/63-vancouver-man-must-pay-almost-1-million-for-illegally-distributing-securities">paid</a>&nbsp;$950,000 to the BCSC under a settlement agreement, with $900,000 of that representing the amount that Sidhu obtained as a result of his misconduct. The BCSC must make such funds available to harmed investors. As a result, the investor&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/about/media-room/news-releases/2023/93-bcsc-to-return-funds-to-investor-of-illegally-distributed-securities">received</a>&nbsp;$900,000 plus interest.</p>
<p>Separately, Bracetek was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/about/media-room/news-releases/2023/16-vancouver-company-ordered-to-pay-900k-for-illegally-selling-securities-to-vulnerable-investor">ordered</a>&nbsp;to pay $850,000, and in March 2024, the BCSC received $178,750 in partial satisfaction of that order. That amount, plus the $4,600 those funds have accrued in interest, will be paid in full to the investor, who is the only person to have filed a claim.</p>

<title>SEC Adopts Rules To Amend Minimum Pricing Increments And Access Fee Caps And To Enhance The Transparency Of Better Priced Orders</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-adopts-rules-to-amend-minimum-pricing-increments-and-access-fee-caps-and-to/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Amendments, Regulation NMS, SEC, tick size, market quality<br />
Summary:<br />
SEC adopts amendments to Regulation NMS to introduce minimum pricing increment, reduce access fee caps, increase transparency, and accelerate implementation of best priced order information. <div>
<p class="PR-Body">The Securities and Exchange Commission today adopted amendments to certain rules under Regulation NMS to adopt an additional minimum pricing increment, or &ldquo;tick size,&rdquo; for the quoting of certain NMS stocks, reduce the access fee caps for protected quotations of trading centers, increase the transparency of exchange fees and rebates, and accelerate the implementation of rules that will make information about the market&rsquo;s best priced, smaller-sized orders publicly available. The amendments are designed to reduce transaction costs and improve market quality for all investors and to help ensure that orders placed in the national market system reflect the best prices available for all investors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 1975, Congress tasked the Securities and Exchange Commission with responsibility to facilitate the establishment of the national market system and enhance competition in the securities markets, including the equity markets,&rdquo; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. &ldquo;A lot has changed &ndash; in technology and business models &ndash; since we last took a comprehensive review of the national market system rules in 2005. Thus, it is incumbent upon us to update our national market system rules. The reforms we adopted today will help promote greater transparency, competition, fairness, and efficiency in our $55 trillion equity markets. That goes to the heart of the SEC&rsquo;s mission. The reforms are pro-investors. They are pro-capital formation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since the adoption of Rule 612 of Regulation NMS in 2005, there has been a marked increase in trading volume related to NMS stocks that are constrained by the minimum pricing increment under the rule. Many NMS stocks would likely be priced more competitively if not constrained by a market-wide minimum pricing increment of $0.01. The amendments to Rule 612 establish a new, additional $0.005 minimum pricing increment for quotations and orders in NMS stocks that are priced at, or greater than, $1.00 per share. The tick size for all NMS stocks will be based on the Time Weighted Average Quoted Spread for the relevant NMS stock during a specified three-month Evaluation Period and thereafter assigned for a six-month period.</p>
<p>Further, the Commission adopted amendments to Rule 610 of Regulation NMS to reflect the new lower minimum pricing increment under Rule 612, address distortions associated with access fees and rebates under the existing access fee caps, address potential conflicts of interest, and increase the transparency of exchange fees, rebates, and other forms of remuneration. The amendments reduce the access fee caps for protected quotations in NMS stocks that are priced $1.00 or more to $0.001 per share. For protected quotations in NMS stocks priced less than $1.00 per share, the access fee cap will be 0.1 percent of the quotation price per share. In addition, Rule 610 will now require exchanges to make the amounts of all fees, rebates, and other forms of remuneration determinable at the time of execution.</p>
<p>Finally, to expedite the availability of information about the best prices for smaller-sized orders, the Commission accelerated the implementation of previously adopted definitions related to round lots and odd-lot information. These definitions were approved by the Commission in 2020, but their implementation has been delayed. In addition, the Commission adopted an amendment to the odd-lot information definition to require the identification of the best priced odd-lot orders that are available in the market.</p>
<p>The amendments will become effective 60 days after the publication of the adopting release in the Federal Register. For Rule 612, Rule 610, and the round lot definition, the compliance date will be the first business day of November 2025. For odd-lot information, the compliance date will be the first business day of May 2026.</p>

Summary: Project Agorá, a collaboration between central banks and private financial firms, aims to enhance cross-border payments using tokenization and blockchain technology. <div>
<p dir="ltr"><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://aminagroup.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>AMINA Bank</span></a><span>, a leading global crypto bank, is excited to announce its participation in&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.bis.org/press/p240403.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>Project Agor&aacute;</span></a><span>, launched by the&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.bis.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>Bank for International Settlements</span></a><span>&nbsp;(BIS), a group of leading central banks, and the&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.iif.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>Institute of International Finance</span></a><span>&nbsp;(IIF) to explore how tokenization can enhance wholesale cross-border payments.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Project Agor&aacute; is structured as a public-private collaboration and brings together seven central banks: Bank of France, Bank of Japan, Bank of Korea, Bank of Mexico, Swiss National Bank, Bank of England, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, convened by the BIS. AMINA Bank is one of the private financial firms, convened by the IIF, that will proceed to the next phase in the exploration of how tokenization can enhance wholesale cross-border payments.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Franz Bergmueller, CEO at AMINA said:&nbsp;</span><span>&ldquo;We at AMINA Bank relish the opportunity to participate in Project Agor&aacute;, a groundbreaking initiative that represents a significant step forward in the continuing evolution of cross-border payments. Project Agor&aacute; is set to disrupt the financial system and bring it to a level where it is not only faster, but also more secure and inclusive. Smart contracts and DLT are two major components of blockchain technology which will be the driving force of the banking sector in the future. Similarly, the market for asset tokenization is rapidly growing and estimates indicate that it could reach $16 trillion by 2030, which is 10% of the world&rsquo;s GDP. These developments highlight the significance of Project Agor&aacute;, and we are privileged to be part of this change process.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The project builds on the unified ledger concept proposed by the BIS and will investigate how tokenized commercial bank deposits can be seamlessly integrated with tokenized wholesale central bank money in a public-private programmable core financial platform. This could enhance the functioning of the monetary system and provide new solutions using smart contracts and programmability while maintaining its two-tier structure.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This major public-private partnership will seek to overcome several structural inefficiencies in how payments happen today, especially across borders, which add a layer of challenges: different legal, regulatory and technical requirements, operating hours and time zones. Plus the increased complexity of carrying out financial integrity controls (e.g. against money laundering and customer verification), which today are often repeated several times for the same transaction, depending on the number of intermediaries involved.&nbsp;</span></p>

<title>SEC Charges Broker-Dealer First Horizon With Regulation Best Interest Violations - Firm’s Structured Note Recommendations Violated Reg BI’s Compliance Obligation</title>

<div> Keywords: First Horizon Advisors, structured notes, Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI), SEC charges, compliance.

Summary: First Horizon Advisors charged for failing Reg BI compliance, violating policies and procedures, and approved structured note recommendations without documentation. <br /><br />Summary: SEC ordered First Horizon to pay a civil penalty, agreed to a cease-and-desist order, and a censure for their violations. <div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against registered broker-dealer First Horizon Advisors, Inc. for failing to maintain and enforce policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance with Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI). The charges relate to First Horizon&rsquo;s recommendations of a type of derivative security called a structured note. First Horizon agreed to pay a civil penalty of $325,000 to resolve the SEC&rsquo;s charges.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that First Horizon failed to comply with its Reg BI policies and procedures in multiple ways. For example, in 2021, First Horizon migrated more than 5,000 customer brokerage accounts to its system from that of a broker dealer with whom First Horizon had merged. Because of incompatibilities in the two systems First Horizon did not have accurate customer information necessary to review structured note recommendations for compliance with First Horizon&rsquo;s Reg BI policies and procedures. In addition, the registered representatives who joined First Horizon from the merging broker-dealer did not have access to First Horizon&rsquo;s exception reporting site to review structured notes transactions flagged as non-compliant, as required by First Horizon&rsquo;s Reg BI policies and procedures. The SEC&rsquo;s order also finds that, in 2023, the firm approved structured note recommendations without all the documentation required by its Reg BI policies and procedures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To help reduce the chance of retail customer harm, Reg BI requires broker-dealers to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance with Reg BI as a whole,&rdquo; said Osman Nawaz, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division&rsquo;s Complex Financial Instruments Unit. &ldquo;This action underscores that broker-dealers must ensure appropriate compliance around complex financial products and that it is not enough to simply have written policies; firms must also enforce them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that First Horizon violated Reg BI&rsquo;s Compliance Obligation. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, First Horizon agreed to a cease-and-desist order, a censure, and the above-mentioned civil penalty.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Caryn Trombino, Melissa Lessenberry, and Stephanie Reinhart under the supervision of Armita Cohen and Osman Nawaz of the Complex Financial Instruments Unit and Paul Montoya of the Chicago Regional Office. The team was assisted by Alex Lefferts of the Enforcement Division&rsquo;s Office of Investigative and Market Analytics. The examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Michael Wells, David Kinsella, Joon Kwak, Keith Frisz, Benjamin Kempton, Edward Holland, and John Brodersen of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Examinations, Chicago Regional Office.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Publishes Update On Cash Savings Market And Fair Value</title>

<div> Update, FCA, savings market, interest rates, value assessment
Summary:<br /><br />The FCA has increased average interest on easy access savings accounts, encouraged shopping around, and expects firms to improve value assessments. Applies Consumer Duty to open and closed products. <div>
<p><span>The FCA has published an update on the actions we have taken since our July 2023 cash savings market review, and the work we have done with the largest 9 firms on the value they provide.</span></p>
<p><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p><a class="btn btn-primary" href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/multi-firm-reviews/fca-update-cash-savings-september-2024" title="FCA update on cash savings - September 2024">Read the FCA update on cash savings</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The average interest paid on easy access savings accounts rose to 2.11% in June 2024, up from 1.66% in July 2023 when we published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/action-plan-cash-savings" title="FCA sets out 14-point action plan on cash savings">our review</a>. We estimate savers are &pound;4bn a year better off from higher interest rates as a result.</p>
<p>Our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/data/cash-savings-profitability-analysis" title="Cash savings profitability analysis">latest analysis</a>&nbsp;also shows that while firms were benefitting as base rates increased, these benefits were increasingly passed to savers.</p>
<p>We continue to encourage savers to shop around to get the most from their money. There were 174 accounts that offered over 4% interest in August, while the largest firms continue to pay below average for easy access products. Switching is straightforward &ndash; and 89% of ISA switches happen within 7 days. Consumers should also consider if easy access accounts are best suited to their savings needs.</p>
<p>As the base rate has started to fall, this has impacted the interest rates offered. We will continue to closely monitor firms&rsquo; future savings rate changes. However, we expect that our interventions to improve competition and support better communications will continue to have a positive impact. Savers who are able to switch should be able to continue to access the best deals.</p>
<p>We found room for improvement in how firms assess the value offered by their savings products. We expect firms to improve these assessments, having considered our feedback, and will take appropriate action where this is not the case.</p>
<p>While we will continue to monitor the savings market, we do not anticipate providing further savings updates unless we identify market-wide concerns in the future. Since July 2024, the Consumer Duty applies to both open and closed products, and we now expect firms to take action in relation to closed book products.</p>
<p>We have also published an update on how firms across the financial services sector have assessed their products and services against the price and value outcome of the Consumer Duty. This outcome sets out that the price a customer pays for a product should be reasonable compared to the overall benefits they get. We have highlighted the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/good-and-poor-practice/price-value-outcome-good-poor-practice-update" title="Price and Value Outcome: Good and Poor  Practice update">good and poor practice</a>&nbsp;we have seen in relation to 3 markets &ndash; cash savings, GAP insurance and cash on investment platforms &ndash; but the findings will be relevant to all firms who need to demonstrate that their products provide fair value to retail customers.</p>

<title>New UK Financial Conduct Authority Rules To Protect Access To Cash Already Having An Impact</title>

<div> FCA, cash access, new rules, LINK, banking hub <br />
Summary:<br />Since the new FCA rules in July, LINK has reassessed local needs, resulting in 15 new banking hubs, 6 new ATMs, and enhanced services in 6 areas. The rules require banks to assess local cash access and provide additional services if needed, ensuring continued access for the 3.1 million adults who rely on cash. <br /> <div>
<p align="left">New rules from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to protect access to cash have come into force and are already having a positive impact in local communities.</p>
<p align="left">Since the rules were confirmed in July, LINK, which manages the UK&rsquo;s cash access and ATM network, has reassessed the needs of local areas where banking services are changing. As a result of this:</p>
<ul>
<li>15 communities, which had not previously been assessed as needing a banking hub, will now get one.</li>
<li>6 communities will now have an ATM at their banking hub.</li>
<li>6 areas will get an automated deposit service or enhanced post office.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Existing services will not be removed before the replacement services are in place. These changes are a direct result of the new rules.</p>
<p align="left">Under the rules, banks and building societies must assess whether changes to local services, like closing branches or cash machines, leave local communities lacking ways to take out or pay in cash. Additionally, residents, businesses, local representatives and charities who feel there is a gap in cash access can request a review. Charities or local groups will be able to share a collective view of community needs, including the most vulnerable residents and businesses which rely heavily on cash.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">LINK will then have 12 weeks to do an assessment which examines whether there are gaps in the ability to deposit and withdraw cash. If there are significant gaps, banks and building societies will need to deliver additional cash services to meet the local areas&rsquo; needs. These could include banking hubs, cash machines, deposit ATMs and Post Office facilities. The FCA will use data to oversee how the rules are working in practice.</p>
<p align="left">Sheldon Mills, Executive Director for Consumers and Competition at the FCA, said:</p>
<p align="left">&ldquo;The way we spend money is changing, and far fewer of us use cash day-to-day. We don&rsquo;t want to stand in the way of change, but we do want to ensure reasonable access for those who continue to rely on cash. Our new rules are already having an impact, protecting vital services for communities across the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="left">The FCA&rsquo;s 2022 Financial Lives Survey found that while digital payments are popular, 3.1 million adults still use cash for everyday payments. The new rules are intended to ensure that individuals and businesses who rely on cash can continue to access it.</p>

<div> transcription, voice surveillance, Global Relay, AI-enabled, recordkeeping
Summary:<br /><br />Global Relay offers AI-enabled voice transcription services for recordkeeping and surveillance, supporting multilingual capabilities and speaker separation for compliance teams. <div>
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.globalrelay.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Global Relay</a>, a leading provider of digital communications and recordkeeping, announces AI-enabled voice-to-text transcription services to support the heightened need for voice communications surveillance.</p>
<p>As organizations place more reliance on voice and video platforms to deliver business meetings virtually, the pressure escalates for firms to increase their recordkeeping and surveillance capabilities to include these channels.</p>
<p>Global Relay's end-to-end voice transcription enables organizations to archive and monitor voice, alongside all other communications data &ndash; for a complete and unified solution for data capture. Currently the ground-breaking service can transcribe 57 languages into their original language to meet the demands of today&rsquo;s global market. Once archived, transcriptions can be downloaded directly into English, on demand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our solution goes beyond just transcribing voice communications, it&rsquo;s intelligent transcription,&rdquo; says Warren Roy, CEO and Founder of Global Relay. &ldquo;Compliance teams expect to monitor and act on all the data in their archive &ndash; voice included. When choosing a transcription service, they want the highest levels of data security, accuracy, and control &ndash; which are fundamentals for Global Relay and we&rsquo;re proud to be one of the most accurate solutions on the market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trained on vast, multilingual datasets, Global Relay&rsquo;s AI-enabled transcription service recognizes complex speech patterns, including technical language, slang, and accents, while omitting background noise. Using a Large Language Model, voice communications are accurately transcribed to text, allowing the same keyword analysis that firms have for emails, texts, and other communications channels. Features such as speaker separation also makes reviewing conversations quick and seamless for regulated firms conducting voice surveillance.</p>

<title>ASIC Urges Businesses To Prepare For Mandatory Climate Reporting</title>

<div> climate reporting, Australian businesses, financial institutions, ASIC, mandatory

Summary:<br />ASIC urges large Australian businesses and financial institutions to prepare mandatory sustainability reports on climate-related financial disclosures. Entities are categorized in three groups with phased reporting requirements.<br />Summary: <div>
<p>From 1 January 2025, many large Australian businesses and financial institutions will need to prepare annual sustainability reports containing mandatory climate-related financial disclosures, following the passage of a major bill through Parliament.</p>
<p>The Treasury Laws Amendment (Financial Market Infrastructure and Other Measures) Bill 2024 (Cth) passed Parliament on 9 September 2024 and received Royal Assent on 17 September 2024.</p>
<p>ASIC Commissioner Kate O&rsquo;Rourke urged those entities captured by the rollout to proactively engage with these mandatory climate reporting requirements.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Large businesses and financial institutions should ensure that they implement appropriate governance arrangements and sustainability record-keeping processes ahead of the mandatory climate reporting requirements taking effect from 1 January 2025,&rsquo; said Commissioner O&rsquo;Rourke.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is a significant reform that will have far-reaching implications for many of our key stakeholders. ASIC recognises there will be a period of transition as organisations develop the capabilities required to comply. We will take a proportional and pragmatic approach to supervision and enforcement as industry adjusts to these new requirements.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Throughout this transition, ASIC will continue to ensure current disclosure and governance standards in relation to voluntary sustainability disclosures are maintained and that entities comply with their existing legal obligations. This includes the longstanding prohibition against misleading and deceptive conduct.</p>
<p>To assist reporting entities, ASIC has established a dedicated&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/sustainability-reporting/" title="Sustainability reporting">sustainability reporting page</a>&nbsp;on the ASIC website to provide information about the new regime and how ASIC will administer it. We encourage reporting entities to refer to this page as an ongoing resource as it will be updated with further information and regulatory guidance.</p>
<p>ASIC will consult with stakeholders on issuing new and/or updated regulatory guidance to assist them in complying with their sustainability reporting obligations. This will include specific guidance about ASIC&rsquo;s approach to relief from the sustainability reporting obligations as well as how the regime will interact with existing legal and regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>Commissioner O&rsquo;Rourke said, &lsquo;As more people consider environmental sustainability when making financial decisions, climate disclosure will continue to grow in importance. Enhanced climate disclosure will also benefit reporting entities themselves, enabling them to better understand their climate-related risks and opportunities over the short, medium and long term.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The mandatory climate reporting requirements will be phased in over the next three years across three groups of reporting entities, with the first reporting cohort required to prepare annual sustainability reports for the financial year commencing on or after 1 January 2025. The second and third reporting cohorts are required to prepare annual sustainability reports for the financial years commencing on or after 1 July 2026 and 1 July 2027 respectively.</p>
<p>ASIC is urging all reporting entities, including those in the second and third reporting cohorts, to begin preparing for the new climate disclosure regime.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>On 27 March 2024, the Australian Government introduced the&nbsp;<em>Treasury Laws Amendment (Financial Market Infrastructure and Other Measures) Bill 2024</em>&nbsp;(Cth) into the Australian Parliament, which proposed mandatory climate reporting for large businesses and financial institutions in Australia through amendments to the&nbsp;<em>Corporations Act 2001</em>&nbsp;(Cth) and the&nbsp;<em>Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001</em>&nbsp;(Cth).</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s dedicated sustainability reporting page includes information regarding:</p>
<ul>
<li>the sustainability reporting obligations</li>
<li>our role in administering the regime</li>
<li>our approach to enforcement in the regime&rsquo;s early days, and</li>
<li>our approach to relief and our forward work plan.</li>
</ul>

<title>Major Singapore Retail Banks To Introduce Singpass Face Verification, Further Strengthening Resilience Against Phishing Scams</title>

<div> Singpass Face Verification, digital token, retail banks, security measure, scams<br />
Summary:<br />
Major retail banks in Singapore will implement Singpass Face Verification to strengthen digital token setup, using face scan to verify customer's identity for added security against scams. MAS and ABS urge consumers to be vigilant and practice good cyber hygiene.<br /> <div>
<p><span>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and The Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) today announced that major retail banks in Singapore will progressively implement Singpass Face Verification (SFV) over the next three months to strengthen the digital token (DT) setup process for retail banking customers.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>2.<span> </span></span><span>SFV will be triggered in higher risk scenarios to strengthen and complement existing authentication methods for DT setup. SFV uses a face scan to verify a customer&rsquo;s identity against national records before the customer&rsquo;s DT can be activated for use. This makes it more difficult for a scammer to take over a customer&rsquo;s DT by setting it up on his own device using phished credentials such as an SMS, one-time passwords (OTPs) and/or bank card information.</span></p>
<p><span>3.<span> </span></span><span>Customers who do not have a Singpass account may register for one and download the Singpass app before setting up their DT.</span></p>
<p>4.<span> </span>The use of SFV is the latest security measure that banks are rolling out to protect customers from scams. Other initiatives and self-help tools include the phasing out of OTPs for bank account login by DT users and the Money Lock feature, through which customers can &ldquo;lock up&rdquo; specified amounts of their funds that cannot be accessed digitally. These various measures will serve to step up our collective defence against scams.</p>
<p>5.<span> </span>Mrs Ong-Ang Ai Boon, Director, ABS, said: &ldquo;Singpass Face Verification gives customers increased protection against unauthorised access to their bank accounts, adding to the suite of measures and tools that banks have provided customers to empower them to guard themselves against scams. While banks will continue to do their part to fight scams, customers need to be vigilant themselves and practice good cyber hygiene.&rdquo;</p>
<p>6.<span> </span>Ms Loo Siew Yee, Assistant Managing Director (Policy, Payments &amp; Financial Crime), MAS, said, &ldquo;The use of Singpass Face Verification will significantly strengthen the process of digital token set up. This is important as the digital token will be used as a factor to approve subsequent transactions. MAS will continue to work closely with banks on measures to protect customers against scams. We urge consumers to maintain vigilance and avoid falling prey to scams by keeping updated on the latest scam tactics, practising good cyber hygiene and making use of Money Lock.&rdquo;</p>

<div> charges, institutional investment managers, Forms 13F, civil penalties, violations

Summary:
SEC charged 11 investment firms for failing to file Forms 13F and 13H, settling with penalties up to $725,000. Cooperation and self-reporting mitigated penalties. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against 11 institutional investment managers for failing to file reports, known as Forms 13F, that they were required to file because they have discretion over more than $100 million in certain securities. Two of the entities, Nationale-Nederlanden Powszechne Towarzystwo Emerytalne S.A. (Nationale-Nederlanden) and NEPC, LLC, were also charged with failing to file Forms 13H as required for large traders who trade a significant amount of exchange-listed securities. All 11 firms agreed to settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges. Nine of the firms will pay more than $3.4 million in combined civil penalties. Two firms were not ordered to pay any civil penalties because they self-reported the violations at issue and otherwise cooperated with the SEC&rsquo;s investigations, and another (NEPC, LLC) was not ordered to pay a civil penalty for its failure to file Forms 13H because it self-reported those violations and otherwise cooperated with the SEC&rsquo;s investigations.</p>
<p>The institutional investment managers charged and their respective penalties are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ashton Thomas Private Wealth, LLC - $375,000</li>
<li>Azzad Asset Management, Inc. - $225,000</li>
<li>Bulltick Wealth Management, LLC - $175,000</li>
<li>Dixon Mitchell Investment Counsel, Inc. - no financial penalty</li>
<li>Financial Synergies Wealth Advisors, Inc. - $225,000</li>
<li>Focus Financial Network, Inc. - $475,000</li>
<li>Mason Investment Advisory Services, Inc. - $525,000</li>
<li>Nationale-Nederlanden - no financial penalty</li>
<li>NEPC, LLC - $725,000</li>
<li>TD Private Client Wealth, LLC - $475,000</li>
<li>Traphagen Investment Advisors, LLC - $225,000</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;The integrity of the securities markets depends largely on firms providing accurate, timely information about their securities holdings and trading activity,&rdquo; said Jason Burt, Director of the Denver Regional Office. &ldquo;These resolutions illustrate how seriously the Commission takes non-compliance as well as the benefits a firm may derive from self-reporting its non-compliance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigations of Ashton Thomas Private Wealth, Azzad Asset Management, Bulltick Wealth Management, Financial Synergies Wealth Advisors, Focus Financial Network, Mason Investment Advisory Services, NEPC, TD Private Client Wealth, and Traphagen Investment Advisors were conducted by Michael Cates, Abigail Edwards, Jacqueline Moessner, and Jennifer Turner, under the supervision of Laura Metcalfe, Nicholas Heinke, and Jason Burt of the Denver Regional Office. The SEC&rsquo;s investigation of Dixon Mitchell Investment Counsel was conducted by Erin East under the supervision of Stephen Donahue, Andrew Dean, and Corey Schuster of the Division of Enforcement&rsquo;s Asset Management Unit. The SEC&rsquo;s investigation of Nationale-Nederlanden was conducted by Caitlin Giaimo under the supervision of Celeste Chase, Sheldon Pollock, and Antonia Apps of the New York Regional Office.&nbsp;</p>

<div> Treasury market, Liquidity, Regulations, Central clearing, Market resilience
Summary:
Treasury market resilience, primary and secondary markets, regulatory efforts, central clearing implementation, repo market reforms, and leverage monitoring are crucial. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Thank you for the invitation to be part of this impressive conference on financial market quality and the opportunity to speak with you.<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2584#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>[1]</span></a></p>
<p>In my remarks today, I will focus on the Treasury market. This market serves the role of financing our government at the lowest cost to the taxpayer over time and is at the core of global financial markets. It provides the benchmark risk-free yield curve, and it helps underpin the role of the dollar in global transactions. And being the deepest and most liquid market in the world, it serves as a key source of safe and liquid assets for investors and is used for liquidity risk management by many financial firms, both banks and nonbanks.</p>
<p>The Treasury market has evolved significantly over the last couple decades, driven in part by regulatory and technological changes&mdash;themes that connect naturally with this conference&rsquo;s focus on &ldquo;innovation and uncertainty.&rdquo; For example, increased electronic trading and shifting types of market intermediaries have changed how market liquidity is provided. While traditional dealers had been the main participants in the interdealer cash market, principal trading firms (PTFs) now represent the majority of trading activity in the futures and electronically brokered interdealer cash markets. We saw an implication of these changes in the Treasury &ldquo;flash rally&rdquo; on October 15, 2014. It was that event that led to the expansion of the work of the Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG).<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2584#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span>[2]</span></a></p>
<p>At the same time, we have seen an increase in the amount of Treasury securities outstanding relative to the capacity of dealers to provide liquidity to those markets, partly reflecting the regulations adopted in response to the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-09.<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2584#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><span>[3]</span></a>&nbsp;Moreover, in recent years, demand for U.S. Treasuries has become more broad-based and shifted toward more price-sensitive investors, such as pension funds, money market funds, mutual funds, and hedge funds.<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2584#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><span>[4]</span></a>&nbsp;Some of these funds are reliant on the ability to quickly sell Treasuries to meet liquidity needs, which increases the potential for surges in Treasury sales.</p>
<p>I will turn now to an overview of current Treasury market conditions. Next, I will review our most significant efforts in recent years to strengthen the resilience of the Treasury market. Finally, I will conclude with a few thoughts on some unfinished business.</p>
<h3><span>Current Treasury Market Conditions</span></h3>
<p>To assess Treasury market functioning, we monitor a variety of metrics for both the secondary and primary markets. These metrics are similar to the ones followed broadly by market participants.</p>
<p>The figure on the left of this slide shows our composite index of trading conditions for 2-year and 10-year Treasury securities, from 2019 to present. Its inputs are bid-ask spreads, market depth, and price impact measures; higher values indicate higher costs of transacting and less-liquid market conditions. There are two things to note: first, costs can rise sharply, as evident in March 2020 at the onset of the pandemic, and in March 2023, when several banks faced depositor runs and failed. Second, costs generally do not vary significantly day-to-day, but have been slightly higher since mid-2022 than in the period before. This pattern reflects the fact that transaction costs are generally highly correlated with interest rate volatility. You can see this relationship in the right panel. There is an upward slope between rate volatility and this index for the 10-year Treasury note, with volatility and costs lowest in 2019 and both higher in 2022 and 2023.</p>
<p>You can also see the red dots &ldquo;above the cloud,&rdquo; which illustrates that in March 2020, transaction costs were much higher than might be expected even given the higher volatility. This outsized reaction illustrates the &ldquo;dash for cash&rdquo; episode when Treasury prices fell sharply, in contrast to a typical pattern for prices to rise in periods of high uncertainty when investors run to safety. It reflects that some investors, including open-end bond funds and hedge funds, rapidly sold Treasury securities to meet redemptions or margin calls, in amounts that exceeded the ability or willingness of dealers to supply liquidity. In this episode, the Federal Reserve had to step in and purchased Treasury securities in significant amounts to support smooth market functioning.</p>
<p>Since then, market liquidity conditions have been more stable. When volatility rose sharply in 2023 after the bank deposit runs, the higher transaction costs, shown by the purple dots for 2023, were relatively in line with the volatility. Importantly, market conditions remained orderly, and moderately reduced liquidity did not amplify volatility during this period. I would note that the event in early August of this year is captured within the green dot cloud, suggesting that the steep drop in global stock prices with some unwinding of carry trades did not cause a deterioration in Treasury market liquidity.</p>
<p>Turning to primary markets, they also are functioning well. Treasury&rsquo;s longstanding &ldquo;regular and predictable&rdquo; issuance strategy, described recently by Assistant Secretary Josh Frost, helps to support smooth market functioning.<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2584#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><span>[5]</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;On this slide, you can see two commonly used metrics to assess primary market functioning for the 2- and 10-year Treasury notes. One indicator is the bid-to-cover ratio&mdash;the total amount of bids divided by the total amount of Treasury debt offered for sale. This measure has been stable and well above 1 over the past several years, notably even when there were sharp increases in secondary market costs in March 2020. Bid-to-cover also has not changed as issuance has been increasing, suggesting continued strong demand for Treasury securities.</p>
<p>Similarly, as shown on the right, data on auction tails&mdash;which compares the yield set in the auction with the yield in when-issued trading&mdash;show that auction results have fluctuated both above and below market expectations within a pretty tight range (of +/- 3 basis points), even as the variability increased when interest rate volatility moved up starting in 2022.</p>
<h3><span>A Review of Recent Efforts to Increase the Resilience of the Treasury Market</span></h3>
<p>At the start of this Administration and following the &ldquo;dash for cash&rdquo; in March 2020, we embarked on a comprehensive effort to improve the infrastructure of the Treasury market to ensure that the Treasury market remains the deepest and most liquid market in the world. Through the IAWG, we set out guiding principles, including transparency that fosters public confidence, fair trading, and a liquid market, and prices that appropriately reflect economic and financial conditions.<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2584#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><span>[6]</span></a>&nbsp; We also put a strong emphasis on ensuring its resilience in periods of stress.</p>
<p>The five workstreams that are at the heart of our efforts are outlined on this next slide. We&rsquo;ve documented our progress each year and will publish a new update next week. Overall, we have made significant progress, as I will describe, even as some work remains.</p>
<p>Starting with improving data quality and disclosures, we have made great strides. Working with FINRA, starting in February 2023, we began publishing aggregate transaction volume data on a daily basis&mdash;only weekly data were available before that. Furthermore, earlier this year, we began to disclose data on price and volume (with caps) for on-the-run securities at the transaction-level at the end of each day. While we have greatly expanded data availability for market participants, we also have been deliberate to avoid potential harms such as disclosing data that could reveal confidential trading positions.</p>
<p>In addition, we have taken steps to close a large data gap in the critically important repo market, for non-centrally cleared bilateral repo. Data collection at the transaction level will start in December, based on the rule finalized by the Office of Financial Research. These new data will allow the official sector to better assess vulnerabilities in this market.</p>
<p>Second, to strengthen the resilience of market intermediation, Treasury started a buyback program earlier this year. This program creates predictable opportunities for dealers to sell off-the-run securities, which should encourage market-making and free up balance sheet allocated to less-liquid positions. We are monitoring closely how this new program will affect trading activity and liquidity.</p>
<p>In addition, relative to March 2020, there now are two Federal Reserve facilities that should support liquidity in periods of high stress: the Standing Repo Facility (SRF) to finance Treasury repo with pre-authorized banks and primary dealers, and the Foreign and International Monetary Authorities (FIMA) facility for certain foreign central banks.</p>
<p>Third, on trading venues and oversight, the SEC adopted new rules this year that requires firms that have significant liquidity-provision roles, such as PTFs, to register with the SEC as a dealer, and is working to finalize its proposed Regulation ATS to enhance the resilience of electronic trading venues. The new rules recognize the emergence of new types of firms and practices based on advances in data and computing, and will better protect investors and promote market stability. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Fourth, a key IAWG initiative was to evaluate central clearing for Treasury securities.<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2584#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><span>[7]</span></a>&nbsp;After substantive engagement with market participants and other regulators, the SEC adopted final rules to require central clearing of Treasury securities transactions. Expanded central clearing could increase the intermediation capacity of dealers through netting. It also could reduce counterparty risk and increase transparency in these markets, and incentivize some all-to-all trading. &nbsp;Market participants are working towards deadlines for cash securities by year-end 2025 and for repo by the end of June 2026.</p>
<p>All these efforts help to ensure the Treasury market remains liquid and resilient. However, there is also some unfinished business; I will touch on these next.</p>
<h3><span>What Remains&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p>Continuing with central clearing, there is important implementation work ahead.&nbsp; The new mandate will lead to a significant increase in the volume of transactions to be centrally cleared, and currently there is only one firm that clears U.S. Treasuries. Other firms have signaled an interest in entering this market, which raises interesting questions around the benefits and costs of having multiple clearinghouses for Treasuries. Would participants benefit from greater competition, or would they lose netting benefits? From a macro perspective, are there gains to operational resilience from multiple clearinghouses or higher risks from additional complexity? Regulators will need to monitor progress and address these types of questions.</p>
<p>While central clearing should help ease dealer balance sheet constraints, as I mentioned, the banking regulators also should consider changes to the supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) to improve the elasticity of the supply of market liquidity. Proposed options include excluding reserves held at the central bank and making the enhanced-SLR buffer countercyclical, to be released in periods of market-wide stress.<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2584#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><span>[8]</span></a>&nbsp;These types of changes could be accomplished without reducing the overall amount of capital in the system and would allow bank dealers to be better able to make markets in periods of stress.</p>
<p>Finally, as I noted earlier and going back to the fifth workstream, Treasury securities are used for liquidity risk management by some types of investment funds, such as open-end bond and loan mutual funds, which have grown to hold a significant share of corporate credit. These funds have a liquidity mismatch between daily redemptions offered to shareholders and the longer time it takes to sell the underlying bonds and loans. To address this &ldquo;phantom&rdquo; liquidity and the need to rapidly sell large amounts of Treasuries for liquidity (as we saw in March 2020), the IAWG advocated for reforms and the SEC proposed a rule with some options. However, there was substantial industry pushback because of operational impediments to swing pricing, and the recently issued final rule dropped this feature.<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2584#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"><span>[9]</span></a>&nbsp;The SEC and industry should continue to explore possible solutions.</p>
<p>In addition, we also saw in March 2020 that leverage in the Treasury market could become excessive and destabilizing. Much attention has focused on the cash-futures basis trade, in which hedge funds take short positions in Treasury futures corresponding to long positions by asset managers, and finance their long cash Treasury hedges with repo.<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2584#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><span>[10]</span></a>&nbsp;This basis trade supports Treasury market functioning in normal times by tying together cash and futures markets and serving as an important source of demand for Treasury securities. However, research has highlighted repo haircuts reported at zero and that deleveraging by hedge funds contributed to the dynamics in March 2020.<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2584#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"><span>[11]</span></a><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>While reported haircuts on repo may not fully reflect the leverage of the overall trade, several reforms mentioned above will shed a brighter light on practices.<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2584#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"><span>[12]</span></a>&nbsp;In the near term, the SEC now collects more Form PF data on hedge fund leverage and makes aggregated data available, and bank supervisors are enhancing their work on how banks manage their hedge fund exposures.<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2584#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"><span>[13]</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span>Over time, the new data collection on bilateral repo transactions and the central clearing mandate for repo should improve transparency and standardization, providing some market-based discipline to prevent excessive leverage from building. As the basis trade remains sizable, it is important for regulators to continue to monitor leverage, and to balance the benefits of leverage for repo versus resilience in periods of stress.<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2584#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14"><span>[14]</span></a></p>
<h3><span>Conclusion</span></h3>
<p>To conclude, our indicators suggest continued robust demand for Treasury securities, and the market remains the deepest and most liquid market in the world. This strength of the Treasury market is a privilege that allows the U.S. government to finance itself at a lower cost than it would otherwise. But it also comes with a responsibility to continue to ensure its resilience. For the past few years, Treasury and the financial regulators, consulting with industry, have made important changes to the market infrastructure. I believe these changes have made the Treasury market more transparent and more resilient, even as some work remains. Of course, we should expect that the market will continue to evolve with new technologies and innovations, and regulators will need to continue to address new risks while allowing for the benefits of innovations as they arise.</p>
<p>Thanks again, I now look forward to our conversation and your questions.</p>

<p><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2584#_ftnref9" name="_ftn9"><span>[9]</span></a>&nbsp;In particular, the industry has pointed to high costs of adjusting their operations to make swing pricing work because a fund&rsquo;s net asset value must be set before flows are recorded each day. This operational constraint appears to be a problem in the United States, but not in other jurisdictions that already feature swing pricing. One alternative to swing pricing that could be considered could be to lengthen the period in which investors should be able to redeem shares, from daily to the number of days it would typically be expected to take to sell the underlying securities even in normal periods.</p>
<p><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2584#_ftnref10" name="_ftn10"><span>[10]</span></a>&nbsp;The role of asset managers&rsquo; demand for futures is also gaining attention. See, for example, Barth, Daniel and Kahn, R. Jay and Monin, Phillip and Sokolinskiy, Oleg, &ldquo;<a class="external" href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=4816018">Reaching for Duration and Leverage in the Treasury Market</a>,&rdquo; May 3, 2024. The Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee highlighted that while mutual funds may prefer futures for several reasons, including their liquidity, there also may be some non-economic incentives. For example, there are accounting differences that require the reporting of repo borrowing as an expense, but do not apply to implied financing costs for futures. This expense may raise a fund&rsquo;s reported expense ratio, which is a metric often used by investors to evaluate a fund&rsquo;s attractiveness. For additional detail, see&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/221/TBACCharge1Q12024.pdf">TBACCharge1Q12024.pdf (treasury.gov)</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2584#_ftnref11" name="_ftn11"><span>[11]</span></a>&nbsp;See, for example,&nbsp;Barth, Daniel and R.

<div> Announcement, 2023 Merger Guidelines, Banking, Collaboration, Enforcement

Summary:<br /><br />The Justice Department withdraws from the 2023 Merger Guidelines, provides commentary on banking mergers, emphasizes collaboration with bank regulators, and highlights prosecutorial discretion. <div>
<p>The Justice Department announced today its withdrawal from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/atr/legacy/2007/08/14/6472.pdf">1995 Bank Merger Guidelines</a>&nbsp;and emphasized that the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/atr/2023-merger-guidelines">2023 Merger Guidelines</a>&nbsp;remain its sole and authoritative statement across all industries.</p>
<p>The department today also released commentary explaining the application of the 2023 Merger Guidelines in banking. This commentary identifies competition issues that may commonly occur in bank mergers and outlines which guidelines best inform analysis of those issues. As with the 2023 Merger Guidelines, this commentary offers transparency into the department&rsquo;s merger review process but does not create rights or obligations of any party under the laws governing mergers of banks and bank holding companies.</p>
<p>The announcement today was the result of a collaborative consultative process with the department&rsquo;s close partners at the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The announcement was also informed by robust public feedback, department experience and expertise, as well as developments in the market, law and economics.</p>
<p>Neither the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/atr/media/1368576/dl">2024 Banking Addendum</a>&nbsp;nor the 2023 Merger Guidelines predetermine enforcement action by the department. Although the 2023 Merger Guidelines identify the factors and frameworks the department considers when investigating mergers, the department&rsquo;s enforcement decisions will necessarily depend on the facts in any case and will continue to require prosecutorial discretion and judgment.</p>
<p>Throughout any bank merger review, the Justice Department works closely with the relevant bank regulators to ensure the complementary and consistent application of the laws within each agency&rsquo;s area of expertise. As is always the case, those agencies may at their discretion use their own methods for screening and evaluating bank mergers.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Multiple Individuals And Entities In Relationship Investment Scams - Schemers allegedly used WhatsApp, LinkedIn, And Instagram To Lure Investors To Fake Crypto Asset Trading Platforms Before Stealing Their Money</title>

<div> charged, relationship investment scams, fake crypto platforms, social media, enforcement actions
Summary: 
The SEC charged entities and individuals for running relationship investment scams involving fake crypto platforms, targeting investors via social media.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged five entities and three individuals in connection with two relationship investment scams involving fake crypto asset trading platforms NanoBit and CoinW6, respectively. The SEC&rsquo;s two complaints allege that the defendants solicited investors via social media apps, lied to them to gain their trust and confidence, and then stole their money. These charges are the SEC&rsquo;s first enforcement actions alleging these types of scams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Relationship investment scams, including those involving crypto asset investments, pose a risk of catastrophic harm to retail investors, and the threat is increasing rapidly as these scams become more popular with fraudsters,&rdquo; said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;In these two cases, we allege that fraudsters created fake crypto ecosystems that displayed false information to investors. Our allegations serve as a reminder to the public to be on heightened alert about potential scams involving investment opportunities promoted by strangers on social media.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint in SEC v. NanoBit Limited et al. alleges that, from approximately October 2023 to at least June 2024, scheme participants impersonated financial industry professionals in WhatsApp groups to build investors&rsquo; trust and then solicited their investments through the supposed NanoBit crypto asset trading platform. To persuade investors that the platform was safe, NanoBit allegedly falsely claimed that its affiliate, NanobitUS Securities, was an SEC-registered broker. The supposed financial professionals then touted fake initial coin offerings as a way for the investors to make substantial returns. As alleged, however, the NanoBit platform was fake, and investors&rsquo; funds in fact went to scheme participants who wired more than $2 million to bank accounts in Hong Kong and misappropriated hundreds of thousands of dollars&rsquo; worth of investors&rsquo; crypto assets.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, charges NanoBit Limited, Radiant Horizons Limited, Sweet Karma Fashion Inc., Zhao Tropical Deli Inc., Jiajie Liu, Fei Liao, and Hua Zhao with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against each defendant.</p>
<p>Separately, the SEC&rsquo;s complaint in SEC v. CoinW6 alleges that, from approximately July 2022 to at least December 2023, scheme participants who purported to be young, wealthy professionals contacted prospective investors via LinkedIn and Instagram and pursued romantic relationships over WhatsApp. Scheme participants gained investors&rsquo; trust and then convinced them to open accounts on CoinW6&rsquo;s supposed crypto asset trading platform. As alleged, the schemers claimed that investors could earn up to a three percent return per day from CoinW6&rsquo;s crypto asset staking, mining, and yield farming products. In reality, investors&rsquo; funds were misappropriated, and their ostensible investments, profits, and account balances were fictitious. When investors tried to withdraw their purported profits, the schemers allegedly demanded additional payments for taxes or fees, told investors that the crypto assets were frozen as part of a law enforcement inquiry, or tried to blackmail them using compromising romantic communications over WhatsApp.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, charges CoinW6 with offering and selling securities in unregistered offerings and with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against CoinW6.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation regarding NanoBit was conducted by Jeremy Brandt, Michael DiBattista, and Neil Hendelman of the New York Regional Office and was supervised by Rebecca Reilly and Sheldon L. Pollock. The litigation is being conducted by Todd Brody and Jeremy Brandt and supervised by Alexander Vasilescu.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation regarding CoinW6 was conducted by Matthew B. Reisig and was supervised by Timothy N. England and Melissa Hodgman.

<div> SEC, Prager Metis, audits, FTX, auditor independence
Summary:
Prager Metis CPAs settled two SEC actions, agreeing to pay $1.95 million for misconduct in FTX audits and violations of auditor independence rules. <br /><br />Summary: The SEC alleged that Prager Metis CPAs misrepresented its compliance with auditing standards regarding FTX, leading to negligence-based fraud. Prager Entities also settled for violating auditor independence rules. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Prager Metis CPAs, LLC (Prager) and its California professional services firm, Prager Metis CPAs LLP, (collectively, the Prager Entities) agreed to pay $1.95 million to resolve two actions alleging misconduct in its audits of the now-defunct crypto asset trading platform, FTX, and auditor independence violations.</p>
<p>In one of the actions, the SEC alleges that Prager misrepresented its compliance with auditing standards regarding FTX. According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, from February 2021 to April 2022, Prager issued two audit reports for FTX that falsely misrepresented that the audits complied with Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS). The SEC alleges that Prager failed to follow GAAS and its own policies and procedures by, among other deficiencies, not adequately assessing whether it had the competency and resources to undertake the audit of FTX. According to the complaint, this quality control failure led to Prager failing to comply with GAAS in multiple aspects of the audit&mdash;most significantly by failing to understand the increased risk stemming from the relationship between FTX and Alameda Research LLC, a crypto hedge fund controlled by FTX&rsquo;s CEO.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint charges Prager with negligence-based fraud. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, Prager agreed to permanent injunctions, to pay a $745,000 civil penalty, and to undertake remedial actions, including retaining an independent consultant to review and evaluate its audit, review, and quality control policies and procedures and abiding by certain restrictions on accepting new audit clients. The settlement is subject to court approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Effective investor protection requires a collaborative approach that includes both regulators and gatekeepers such as auditors. To fulfill their role, auditors must, among other things, be independent, exercise due professional care and skepticism, and comply with all applicable professional standards. As we allege in these enforcement actions, Prager Metis fell short in all of these areas,&rdquo; said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;Because Prager&rsquo;s audits of FTX were conducted without due care, for example, FTX investors lacked crucial protections when making their investment decisions. Ultimately, they were defrauded out of billions of dollars by FTX and bore the consequences when FTX collapsed. By limiting Prager&rsquo;s ability to take on new business and by requiring it to retain an independent compliance consultant, today&rsquo;s resolutions not only enhance investor protection, they also serve as a warning to audit professionals that are not appropriately meeting their gatekeeping obligations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once more we see an entity, lured by the siren song of the crypto asset markets, cutting corners on its obligations to comply with the law. As we have seen time and time again, these shortcuts do not pay.&nbsp; They do not pay for the entities who take them or for the multitude of victims that this misconduct leaves in its wake,&rdquo; said Jorge G. Tenreiro, Acting Chief of the SEC's Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit. &ldquo;Our dedicated staff will continue to pursue investigations of those who may have violated the law, even after other wrongdoers have been identified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC today also announced that the Prager Entities agreed to the entry of final judgments to settle separate,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023-214">previous charges</a>&nbsp;for violating auditor independence rules and for aiding and abetting their clients&rsquo; violations of federal securities laws. The SEC&rsquo;s complaint alleged that, between approximately December 2017 and October 2020, the Prager Entities improperly included indemnification provisions in engagement letters for more than 200 audits, reviews, and exams and, as a result, were not independent from their clients, as required under the federal securities laws.</p>
<p>The final judgments provide for permanent injunctions, combined civil penalties of $1 million, and combined disgorgement with prejudgment interest of $205,000. The Prager Entities also agreed to be censured. The settlement is subject to court approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Auditor independence is critical to investor protection and a fundamental cornerstone of the integrity of our financial markets,&rdquo; said Eric I. Bustillo, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Miami Regional Office.&nbsp;&ldquo;We are committed to this principle, and we will hold accountable auditors who violate their independence requirements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s ongoing investigation as to Prager&rsquo;s audits of FTX is being conducted by Amy Burkart, David D&rsquo;Addio, Devlin N. Su, Brian Huchro, and Pasha Salimi. It is being supervised by Michael Brennan, Amy Flaherty Hartman, and Mr. Tenreiro of the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation of the Prager Entities&rsquo; auditor independence violations was conducted by Michelle Bosworth and Carol Der Garry and supervised by Thierry Olivier Desmet, Fernando Torres, and Glenn S. Gordon in the Miami Regional Office. The SEC&rsquo;s litigation was led by Christine Nestor and Brian Lechich and supervised by Teresa Verges in the Miami Regional Office.</p>

<title>B.C. Securities Commission Bans Unregistered, Offshore Crypto Trading Platform From Operating In B.C.</title>

<div> Securities Commission, unauthorized platform, derivatives, trading, LiquiTrade <br />
Summary:<br />
BCSC prohibits LiquiTrade's unregistered trading platform, imposes penalty, and ensures compliance with securities legislation for crypto trading platforms. <div>
<p>The B.C. Securities Commission (BCSC)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/-/media/PWS/New-Resources/Decision-and-Orders/Decisions/2024/2024-BCSECCOM-406.pdf" target="_blank">has banned</a>&nbsp;the operator of an unregistered and unauthorized crypto trading platform from trading in or purchasing securities and derivatives on behalf of British Columbians.</p>
<p>The BCSC panel also prohibited LiquiTrade Ltd., which is incorporated in the Cayman Islands, from engaging in any promotional activities in B.C., and ordered it to pay an administrative penalty of $500,000.</p>
<p>The BCSC&rsquo;s prohibition of LiquiTrade&rsquo;s trading in or purchasing derivatives effectively means it can no longer legally facilitate B.C. residents&rsquo; trading in crypto assets under its current model.</p>
<p>LiquiTrade began operating a crypto trading platform known as LATOKEN in 2020. Like many other crypto trading platforms, LATOKEN doesn&rsquo;t let users directly buy and sell crypto assets; instead, users buy and sell&nbsp;<em>contractual rights&nbsp;</em>to crypto assets, and those contractual rights are derivatives.</p>
<p>A BCSC panel&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/about/media-room/news-releases/2024/62-crypto-trading-platform-operator-violated-securities-act">found</a>&nbsp;in July 2024 that LiquiTrade, through the LATOKEN platform, created a derivatives trading market, promoted derivatives, and operated as an exchange, even though LiquiTrade and LATOKEN weren&rsquo;t registered or authorized to engage in any of those activities in B.C.</p>
<p>There is no evidence that any B.C. residents lost funds as a result of LiquiTrade&rsquo;s misconduct, and the number of B.C. customers was relatively small. But the panel said, &ldquo;LiquiTrade chose to work outside of important requirements which are designed to mitigate some risks faced by investors in this province.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since the BCSC hearing in November 2023, LiquiTrade added Canada to the list of countries from which it will not accept users. In July 2024, shortly after a BCSC panel found that LiquiTrade had committed misconduct, a BCSC investigator tried to open an account with a Canadian telephone number, and later with an email address that was traceable to Vancouver; those attempts were unsuccessful. However, when he disguised his location with virtual private network software, he was able to obtain a crypto deposit address.</p>
<p>Regardless of where they are located, platforms that facilitate Canadians&rsquo; buying and selling of crypto assets must register with provincial or territorial securities regulators and abide by certain conditions to help protect investors. A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/crypto-trading-platforms-regulation-and-enforcement-actions/crypto-trading-platforms-authorized-to-do-business-with-canadians/" target="_blank">list</a>&nbsp;of crypto trading platforms authorized to do business with Canadians is available on the website of the Canadian Securities Administrators, of which the BCSC is a member.</p>
<p>The BCSC&rsquo;s action against LiquiTrade is part of an ongoing, coordinated effort by Canadian securities regulators to ensure that crypto trading platforms comply with securities legislation in Canada.</p>

<title>Grant Thornton Report: Economic Impact Of AIM</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/grant-thornton-report-economic-impact-of-aim/</link>

<div> London Stock Exchange, Grant Thornton, AIM, economic impact, UK economy<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
AIM's economic impact on the UK: £68B GVA, 778K jobs, high productivity, regional balance, overseas exports. Funding challenges require government support. <div>
<p>Today, Grant Thornton published the report &lsquo;Economic impact of AIM&rsquo;, commissioned by the London Stock Exchange, which examines the important role that AIM continues to play in supporting business growth and in doing so delivering notable economic value to the UK. Read the full report at the following link:&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.grantthornton.co.uk/insights/report-the-economic-impact-of-aim-companies/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Report: The Economic impact of AIM companies | Grant Thornton</a>.</p>
<p>Key findings of the report include:</p>
<ul>
<li>In 2023, through direct, supply chain and induced impact, the overall economic impact of AIM to the UK economy was equivalent to &pound;68.0 billion in GVA and over 778,000 jobs.</li>
<li>In addition, AIM companies made a significant corporation tax contribution of &pound;5.4 billion to the Exchequer.</li>
<li>AIM companies are, on average, more productive than the national average with productivity of &pound;87,100 GVA per employee compared to the national (UK) average of &pound;58,327 and a London (the most productive region in the UK) average of &pound;82,801.</li>
<li>AIM businesses can play an important role in helping balance regional disparities. This is particularly the case where there are clusters of AIM companies in certain regions where productivity is lower such as the Midlands, Yorkshire, the North East and parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland, for these areas AIM companies are often important anchor institutions for the local economy.</li>
<li>Between 2019 and 2023, AIM companies have consistently generated four-times as much of their revenue from overseas exports, compared to private company counterparts in the UK.</li>
<li>Since its inception almost 30 years ago, AIM companies have raised a combined &pound;48 billion in equity capital at admission and followed this with further fundraising amounting to &pound;87 billion.</li>
<li>However, while AIM has proven itself to be a robust market over nearly three decades, wider macro conditions are presenting significant challenges, with the total money raised by AIM companies falling by 71% between 2020 and 2023.</li>
<li>Therefore, if the Government&rsquo;s mission to support economic growth and in particular its desire to create &ldquo;good jobs and productivity growth in every part of the country&rdquo; is to be delivered, thriving and growing private sector businesses will be critical. To make this happen, Government should enable a funding continuum and ensure the ongoing availability of targeted fiscal incentives, that helps companies to raise external finance throughout their growth journey &ndash; such as through AIM &ndash; and in doing so facilitate their growth.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Marcus Stuttard, Head of UK Primary Markets &amp; AIM, London Stock Exchange plc, said:</b></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;As a leading growth market, AIM plays a crucial role in the provision of long-term equity capital for growth and development, supporting more than 4,000 companies to raise nearly &pound;135 billion, funding innovation, creating jobs and driving economic growth across the UK. Grant Thornton&rsquo;s research highlights the importance of AIM for the UK economy and its impact on improving productivity and regional growth.</i></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Despite AIM&rsquo;s importance to the UK economy, smaller quoted companies have been significantly impacted by outflows from UK equities in recent years. It is vital that we continue with the reform agenda currently underway to evolve our capital markets, which will encourage greater investment into AIM quoted companies and seek to protect the fiscal incentives that drive capital and liquidity to the growing companies of the UK. Together, these measures will contribute to the growth of our economy and, ultimately, deliver improved returns to our savers.&rdquo;&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><b><i>Philip Secrett, Partner and Head of Public Company Advisory, Grant Thornton UK LLP, said:</i></b></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Despite an extended period of uncertainty, AIM continues to play an important role in supporting business growth and delivering notable economic value to the UK. Our analysis shows that in 2023 the economic impact of AIM companies was &pound;68billion and they supported over 778,000 jobs. Given the Government&rsquo;s mission to support economic growth and productivity, consideration of the role that AIM is playing &ndash; and can continue to play &ndash; in achieving this mission will be vitally important. An important enabler of this growth has been Government support through the Enterprise Investment Scheme and other tax reliefs. Together these have provided a well calibrated package of support that incentivises investment. By committing to the ongoing availability of these targeted fiscal incentives and reliefs Government can help make future growth a reality.&rdquo;</i></p>

<title>European Retail Investors Turn Bearish On CAC 40 Amid Post-Olympics Calm And Economic Uncertainty</title>

<div> SERIX, CAC 40, retail investors, after-hours trading, political uncertainty
Summary: Spectrum Markets' SERIX data shows bearish sentiment towards CAC 40, with increased after-hours trading and concerns over political uncertainty and flat earnings. <br /><br /> <div>
<ul>
<li>Spectrum Markets&rsquo; SERIX data reveals a bearish shift in sentiment towards the CAC 40, with the index dropping from a neutral 100 in July to a bearish 93 in August</li>
<li>Traders show growing caution towards the French economy post-Olympics, likely due to political uncertainty, flat earnings, and luxury sector concerns</li>
<li>Spectrum saw after-hours trading in August 2024 reach 38.7%, its highest level since November 2022, reflecting rising demand for 24/5 trading hours<br /> <br /> </li>
</ul>
<p>Spectrum Markets (&ldquo;Spectrum&rdquo;), the pan-European trading venue designed for retail investors, has published its SERIX sentiment data for European retail investors for August, revealing a bearish sentiment towards the CAC 40, which dropped from a neutral 100 in July to a bearish 93 in August.</p>
<p>The SERIX value indicates retail investor sentiment, with a number above 100 marking bullish sentiment, and a number below 100 indicating bearish sentiment. (See below for more information on the methodology).</p>
<p>August witnessed significant market-sensitive events that triggered spikes in volatility. As a result, 38.7% of trading on Spectrum took place outside of traditional European market hours during this period, its highest level of out of hour trading on Spectrum since November 2022.</p>
<h4><b>Market opinion</b></h4>
<p>&ldquo;Our bearish investor sentiment index indicates a degree of pessimism among retail investors, as the attention switched back to politics. After the heightened political uncertainty caused by President Macron&rsquo;s call for a snap election in June, the upcoming Olympics worked as a distraction to investors&rsquo; concerns," says Michael Hall, Head of Distribution at Spectrum Markets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Political deadlocks, however, did not vanish. This, combined with headwinds in French corporate earnings, especially in the luxury goods sector, has added to market concerns. Global demand, especially from China, has been weaker than expected, leading to underperformance from major companies like LVMH and L'Or&eacute;al," Hall concludes.</p>
<h4><b>Spectrum&rsquo;s August data</b></h4>
<p>In August 2024, order book turnover on Spectrum was &euro;306.3 million, with 38.7% of trades taking place outside of traditional hours (i.e., between 17:30 and 9:00 CET).</p>
<p>The order book turnover was distributed among various underlying assets as follows: 82.2% on indices, 2.8% on currency pairs, 7.4% on commodities, 4.5% on equities and 3.1% on cryptocurrencies. The top three traded underlying markets were NASDAQ 100 (34.3%), DAX 40 (26.6%), and DOW 30 (11.4%).</p>
<p>Looking at the SERIX data for the top three underlying markets, the NASDAQ 100 remained at a neutral 100 from last month, while the DAX 40 dropped from a neutral 100 to a bearish 96, and the DOW 30 increased slightly but remained bearish from 96 to 98 last month.</p>

<table border="0" style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<div>
<h4 align="center"><b>Calculating SERIX data</b></h4>
<p>The Spectrum European Retail Investor Index (SERIX), uses the trading venue&rsquo;s pan-European trading data to shed light on investor sentiment towards current development in financial markets.</p>
<p>The index is calculated on a monthly basis by analysing retail investor trades placed and subtracting the proportion of bearish trades from the proportion of bullish trades, to give a single figure (rebased at 100) that indicates the strength and direction of sentiment:</p>
<p align="center"><i>SERIX = (% bullish trades - % bearish trades) + 100</i><span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Trades where long instruments are bought and trades where short instruments are sold are both considered bullish trades, while trades where long instruments are sold and trades where short instruments are bought are considered bearish trades. Trades that are matched by retail clients are disregarded. (For a detailed methodology and examples, please visit this <a href="https://www.spectrum-markets.com/the-venue/spectrum-european-retail-investor-index?utm_source=Press%20Release%20-%20EN&amp;utm_medium=SERIX%20LINK&amp;utm_campaign=May%20Volumes%20Press%20Release&amp;utm_content=">link</a>).</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>INFINOX welcomes veteran Lee Holmes back into its senior management team. Having spent more than 15 years in the FX and CFD trading sector, Lee's rejoining comes at a pivotal point as the business keeps on its path of expansion worldwide.</p>
<p>Lee started his career with FXCM, where he laid a solid foundation in the financial markets. Later on, he was instrumental in helping VIBHS flourish; he then co-founded the brokerage ForexVox, where his leadership helped it to expand. Lee originally joined INFINOX in 2022 after time with Zenfinex (now Taurex), Hantec, and Exinity. He jumped at the chance to come back after a short hiatus in 2023 and continue where he left off.</p>
<p>"Rejoining INFINOX felt like unresolved business when the opportunity presented itself". Lee said, "The challenge was one that excited me from the outset, and I look forward to continuing INFINOX's growth over the last year&hellip; it feels good to be home"</p>
<p>INFINOX has seen significant growth in its key markets through 2024, pushing key metrics to recent new highs. The growth has been fuelled by its strong brand reputation and a continued commitment to relationships with Partners and Prime clients. A sponsorship deal with Alpine F1 has seen the brand elevate in its positioning and establish new relationships with stakeholders across the industry.</p>

<div> Enforcement Division, Municipal Advisors, Recordkeeping, Civil Penalties, Securities Laws
Summary:<br /><br />The SEC charged 12 municipal advisors with failing to maintain electronic communications, resulting in civil penalties and censure. They admitted violating recordkeeping provisions. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against 12 municipal advisors for failures by the firms and their personnel to maintain and preserve certain electronic communications. The firms agreed to pay combined civil penalties of more than $1.3 million to settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges.</p>
<p>The firms admitted the facts set forth in their respective SEC orders, acknowledged that their conduct violated recordkeeping provisions of the federal securities laws, have begun implementing improvements to their compliance policies and procedures to address these violations, and agreed to pay the following civil penalties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acacia Financial Group Inc. agreed to pay a civil penalty of $52,000;</li>
<li>Caine Mitter and Associates Inc. agreed to pay a civil penalty of $94,000;</li>
<li>cfX Inc. agreed to pay a civil penalty of $42,000;</li>
<li>CSG Advisors Inc. agreed to pay a civil penalty of $40,000;</li>
<li>Kaufman Hall &amp; Associates LLC, together with Ponder &amp; Company, agreed to pay a civil penalty of $324,000;</li>

<li>Zions Public Finance Inc. agreed to pay a civil penalty of $47,000.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;The books and records requirements are critical to facilitating Commission inspections and examinations of municipal advisors and in evaluating a municipal advisor&rsquo;s compliance with the applicable federal securities laws,&rdquo; said Rebecca Olsen, Deputy Chief of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement Public Finance Abuse Unit. &ldquo;Municipal advisors are encouraged to assess their recordkeeping practices relating to off-channel communications.&nbsp;Firms that believe their practices do not comply with the securities laws are encouraged to self-report to the SEC&rsquo;s Enforcement staff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As described in the SEC&rsquo;s orders, the firms admitted that, during the relevant periods, they failed to maintain and preserve communications sent and/or received by their personnel relating to municipal advisory activity and that these communications were records required to be maintained and preserved under the federal securities laws. The failures involved personnel at multiple levels of authority, including supervisors.</p>
<p>The firms were each charged with supervision failures and with violating certain recordkeeping provisions of the Securities Exchange Act and the rules of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. In addition to the financial penalties, each of the firms was censured and ordered to cease and desist from future violations of the relevant recordkeeping provisions.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigations were conducted by members of the Enforcement Division&rsquo;s Public Finance Abuse Unit, including Kevin B. Currid, Brian Fagel, David Zhou, Sally Hewitt, Kristal P. Olson, Jonathan Grant, Silvana A. Quintanilla, and Louis Randazzo.&nbsp;Each of these matters was supervised by Ms. Olsen.</p>

<li>Partnerships, where we share ideas, lessons learnt, exchange data and intelligence are essential in reinforcing our defences and staying ahead of evolving threats.</li>

</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Stephen Bush, a columnist for the Financial Times, recently wrote about the reason we have a visceral reaction to being defrauded. It also doubled as a review for a film out now called &lsquo;Thelma&rsquo;, which follows a 93-year-old granny&rsquo;s quest for revenge against phone scammers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That desire for payback from those who have stolen from us is understandable from a pure monetary point of view. &pound;1.17bn was taken from people in payment scams in the UK last year. That astonishing figure hides, in its sheer scale, the individual human stories of financial loss &ndash; of money hard earnt, of housing deposits lost, or life savings/life dreams disappearing into the ether.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it isn&rsquo;t just the money that is lost, it&rsquo;s our sense of security, our pride at being impervious to trickery, that is gone. And in its place, fraud victims are so often left with a feeling of helplessness. A feeling that is so understandable, given the scale of the problem, its complexity and ever evolving nature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am Andrea Bowe, director of the specialist directorate at the FCA. Among other things, my teams lead the FCA&rsquo;s approach on tackling financial crime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will set out why I believe we can, indeed that we are, starting to shift the dial in the global fight against fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it is only through partnership, renewed effort and ingenuity that we can address a problem that has no respect for borders.</p>
<h2>Role of the FCA</h2>
<p>The FCA plays a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/corporate-documents/reducing-and-preventing-financial-crime" title="Reducing and preventing financial crime">significant role in helping reduce financial crime</a>. We lead or support on 20 of the 43 actions identified in the Government&rsquo;s Economic Crime Plan, and are a key delivery partner within the Fraud Strategy - both aimed at driving improvements in the UK&rsquo;s system-wide response to financial crime.</p>
<p>Our role is to set the standards for the financial firms we regulate &ndash; those whose services would be readily abused and exploited by criminals.</p>
<p>Our role is also to allow those with the right standards to be authorised, and prevent entry to the regulated system to those who are unlikely or unwilling to meet the minimum standards we expect. We know that in so doing we will often face criticism. Some 86% of the initial crypto registrations we received were rejected, withdrawn or refused. This was because they often failed to meet the appropriate standards to satisfy the anti-money laundering control framework.</p>
<p>But whether it is during authorisation or after, our role is not simply to set out the standards, but to explain them and provide support, so firms understand and can navigate the regulatory system. That has helped over 40 crypto firms meet the bar to be registered by us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We uphold standards by taking regulatory action, ranging from words of advice to formal skilled persons reviews, so we&rsquo;re assured firms&rsquo; anti-crime systems are what they should be, and we impose requirements when they&rsquo;re not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And we use enforcement when we believe there is evidence of serious harm, taking public action when this is proven, both to punish but also to deter others.</p>
<p>And we can exercise a range of criminal and civil powers to tackle those who undertake activity that should be regulated but for which they are not approved, for example, our recent charges against a number of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/finfluencers-charged-promoting-unauthorised-trading-scheme" title="'Finfluencers&rsquo; charged for promoting unauthorised trading scheme ">&lsquo;finfluencers&rsquo; for allegedly promoting high-risk investments</a>&nbsp;without authorisation. These individuals had a combined following of circa 4.5 million people across Instagram, giving them access to a substantial audience.</p>
<p>The FCA also houses the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/about/how-we-operate/who-work-with/opbas" title="Office for Professional Body Anti-Money Laundering Supervision (OPBAS)">Office for Professional Body Anti-Money Laundering Supervision (OBPAS)</a>, which supervises the 25 professional body supervisors (PBSs) in the legal and accountancy sectors. OPBAS, together with our financial sector, enables us to look across 3 core sectors of the financial crime landscape, taking a joined-up, end-to-end approach in our work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, we are a partner. We support other agencies, in the UK and abroad, in their work to tackle financial crime.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Stock take, dial shifting</h2>
<p>When I began, I suggested the dial was beginning to shift. And while I believe that to be the case, we should be under no illusion about the scale of the problem to fix.</p>
<p>Fraud makes up 36% of all the crime reported in England and Wales, with 3.2m incidents in the year to March 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But that represented a 16% fall on the year before. And there were half a million fewer victims last year compared with 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And UK Finance reported total losses from payment fraud were down 4%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Saying that, while some fraud figures may have fallen, we know from recently released Financial Ombudsman Service figures, that scam related complaints have reached their highest level since early 2018.</p>
<p>It is too early to be definitive that this is part of a longer-term pattern, but these statistics show, perhaps, that losses are stabilising. If that is true, it is no mean feat given the fast-evolving nature of fraud typologies and the development of emerging technologies. And, whilst visions of a fraud-free financial services landscape are still very distant, if sustained, it would show us moving in the right direction.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Partnership</h2>
<p>The challenge is how to continue to move that dial further and move it faster. We know we can&rsquo;t do it alone. Collaboration and a collective effort are key to tackling fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, partnerships, where we share ideas, lessons learnt and exchange data and intelligence, are essential in reinforcing our defences and staying ahead of evolving threats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recognise the importance of a coordinated national response, bringing together multiple public and private organisations to tackle the significant issue of fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One way in which we are seeking to do this is through working closely with industry to develop practical answers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year, the FCA and the National Crime Agency (NCA) jointly hosted a 3-day investment fraud tech sprint. This saw regulatory, intelligence and law enforcement agencies get together to test tactical, cross-agency collaboration, and it led directly to the development of solutions that participants are continuing to explore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With colleagues at the Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) and the Corporation of the City of London, we have run similar events with payment providers in our effort to tackle push payment fraud, including using synthetic data to better tackle scams.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So often, the relationship between regulated and regulator can be seen as adversarial. What the outside world sees are criticisms made, fines levied, formal action taken. What is often less obvious is that we have a mutual interest in tackling the scourge of financial crime, not least because it inhibits growth by diverting funds that could go to investment into criminal coffers instead.</p>
<p>That is why we want to work with industry, by providing more guidance on how we can jointly tackle financial crime, and greater transparency with it, on threats we see developing and how we, together, can tackle them.</p>
<p>Another crucial area for joint action is stopping the cash-out of the proceeds of fraud through money mule activity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Firms must adopt a collaborative approach, prioritising not only the sharing of information on suspected mules, but also acting swiftly when such information is received, whether through internal or external channels.</p>
<p>Addressing mule activity is an area where our collective efforts can have a substantial impact on disrupting criminal operations and greatly reducing the flow of fraudulent funds.</p>
<p>We also work closely with our international partners, including the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and our global leadership position in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/innovation/global-financial-innovation-network" title="Global Financial Innovation Network (GFIN)">Global Financial Innovation Network (GFIN).</a>&nbsp;In March of this year, the FCA participated in the Home Office&rsquo;s inaugural Global Fraud Summit, which resulted in the agreement by ministers of a communiqu&eacute; setting out an agreed global framework to tackle fraud.</p>
<h2>A renewed, collective effort&nbsp;</h2>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s look at what can happen with our collective effort.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have worked with big tech platforms such as Google and Meta to highlight the risk of illegal financial promotions and scam adverts. As a result of the change in policy adopted by Google, the FCA identified in monitoring from August to December 2021 an almost 100% reduction in the number of illegal financial services ads on Google&rsquo;s platforms. Paid-for adverts for UK financial services are now banned if they&rsquo;re not approved by an FCA authorised firm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have raised consumer awareness of scams through our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/scamsmart" title="ScamSmart">ScamSmart campaigns&nbsp;</a>- aimed at highlighting possible red flags and encouraging consumers to review our online&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/warning-list-unauthorised-firms" title="FCA Warning List of unauthorised firms">Warning List</a>&nbsp;prior to investing. We are using data to tackle online fraud faster, by scanning approximately 100,000 websites created every day to identify suspected scams, with hundreds of websites taken down and over 2,200 alerts issued on our Warning List in 2023 &ndash; a 21% increase from the previous year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are engaging with app stores, such as Apple and Google Play, to request the removal of crypto apps that are in breach of our financial promotion rules. And we have issued guidance clarifying the obligations for firms and others, including finfluencers, when using social media to communicate financial promotions.</p>
<p>Banking protocol rapid response has prevented &pound;312.9m in fraud, engaged with 56,908 emergency calls, and made 1,385 arrests since it launched in 2016.<a class="ext" href="https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/system/files/2024-06/UK%20Finance%20Annual%20Fraud%20report%202024.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">&nbsp;&pound;54.7m of fraud was prevented in 2023 (PDF)<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Ingenuity&nbsp;</h2>
<p>But renewed effort is required if we are to meet the ingenuity of the criminals whose efforts we seek to stymie.</p>
<p>Scammers are tech-savvy risk-takers, and continuously use new mechanisms, often playing on the elements of being human (wanting to take care of our family, finding the love of our lives, wanting to turn &pound;100 into &pound;1m, buying a home, saving for the future).</p>
<p>Therefore, we need to draw on all our collective ability to innovate.</p>
<p>We know technology is transforming cross-border fraud and money-laundering detection. Cyber and identity fraud are increasing in scale, sophistication and impact, as artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more widespread. We are likely to see more sophisticated social engineering using AI deepfake technology to clone voices and faces of trusted individuals, making it increasingly difficult for individuals to distinguish between genuine and fraudulent interactions. Whilst deepfake scams are still in their relative nascency, as an industry we cannot afford to be complacent to their potential threat.</p>
<p>But AI is not just a method used by criminals, its ability to crunch massive data sets means it is a tool for gamekeepers, not just poachers. And we have shown how it can work. Following Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine, we developed an AI tool that helped us identify potential breaches of international sanctions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But innovation isn&rsquo;t just about technology. It is about policy and powers, continually ensuring both keep pace with developing financial crime risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have shown, only recently, our willingness to do so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using new powers, we&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/pwc-fined-failing-alert-fca-suspected-fraudulent-activity-london-capital-finance-plc" title="PwC fined &pound;15 million for failing to alert the FCA to suspected fraudulent activity at London Capital &amp; Finance plc">recently fined PwC</a>, an audit firm, &pound;15m for failing to report to us their suspicions that a firm they were auditing might be involved in fraudulent activity. This was the first time the FCA fined an audit firm and establishes a clear precedent that depriving us of potentially vital information can lead to enforcement action.</p>
<p>And just last week, we worked with Kent Police to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-charges-first-individual-running-network-illegal-crypto-atms" title="FCA charges first individual with running a network of illegal crypto ATMs">charge the first person suspected of illegally operating a crypto-ATM</a>.</p>
<p>But as the threat changes and criminals seek to exploit gaps in regulatory cover, we will need to maintain an open dialogue with Government about the powers we need to best protect consumers and market integrity.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A call to action</h2>
<p>Charles Clarke wrote about the Too Difficult Box, into which policymakers throw the problems that are too complex, too multifaceted, requiring too much action, which would be too unpopular with too many people. As a former Home Secretary, he could very well have been referring to how to tackle fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But we have seen, we are already seeing, what can be done when regulator, law enforcement, Government and industry work together, supported by consumer awareness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our job now is to renew those efforts, ensure our ingenuity meets and bests that of the fraudsters, and that we do so in partnership. This is indeed a task too difficult to do alone. Together we have the chance of protecting people from that loss of money, that loss of confidence, that feeling of helplessness that comes from being scammed, like Thelma.</p>

<title>R3 And Quant Support The Publication Of UK Finance’s UK Regulated Liability Network (RLN) Experimentation Phase Report - R3 And Quant, Alongside DXC Technology And Coadjute Are Technology Partners To The UK RLN</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: R3, Quant, UK Finance, Regulated Liability Network, digital finance.

Summary:
- R3 and Quant collaborated with UK Finance and other partners to explore new financial market infrastructure and capabilities.
- The collaboration demonstrated the potential for digital transformation in the UK finance industry.
- The experiment showed that technology can deliver economic value and support innovation in the market.
- The platform could provide new functionality and a common point of access for innovative firms.
- The legal and regulatory framework in the UK is flexible enough to support the implementation of a Regulated Liability Network.

Summary: <div>
<p>R3, the infrastructure platform building digital solutions for financial markets, and&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="http://www.quant.network/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Quant</a>, the digital finance pioneer, announce the publication of the results of UK Finance&rsquo;s UK Regulated Liability Network. The&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/news-and-insight/press-release/uk-finance-announces-successful-outcome-regulated-liability-network" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>&nbsp;which follows work with UK Finance with eleven of its members<a href="https://mailhost.mondovisione.com/WorldClient.dll?Session=SAW16LB3GNFQ5&amp;View=BlankMessageBody#_ftn1"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a>&nbsp;and partners<a href="https://mailhost.mondovisione.com/WorldClient.dll?Session=SAW16LB3GNFQ5&amp;View=BlankMessageBody#_ftn2"><sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup></a>&nbsp;on a new experimentation phase. This is a new type of financial market infrastructure that can deliver new capabilities for payments and settlement, including tokenisation and programmability.</p>
<p>R3 and Quant were&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://r3.com/press-media/r3-quant-selected-as-technology-providers-for-the-uks-rln/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><b>selected</b></a>&nbsp;by the UK RLN, alongside DXC Technology and Coadjute, as technology partners in exploring a number of use cases and in particular the technology workstream which delivered a multi- issuer DLT-based Tokenisation Platform, a comprehensive API for interaction with all forms of money, and an Orchestration Layer. Implementation of the Orchestration Layer seamlessly connected the Tokenisation Platform to different ledgers and integrated with existing systems (e.g. Open Banking, Project Rosalind, and simulated RTGS).</p>
<p>Together with other participants, R3 and Quant reviewed and worked on various technical, legal and business case questions surrounding the development of an RLN and the main conclusions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Such a platform, in collaboration with other important initiatives such as Open Banking, could deliver economic value and support innovation in the market.</li>
<li>New functionality, such as programmable payments and locking/unlocking of funds, could be delivered across a range of use cases.</li>
<li>It could provide new and innovative firms with a single, common point of access to enable them to interface with established institutions, and enhanced payment and settlement systems.</li>
<li>The legal and regulatory framework of the UK is sufficiently flexible to support the implementation of an RLN.</li>
</ul>
<p>R3 has brought its ability to deliver complex pioneering projects for regulated markets whilst providing the critical distributed ledger capability, via Corda, its leading open permissioned&nbsp;DLT platform, powering the tokenisation of assets and currencies connecting global markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;Quant enabled programmability and interoperability across different forms of money by delivering the orchestration and API layer to the project with its Overledger platform.</p>
<p><b>Jana Mackintosh, Managing Director of Payments, Innovation and Operational Resilience at UK Finance, said:</b></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Every year, over &pound;11 trillion worth of payments are processed in the UK, powering the economy. The success of the RLN experiment shows the potential of technology to transform the customer experience and deliver economic value and benefits for society.</i></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;The Experimentation Phase demonstrated the power of industry collaboration to deliver a platform for innovation in the UK. The private sector wants to invest in the future of commercial bank money but needs a partnership with regulators to do so.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><b>Kate Karimson, R3 Chief Commercial Officer, said:</b></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re proud to be a part of this pioneering effort where the UK finance industry has operated across retail, wholesale, technology and legal workstreams in a collaborative manner.&nbsp;</i><i>R3 is committed to progressing financial markets and to enabling an open, trusted and advanced digital economy.&nbsp;The success of the RLN experimentation phase and the publication of a roadmap for the UK economy to harness the potential for the benefits of tokenisation demonstrates our advanced technology implementation capability</i>,&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Gilbert Verdian, Founder and CEO at Quant, said:</b></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;The RLN isn&rsquo;t just about enhancing the efficiency of our current payment infrastructure; it&rsquo;s about creating different forms of money that will transform the way value and assets are moved and managed. Programmability is at the heart of the transition to digital finance. As the project has proven, programmability brings new functionality across payments and settlement that are inconceivable under the current system. Implementing programmability will be key to cementing the UK&rsquo;s leadership position in digital finance and futureproofing our capital markets for the decades to come. As the digital economy evolves, we&rsquo;re excited to continue working with other project participants in delivering further innovation across payments.&rdquo;</i>&nbsp;</p>

Summary:
Euronext acquires Substantive Research, enhancing investor services with market benchmarking. Commcise integration offers compliance solutions and expands vendor universe.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p align="justify"><span>Euronext today announces that it has acquired 100% of Substantive Research, an industry-leading pioneer providing in-depth transparency on product and pricing comparison for investment research spend, market data and investment research content.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Founded in 2015 and headquartered in London, Substantive Research provides research and market data benchmarking to a growing base of over 100 global clients, across Europe and North America, including asset managers, hedge funds, wealth managers, sell-side institutions and private markets. Substantive Research provides valuable insights into research pricing and spending, benchmarks of market data providers, and automated delivery of user-customised research content.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Euronext, through its subsidiary Commcise, offers cloud-based, fully-integrated commission management, research valuation, consumption tracking and payment solutions which are connected to over 1,000+ capital markets participants globally. Commcise brings the buy-side, sell-side and research providers together using technologies that are designed to service the needs of each participant, and its business has grown rapidly since joining Euronext in December 2018.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>The combination of Commcise and Substantive Research offers multiple benefits for customers. Following the integration of Substantive Research, Commcise clients will be able to gain access to unique market benchmarks within the application. This will enable asset managers to demonstrate compliance with evolving regulation with the help of a single, integrated technology solution. Substantive Research customers will benefit from Euronext and Commcise&rsquo;s scale, which will help Substantive Research to grow the universe of vendors that are benchmarked and also expand the variety of benchmarking products that it can offer to the buy- and sell-side.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>The transaction complies with Euronext capital allocation policy. It will further reinforce Euronext&rsquo;s growing investor services segment with high-quality, recurring revenues, and strengthen the Group&rsquo;s proximity with the buy-side community.</span><br /><br /></p>

</ul>
<p align="justify"><span>&ldquo;Euronext&rsquo;s acquisition of Substantive Research underlines our team&rsquo;s hard work in creating a unique price benchmarking database in investment research and market data.&nbsp; With the research market poised for yet more regulatory-driven changes, plus market data consumers grappling with increasing costs and pricing opacity, we are so excited to be able to accelerate our coverage and data depth with Commcise and Euronext&rsquo;s insight and resources. It feels great that we can now accelerate development into areas we know our clients need greater market transparency.&rdquo;</span></p>

<div> Expansion, Euronext Clearing, Derivatives markets, Integration, Synergies<br />
<br />
Euronext completes migration of clearing business, achieves EBITDA synergies, becomes leading clearing house, integrates Borsa Italiana Group, strengthens market infrastructure.<br />
<br />Summary: Euronext completes migration and integration, achieves synergies, becomes leading clearing house, and strengthens market infrastructure. <div>
<ul type="square">
<li><span><strong>This significant milestone completes the migration of Euronext clearing business from LCH SA to Euronext Clearing and completes the integration of the Borsa Italiana Group</strong></span></li>
<li><span><strong>The migration was delivered as planned and on schedule, and is the final step in reaching the targeted &euro;115 million of run-rate EBITDA synergies by the end of 2024</strong></span></li>
<li><span><strong>Euronext Clearing has become a leading multi-asset class clearing house in Europe</strong></span></li>
<li><span><strong>Euronext is now the leading pan-European market infrastructure integrated across the entire trading value chain (listing, trading, clearing, settlement and custody), for the benefit of its clients and the attractiveness of the European markets</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><span>Euronext, the leading pan-European market infrastructure, is pleased to announce the successful completion of the expansion of Euronext Clearing activities to all Euronext financial derivatives markets. This milestone marks the conclusion of the migration from LCH SA to Euronext Clearing and the end of the contractual relationship with LCH SA. This was the final phase in the European expansion of Euronext Clearing, to create Euronext&rsquo;s multi-asset class clearing house. This achievement, realised on schedule in September 2024, marks the last critical achievement in completing Euronext's &lsquo;Growth for Impact 2024&rsquo; strategic plan and the integration of the Borsa Italiana Group, three years after it was acquired by Euronext.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Over the last three years, Euronext has successfully and seamlessly migrated its core data centre from the UK to Italy, migrated Borsa Italiana cash and derivatives markets to its proprietary trading platform Optiq</span><span>&reg;</span><span>, and expanded the clearing activities of Euronext Clearing to all Euronext cash and derivatives markets across Europe. The completion of the clearing migration solidifies Euronext&rsquo;s role as a central player in the European financial landscape, positioning Euronext Clearing as the third-largest clearing house</span><span>1</span><span>&nbsp;in Europe, underscoring its rapid growth and influence in the post-trade space.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>The expansion to Euronext financial derivatives markets follows Euronext Clearing&rsquo;s successful expansion to Euronext's cash markets in November 2023 and commodity derivatives in July 2024. Euronext Clearing is now positioned as the Central Counterparty (CCP) for all of Euronext's derivatives markets, to provide a robust and unified clearing solution across a comprehensive range of asset classes. The expansion of Euronext Clearing to all Euronext derivatives markets is a strategic milestone that brings significant benefits to market participants. These benefits include enhanced risk management through a VaR-based margin methodology, improved efficiency and reliability in risk capture and allocation, and the introduction of a unified equity and derivatives default fund to facilitate cross-margining. Clients can now streamline their collateral management and access consolidated information on collateral, risk and clearing activities through a single platform.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>This integration strengthens Euronext's ability to offer end-to-end solutions across the entire trading value chain, from listing, trading to clearing, settlement and custody. It also paves the way for further innovation and growth, empowering clients to optimise their trading strategies and operational efficiencies.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>With the completion of this last phase of the clearing migration project, Euronext is on track to reach its target of &euro;115&nbsp;million run-rate annual EBITDA synergies by the end of 2024, as outlined in its&nbsp;</span><span>&lsquo;</span><span>Growth for Impact 2024&rsquo; strategic plan. The expansion of the Euronext Clearing operations and business underscores Euronext's ongoing dedication to delivering innovative and integrated market solutions, driving future growth and maintaining its leadership in the European and global financial ecosystems.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>St&eacute;phane Boujnah, CEO and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext,&nbsp;</span><span>said:&nbsp;</span><span>"Euronext continues to strengthen the backbone of the Capital Markets Union in Europe by expanding Euronext Clearing services to financial derivatives activities. The successful expansion of Euronext Clearing contributes to the defragmentation and the harmonisation of post-trade activities in Europe, to increase the attractiveness of our markets. This ensures that our single European liquidity pool is supported by a simplified, streamlined and fully integrated post-trade structure. I want to thank the LCH SA teams for the constructive cooperation that made this smooth migration possible."</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Anthony Attia, Euronext Global Head of Derivatives and Post-Trade,&nbsp;</span><span>said:</span>&nbsp;<span>"This landmark achievement marks the end of the transformation of Euronext Clearing and the end of the migration of Euronext markets from LCH SA to Euronext Clearing. By offering a comprehensive clearing solution across multiple asset classes, we enhance the efficiency and reliability of the markets we serve, delivering significant value to our clients. Thanks to this achievement, Euronext now offers a streamlined and efficient market environment and is ready to innovate and develop new derivatives and clearing solutions for our clients."</span></p>

<div> RECs, BCX, trading platform, Bursa Malaysia, sustainability reporting
Summary: BCX launches continuous RECs trading, includes solar, bioenergy, and small-hydropower sources, encouraging corporates to onboard for sustainability reporting.<br /><br /> <div>
<ul>
<li><i>BCX commenced its continuous trading service offering of RECs on its platform; </i></li>
<li><i>BCX to now include RECs generated from solar photovoltaic, bioenergy and small-hydropower sources; </i>&nbsp;</li>
<li><i>Bursa Malaysia invites corporates to onboard BCX ahead of year-end sustainability reporting.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Bursa Carbon Exchange (&ldquo;BCX&rdquo;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bursa Malaysia Berhad (&ldquo;Bursa Malaysia&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Exchange&rdquo;), is pleased to announce the successful go-live of its renewable energy certificates (RECs) continuous trading on 9 September 2024. This extends its previous RECs auction capability and includes the facilitation of off-market transactions on its platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This development marks a significant milestone as BCX expands its trading offering from voluntary carbon credits to now include voluntary unbundled RECs. It reinforces BCX as a one-stop, Shariah-compliant, multi-environmental product exchange, democratising access and creating new opportunities for the market through additional asset classes, investment, and trading choices.</p>
<p>Additionally, BCX&rsquo;s offering of Malaysian RECs has grown from only hydropower REC previously, and will also include RECs generated from solar photovoltaic, bioenergy and small-hydropower sources. This diversification in the RECs-product range will allow local corporates to select RECs based on their specific preferences based on their Scope 2 emissions reduction needs. All RECs are issued under the I-REC Standard, a globally recognised standard body, and adhere to the International Attribute Tracking Standard, managed by the I-TRACK Foundation (formerly known as the I-REC Standard). The BCX trading platform is accredited by the I-TRACK Foundation, with BCX being the first Malaysian trading platform operator, and one of only eight globally, to receive this accreditation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The platform will enable participants to conveniently trade both carbon credits and RECs. &ldquo;We are pleased to offer this opportunity for companies to take proactive steps in their sustainability journey,&rdquo; said Datuk Muhamad Umar Swift, Chief Executive Officer of Bursa Malaysia. &ldquo;The BCX platform provides a seamless and efficient way for businesses to procure environmental assets such as RECs and carbon credits, supporting their commitment to reducing carbon footprints and promoting renewable energy and decarbonisation projects.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The availability of RECs continuous trading facilitates the increased adoption of renewable energy in Malaysia, contributing towards objectives in Malaysia&rsquo;s National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR),&rdquo; added Datuk Muhamad Umar. &ldquo;Enabling the trading of RECs encourages more renewable energy projects by making them more financially viable and attractive to investors, which supports accelerating the nation&rsquo;s transition towards a low-carbon economy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The healthy interest and price signals shown by the domestic corporate sector during the inaugural auction of RECs<sup>1</sup>, and commencement of continuous RECs trading, has demonstrated local market demand for a transparent pricing mechanism and enhanced accessibility to unbundled RECs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Exchange encourages corporates to onboard onto the BCX platform without delay.&nbsp; Early onboarding provides benefits such as competitive trading fees, and positions corporates to be well-prepared for their emissions reduction plans and year-end sustainability reporting.</p>
<p>For more information on how to onboard and to start trading, contact BCX at <a href="https://bcx.bursamalaysia.com/web/contactus">https://bcx.bursamalaysia.com/web/contactus</a><a href="https://bcx.bursamalaysia.com/web/contactus"> </a>or call +603 2034 7788.</p>

<title>ASIC Expands Operational Resilience Guidance For Market Participants</title>

<div> Release, guidance, resilience, market participants, ASIC
Summary: ASIC released guidance on technological and operational resilience for market participants, emphasizing the identification of critical business services and major event notifications.<br /><br /> <div>
<p>ASIC has today released a letter to market participants outlining technological and operational resilience guidance, clarifying how to identify critical business services and notification of a major event.</p>
<p>The guidance relates to the technological and operational resilience requirements detailed in Chapters 8A and 8B of the ASIC Market Integrity Rules (Securities Markets) 2017 and ASIC Market Integrity Rules (Futures Markets) 2017.</p>
<p>ASIC expects market participants to maintain a strong and continued focus on their technological and operational resilience, noting it is not a &lsquo;set-and-forget&rsquo; process. Adjustments to critical business services arrangements should be made as required.</p>
<p>ASIC is committed to advancing digital and data resilience and safety as one of its strategic priorities for 2024-25. Resilient market operators and market participants are essential to the integrity of our securities and futures markets and to the efficient functioning of the economy.</p>
<p>The market integrity rules set minimum expectations and controls to mitigate risks to help safeguard the integrity and resilience of Australia&rsquo;s markets.</p>
<p>ASIC encourages market participants to carefully consider the guidance set out in the letter and in Regulatory Guides 265 and 266, as it clarifies expectations around critical business service arrangements, specifically market participants&rsquo; identification of critical business services and major event notifications.</p>
<p>ASIC will now consult with industry on incorporating this guidance into Regulatory Guides 265, 266 and 172 when they&rsquo;re next updated.</p>
<h2>Download</h2>
<p><a href="https://download.asic.gov.au/media/jpohllms/technological-and-operational-resilience-letter-17-september-2024.pdf" title="Technological And Operational Resilience Letter 17 September 2024">Letter to Market Participants (PDF 276 KB)</a></p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Chapters 8A and 8B of the ASIC Market Integrity Rules (Securities Markets) 2017 and ASIC Market Integrity Rules (Futures Markets) 2017 (the Resilience Rules), which came into effect on 10 March 2023, aim to promote the technological and operational resilience of market participants.</p>
<p>In 2023, ASIC conducted a thematic review of market participants&rsquo; arrangements for complying with the Resilience Rules, focusing on the requirements to identify their critical business services and notify ASIC of major events.</p>
<p>Since providing feedback to the market participants we reviewed, we have been meeting with industry organisations to discuss our observations, and have shared our three-step plan to review and expand guidance on the Resilience Rules in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regulatory Guide 265&nbsp;<em>Guidance on ASIC market integrity rules for participants of securities markets</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/regulatory-guides/rg-265-guidance-on-asic-market-integrity-rules-for-participants-of-securities-markets/">RG 265</a>)</li>
<li>Regulatory Guide 266&nbsp;<em>Guidance on ASIC market integrity rules for participants of futures markets</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/regulatory-guides/rg-266-guidance-on-asic-market-integrity-rules-for-participants-of-futures-markets/" title="RG 266 Guidance on ASIC market integrity rules for participants of futures markets">RG 266</a>), and</li>

<p>As a first step, in May 2024, we made revisions correcting minor drafting errors in RG 265, RG 266 and RG 172 that caused confusion about the identification of critical business services, and clarifying what we mean by &lsquo;immediately&rsquo; when notifying ASIC of a major event.</p>
<p>As a second step, we published a letter to market participants to share our observations and guidance from the thematic review we conducted of market participants&rsquo; arrangements for identifying critical business services and dealing with a major event.</p>
<p>Our third step, which is currently underway, is to meet with market participants to discuss and consider questions and requests for further expanded guidance.</p>

<div> FMA, insider trading, HGH, HBL, criminal proceedings
<br />
Summary:<br />
The FMA files criminal proceedings for alleged insider trading involving HGH shares. Unethical trading undermines market integrity. Criminal insider trading can be punishable. HGH and HBL are not party to the FMA proceeding. Referral to the FMA by NZ RegCo in December 2020. <div>
<p>The Financial Markets Authority &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; has filed criminal proceedings against an individual for alleged insider trading relating to the buying and selling of shares in Heartland Group Holdings Limited (HGH).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA alleges the individual traded, and encouraged others to trade or hold, HGH shares on several occasions between July 2020 and February 2021, while holding material information that was not generally available to the public. The individual also disclosed material information that was not generally available to the public to others. The individual was a junior Heartland Bank Limited (HBL) employee at the time of the alleged offending.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The matter was first referred to the FMA by NZ RegCo &ndash; NZX&rsquo;s frontline regulator &ndash; in December 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neither HGH nor HBL have been the subject of the FMA&rsquo;s investigation and are not party to the FMA proceeding. &nbsp;Both HGH and HBL have cooperated with the FMA throughout its investigation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>About insider trading&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sections 240 - 243 of the Financial Markets Conduct (FMC) Act prohibit people who hold material information about an issuer that is not generally available to the market (inside information) from trading with that information, disclosing it in certain circumstances, and advising or encouraging other individuals to trade the issuer&rsquo;s shares.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unethical trading activity can undermine market integrity and erode investor confidence at a fundamental level. Participants in financial markets must operate on the basis that all trades are legitimate and based on equally available information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA considers it critical to uphold the law in this area to maintain investor confidence, but also to maintain credibility for those market participants who are willing compliers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Criminal insider trading can be punishable with up to a term of imprisonment not exceeding five years, a fine not exceeding $500,000, or both for individuals.</p>

<title>Effective Compliance: Perspectives From The Regulator - Speech By ASIC Chair Joe Longo At The Australian Compliance Institute Annual Conference, 17 September 2024.</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul>
<li>More than ever, compliance professionals can play a strategic role in the boardroom.</li>
<li>Written policies and procedures provide the framework for compliance. Systems, processes, and technology can be used to underpin and support compliance. But compliance in practice requires a culture of integrity, ethics, and trust.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s the role of the directors of a company to set the tone, establish and lead a culture of compliance. This includes monitoring the arrangements the company has in place to ensure compliance with regulatory obligations.</li>
</ul>
<p>I begin today by acknowledging the Wurundjeri people, traditional custodians of the land on which we gather today, and pay my respects to their Elders past and present. I extend that respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples here today.</p>
<p>The British philosopher Bertrand Russell once said that &lsquo;we have, in fact, two kinds of morality, side by side: one which we preach, but do not practise, and another which we practise, but seldom preach.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the job of every compliance professional in the country to prove Russell wrong &ndash; every day. Because, when not taken seriously, compliance&nbsp;<strong>can</strong>&nbsp;devolve into a mere lip service, where what is practised isn&rsquo;t preached, and what is preached not practised.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/effective-compliance-perspectives-from-the-regulator/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a><a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/effective-compliance-perspectives-from-the-regulator/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>&nbsp;</span></a></p>
<p>On the other hand, when&nbsp;<strong>true</strong>&nbsp;compliance is present, we see alignment between what is preached and what is practised. What is true compliance? It&rsquo;s a culture of compliance built on&nbsp;<strong>integrity, trust and ethics</strong>&nbsp;in how people work &ndash; and not simply legal compliance with the rules. When there&rsquo;s alignment between what&rsquo;s preached and what&rsquo;s practised, it&rsquo;s much easier to nurture trust by consumers and investors. And without that trust as a foundation, the tower of business comes toppling down. That&rsquo;s why, as I&rsquo;ve said before,<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/effective-compliance-perspectives-from-the-regulator/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[2]</sup></a>&nbsp;a profitable business&nbsp;<strong>is</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; and must be &ndash; a compliant one.</p>
<p>So the role of a compliance professional is a critically important one. You are part of the fabric of the business &ndash; not only to help your organisation meet its legal obligations, but to help create an ethical culture, where employees act in the best interests of its customers. Viewing compliance through this lens means it&rsquo;s about more than meeting obligations &ndash; it&rsquo;s about meeting, even exceeding,&nbsp;<strong>expectations</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; both investor and societal.</p>
<p>I would like to talk to you today about&nbsp;<strong>your roles as compliance professionals</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; what that means in practice, and how those roles can be most influential, rewarding and effective. A fundamental element of this is the need to keep an open and curious mind &ndash; one that asks questions, and never stops learning. This approach enables the compliance professional to play a key strategic role in the boardroom, and this should be everyone&rsquo;s objective.</p>
<p>I will finish with some remarks on a number of key areas of focus for ASIC &ndash; and for you, in your roles as compliance specialists.</p>
<h2>The changing face of compliance</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it: the items stacked on the compliance professional&rsquo;s desk have dramatically multiplied in the last five to 10 years. Rapid advances in technology present enormous opportunities, but also increasing risk of scams and cyber-attacks. The growing global consensus on sustainability issues is reflected in Australia in the recent passing of a bill on mandatory climate-related reporting. This, too, is but one part of a larger ESG picture.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that the demands and expectations on compliance professionals are growing exponentially. Regulatory expectations are becoming ever more complex and nuanced.</p>
<p>In a recent global survey of Chief Compliance Officers, KPMG found that 84% expected to face increasing regulatory expectations and scrutiny in the next two years. 34% say new regulatory requirements are the biggest compliance challenge, followed by data analytics (30%). 36% rate cybersecurity as their top compliance improvement priority, followed by data privacy (35%). 41% say ESG compliance programs are still in the planning and development stage.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/effective-compliance-perspectives-from-the-regulator/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[3]</sup></a><a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/effective-compliance-perspectives-from-the-regulator/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><span></span></a></p>
<p>ASIC is of course keenly aware of the impact of law reform and new regulatory requirements on business and markets. This is why, as industry adjusts to new requirements, our approach has generally been to take a pragmatic and proportionate approach to supervision and enforcement during the transition phase of any implementation.</p>
<p>And from the perspective of a compliance officer, when confronted with such a wide range of ever-changing issues, it&rsquo;s helpful to return to the essential functions of a strong, fit-for-the-future compliance function.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the role of the directors of a company to set the tone, establish and lead a culture of compliance. This includes monitoring the arrangements the company has in place to ensure compliance with regulatory obligations. But it&rsquo;s the compliance professionals who are closer to the nuts and bolts of how the business runs. They actually do the work to support and implement those arrangements.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the ones who can first spot the risks, and propose how to manage them &ndash; in a way that is commercial, legal, ethical, cost-effective and forward-looking &ndash; in consultation with the board and others. They&rsquo;re the ones who work with management to implement the systems and controls, and see that they&rsquo;re followed. And they&rsquo;re the ones who communicate with and report to the board, calling out what&rsquo;s working and what&rsquo;s not, so that the board can hold management accountable.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/effective-compliance-perspectives-from-the-regulator/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>
<p>And to do this effectively takes more than just a checklist approach. An effective regulatory compliance program must reflect the organisation&rsquo;s key values and ethos &ndash; and focus on putting customers at the centre of how the organisation operates.</p>
<h2>The need for a curious mind</h2>
<p>A compliance professional is, in essence, a gatekeeper &ndash; a trusted adviser to the board, relied on for&nbsp;<strong>well-thought-out</strong>&nbsp;advice.</p>
<p>Public accountability for compliance will naturally fall on the directors. And one way for them to meet these expectations is to rely on the advice and performance of the compliance professionals in their organisation. Good advice and good service from you will protect the organisation from financial and non-financial risks &ndash; improve its operations &ndash; and uphold its reputation.</p>
<p>As compliance continues to be a key focus for directors, and a significant part of any meeting of directors, the strategic role of compliance professionals becomes more important.</p>
<p>In Australia, we&rsquo;ve seen large, well-resourced businesses that have compliance systems and processes in place. And still, they&rsquo;ve failed to prevent the very issues they were designed to avoid. Why? Because regulatory compliance was undermined by the culture and ethics of the organisation. They had the&nbsp;<strong>appearance</strong>&nbsp;of compliance &ndash; but it was a hollow, empty kind of compliance.</p>
<p>Written policies and procedures provide the framework for compliance. Systems, processes, and technology can be used to underpin and support compliance. But compliance in practice requires a culture of integrity, ethics, and trust.</p>
<p>So, what are the elements of such a culture? It is all about asking the right questions.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no rule book that maps out every step of every response in every possible circumstance. What&rsquo;s needed is an&nbsp;<strong>attitude of compliance</strong>, based on a curious mind that asks the right questions. Questions like&nbsp;<strong>What are our obligations? What are the risks? How can we manage them? What systems and controls should be in place to ensure we meet our obligations? Is what we are doing both legal and ethical? How can we make sure they&rsquo;re being followed? Do I have an open line to the board? Am I keeping them informed?</strong></p>
<p>Asking these &ndash; and other relevant &ndash; questions presents you as compliance professionals with an opportunity: the opportunity to take what you&rsquo;re seeing, and influence your organisation to improve its performance. But this can only happen when you remain firmly committed to questioning and challenging management &ndash; and to continually upskilling and learning to ensure peak performance.</p>
<h2>Key areas of focus for ASIC</h2>
<p>So, if the role of the compliance professional is a complex one that requires alertness at all times to the myriad issues of the day &ndash; what are some of the issues that are &ndash; or should be &ndash; currently on your radar?</p>
<p>Perhaps the first to come to mind is mandatory climate reporting, which will, following Royal Assent, become the law. Compliance teams will obviously play a crucial role in ensuring that their organisations are able and ready to meet these new reporting obligations.</p>
<p>As I have previously observed, the introduction of a compulsory climate risk disclosure regime is the biggest change in Australia in financial reporting and disclosure standards in a generation.</p>
<p>We know these reporting standards are new and that some disclosures are novel &ndash; perhaps more forward-looking than those required to be disclosed under other periodic financial reporting obligations.</p>
<p>We also know there will be a period of transition as industry continues to build capability and implements the organisational changes that will be required to comply with the regime. We understand this. This is why, as I said before, we will be taking a &lsquo;proportionate and pragmatic&rsquo; approach to the supervision and enforcement of the regime while industry adjusts to these new requirements.</p>
<p>In this regard, entities may wish to consider utilising existing processes and procedures that have likely been refined over many years to prepare and verify financial reporting disclosures. Consider the extent to which sustainability reporting disclosures can be integrated into existing risk and compliance measures. This applies to all entities that will eventually be captured by this regime &ndash; start engaging with these new obligations early, so you can be prepared when the time does come for you to lodge your first report.</p>
<p>Now to our work on greenwashing &ndash; and here I want to draw a distinction between ASIC&rsquo;s enforcement approach to the new mandatory climate reporting regime, and our enforcement approach to misleading and deceptive greenwashing misconduct.</p>
<p>Our greenwashing work involves a focus on sustainability statements being made&nbsp;<strong>voluntarily</strong>&nbsp;by entities about their green credentials. As I&rsquo;ve said many times before, this work is based on the&nbsp;<strong>longstanding prohibition against misleading and deceptive conduct</strong>&nbsp;and comes back to ensuring that you do what you say you are going to do.</p>
<p>As Justice Horan stated in his judgment on the Mercer Superannuation case, &lsquo;it is vital that consumers in the financial services industry can have confidence in ESG claims made by providers of financial products and services [...] Any misrepresentations in relation to ESG policies or practices associated with financial products or services, whether as an aspect of &ldquo;greenwashing&rdquo; practices or otherwise, undermines that confidence to the detriment of consumers and the industry generally.&rsquo;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/effective-compliance-perspectives-from-the-regulator/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[5]</sup></a><a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/effective-compliance-perspectives-from-the-regulator/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><span></span></a></p>
<p>Another critical issue for all of us &ndash; government, business and regulators &ndash; is of course technology, and in particular AI. As it rapidly reshapes so much about the way we work, the responsible development and ethical use of AI is increasingly urgent and critical. We need a strong regulatory framework to steer the course of AI toward safe and responsible development and use, and we&rsquo;re taking small steps in this direction.</p>
<p>At ASIC, our focus is on the range of risks associated with the use of AI that arise in financial services and markets. These include risks around bias and discrimination, loss of privacy, misinformation and disinformation, lack of explainability, and transparency, unethical conduct and copyright issues. Safe and responsible use of AI can only be realised through strong governance, transparency and accountability, including human oversight, as well as robust information security to protect data and privacy.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re not working from a blank sheet of paper. Existing laws and guidance apply to protect consumers and investors and don&rsquo;t change with new technology. Businesses and individuals who develop and use AI are already subject to various Australian laws. These include laws relating to privacy, online safety, directors&rsquo; duties, AFSL obligations, corporations, intellectual property and anti-discrimination, which apply to all sectors of the economy.</p>
<p>But, of course, this is a changing space. Recently the Department of Industry, Science and Resources issued a consultation paper proposing mandatory guardrails for situations where AI use is considered high risk. The guardrails aim to address risks and harms from AI, build public trust, and provide businesses with greater regulatory certainty. The controversial Californian AI legislation is currently awaiting Governor Newsom's approval. I'm sure we will all watch these developments with great interest.</p>
<p>These are just a few of the current issues that are top of mind for ASIC and &ndash; I&rsquo;m sure &ndash; many of you here today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve no doubt there are others &ndash; far more than I can mention here. But in all cases, the solution is the same: a clear commitment to learning and to asking questions.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, as compliance professionals, it&rsquo;s your job to be the gatekeeper, the trusted advisor to the board.</p>
<p>Your role is to refine the systems and controls, and to call out what&rsquo;s working and what can be improved. That will enable the board to look ahead to spot the risks, think about how to balance the legal and commercial perspectives, and monitor the compliance arrangements that the company has in place.</p>
<p>And so, more than ever, you play an influential and strategic role in the boardroom &ndash; a role that is critical in ensuring effective compliance.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Former Chairman And CEO Of Tech Co. Kubient With Fraud And Lying To Auditor - Former CFO And Audit Committee Chair Also Charged</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-charges-former-chairman-and-ceo-of-tech-co-kubient-with-fraud-and-lying-to/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-charges-former-chairman-and-ceo-of-tech-co-kubient-with-fraud-and-lying-to/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed charges against Paul D. Roberts, the former Chair, CEO, and president of Kubient Inc.; Joshua A. Weiss, the company&rsquo;s former chief financial officer; and Grainne M. Coen, the company&rsquo;s former audit committee chair, for their roles in a scheme in which Kubient overstated and misrepresented its revenue in connection with two public stock offerings.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint against Roberts, shortly before Kubient&rsquo;s initial public offering, Roberts fabricated reports that Kubient had successfully tested a software program that detects real-time fraud during digital advertising auctions, allowing Kubient to recognize $1.3 million in revenue, which was nearly all of its revenue leading up to the offering. The complaint alleges that Kubient did not actually perform the tests and thus should not have recognized the revenue. In a separate complaint, the SEC alleges that Weiss and Coen learned during Kubient&rsquo;s secondary stock offering that the tests had not been performed, but instead of investigating or correcting the misrepresentations, Weiss and Coen perpetuated the scheme by making false statements about the revenue at issue. Additionally, Roberts, Weiss, and Coen allegedly each lied to Kubient&rsquo;s independent auditor about the revenue or whether they had become aware of any concerns about it. According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaints, Kubient raised approximately $33 million in the two stock offerings using offering materials that touted the misrepresentations about the success of the tests and the revenue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As alleged, this was a deliberate scheme by a public company CEO to concoct phony revenue, perpetuated by the failure of the company&rsquo;s CFO and independent audit committee chair to act appropriately when they learned of concerns about that revenue,&rdquo; said Jason J. Burt, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Denver Regional Office. &ldquo;This case should send an important signal to gatekeepers like CFOs and audit committee members that the SEC and the investing public expect responsible behavior when critical issues are brought to their attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaints, both of which were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charge Roberts, Weiss, and Coen with violating the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws and lying to auditors. The complaints seek injunctions, officer-and-director bars, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil penalties, and other relief against each of the defendants. In a partial settlement, Roberts has consented to injunctions from future violations of the charged provisions while agreeing to litigate the appropriate remedies. His settlement is subject to court approval.</p>
<p>In a parallel criminal matter, the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Southern District of New York today announced charges against Roberts.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Jeffrey S. Lyons, Emily C. Scruggs, and Donna B. Walker, and supervised by Ian S. Karpel, Nicholas P. Heinke, and Mr. Burt. The litigation will be led by Jodanna Haskins and Ian Kellogg and supervised by Gregory A. Kasper, Mr. Heinke, and Mr. Burt.</p>
<p>The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Southern District of New York and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.</p>

<title>Omakase: Statement On In The Matter Of Flyfish Club, LLC, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, SEC Commissioner Mark T. Uyeda, Sept. 16, 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Enforcement, NFTs, Securities, Commission, Membership
Summary: The article discusses the dissenting opinion on the SEC's enforcement action against Flyfish Club for its sale of NFTs.<br /><br />Summary: The dissenting commissioners argue that the sale of Flyfish NFTs should not be considered securities and that the SEC's focus on this case is misguided.<br /><br />Summary: They believe that NFTs are utility tokens and the SEC's application of securities laws is harmful, as it limits the ability of creative individuals to experiment with NFTs.<br /><br />Summary: They reference past cases where the SEC did not recommend enforcement action for unregistered sale of club memberships and argue that the concerns raised in this dissent would apply in similar cases.<br /><br />Summary: The Order also requires Flyfish Club to remove all links to crypto asset trading platforms from its website and social media channels. 
Summary: <div>
<p>For curmudgeonly commissioners like us, crypto enforcement feels a bit like a trip to a restaurant for a meal, Omakase style. Omakase translates to, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave it up to you.&rdquo; This directive is wonderful in the hands of a renowned chef, but disastrous in the hands of a crypto-obsessed Commission. Leaving crypto to be addressed in an endless series of misguided and overreaching cases has been and continues to be a consequential mistake. By its very nature, Omakase dining requires a deep level of trust. Americans should be able to extend a similar trust to our regulators. Today&rsquo;s settled enforcement action with Flyfish Club for its sale of non-fungible tokens (&ldquo;NFTs&rdquo;) is just the latest dish that undermines trust in Chef SEC.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-flyfish-091624#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Accordingly, we dissent.</p>
<p>Flyfish Club, a dining club, sold NFTs&mdash;unique digital tokens recorded on a blockchain&mdash;as the exclusive way to access a yet-to-be-built restaurant and bar. Flyfish NFT owners will be eligible to eat in the restaurant, which is scheduled to open soon (though they will still have to pay for their food and drink). A pricier Omakase NFT qualifies owners to eat in the more exclusive Omakase room. Flyfish and Omakase NFT owners can lease or sell their NFT&mdash;and thus their membership&mdash;to someone else. The Flyfish Club received royalties for many of the secondary sales and earned $2.7 million in such royalties. Flyfish created approximately 3,000 NFTs, of which it sold slightly more than half at $8,400 for the regular NFTs and $14,300 for the Omakase NFTs, for aggregate proceeds of $14.8 million. Flyfish Club held on to the remaining NFTs for future distribution. According to an interview with a Flyfish principal that was excerpted in the order, the intent behind Flyfish&rsquo;s utility-based NFT project was to &ldquo;build a large business around this with multiple clubs, ancillary offerings, other social experiences, pop-up events, and build a whole world around Flyfish Club.&rdquo; That is to say, the social experiences were at the heart of the Flyfish venture.</p>
<p>The Commission, with the many demands on its time and resources, inexplicably has decided to focus on membership in an exclusive dining club. This case is not one in which the Commission alleges fraud; it finds only that Flyfish Club should have registered its sale of membership NFTs as securities transactions.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-flyfish-091624#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;In our view, the NFTs here are utility tokens, not securities, and statements by the founders and NFT purchasers that a successful restaurant would cause the NFT price to rise do not change that. While a member potentially could earn a profit by leasing or selling her token, the NFT has a concrete use: you need it to eat at the Flyfish Club. The Order slaps the&nbsp;<i>Howey</i>&nbsp;label on these NFTs because &ldquo;Investors in Flyfish NFTs had a reasonable expectation of obtaining future profits based on the managerial and entrepreneurial efforts of Flyfish and its principals.&rdquo; To the contrary, Howey is inapt because holders of Flyfish NFTs had a reasonable expectation of obtaining in the future wonderful culinary experiences and other exclusive membership experiences based on the managerial and entrepreneurial efforts of Flyfish and its principals. Whether their expectations will be met should not be judged by a securities regulator. Might someone who moved out of the area or moved on to a new phase of life decide to sell her membership? Sure. And might&mdash;as the Order states&mdash;many purchasers have purchased the NFTs with speculative intent? Sure. A well-known artist who sells a limited set of numbered prints may be selling to a couple who wants to display her art in their home, or to someone who wants to turn around and sell it for a profit and is making a bet on the artist&rsquo;s future. The intent of a buyer cannot transform a non-security into a security. Will Flyfish Club members really be better off now that the Commission is making it much harder to sell their memberships?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-flyfish-091624#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>The securities laws are not needed here, and their application is harmful both in the present case and as future precedent. The Flyfish NFTs were simply a different way to sell memberships. Why shouldn&rsquo;t a chef be able to sell memberships to eat at her kitchen table and to collect royalties on resales of those memberships? NFTs offer a promising way to allow creative people&mdash;such as chefs, musicians, or visual artists&mdash;to monetize their talent and a potentially efficient way for selling access to experiences and communities. Experiments like Flyfish Club are not a threat to the American investor. Creative people should be able to experiment with NFTs without having to consult a high-priced tea-leaf reader&mdash;ahem, lawyer. The Commission can change its menu to include a healthy serving of guidance to give non-securities NFT creators the freedom to experiment.</p>

<title>Eurex Clearing AG Participates In Project Agorá</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> partnership, tokenization, wholesale payments, central banks, efficiency <br />
Summary: Eurex Clearing AG joins Project Agorá, a collaboration between central banks and private firms to explore tokenization's impact on wholesale cross-border payments, aiming to enhance efficiency. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>Eurex Clearing AG is excited to announce its participation in Project Agor&aacute;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Project Agor&aacute;, launched by the<a href="https://www.bis.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">&nbsp;Bank for International Settlements (BIS)</a>, a group of leading central banks, and the Institute of International Finance (IIF), will proceed to the next phase with more than 40 private sector financial firms in their exploration of how tokenization can enhance wholesale cross-border payments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Project Agor&aacute; (Greek for "marketplace") is structured as a public-private collaboration. It brings together seven central banks: Bank of France (representing the Eurosystem), Bank of Japan, Bank of Korea, Bank of Mexico, Swiss National Bank, Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, convened by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). They will work in partnership with a group of private financial firms, convened by the Institute of International Finance (IIF).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project builds on the unified ledger concept proposed by the BIS (link) and will investigate how tokenized commercial bank deposits can be seamlessly integrated with tokenized wholesale central bank money in a public-private programmable core financial platform. This could enhance the functioning of the monetary system and provide new solutions using smart contracts and programmability, while maintaining its two-tier structure. This major public-private partnership will seek to overcome several structural inefficiencies in how payments happen today, especially across borders, which add a layer of challenges: different legal, regulatory and technical requirements, operating hours and time zones. Plus the increased complexity of carrying out financial integrity controls (eg against money laundering and customer verification), which today are often repeated several times for the same transaction, depending on the number of intermediaries involved.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p--heading-1">&ldquo;We are honored that Eurex Clearing is the sole CCP in this global project. We are committed to support enhancements that drive efficiency and reduce risks in global payments.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jens Janka, COO and Member of the Executive Board of Eurex Clearing AG</p>

<div> Companies, IBEX ESG index, additions, exclusions, sustainability

Summary:
The IBEX ESG index adds 7 companies and removes 4, reaching 49 components. It measures companies' ESG performance and requires compliance with UN Global Compact Principles.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<ul>
<li><span>Aena, Elecnor, IAG, Lar Espa&ntilde;a, Neinor Homes, Puig and Tubacex join the index</span></li>
<li><span>The indicator excludes 4 companies as they are no longer part of its selection universe (IBEX 35&reg; or IBEX&reg; Medium Cap)</span></li>
<li><span>The index, which measures companies' performance on environmental, social and governance aspects, reaches 49 components in its first review after its launch in October 2023</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The Technical Advisory Committee has decided to add seven new companies to the IBEX<span>&reg;</span>&nbsp;ESG index, as well as the exit of four, as they are no longer part of the selection universe (IBEX 35<span>&reg;</span>&nbsp;or IBEX<span>&reg;</span>&nbsp;Medium Cap), so the index has increased from 46 to 49 components.&nbsp;<span>Aena, Elecnor, IAG, Lar Espa&ntilde;a, Neinor Homes, Puig and Tubacex</span>&nbsp;are added, and&nbsp;<span>Alba, Catalana Occidente, Grenergy</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span>Prosegur</span>&nbsp;are removed. The changes will be effective from 23 September.</p>
<p>Following this revision, the IBEX&reg; ESG is made up of the following companies:</p>
<p><span>Acciona, Acciona Energ&iacute;a, Acerinox, ACS, Aena, Almirall, Amadeus, Atresmedia, Bankinter, BBVA, CAF, Caixabank, Cellnex, Cie, Colonial, Dominion, Ebro, Edreams, Elecnor, Enagas, Ence, Faes, Ferrovial, Fluidra, Gestamp, Grifols, Iberdrola, Inditex, IAG, Lar Espa&ntilde;a, Linea Directa, Mapfre, Meli&aacute;, Merlin, Neinor Homes, Pharma Mar, Puig, Redeia, Rovi, Sabadell, Sacyr, Santander, Solaria, T&eacute;cnicas Reunidas, Telefonica, Tubacex, Unicaja, Vidrala y Viscofan</span>.</p>
<p>This sustainability index was launched in October last year with the aim of providing independent information to the market on how well companies are performing on environmental, social and governance issues. The independent consultant Inrate provides the information needed to measure the impact of companies.</p>
<p>Any IBEX 35<span>&reg;</span>&nbsp;or IBEX<span>&reg;</span>&nbsp;Medium Cap company with an ESG rating equal to or higher than C+ (there are 12 levels ranging from A+ to D-) is eligible for inclusion in the indices. In addition, companies must comply with the United Nations Global Compact Principles, and certain exclusion criteria for business activities critical to sustainability are taken into account.</p>

Summary: Exegy integrates Enyx and Vela, launches Client Success Initiative led by Yewande Sobola and Thomas Gallo to optimize support and delivery functions. <div>
<p><span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://click.icptrack.com/icp/relay.php?r=59597334&amp;msgid=631223&amp;act=FNP7&amp;c=783105&amp;pid=4500465&amp;destination=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.exegy.com%2F&amp;cf=3638&amp;v=527f43e1b5610330d904e4ea41b6ea943cc4e23146431d00e8c58ff6417a967c" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>Exegy</span></a></span><span>, the leading provider of market data and trading technology for the capital markets, is announcing today the hiring of Yewande Sobola and Thomas Gallo to spearhead its Client Success Initiative. This signifies the successful integration of Enyx and Vela with Exegy, where FPGA technology underpins Exegy's core offerings. With this milestone, a new brand is introduced along with an expanded client success initiative.&nbsp;</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The program&rsquo;s main goal is for Exegy to become an extension of clients&rsquo; technology and operations teams, enabling them to achieve better business outcomes than they could on their own. The two new senior team members are a crucial part of Exegy&rsquo;s leadership team and are overseeing the optimization of global support and delivery functions as part of the client success initiative.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Yewande Sobola, Global Head of Solutions Consulting, brings 15+ years of global experience in the trading technology space. Prior to joining Exegy, she held roles as a Senior Network Engineer at G-Research, Network Engineer at Trading Technologies, and most recently spent six years as Executive Director of Sales Engineering at Pico. Her vision for the Client Success Initiative is to develop a team that will be acting as expert technology consultants and an extension of internal client teams, helping them extract maximum value from Exegy solutions and accelerating deployments of new trading infrastructure.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Gallo&rsquo;s experience lies within client success management, having joined Exegy from Pico where he was Vice President, Client Success Management &amp; Delivery for over three years. He previously held roles at ITG and Virtu Financial, driving support and coverage across their global product suite. He is now Vice President, Head of Client Success at Exegy, a role in which he will be spearheading client engagement with the initiative. With their combined expertise, Exegy&rsquo;s new leaders will enable Exegy to consistently align its solution delivery and ongoing services to the business goals of its clients.&nbsp;</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>David Taylor, CEO of Exegy, said: &ldquo;The successful integration of three major capital markets technology players into one company is an accomplishment not to be underestimated. We brought together not only the technology, but also the cultures and processes that enable us to bring&nbsp;the most value to our clients. We are delighted to have Yewande and Tom on our team to maximize value delivery to our clients.&nbsp;To mark this achievement, we are rolling out a new look and feel of the brand, which embodies the unification of the three companies &ndash; Exegy, Vela, and Enyx.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>

<title>LuxSE And CEB Mark EUR 10bn Of Social Inclusion Bonds</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/luxse-and-ceb-mark-eur-10bn-of-social-inclusion-bonds/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/luxse-and-ceb-mark-eur-10bn-of-social-inclusion-bonds/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="paragraph"><b>The Council of Europe Development Bank has passed the EUR 10 billion mark in total Social Inclusion Bond issuance since its first social bond was issued in 2017. Today, CEB celebrated this important milestone at the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, where the bonds are listed.&nbsp; </b><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="paragraph"><b>Luxembourg 16 September 2024: </b>In the presence of Luxembourg Minister of Finance Gilles Roth, the Governor of the Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB) Carlo Monticelli visited the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (LuxSE) for the very first time today to celebrate a crucial milestone in the bank&rsquo;s pioneering contribution to creating social impact through sustainable finance.</p>
<p class="paragraph">With the social development bank&rsquo;s latest Social Inclusion Bond issuance in April this year, its largest ever syndicated Social Inclusion Bond of EUR 1.25bn, the CEB has raised a total of more than EUR 10bn through its Social Inclusion Bonds since 2017. Through these bonds, the CEB has supported vulnerable communities, fostered social cohesion across Europe and acted as a first responder in large-scale social crises.</p>
<p class="paragraph">All the bank&rsquo;s social bonds were listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and displayed on the Luxembourg Green Exchange (LGX), the world&rsquo;s leading platform for sustainable securities.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Gilles Roth, Luxembourg Minister of Finance, remarked that: &ldquo;Achieving the cumulative issuance of EUR 10 billion in social inclusion bonds is a fantastic milestone that highlights the CEB&rsquo;s commitment to sustainable growth. By focusing on the social dimension, we ensure that progress leaves no one behind. Pursuing efforts in social finance allows us to harness the power of finance to build a better, more equal future for all. The Luxembourg Stock Exchange&rsquo;s role as a key partner and listing location for these social bonds is a wonderful demonstration of the platform&rsquo;s capabilities.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="paragraph"><b>Pioneering social bond issuance</b></p>
<p class="paragraph">The CEB was one of the early issuers of social bonds and has shaped the social bond market as an active issuer, but also as a founder of the International Capital Market Association&rsquo;s social bond working group, which led to the establishment of the industry-leading standard for social bonds, the Social Bond Principles in 2017.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Initially, the Paris-based social development bank issued its Social Inclusion Bonds exclusively in EUR. Since 2020, the bank has issued social bonds in multiple currencies, including USD, SEK, NOK, AUD and CAD, thereby expanding the appeal of the social bond market and responding to the needs of a diversified investor community.</p>
<p>"We embarked on this extraordinary journey nearly a decade ago, and over the years our Social Inclusion Bonds have become a hallmark of the CEB on the international capital markets. Today, I am delighted to celebrate our EUR 10 billion milestone at the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, which has been a dedicated and loyal partner of the CEB every step of the way,&rdquo; commented Governor Monticelli.</p>
<p class="paragraph">In the early days of its social bond issuance journey, the CEB focused on three categories of social impact, namely education, social housing and MSME lending. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020, the CEB added another social category to its list, namely health. Today, the Social Inclusion Bonds represent more than 40% of the CEB&rsquo;s annual funding. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="paragraph"><b>From green to social impact</b></p>
<p class="paragraph">Initially, the focus of sustainable finance was on contributing positively to different environmental goals and help accelerate the green transition. The social dimension came to the fore in 2020, when governments and companies alike raised funding to address the far-reaching social and societal fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p class="paragraph">&ldquo;We are proud to serve as the reference exchange for the Council of Europe Development Bank&rsquo;s Social Inclusion Bonds. The CEB is one of our leading issuers in the social bond sphere and we applaud the bank&rsquo;s pivotal role in propelling the social aspect of sustainable finance and contributing to a fair and just transition. By leveraging capital market financing, the CEB&nbsp;has significantly improved the lives of vulnerable communities throughout Europe,&rdquo; commented Julie Becker, CEO of LuxSE.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="paragraph">LGX started as a platform for green bonds in 2016. In response to market developments, LuxSE increased the scope of instruments to include social and sustainability bonds the following year. One of the first social bonds displayed on the social bond window of LGX was the first Social Inclusion Bond issued by CEB.</p>
<p class="paragraph">The relationship between CEB and LuxSE precedes the Social Inclusion Bonds, and dates back to 1985, when the first bond issued by the CEB was listed on LuxSE. Today, there are around 50 outstanding bonds issued by the CEB listed on LuxSE, totalling EUR 30 billion, which includes 14 Social Inclusion Bonds.</p>

<div> global Fintech leader, asset servicing, real-time platform, AI utilization, modular design
Summary: 
Broadridge introduces a unified real-time platform for asset servicing, featuring AI utilization, modular design, and streamlined operations for efficient financial management. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>To redefine the financial industry's conventional approach to asset servicing (the range of administrative and operational functions that support the management and maintenance of investment assets), global Fintech leader&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.broadridge.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Broadridge Financial Solutions</a>&nbsp;Inc. (NYSE: BR) is introducing a ground-breaking integration of several asset servicing functions into a single, real-time, multi-currency platform across capital markets, wealth management, asset management and global custody. This innovation transforms traditionally fragmented activities and extends well beyond existing industry&nbsp;asset servicing solutions&nbsp;to include tax and performance reporting, cost basis, proxy, class actions, reclaims&nbsp;and a truly global custody platform. The streamlined solution enhances automation, drives straight-through processing benefits, leverages a common data ontology to optimize AI utilization and improves operational accuracy, speed and risk mitigation.</p>
<p>"Broadridge&rsquo;s new unified platform represents a major shift in asset servicing," said Michael Alexander, President of Wealth Management at Broadridge. &ldquo;Changes like the transition to T+1 and eventual T+0 settlement cycles and the rise of AI strategies are driving the demand for real-time, standardized data and streamlined, end-to-end operations. Companies have long struggled with challenges such as high costs, delays in processing, risk evaluation, data reconciliation and sub-par service levels. With our trusted expertise and transformative technology, we are uniquely positioned to create a single, best-in-class solution that addresses these issues head-on and can help our clients operate more efficiently in an increasingly digital and data-driven environment."</p>
<p>Broadridge Global Asset Servicing combines over 18 components to deliver unprecedented functionality and a "single gateway" data integration approach. It streamlines the management and maintenance of financial assets, facilitating their safekeeping, accurate transaction processing, and compliance with regulations. Solution features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modular design to seamlessly support onboarding and the overall experience.</li>
<li>Ability for institutions to consolidate and reconcile data more efficiently across the entire business, eliminating friction and minimizing financial and reputational risk.</li>
<li>Simplified tech stack to help users realize straight-through processing across the asset servicing ecosphere.</li>
<li>Consolidated, real-time data supports advanced, generative artificial intelligence to provide predictive and operational analytics, driving efficiency and real-time decision making.</li>
</ul>
<p>The platform is powered by real-time advisor and customer event notifications with a full omnichannel communications system that minimizes decision-making time and reduces risk. Its seamless interoperability transforms asset servicing operations, eliminates workarounds, and reduces risk. The modular design allows organizations to select the components needed today and effortlessly deploy additional capabilities as requirements evolve.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eurex will open its markets to further member groups in the U.S. As of 16 September 2024, the leading European derivatives exchange will allow U.S. Introducing Brokers (IB) to become direct exchange members. The European-based exchange is thus once again living up to its claim of making its markets easily accessible to a broad global trading community.&nbsp;<br /><br />The U.S. regulatory authority CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission) announced in July that it has approved final rules amending Part 48 of its regulations. This change allows CFTC-registered foreign boards of trade (FBOTs) to give U.S. IBs registered with the CFTC direct access to their electronic trading systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />IBs generally act as intermediaries between clients and brokers. So far, U.S. market participants utilizing Introducing Brokers to trade on Eurex had been limited to non-U.S.-based Introducing Brokers, many of whom were not available after markets closed in Europe. The new regulation and Eurex&rsquo;s new offer will enable U.S. clients to continue to execute via U.S. Introducing Brokers for the full U.S. trading day.&nbsp;<br /><br />A wide range of European and global benchmark derivatives can be traded on Eurex till the end of the U.S. trading day, these include flagship derivatives such as EURO STOXX 50, STOXX Europe 600, German Bond Futures or a broad range of MSCI derivatives.&nbsp;<br /><br />Robbert Booij, CEO of Eurex: &ldquo;Providing clients with easy access to our markets is a top priority for us. This latest move offers U.S. market participants greater choice and will provide them with greater efficiency in terms of trading and risk management.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: Ecospend, Trustly, Open Banking, HMRC, contract <br />
Summary: Ecospend, a Trustly Company, extends its contract with HMRC to provide open banking solutions, reducing errors and fraud, and improving payment processes.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Ecospend, a Trustly Company and the UK leader in open banking payments, has retained the UK&rsquo;s most significant open banking contract to date with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ecospend will continue to offer its Open Banking solutions to enhance parts of HMRC&rsquo;s payment processes and deliver innovative data solutions for taxpayers. Such services provide a range of benefits from decreasing errors and reducing fraud to improving usability for UK taxpayers while reducing costs for HMRC itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The original contract was won by Ecospend in 2021 (prior to its acquisition by Trustly in 2022) and by volume has become the single biggest use case for open banking payments in the UK with &pound;30bn of tax payments processed since launch.</p>
<p>As part of the re-awarded contract, Ecospend will continue to provide its account-to-account payment services which allow HMRC to process payments across over&nbsp;forty tax regimes including Self-Assessment, PAYE, Corporation Tax and VAT.&nbsp;As Open Banking payments require minimal manual data entry and are sent directly from a taxpayer&rsquo;s bank account using pre-filled HMRC account details, the solution significantly improves payment reconciliation. This means that in addition to cost savings, faster-speeds, and less human error, it is proven to significantly reduce the need for suspense accounts for incoming payments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The extension of the contract will allow both HMRC and Ecospend, A Trustly Company, to continue to drive the open banking agenda in the UK, bringing value for money and efficiencies to taxpayers.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Johan Tj&auml;rnberg, Group CEO of Trustly, comments:&nbsp;</b>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re thrilled that we have been awarded a new contract to provide Open Banking services to HMRC. We believe this is one of the most innovative relationships to embed financial technology within a Government. Our technology will allow HMRC to continue to offer a&nbsp;simple, fast, and secure payment experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>James Hickman, CCO at&nbsp;</b><b>Ecospend, A Trustly Company, said:&nbsp;</b>&ldquo;We are excited to continue our excellent working relationship with HMRC and build on the success of the last three years.&nbsp;Our collaboration to date is the industry standard for Open Banking and HMRC has led the industry in proving its value at scale. Further adoption of Open Banking across Government will help speed up and simplify payments, prevent fraud, and reduce costs to the public sector.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<div> received, TSOs, methodology, capacity, decision <br />
Summary: 
ACER received a request from TSOs to amend the methodology for cross-zonal capacity allocation to improve integration and reduce costs. ACER aims to make a decision by 31 January 2025. <div>
<p>On 31 July 2024, ACER received a&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtXUFcCV1RRBkwIBAcAHVYJBw4dCggJVRoCBwAEUQNXBg9XVQIdAgBVBF0GBFMdVAoGVx0GDwhTGlRdAgIZVVcCAVcFBgdZBltYRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">proposal</a>&nbsp;from Transmission System Operators (TSOs) to amend the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsBCFdSWAQFV0xYU1ZRHVYLBQIdCgEFABoHA1EFUlYBDwdQA1IdAgBVBF0GBFMdVAoGVx0GDwhTGlRdAgIZVVcCAVcFBgdZBltYRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">harmonised methodology for cross-zonal capacity allocation for the exchange of balancing capacity or sharing of reserves</a>.</p>
<p>Today, ACER opens a&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsHUgMCWARTBUxcUwACHVYAVFUdU11UBRpXU1IHA1EMVg8IBgMdAgBVBF0GBFMdVAoGVx0GDwhTGlRdAgIZVVcCAVcFBgdZBltYRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">public consultation</a>&nbsp;on the topic and invites stakeholders to submit their views by 14 October 2024.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is the methodology about?</span></p>
<p>This methodology provides a harmonised approach for effective allocation of cross-zonal capacity for the exchange of balancing capacity or sharing of reserves. Having an optimised allocation of cross-zonal capacity is important to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Foster the integration of balancing capacity markets.</li>
<li>Lower the costs of procuring balancing capacity (hence the costs for tariff payers).</li>
<li>Ensure the security of electricity supply.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why amend the methodology?</span></p>
<p>Amending the methodology is necessary to clarify the governance of the market-based process, covering both its implementation and operation. This aims to ensure the process runs efficiently and encourage more TSOs to apply it.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the next steps?</span></p>
<p>ACER expects to reach a decision by 31 January 2025.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> advocate, corporate governance, equity market, regulatory, investor<br />
Summary:<br />
SIAS advocate for fair markets, improve equity market, encourage quality listings, enhance investor participation, re-evaluate regulations for growth. <div>
<p>Mr David Gerald, Founder, President, and CEO of the Securities Investors Association (Singapore),<br /><br />Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, good morning.<br /><br /><span><span>Introduction<br /></span></span></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;<span> </span>I would like to thank SIAS for inviting me to the Corporate Governance Conference 2024.</p>
<p>a. Let me start by congratulating SIAS on its 25th anniversary and for successfully organising the 15th iteration of its Corporate Governance Week this year.<br /><br />b. This has been an important platform for stakeholders to engage in meaningful discussions and share best practices to address emerging challenges in corporate governance.</p>
<p><span><span>Background</span></span></p>
<p>2.&nbsp;<span> </span>Over the years, SIAS has remained a strong advocate for investors. Under Mr David Gerald&rsquo;s leadership, SIAS has adopted a firm and constructive approach in pushing for fairer and more transparent financial markets. Beyond its advocacy role, SIAS has also guided companies to adopt good corporate governance practices, and spearheaded initiatives to enhance investors&rsquo; financial literacy.</p>
<p>a. In recent privatisation exercises, we saw how such advocacy efforts on behalf of minority shareholders resulted in higher offers, and achieved fairer outcomes for all involved<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/keynote-speech-by-mr-chee-hong-tat-at-the-sias-25th-anniversary-corporate-governance-conference-2024#1">[1]</a></span>.</p>
<p>b. On the investor education front, SIAS&rsquo; investor education programmes have benefited more than 300,000 retail investors. These programmes empower retail investors to make informed decisions.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;<span> </span>As we celebrate these achievements over the past 25 years, we recognise that much work remains to be done. One area which I look forward to SIAS&rsquo; continued contributions is how we can improve Singapore&rsquo;s equities market. This morning, I would like to provide everyone with an update on our on-going review.<br /><br />4.&nbsp;<span> </span>Let me start by saying candidly that it is not an easy task to revitalise our equities market, given the global headwinds faced by other exchanges and the increasing competition in this space. Although we have identified some ideas from our engagements with industry stakeholders, it is not a given that all these measures will succeed. But we are prepared to make changes and try new ideas. Because if we don&rsquo;t try, our chances of success is zero. If we take some calculated risks and try, it is not a guarantee we will succeed, but we have a chance to turn things around.<br /><br />5.&nbsp;<span> </span>Just as Pope Francis advised our young people during his recent visit to Singapore to have the courage to leave our comfort zones and take some risks, we shall do the same with our review, and be willing to try and take some calculated risks.<br /><br />6.&nbsp;<span> </span>In assessing our options, we will focus on what are Singapore&rsquo;s strengths and what is our value proposition to investors and the companies who are seeking listing. For example, Singapore has established ourselves as a leading REITs hub by identifying a market need and creating a supportive regulatory framework and ecosystem to nurture its growth. Today, we are the largest REITs market in Asia ex-Japan<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/keynote-speech-by-mr-chee-hong-tat-at-the-sias-25th-anniversary-corporate-governance-conference-2024#2">[2]</a></span>. I believe there can be other such opportunities for Singapore&rsquo;s equities market &ndash; not to go head-on against the larger exchanges, but to identify areas where we can add value by playing to our strengths.</p>
<p>a. For instance, could our market be a trusted venue to facilitate investor flows into mid-sized regional companies, who can enjoy better brand and investor familiarity within their own backyard compared to listing in a larger global market? Being a big fish in a smaller pond can be a more attractive value proposition compared to being an ikan bilis or ikan kuning in a big ocean. I thought of these two fishes because they are often found in nasi lemak, which is one of my favourite local dishes.<br /><br />b. Singapore and our region have also seen a strong burst of entrepreneurship and produced many good quality growth companies. Singapore should aim to provide a platform for these Asian companies to raise funds and support their future growth.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;<span> </span>A robust equities market provides a venue to facilitate successful IPO exits &ndash; which allows private equity and venture capitalist investors to recycle capital into other startups and early-stage growth companies. This completes a virtuous cycle of growth, innovation and a more vibrant financial market. This is why the Government is considering policy measures and incentives to improve Singapore&rsquo;s equities market and enterprise financing ecosystem. These are important elements of our business ecosystem to support a competitive economy.</p>
<p>a. The Equities Markets Review Group that MAS has set up will take a closer look at the challenges we face and recommend measures that can position Singapore&rsquo;s equities market for growth.<br />&emsp;<br />b. Our objectives are clear; to develop an equities market that provides an attractive venue for local and regional enterprises to access funding and support for their innovation and expansion plans.<br /><br />c. As Mr Koh Boon Hwee, Chairman of SGX, said during our first Review Group meeting, the review is not about SGX as a company. I fully agree with Boon Hwee, and this is aligned with our strategic approach for the review. The focus is not about SGX, but about growing Singapore&rsquo;s equities market.<br />&emsp;<br />d. To be clear, SGX has been performing well, including in Equities Derivatives and Fixed Income, Currency and Commodity (or FICC) business segments<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/keynote-speech-by-mr-chee-hong-tat-at-the-sias-25th-anniversary-corporate-governance-conference-2024#3">[3]</a></span>. And if we succeed in growing our equities market, SGX as a company will certainly also benefit from the growth because a rising tide will lift all boats. However, the Review Group&rsquo;s scope extends beyond SGX; we are considering the broader capital market and enterprise financing landscape.<br /><br />e. At the core of our strategy, we are focusing on strengthening the supply of good companies and creating a strong financial ecosystem to support their growth. We have to complement this with a broader range of products to draw in demand from a larger pool of investors, both institutional and retail investors.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;<span> </span>Besides the members of the Review Group and its two workstreams, we are actively engaging stakeholders from across the enterprise financing and market ecosystems &ndash; including start-ups, enterprises, banks, fund managers, market intermediaries, and investors such as those that SIAS represents.<br /><br />9.&nbsp;<span> </span>I am heartened by the strong interest from industry stakeholders and the public since the launch of our review last month. I would like to thank everyone for your views and suggestions, including some members in the audience who have written to my colleagues and I to share your feedback and ideas. We hope to continue to engage with you as we study the different ideas and initiatives.<br /><br />10.&nbsp;<span> </span>We can group the ideas into three main areas:</p>
<p>a. Encouraging pipeline of quality listings;</p>
<p>b. Enhancing investor participation and broadening market liquidity; and</p>
<p>c. Re-evaluating our regulatory structures and approach.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp;<span> </span>Please allow me to briefly elaborate on each one.<br /><br /><span><span>Encouraging pipeline of quality listings</span></span></p>
<p>12.&nbsp;<span> </span>Singapore is globally recognised as a leading startup hub in Asia, with a vibrant startup and innovation ecosystem supporting the growth of promising startups. Today, we have over 4,500 tech startups, 400 venture capital firms as well as 240 incubators and accelerators. Through the StartupSG initiative, Enterprise Singapore has supported many entrepreneurs and startups, enabling them to access crucial resources and networks such as market opportunities, talent and capital.<br /><br />13.&nbsp;<span> </span>Singapore has also consistently retained our position as the country with one of the best business environments. This is driven by many factors such as a progressive regulatory environment, which we will continue to improve through rules and process reviews, stable and efficient infrastructure, and access to top quality financial intermediation and services. This is also why many companies, both local and foreign, choose to set up their regional and global headquarters in Singapore.<br /><br />14.&nbsp;<span> </span>The Review Group will build on this strong foundation to enhance our value proposition to growth companies from Singapore and the region, by providing them with a strong equities market to raise capital for their growth and expansion.</p>
<p>a. A key target segment of companies that we hope can consider a listing in Singapore are those which are already based here. We will look at the incentives to encourage listing, and to reduce the costs of listing to lower entry barriers.<br /><br />b. There is also scope to explore attracting growth companies from emerging markets, in certain niches such as in fintech &amp; innovation and sustainability. Such companies could benefit from raising capital in a trusted and open market venue like Singapore.</p>
<p>15.&nbsp;<span> </span>At the same time, due to the current venture capital funding winter, we have observed that more start-ups are listing before they are ready for the scrutiny of public markets. These companies are looking for alternative markets to maximise the valuation for their investors who are seeking exits.</p>
<p>a. In this regard, we are reviewing how we can work with investors and fund managers to catalyse the secondary private fund sector to better support and nurture such late-stage start-ups in our ecosystem, as they grow and consider an IPO in the future.</p>
<p>16.&nbsp;<span> </span>Other areas the Review Group will explore include enhancing research coverage of targeted sectors, before and after they go public.</p>
<p>a. Research provides visibility and bridges information asymmetry, helping companies attract investors and capital. It also generates investor interest and supports their decision-making when these companies are ready to transit from being privately-held to publicly-listed.<br /><br />b. We will collaborate closely with the industry, including SIAS, to explore initiatives to strengthen research capabilities and expand coverage of our companies.</p>
<p><span><span>Enhancing investor participation and broadening market liquidity</span></span></p>
<p>17.&nbsp;<span> </span>Next, to complement our efforts to strengthen and broaden the pipeline of growth companies, we recognise the need to further deepen market liquidity through demand initiatives. Market liquidity is necessary to promote efficient price discovery and fair valuations, and to attract new listings.</p>
<p>a. Market data suggests that liquidity in our equities market is currently concentrated in a limited number of well-known counters.<br /><br />b. Around 85% of securities daily average value traded on the SGX is attributable to the 30 large-caps that make up the Straits Times Index.</p>
<p>18.&nbsp;<span> </span>To improve liquidity, industry players have shared ideas on possible measures to catalyse broader investor participation, from both institutional and retail investors.</p>
<p>a. Such measures include incentivising market makers to facilitate price discovery, broadening stock indices and expanding the pool of equity market derivatives.<br /><br />b. We will study these ideas and others, with the aim of boosting market liquidity in Singapore.</p>
<p><span><span>Re-evaluating our regulatory structures and approach</span></span></p>
<p>19.&nbsp;<span> </span>Lastly, re-evaluating our regulatory structures and approach. Over time, additional rules and safeguards have been introduced to protect investors, mitigate risks and uplift market practices. The moves were made with good intentions, but with the passage of time and with new technological and industry developments, we need to ask ourselves if all of these rules and regulations are still relevant and required. And if we need to change, we must have the courage to take some risks and make the changes.<br /><br />20.&nbsp;<span> </span>The Review Group will take a careful look at our regulatory regime, and where necessary, &ldquo;prune&rdquo; regulations that may no longer be necessary or pose disproportionate regulatory burden.<br />&emsp;<br />21.&nbsp;<span> </span>We will be guided by the principles of a disclosure-based regime that facilitates dynamism while having in place proper safeguards and avenues for investor recourse. There may be areas where the risk appetite in the system has fallen in response to market failures, and it is useful to relook and recalibrate our approach. There are important trade-offs which the Review Group and workstreams would need to discuss and assess &ndash; we are prepared to make bold changes but we want to do so after we carefully assess the trade-offs.<br /><br />22.&nbsp;<span> </span>One area we are exploring is to streamline the prospectus disclosure requirements to lighten compliance burden for IPO issuers, while sharpening the focus on material disclosures and disclosure quality. The streamlining will also apply to disclosure requirements for secondary listings.<br /><br />23.&nbsp;<span> </span>Another example, while not as directly linked to the equities market, is our complex products regime which imposes distribution safeguards to ensure that consumers are aware of the complexity and risk profile of the products they invest in.</p>
<p>a. More than a decade from when the rules were introduced, there has been improved access to investment knowledge and product information. Standards for licensed financial advisors have also been enhanced.<br /><br />b. MAS will explore how our requirements can be more risk targeted, including removing some of the checks that are currently required for all retail customers.</p>
<p>24.&nbsp;<span> </span>As we lift the regulatory burden to enable more investment options in the market, the industry and investors will need to do their due diligence checks, and exercise caution and judgment based on their risk appetites and investment preferences. It will not be a one-size fits all approach, and one has to go in with open eyes and be mentally prepared for negative outcomes, which can happen with any investment. Unlike buying durians, there is no &ldquo;bao jiak&rdquo; or guarantee when it comes to investments.</p>
<p>a. Investors therefore need to understand their own risk tolerance for potential losses and the risk profile of the products before they invest.<br /><br />b. SIAS can continue to play a key role here. Through its investment seminars and programs, SIAS equips retail investors with knowledge and tools to know what to look out for when investing in a company. For example, the Three Questions Initiative by SIAS, encourages investors to be discerning about information and events impacting their investments.<br /><br />c. We will also look into ways to strengthen our investor recourse framework, to better enable investors to seek redress in cases of market misconduct. The Review Group and workstreams will be happy to discuss possible options in greater detail with industry stakeholders, including SIAS.</p>
<p><span><span>Conclusion</span></span></p>
<p>25.&nbsp;<span> </span>Ladies and gentlemen, I have spoken about some areas that the Review Group is exploring to better position the Singapore equities market for growth &ndash; (i) Encourage pipeline of quality listings, (ii) Enhance investor participation and broaden market liquidity, and (iii) Re-evaluate our regulatory structures and approach.<br /><br />26.&nbsp;<span> </span>We will be consulting closely with market participants and relevant stakeholders. As we study the different ideas and consider their feasibility, there will be those that we decide to implement first while others may need more time to further review. We do not intend to wait till the end of 12 months before we start to implement the proposals. That will take too long. It is better for us to stage the review and implement the measures in phases.<br /><br />27.&nbsp;<span> </span>I would like to conclude my speech by thanking SIAS for serving as a bridge between investors, regulators and industry players in our ecosystem over the past 25 years. May you continue to play this important role and more, as we grow our equities market and financial sector in Singapore.<br /><br />28.&nbsp;<span> </span>I wish everyone a fruitful conference ahead. Thank you.</p>

<div> Meeting, Financial Stability Oversight Council, Executive Session, Dodd-Frank Act, Transparency Policy
<br /><br />Summary:
The Secretary of the Treasury will preside over a closed executive session meeting to discuss financial market developments and regulatory issues. <div>
<p>On Friday, September 20, Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen will preside over a meeting of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council) at the Treasury Department. The meeting will consist only of an executive session. The preliminary agenda for the executive session includes an update on the Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance; an update on the Council&rsquo;s Climate-related Financial Risk Committee and a vote on additional members of the Council&rsquo;s Climate-related Financial Risk Advisory Committee; the Council&rsquo;s 2024 annual report; and the Council&rsquo;s fiscal year 2025 budget.*</p>
<p>The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires the Council to convene no less than quarterly, but the Council has historically convened on a more frequent basis. The meetings bring Council members together to discuss and analyze emerging market developments and financial regulatory issues. The Council is committed to conducting its business as openly and transparently as practicable, given the confidential supervisory and sensitive information at the center of its work. Consistent with the&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/261/The%20Council%26%23039%3Bs%20Transparency%20Policy_1.pdf">Council's transparency policy</a>, the Council opens its meetings to the public whenever possible.</p>
<p><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/webcasts">Open session Council meetings are made available to the public via live webcast and can also be viewed after they occur</a>. Upcoming Council meeting dates and times are posted following the official notification to Council members of an upcoming meeting.</p>
<p>Meeting minutes and readouts for past Council meetings are available below. Meeting minutes for the most recent Council meeting are generally approved at the next Council meeting and posted online soon afterwards.</p>
<p><small>* In accordance with the Council&rsquo;s Transparency Policy, which is available at&nbsp;</small><a href="http://www.fsoc.gov/"><small>www.fsoc.gov</small></a><small>, this meeting will be held in a closed session to prevent the potential disclosure of information contained in or related to investigation, examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of, an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial markets or financial institutions; information which would lead to significant financial speculation, significantly endanger the stability of any financial market or financial institution, or significantly frustrate implementation of a proposed agency action; information exempted from disclosure by statute or by regulation, or authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order to be kept secret; trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential; inter-agency and intra-agency memoranda or letters which would not otherwise be available by law; and to conduct administrative business of the Council.&nbsp;&nbsp;</small></p>

<title>US Department Of Justice: Twelve Defendants Sentenced For Violent Home Invasion Robberies To Steal Cryptocurrency</title>

<div> Keywords: Florida man, cryptocurrency, home invasion, SIM swapping, sentencing <br />
Summary:<br />
Florida man sentenced to 47 years for leading home invasion robberies targeting cryptocurrency. 12 co-conspirators also sentenced. Use of SIM swapping and violence. National enforcement team involved.<br /> <div>
<p>A Florida man was sentenced to 47 years in prison on Wednesday for his role in a scheme involving a series of home invasion robberies targeting cryptocurrency. Between Sept. 5 and Sept. 12, a total of 12 men have been sentenced for their role in the scheme.</p>
<p>According to court documents and evidence presented at the trial, Remy Ra St Felix, 25, of West Palm Beach, and his co-conspirators stole over $3.5 million from victims through SIM swapping and violent home invasions in which they held victims at gunpoint, assaulted them, and bound them with plastic cable ties. St Felix was convicted on June 25 by a federal jury in Greensboro, North Carolina, after a six-day trial. In addition to his sentence of incarceration, St Felix was sentenced to five years of supervised release and ordered to pay $524,153.39 in restitution.</p>
<p>According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, beginning in late 2020, St Felix&rsquo;s co-conspirator, Jarod Gabriel Seemungal, 23, of West Palm Beach, and foreign co-conspirators stole cryptocurrency from victims&rsquo; accounts at exchanges. They obtained access to the accounts by gaining control of the victims&rsquo; phone numbers through SIM swapping. In 2022, Seemungal and his co-conspirators devised the home invasion scheme and recruited St Felix and others to assist with the invasions. St Felix later became the leader of the home invasion crew. In September 2022, St Felix and members of the crew committed violent home invasions in Delray Beach and Homestead, Florida. In Delray Beach, the victims were held at gunpoint in their home. In Homestead, a man and his family were held at gunpoint in their home, and then the man was abducted, held hostage, and beaten, before the man was found by law enforcement 120 miles from his home.</p>
<p>Later in 2022, St Felix and his crew targeted a Little Elm, Texas, man and made several trips to attempt the robbery. In December 2022, Seemungal and a Houston-based crew comprised of Deangelo Lee Contreras, 21, Tristian Rene Gamez, 21, Victor Gonzalez, 27, Jesus Salazar, 24, Cristian Valdez, 21, and Jesus Gerardo Valdez, Jr., 27, all of Houston, Texas, committed the home invasion. The Little Elm man and members of his family were held at gunpoint and restrained in their home for over three hours, during which time members of the crew tortured the man and his mother. The perpetrators stole approximately $150,000.00 in cash, two Rolex watches, and a valuable necklace and pendant.</p>
<p>In April 2023, St Felix and Elmer Ruben Castro, 23, of West Palm Beach, invaded the home of a wife and a husband in Durham, North Carolina. Prior to the invasion, St Felix&rsquo;s co-conspirators obtained unauthorized access to the couple&rsquo;s email account and conducted multiple days of surveillance on their home. During the invasion, the men violently assaulted the couple, threatened them with guns, and restrained them with plastic cable ties. They forced the man to provide access to his computer and cryptocurrency exchange account. Seemungal then remotely accessed the computer and stole over $150,000.00 worth of cryptocurrency. Conspirators laundered the funds through anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies, as well as &ldquo;instant exchanges&rdquo; and decentralized finance platforms that did not conduct know-your-customer checks.</p>
<p>In July 2023, St Felix traveled from Florida to Long Island, New York, to commit a home invasion of a family of five. Before St Felix could do so, however, he was arrested. At the time of his arrest, St Felix was in possession of two firearms and plastic cable ties.</p>
<p>Throughout the conspiracy, the conspirators communicated via an encrypted messaging application to plan their crimes. They identified targets and discussed how to gain entry to homes, the tools required to carry out the crimes, the technical aspects of cryptocurrency, and the patterns of life of their targets. They also circulated pictures of their targets and their targets&rsquo; homes. In addition to the home invasions described above, conspirators used the encrypted messaging application to plan additional home invasion robberies in Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Orlando, Florida; and Georgia. Seemungal and the foreign co-conspirators financed the purchase of rental cars, hotel rooms, and firearms by co-conspirators Haisel Daily, 22, of West Palm Beach, and Ruben Matias Nicolopulos Silva, 22, of Lake Worth, Florida, to use during the robberies.</p>
<p>Seemungal was also sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison followed by five years of supervised release and ordered to pay $4,038,479.39 in restitution. Seemungal pleaded guilty on December 19, 2023, for his role in the scheme to steal cryptocurrency by hacking victims&rsquo; cryptocurrency accounts as well as the home invasion and robbery scheme.</p>
<p>On Feb. 6, Castro pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit kidnapping and kidnapping. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 1.</p>
<p>On May 29 and 30, nine of St Felix&rsquo;s and Seemungal&rsquo;s co-conspirators pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit kidnapping, and were sentenced as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jose Alfredo Avila, 27, of West Palm Beach, was sentenced on Sept. 11, to 20 years in prison, followed by four years of supervised release and ordered to pay $365,100.00 in restitution.</li>

Gamez was sentenced on Sept. 11, to eight years in prison, followed by three years of supervised release and ordered to pay $355,800.00 in restitution.</p>

Hairston for the Middle District of North Carolina; and Special Agent in Charge Robert M. DeWitt of the FBI Charlotte Field Office made the announcement.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Former Financial Consultant For Providing Father And Friends Inside Information Regarding Firm’s Client - Consultant’s Father And Two Friends Charged With Making More Than $1 Million In Illicit Insider Trading Profits</title>

<br />
Federico Nannini and associates charged by SEC for insider trading, sharing nonpublic information about IEA acquisition, resulting in illicit profits.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Federico Nannini, his father, and two of his friends for insider trading in advance of the pending acquisition of Infrastructure and Energy Alternatives, Inc. (IEA) by MasTec Inc., a client of the financial consulting firm where Nannini worked as an associate.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, on June 7, 2022, Federico Nannini, of Coral Gables, Florida, was entrusted with material nonpublic information that his firm&rsquo;s client, MasTec, was interested in acquiring IEA. The next day, Federico Nannini tipped his father, Mauro Nannini, who then purchased 34,500 shares of IEA over the next several weeks for $310,729. The SEC&rsquo;s investigation also found that, on June 15, Federico Nannini tipped his close friend Alejandro Thermiotis about the planned acquisition, which prompted Thermiotis to purchase more than $1.6 million of IEA stock before the market closed on June 16. Thermiotis then tipped his and Federico Nannini&rsquo;s high school friend, Francisco Tonarely, about the acquisition, which led Tonarely to purchase 321 shares of IEA on June 16.</p>
<p>According to the complaint, text messages revealed that Federico Nannini continued to share material nonpublic information about the status of the acquisition with Mauro Nannini and Thermiotis, which Thermiotis shared with Tonarely, and they traded on the information on multiple occasions. Subsequently, on July 25, 2022, MasTec announced its acquisition of IEA to the public, causing IEA&rsquo;s stock price to rise more than 31 percent. Soon thereafter, Mauro Nannini, Thermiotis, and Tonarely sold all of their IEA securities, realizing combined illicit profits of $1.1 million.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first rule of material nonpublic information is: You don&rsquo;t talk about material nonpublic information,&rdquo; said Eric I. Bustillo, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Miami Regional Office. &ldquo;As alleged in our complaint, Federico Nannini broke the rule and federal law when he shared information about MasTec&rsquo;s probable acquisition of IEA with his dad and high school buddy. This case underscores our steadfast commitment to expose insider trading and to hold violators, including financial professionals, accountable for their actions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, charges Federico Nannini, Mauro Nannini, Thermiotis, and Tonarely with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and seeks injunctive relief and civil penalties against all defendants and disgorgement with prejudgment interest against Mauro Nannini, Thermiotis, and Tonarely.</p>
<p>In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Southern District of Florida today announced criminal charges against Federico Nannini, Mauro Nannini, Thermiotis, and Tonarely.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s ongoing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Gonzalez, under the supervision of Jason R. Berkowitz and Glenn S. Gordon in the Miami Regional Office, with the assistance of Robert Nesbitt in the Investigative and Market Analytics group in the SEC&rsquo;s Washington, D.C. office. The SEC&rsquo;s litigation is being led by Russell R. O&rsquo;Brien and Mr. Gonzalez and supervised by Teresa J. Verges. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Southern District of Florida, the FBI Miami Field Office, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Zymergen Inc. With Misleading IPO Investors About Company’s Market Potential And Sales Prospects</title>

<div> IPO, Zymergen, SEC, misleading, biotechnology<br />
Summary: Zymergen misled investors about market potential, revenue forecasts, and customer pipeline for its only product, leading to a $30 million civil penalty. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against Zymergen Inc., an Emeryville, California-based biotechnology company, for misleading IPO investors about its overall market potential, revenue prospects, and customer pipeline for its only commercially available product, an electronics film named Hyaline. Zymergen raised approximately $530 million through its IPO in April 2021 and filed for bankruptcy in 2023. Zymergen agreed to pay a $30 million civil penalty to resolve the SEC&rsquo;s charges.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, Zymergen claimed that it had a $1 billion electronics display market opportunity for Hyaline, but the estimate was based on flawed and unreasonable assumptions that included product markets that were poor fits for Hyaline&rsquo;s technical characteristics and unsupported premium pricing. The SEC&rsquo;s order also finds that Zymergen provided misleading revenue forecasts to research analysts that far exceeded internal estimates. Additionally, the order finds that Zymergen misled investors during its first public earnings call by misrepresenting the status of Hyaline&rsquo;s customer pipeline while omitting significant technical and commercial problems facing the product.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pre-revenue and early-stage companies that seek to tap the capital markets must do so with reasonable estimates of their market potential,&rdquo; said Monique C. Winkler, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s San Francisco Regional Office. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s order finds that Zymergen failed to satisfy this obligation when it misled investors with what amounted to unsupported hype.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that Zymergen violated certain antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, and subject to bankruptcy court approval, Zymergen agreed to a cease-and-desist order and to pay the civil penalty referenced above.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Anthony Moreno and Eli Greenstein of the San Francisco Regional Office, with assistance from David Baddley and Brent Smyth, and was supervised by Rahul Kolhatkar, Alistaire Bambach, and Jason H. Lee.</p>

<div> ETF, CSI A500, index-based investment, high-quality development, SSE
Summary:
The symposium discussed the CSI A500 ETF's approval and its potential to serve the market, emphasizing index-based investment and long-term commitment.<br /><br /> <div>
<p>On September 12, the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) held a symposium on CSI A500 ETF, where it conducted in-depth exchanges with nearly 80 heads of more than 40 institutions such as fund companies, securities traders, insurance companies, wealth management of banks, etc. Taking the issuance of CSI A500 ETF as an opportunity, the symposium aimed to study and implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Central Financial Work Conference, promote all parties in the market to reach a consensus and form a joint force, jointly build and improve the index-based investment ecosystem, and boost the high-quality development of the capital market.</p>
<p>Recently, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has approved the CSI A500 Index and ETF products. The market value coverage of the CSI A500 Index reaches 56%, with balanced industry distribution covering leading companies in emerging industries. It can timely reflect the transformation of industrial structure and greatly improve the representativeness of new quality productive forces. It has integrated ESG screening, connectivity, and other elements, depicting the structural changes of the capital market from a new perspective and serving the diversified investing needs of various investors. Besides, this product is expected to become an important carrier and good tool for medium and long term capital to enter the market. Participants agreed that as China's economy has entered a stage of high-quality development, the proportion of emerging industries in the real economy and capital market is increasing. In this context, CSI A500 ETF is conducive to better serving residents' wealth management needs and facilitating the investment-side reform of the capital market.</p>
<p>As pointed out by the&nbsp;<span>State Council's Guideline on Strengthening Supervision, Forestalling Risks and Promoting High-Quality Development of the Capital Market</span>, we should vigorously develop equity public funds and promote the development of index-based investment. Convening this symposium is a specific task for the SSE to implement the State Council's Guideline and also a practical action to prioritize the development of technology finance, green finance, inclusive finance, pension finance, and digital finance, thus facilitating the growth of real economy and new quality productive forces. Given the global experience, broad-based index products can be called pillars in the capital market infrastructure construction with their widest characterization range and the most market influence. At present, index-based investment in China is in a new period of opportunity, and the ETF market has broad prospects for development.</p>
<p>Participants agreed that all parties were greatly encouraged and excited to hold this symposium at the key point of CSI A500 ETF issuance. Fund managers and securities companies expressed that they would make great effort to accomplish the initial launch and follow-up operation of the products, better serve the investors, attach importance to investors' returns, and fully stimulate market vitality. Institutional investors generally expressed their firm confidence, maintained resolution and expectation to lasting achievement, adhering to long-term commitment and staying professional, thus taking the lead as patient capital and medium and long term capital.</p>
<p>The relevant person in charge in the SSE said that the ETF industry as a whole is undergoing positive changes, and the concept of index-based investment has further gained popularity. The SSE would make concerted efforts with all parties in the market to build the CSI A500 ETF into a new highlight in the profile of China's ETF market. Meanwhile, the SSE would attach importance to and better serve the investors as usual. It will also respond to issues with all parties concerned in the market, integrate resources, help each other, jointly expand the incremental market and optimize the existing market, build and improve the index-based investment ecosystem, cultivate and establish rational, value, and long-term investment concepts, promote high-quality development of ETF market, and better serve the target of building China into a financial power.</p>

<p>This additional offering will provide the company's global client base with access to pricing and currency markets in Asia and LATAM.</p>
<p>This significant addition means that ATFX Connect, the institutional arm of AT Global Markets (UK) Limited, can provide its global customer base with enhanced liquidity and transparency across a wider range of products. This reflects increasing demand from its clients for electronic trading capabilities in NDFs, and the ability to automate and offer streaming prices, thus allowing clients to participate more effectively in this space.</p>
<p>Wei Qiang Zhang, the Managing Director of ATFX Connect, shared his excitement about the new addition: "This is a testament to the firm's unwavering commitment to our global client base.

Our focus on automation and real-time streaming prices means greater liquidity and transparency and reflects our dedication to innovation and excellence in serving our institutional clients."</p>
<p>The electronification of NDFs has become key in the institutional market as demand from the Buy side has transitioned away from voice execution, and market participants now seek a more automated approach, allowing for greater liquidity and transparency when trading. This launch shows ATFX Connect's commitment to offer clients more dynamic and systematic solutions and reflects its strong partnerships with the LPs, who continue to support ATFX globally.</p>

<title>Building Bridges: The Case For Better Data And Coordination For The Non-Bank Sector - Speech By John Schindler, Secretary General Of The Financial Stability Board, At The Eurofi Financial Forum 2024 In Budapest</title>

<div> financial stability, non-bank sector, data, regulation, vulnerabilities
<br />
The speaker emphasizes the increasing importance of the non-bank sector, the need for a more targeted approach to regulation, and the necessity for more and better data. 
<br /><br />Summary: 
The non-bank sector is crucial for financial stability and needs targeted regulation. Better data collection is necessary for effective oversight. <div>
<p>Thank you for having me here today. This is my first visit to Eurofi and my first trip to Budapest. I want to speak to you today about a topic of increasing importance to financial authorities on both sides of the Atlantic, and indeed around the world: Non-Bank Financial Intermediation (or NBFI or what I will call the non-bank sector).</p>
<p>The 2008 global financial crisis exposed severe vulnerabilities in the global financial system, and it prompted an awareness that we needed to be more vigilant to financial stability considerations.</p>
<p>The global financial regulatory community embarked on an ambitious reform agenda, scrutinising the entire financial system &mdash; banks and non-banks alike &mdash; to build resilience. In the banking sector, Basel III was developed to enhance capital requirements and liquidity management and to reduce leverage. A parallel focus was placed on what was then commonly referred to as &lsquo;shadow banking&rsquo;, but that focus matured into a holistic approach to what we now refer to as non-bank financial intermediation.</p>
<p>Fifteen years later, we face a different financial system. The system has evolved because of our regulatory interventions, innovation, and shifts in global economic and financial conditions. One of the most notable changes has been the increasing importance of the non-bank sector.</p>
<p>Today, I want to make three points as I focus on this critical part of our financial system:</p>
<p>First, the non-bank sector is increasingly critical to the global financial system, and that criticality has been highlighted by the role the sector has played in recent periods of market turmoil.</p>
<p>Second, calling it the non-bank sector may have been appropriate for a while, but the time has come to stop referring to it as if it is monolithic.</p>
<p>And finally, we need more and better data from this critical area.</p>
<h3>The non-bank sector is increasingly critical to the global financial system</h3>
<p>The non-bank sector has grown in size, complexity, and importance since the GFC, with global assets reaching approximately $220 trillion in 2022. But the core issue, which can&rsquo;t be encapsulated in any single number, is where risk is building up within the financial system. Over the last decade, again and again, we see parts of the non-bank sector playing a central role in amplifying shocks across the financial system during periods of stress.</p>
<p>The changing role of the non-bank sector has been driven by several factors.</p>
<p>First, regulatory shifts. Stricter regulations on banks have led to the migration of certain activities to the non-bank sector. For example, non-bank lenders and other entities now play a more prominent role in credit intermediation and in critical activities such as the provision of market liquidity.</p>
<p>Second, the search for yield. The prolonged low-interest-rate environment that followed the Global Financial Crisis drove investors to seek higher returns in alternative asset classes, to seek larger maturity and liquidity mismatches, and to use more leverage.</p>
<p>Finally, technological innovation. The rise of fintech and online lending platforms has introduced new forms of financial intermediation, often operating outside the traditional regulatory framework.</p>
<p>While this has brought benefits, including increased access to credit, it has also introduced new kinds of risk. In recent years, we have witnessed several episodes of market turmoil in which the non-bank sector played a significant role.</p>
<p>The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic was a sharp and sudden shock to global financial markets. Investment funds and money market funds, faced significant liquidity pressures, as investors sought to redeem their holdings amid the heightened uncertainty.<a class="footnote-ref" href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/09/building-bridges-the-case-for-better-data-and-coordination-for-the-non-bank-sector/#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">1</a></p>
<p>In the commodity market turmoil following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, commodity prices and volatility spiked. Non-bank entities, especially commodity trading firms and some investment funds, experienced substantial stress. Weak liquidity management practices and interconnectedness led to contagion.<a class="footnote-ref" href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/09/building-bridges-the-case-for-better-data-and-coordination-for-the-non-bank-sector/#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">2</a></p>
<p>Those two examples followed external, nonfinancial shocks. The implosion of FTX and the collapse of Archegos did not. Those two events were stark reminders of the risks associated with leverage and concentrated exposures within the non-bank sector. Archegos, in particular, led to significant losses for investors and counterparties, and raised concerns about the adequacy of risk management practices among prime brokers.</p>
<p>Finally, there was the turmoil in the UK gilt market. A sharp rise in gilt yields led to severe liquidity challenges because of the investment strategies of some pension funds. The liquidity issues led to contagion that necessitated central bank intervention.</p>
<p>These examples highlight the importance and the interconnectedness of the non-bank sector and the existence of vulnerabilities in the sector that can spread to the broader financial system.</p>
<p>Historically, the regulation of the non-bank sector has focused more on investor protection or market integrity or other similar mandates. However, these mandates do not fully capture the systemic nature of risks that the sector can pose to the global financial system. The negative externalities that can arise from non-bank activities during times of stress suggest that a financial stability perspective is necessary. This perspective requires us to consider not just the risks to individual investors or markets, but also the potential for systemic risks &ndash; risks that can have far-reaching implications for the global financial system and the global economy.</p>
<p>The FSB has argued that we must adopt a financial stability perspective when regulating and supervising the non-bank sector. This is not a case of treating this sector differently or failing to acknowledge how important this sector is. Just the opposite. It is precisely because of how important this sector is to the functioning of the global financial system that we should bring and enhance the financial stability perspective to the regulation and supervision of this sector.</p>
<p>This also doesn&rsquo;t mean treating non-bank institutions and activities the same way as banks. The two sectors have different business models and risk profiles. Indeed, there are many business models in the non-bank sector.</p>
<p>Bringing a financial stability perspective to the non-bank sector means acknowledging the centrality of the non-bank sector to the proper functioning of the global financial system and the way the non-bank sector can amplify shocks to the financial system. Therefore, regulatory frameworks should be in place to mitigate the risks that non-bank institutions or activities can pose to financial stability.</p>
<p>For example, following the turmoil that surrounded the onset of the COVID pandemic, the FSB emphasised the need to enhance the resilience of non-banks to market stress by addressing mismatches in liquidity that can amplify crises. That has underpinned our work on money market funds and open-ended funds in recent years. Currently, the FSB is considering actions that might be useful to mitigate the risks of leverage in the non-bank sector and recommendations to ensure market participants are better prepared for margin and collateral calls.<a class="footnote-ref" href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/09/building-bridges-the-case-for-better-data-and-coordination-for-the-non-bank-sector/#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3">3</a></p>
<h3>Dissecting the non-bank financial sector into its constituent parts</h3>
<p>Turning to my second point on referring to this critical sector as the non-bank sector. For many years, NBFI has been referred to as if it were a monolithic entity. That approach was useful for a time as we tried to identify the broad contours of this vastly diverse set of institutions and activities. However, this approach is no longer sufficient. We have reached a point where broad studies of the non-bank sector are not as useful. We need to drill down into the gallimaufry of non-bank entities and activities.</p>
<p>The FSB has already started to do this, as I alluded to in some of my earlier examples. We have been looking at specific entities and activities where vulnerabilities are more pronounced and where these can create financial stability risks. We seek to understand the unique challenges associated with each and consider the possible interactions among these entities and activities, especially during stress. In our ongoing work on NBFI leverage, we first delved into non-bank leverage broadly, and then we started doing more in-depth work in specific areas where risks to financial stability may be more prominent. Going forward, this more targeted approach would suggest focusing on markets or entities that are known to be potential amplifiers of shocks.</p>
<p>By dissecting the non-bank financial sector into its constituent parts and looking at the behavior of those parts during stress, we can better identify potential threats to financial stability and develop policies that are appropriately calibrated to the specific risks involved.</p>
<h3>We need more - and better - data on NBFI</h3>
<p>This brings me to my final point: We need more and better data, particularly on those parts of the non-bank sector which are least regulated.</p>
<p>Over the past fifteen years, we have become much better at assessing vulnerabilities to the financial system as a whole and to the banking sector in particular. Our assessments have become more systematic &ndash; looking at things like the valuation of assets, use of leverage, maturity and liquidity mismatches, interconnectedness, and complexity. Making such assessments requires enormous amounts of data. In many cases, such data are publicly reported, or measures of vulnerabilities can be calculated from publicly reported data sources. In other cases, such assessments lean on supervisory data. Our ability to assess vulnerabilities and to develop policies to mitigate those vulnerabilities is only as good as the data we have.</p>
<p>There is a reason why the non-bank sector was formerly called &ldquo;shadow banking&rdquo;. The sector has traditionally been characterised by a lack of transparency, meaning there are data gaps that hinder its effective oversight. Those gaps mean that often we can&rsquo;t identify vulnerabilities until periods of market stress reveal them, sometimes with painful consequences.</p>
<p>The FSB has had some success in improving the availability and quality of data for this sector. The FSB's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/12/global-monitoring-report-on-non-bank-financial-intermediation-2023/">Global Monitoring Report on NBFI</a>&nbsp;provides insights into the size, composition, and main trends and risks in the sector. However, challenges remain related to data availability, quality, and use.</p>
<p>On availability, in some jurisdictions there are no legal requirements for some non-bank financial entities to report data that are critical for financial stability assessments. This creates gaps in our understanding of the sector's activities and exposures.</p>
<p>On quality, even when data are available, they may not be fit for the purpose of assessing financial stability risks. For example, data collected for investor protection or market conduct purposes may not capture the systemic risks associated with leverage, liquidity mismatches, or interconnectedness.</p>
<p>Finally, in some cases, data are collected but not used effectively or are not shared with those who need them for financial stability purposes. This can be due to legal or operational barriers that prevent data-sharing among regulators, both domestically and internationally.</p>
<p>The quality and timeliness of non-bank data is essential to the identification and assessment of vulnerabilities and to the design and calibration of effective policies. We must address these data challenges, because we cannot rely on periods of market stress to reveal vulnerabilities in the sector</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The financial system is constantly evolving, and so too must our approach to safeguarding it. This requires a concerted effort to improve data collection, reporting, and sharing practices across the sector. It also requires greater cooperation and coordination among national and international regulators and with the non-bank sector.</p>
<p>Just as the Chain Bridge here in Budapest connects Buda and Pest, we have to bridge the gaps in data and cooperation that exist between the regulatory community and non-bank practitioners. By working together &ndash; across sectors, jurisdictions, and borders &ndash; we can ensure that the non-bank sector remains a source of strength, rather than vulnerability, for the global financial system.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

Summary:<br />ICE’s €STR futures hit 500,000 contracts open interest. Interest rate complex up 14% y/y. Euribor ADV up 50%. Margin offsets up to 90%. SONIA futures record open interest. <div>
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider technology and data, today announced that ICE&rsquo;s &euro;uro Short Term Rate (&euro;STR) futures hit open interest of over 500,000 contracts on September 11, 2024.</p>
<p>ICE&rsquo;s &euro;STR futures and options clear alongside 16.2 million lots of open interest in Euribor, the benchmark for managing short term euro-related interest rate risk. Open interest across ICE&rsquo;s interest rate complex is up 14% year-over-year (y/y) at over 25 million contracts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile average daily volume (ADV) across the interest rate portfolio was up 55% y/y, as at the end of August 2024, including Euribor ADV up 50%, SONIA ADV up 56% and Gilts ADV up 48%.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The health of our &euro;STR market is being driven by end user demand that is benefiting from deeper liquidity available at ICE,&rdquo; said Caterina Caramaschi, Vice President, Financial Derivatives at ICE. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d like to thank all of our market participants for their continued support in developing our &euro;STR futures and we are pleased to see the first &euro;STR option trade&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the only exchange globally to offer liquid multi-currency short-term interest rate products, we are committed to building ICE&rsquo;s franchise to provide even more tools for managing interest rate risk as the market continues to develop,&rdquo; continued Caramaschi.</p>
<p>By trading and clearing &euro;STR at ICE, customers can benefit from margin offsets as high as 90% against Euribor. Euribor is the key euro-dominated interest rate benchmark, based on the average interest rate at which Eurozone banks offer unsecured short-term lending to one another while &euro;STR reflects the wholesale euro unsecured overnight borrowing costs of banks located in the euro area.</p>
<p>Customers are utilizing the inter-contract spread ICE offers for trading the difference between Euribor and &euro;STR, designed so market participants have the flexibility and liquidity to transition in and out of the contract as they do in over-the-counter markets.</p>
<p>ICE is home to a multi-currency interest rate derivatives offering including Euribor, SONIA the U.K. benchmark, SARON the Swiss benchmark and Gilts the benchmark for the U.K. government bond yield curve. On September 11, 2024, SONIA futures hit record open interest of 2.4 million contracts.</p>

<div> Updated, Default rate, Nominal wage inflation, Transitional arrangements, Superannuation forecasts
<br /><br />Summary: ASIC has updated the default rate of nominal wage inflation to 3.7% p.a. Providers have until 31 December 2024 to update superannuation calculators and retirement estimates. <div>
<h2>Key points:</h2>
<ul>
<li>ASIC has updated the default rate of nominal wage inflation in&nbsp;<em>ASIC (Superannuation Calculators and Retirement Estimates) Instrument 2022/603</em>&nbsp;from 4% p.a. to 3.7% p.a. following a period of industry consultation.</li>
<li>Transitional arrangements are in place until 31 December 2024 to allow providers of superannuation calculators and retirement estimates time to update the default rate of nominal wage inflation.</li>
</ul>
<p>ASIC has updated the default rate of nominal wage inflation (default rate) in&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2022L00895/latest/text">ASIC (Superannuation Calculators and Retirement Estimates) Instrument 2022/603</a></em>&nbsp;(ASIC Instrument 2022/603), and Regulatory Guide 276&nbsp;<em>Superannuation forecasts: Calculators and retirement estimates</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/regulatory-guides/rg-276-superannuation-forecasts-calculators-and-retirement-estimates/" title="RG 276 Superannuation forecasts: Calculators and retirement estimates">RG 276</a>).</p>
<p>The default rate has been adjusted from 4% p.a. to 3.7% p.a. to align with the revised long-term wage growth forecast in the&nbsp;<a href="https://treasury.gov.au/publication/2023-intergenerational-report">2023 Intergenerational Report</a>&nbsp;(IGR).</p>
<p>Providers of superannuation calculators and retirement estimates relying on ASIC Instrument 2022/603 will need to update their economic assumptions to reflect this adjustment. Under transitional arrangements, these providers have until 31 December 2024 to update the default inflation rate.</p>
<p>From 1 January 2025, the revised rate of 3.7% p.a. will apply.</p>
<p>We sought feedback from industry on the default rate of nominal wage inflation and the transitional arrangements under ASIC&rsquo;s consultation&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/consultations/cs-7-proposed-update-to-superannuation-forecasts-relief-instrument/" title="CS 7 Proposed update to superannuation forecasts relief instrument">CS 7&nbsp;<em>Proposed update to superannuation forecasts relief instrument</em></a>, which closed on 2 August 2024.</p>
<p>All the submissions supported changing the default inflation rate to 3.7% p.a. While one submission recommended extending the transition period beyond 31 December 2024, based on our review of other submissions, we consider the proposed transitional arrangements provide adequate time for providers of superannuation calculators and retirement estimates to implement the change to the default rate of nominal wage inflation.</p>
<p>Some submissions recommended further changes to the relief settings, which were out of scope for our current review of the default inflation rate. ASIC will consider these changes as part of a broader review of the relief settings in ASIC Instrument 2022/603, ahead of its scheduled repeal on 1 July 2027.</p>
<p>We also consulted with Treasury and the Australian Government Actuary on the default rate of nominal wage inflation.</p>
<h2><strong>Background</strong></h2>
<p>ASIC Instrument 2022/603 exempts providers of superannuation calculators and retirement estimates (collectively referred to as &lsquo;superannuation forecasts&rsquo;) from certain regulatory requirements related to providing financial product advice if they provide their superannuation forecasts within the terms of the instrument.</p>
<p>When providing superannuation forecasts under ASIC Instrument 2022/603, providers must express superannuation forecasts in present values using the prescribed default inflation rates for nominal wage inflation and consumer price inflation, unless a user has inputted an alternate rate.</p>
<p>The default inflation rates reflect nominal wage inflation while a user is in the accumulation phase, and consumer price inflation while a user is in the retirement phase.</p>
<p>ASIC aligns the default inflation rates with the Government&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://treasury.gov.au/publication/2023-intergenerational-report">2023 IGR</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="https://treasury.gov.au/publication/p2020-100554">Retirement Income Review</a>, and the current midpoint of the Reserve Bank of Australia&rsquo;s target range for consumer price inflation. The long-term forecast of nominal wage inflation was revised downward to 3.7% p.a. in the&nbsp;<a href="https://treasury.gov.au/publication/2023-intergenerational-report">2023 IGR</a>, from 4% p.a. in the&nbsp;<a href="https://treasury.gov.au/publication/2021-intergenerational-report">2021 IGR</a>.</p>
<p>In RG 276, ASIC notes we will review the default inflation rates and amend ASIC Instrument 2022/603 if we consider there has been a material change to economic conditions for long-term inflation assumptions. We considered that the reduction of the long-term forecast of nominal wage inflation in the&nbsp;<a href="https://treasury.gov.au/publication/2023-intergenerational-report">2023 IGR</a>&nbsp;evidenced a material change to economic conditions.</p>
<p>The transitional arrangements recognise that providers delivering superannuation forecasts to consumers in the 2024 calendar year may need time to make updates.</p>
<p>ASIC offers consumers a range of resources relating to superannuation and retirement through the&nbsp;<a href="https://moneysmart.gov.au/">Moneysmart website</a>. ASIC aligns the assumptions in the Moneysmart superannuation and retirement calculators, so they are consistent with the current settings of ASIC&rsquo;s relief.</p>

<title>US Department Of Justice: Early Bitcoin Investor Pleads Guilty To Filing Tax Return That Falsely Reported His Cryptocurrency Gains</title>

<div> Guilty plea, Bitcoin, Tax evasion, IRS, Sentencing<br />
Summary: 
An Austin man pleaded guilty to underreporting $3.7 million in bitcoin sales, causing a $550,000 tax loss to the IRS. Sentencing pending. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>An Austin, Texas, man pleaded guilty today to filing a tax return that falsely underreported the capital gains he earned from selling $3.7 million in bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to court documents and statements made in court, between 2017 and 2019, Frank Richard Ahlgren III filed false tax returns that underreported or did not report the sale of $4 million worth of bitcoin in which he had substantial gains. All taxpayers are required to report any sale proceeds and gains or losses from the sale of cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin, on their IRS tax return.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ahlgren was an early investor in bitcoins. In 2015, Ahlgren purchased approximately 1,366 bitcoins. That year, bitcoins were valued at no more than $500 each. In October 2017, Ahlgren sold approximately 640 bitcoins for approximately $5,807.53 per bitcoin for a total of $3.7 million. Ahlgren had purchased most of the bitcoins he sold in 2017 in 2015. He used the entirety of the proceeds from the sale of bitcoins to purchase a house in Park City, Utah. Ahlgren then filed a false tax return with the IRS for 2017 that substantially inflated the cost basis of the bitcoins, and therefore underreported his capital gain from his bitcoin sale.</p>
<p>In addition, in 2018 and 2019, Ahlgren sold more than $650,000 worth of bitcoins and did not report those sales on either years&rsquo; tax returns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In total, Ahlgren caused a tax loss to the IRS of more than $550,000.</p>
<p>Ahlgren will be sentenced at a later date. He faces a maximum penalty of three years in prison as well as a period of supervised release, restitution and monetary penalties. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p>
<p>Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stuart M. Goldberg of the Justice Department&rsquo;s Tax Division and U.S. Attorney Jaime Esparza for the Western District of Texas made the announcement.</p>
<p>IRS Criminal Investigation and the Texas Office of Attorney General are investigating the case.</p>
<p>Assistant Chief Michael C. Boteler and Trial Attorney Mary Frances Richardson of the Justice Department&rsquo;s Tax Division and Assistant U.S. Attorney William R. Harris for the Western District of Texas are prosecuting the case.</p>
<p><i>An indictment is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</i></p>

<title>Dissenting Statement Of CFTC Commissioner Summer K. Mersinger Regarding Amendments To Part 40 Of The CFTC’s Regulations</title>

<div> self-certification process, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, regulations, innovation, market trust
Summary:<br /> Amendments to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's regulations formalize erosion of the self-certification process, stifling innovation and market trust. <div>
<p><span><span><span><span>I respectfully dissent from the adoption of the final rule amending Part 40 of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission&rsquo;s</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement091224b?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;regulations because I fear these amendments formalize a steady erosion of the Commission&rsquo;s self-certification process.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The self-certification process is a fundamental pillar of our agency&rsquo;s principles-based regulatory framework, enabling designated contract markets (&ldquo;DCMs&rdquo;) and swap execution facilities (&ldquo;SEFs&rdquo;) to bring new products to their markets quickly, a critical factor when innovating in our markets.&nbsp; Self-certification requires the DCM or SEF to certify that the product complies with the Commodity Exchange Act (&ldquo;CEA&rdquo;) and CFTC regulations, and the SEF or DCM listing the product remains subject to its obligations under the CEA and CFTC regulations.&nbsp; Bringing a product to the market through self-certification does not mean that the product lacks appropriate safeguards and protections.&nbsp; Rather, a self-certified product must be fully<i>&nbsp;</i>compliant with the CEA and CFTC regulations&mdash;just like a product formally approved by the Commission.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The amendments to Part 40 set forth a new &ldquo;complete&rdquo; standard for information required to be provided to the Commission as part of the self-certification and approval processes.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement091224b?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;I am concerned that the Commission will use this sufficiently vague and amorphous standard to subject new products to unreasonable stays and requests for additional information.&nbsp; A core tenet of the CFTC&rsquo;s mission in the CEA is to &ldquo;promote responsible innovation,&rdquo;</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement091224b?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;not stifle it with the wet blanket of requests for additional information.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>One of the main reasons behind the Commission&rsquo;s principles-based framework is to provide the agency with flexibility to evolve with our markets.&nbsp; Yet all flexibility is lost when prescriptive regulations are issued to outline existing expectations.&nbsp; Here, the preamble of the final rule repeatedly states that the changes being adopted are not intended to expand or otherwise alter the scope of the explanation or analysis required under the current regulation.&nbsp; But I question why we would go through the exercise of amending a regulation if the revisions do not change any existing expectation under the current version of the regulation.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The Commission&rsquo;s self-certification process has served to demonstrate our trust in our markets and their commitment to the highest standards, allowing the markets to be responsible for their compliance with the CEA and the Commission&rsquo;s implementing regulations while also offering innovation in the markets.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the amendments to Part 40 being finalized today suggest an erosion of that trust, and for that reason I must dissent.</span></span></span></span></p>

<title>SEC Charges Three Former Executives Of Pharmacy Startup Medly Health Inc. With Defrauding Investors - Now-Defunct Digital Pharmacy Raised Over $170 Million Based On Fake Prescriptions And Fraudulently Inflated Revenue</title>

<div> charged, digital pharmacy, fraud, investors, capital raising<br />
<br />
The SEC charged Medly Health's former executives with fraudulently inflating revenue by entering fake prescriptions and misleading investors. Ongoing investigation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged now-defunct digital pharmacy startup Medly Health Inc&rsquo;s. co-founder and former CEO, Marg Patel, former CFO, Robert Horowitz, and former Head of Rx Operations, Chintankumar Bhatt, with defrauding investors in connection with capital raising efforts that netted the company over $170 million.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, from at least February 2021 through August 2022, Patel and Horowitz provided financial information to existing and prospective investors that fraudulently overstated Medly&rsquo;s revenue due in part to millions of dollars&rsquo; worth of fake prescriptions entered into the company&rsquo;s systems by Bhatt. The SEC&rsquo;s complaint alleges, among other things, that Patel and Horowitz knew of, but failed to correct, significant accounting irregularities and were aware of several reports and complaints by employees that the revenue reported in Medly&rsquo;s financial statements to investors was inaccurate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The alleged facts of this case demonstrate significant corporate malfeasance,&rdquo; said Sheldon L. Pollock, Associate Director of Enforcement in the New York Regional Office. &ldquo;We allege the defendants harmed investors by misleading them about the company&rsquo;s revenues, with one defendant going as far as making up fake prescription orders to increase revenue numbers. Startups that seek to raise capital from investors through deceitful conduct remain a continued focus for the Commission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, charges Patel, Horowitz, and Bhatt with violating the antifraud provisions of the securities laws and charges Bhatt with aiding and abetting Patel&rsquo;s and Horowitz&rsquo;s primary securities law violations. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil money penalties, disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and officer-and-director bars against all three defendants.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation is ongoing and is being conducted by Suzanne M. Bettis, Heather Marshall Molavi, Lisa Knoop, and Christopher M. Colorado of the New York Regional Office. It is being supervised by Judith Weinstock, Mr. Pollock, and Antonia Apps. The litigation will be led by Mr. Colorado, Ms. Bettis, and Ms. Marshall Molavi, under the supervision of Alex Vasilescu.</p>

<div> Regulation 4.7, CFTC, market participants, disclosure proposals, wealth gap
Summary:<br /><br />Commissioner Pham applauds the extra time taken to consider market protection, public feedback, wealth gap impact, and financial inclusion in amending Regulation 4.7. <div>
<div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item">
<p><span><span>Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Commissioner Caroline D. Pham issued the following statement on the final rule to amend Regulation 4.7:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&ldquo;I'm pleased that the Commission is taking additional time to understand how to best protect market participants and to consider the various disclosure proposals submitted by the public in connection with Regulation 4.7.&nbsp; As a market regulator with material impact on the risk management of the savings of millions of Americans, it is imperative that the Commission takes its time when considering new requirements to ensure that we get it right.&nbsp; This is especially the case when the unintended consequences of our rules could create new obstacles to market participation that draw a distinction between the &ldquo;have-a-lot&rsquo;s&rdquo; and the &ldquo;have-not-enough&rsquo;s&rdquo;.&nbsp; Ultimately, using regulation to pick winners and losers that increases the wealth gap not only betrays the American public&rsquo;s expectation of Washington to create and maintain fair markets, but it also undermines financial inclusion. &nbsp;The government must keep the people&rsquo;s trust that we will help every American achieve economic mobility for them and their families&mdash;not construct artificial barriers to the American Dream.&nbsp; For those reasons, I applaud the Commission taking the time for careful consideration of the public comments and further study including data. I thank the Chairman and the Market Participants Division for working with me on this important rulemaking.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<div> charges, SEC, unregistered broker activity, pre-IPO investments, settlement
<br />
Three sales agents settled SEC charges for unregistered broker activity and fraud in selling pre-IPO investments, soliciting $17 million from 75 investors.
<br /><br />Summary: The SEC settled charges against three sales agents for unregistered broker activity and fraud in selling pre-IPO investments. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against three sales agents from StraightPath Venture Partners&mdash;Anthony Guarino, Robert Seropian, and Frank Vecchio&mdash;for unregistered broker activity, including selling membership interests in LLCs that purported to invest in shares of pre-IPO companies. Vecchio also settled the SEC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023-61">previously announced</a>&nbsp;fraud charges against him.</p>
<p>According to the SEC's orders against Guarino and Seropian and the previously filed complaint against Vecchio, each of them allegedly provided investors with marketing materials, advised investors on the supposed merits of the investments, and received transaction-based compensation, all hallmarks of a broker, despite not being registered as brokers. The SEC&rsquo;s orders against Guarino and Seropian found, and the SEC&rsquo;s complaint against Vecchio alleged, that they collectively solicited upwards of $17 million in funds from at least 75 investors and obtained approximately $2.1 million in transaction-based compensation among them.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order against Guarino also finds that he actively solicited investments for interests in funds managed by Legend Venture Partners, another investment adviser that purported to invest in shares of pre-IPO companies and that was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-25758">previously charged</a>&nbsp;by the Commission with fraud and other violations. The SEC&rsquo;s complaint against Vecchio also alleged that he made false or misleading statements to investors he solicited on behalf of StraightPath Venture Partners regarding the fees he and the manager of the funds received.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s resolutions demonstrate our continued efforts to hold accountable unregistered brokers, including those who facilitate the sale of pre-IPO investments to retail investors,&rdquo; said Sheldon L. Pollock, Associate Regional Director in the New York Regional Office. &ldquo;The Division of Enforcement continues to scrutinize the registration status of individuals selling pre-IPO shares to retail investors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s orders find that Guarino and Seropian violated the broker-dealer registration provision of the federal securities laws. Without admitting or denying the findings, Guarino and Seropian agreed to cease and desist from future violations and to industry and penny stock bars. Guarino agreed to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $431,287 and a civil penalty of $100,000. Seropian agreed to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $1,392,367 and a civil penalty of $300,000. Without admitting or denying the findings, Vecchio agreed to a permanent injunction from future violations of the antifraud and broker-dealer registration provisions of the federal securities laws and to industry and penny stock bars. Vecchio also agreed to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $544,250 and a civil penalty of $90,000.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s ongoing investigation is being conducted by Michael S. DiBattista, Megan R. Genet, Tian Wen, Douglas J. Smith, and Steven G. Rawlings, with supervision by Mr. Pollock, of the New York Regional Office. The SEC&rsquo;s ongoing litigation is being conducted by Sushila P. Rao and Mr. DiBattista and is being supervised by Daniel Loss and Mr. Pollock of the New York Regional Office.</p>

<title>Supporting Statement Of CFTC Commissioner Summer K. Mersinger Regarding The Final Amendments To Regulation 4.7</title>

<div> balance, amendment, regulation, overregulation, market participants
Summary:
Commission achieved balance in adopting amendments to Regulation 4.7, addressing overregulation concerns. Cautioned against future expansions and emphasized the need for balance and compromise in regulations. <div>
<div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item">
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Today, the Commission</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement091224?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;achieved balance in adopting the amendments to Regulation 4.7 and for that reason I can support this final rule.&nbsp; I would like to thank the staff in the Market Participants Division for their hard work on this rulemaking effort and for their consideration of my suggestions and comments throughout this process.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>But the balance achieved in this final rule was sorely missing in the original amendment proposal, as well as in recent drafts of this final rule presented to the Commission.&nbsp; As I identified in my prior dissent, the proposed amendment to Regulation 4.7 was flawed in applying a new minimum disclosure regime on sophisticated investors who had always been exempt from such disclosures.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement091224?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>This flawed proposal led to a unanimous comment file, without a single commenter supporting the Commission&rsquo;s new minimum disclosure regime.&nbsp; The proposal was a textbook example of overregulation.&nbsp; Thankfully, the Commission avoided the temptation to overregulate under this rule, dropping the minimum disclosure regime from the final rule adopted today.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I am pleased that I can support this final rule.&nbsp; However, we should always remember that we do not regulate in a vacuum.&nbsp; We must work with market participants to carefully calibrate all rulemaking efforts.&nbsp; Additionally, we must harmonize our regulations, not only with the interests of our market participants, but with other regulators, including self-regulatory organizations.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>While I am relieved that the final rule reflects a balanced approach and aims to achieve the overarching goal without overregulation, I remain concerned about the adopting release&rsquo;s mention of possible future efforts to expand Regulation 4.7 after this amendment.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement091224?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; I urge the Commission to avoid such future expansions, unless the Commission finds concrete evidence establishing a need for modifications and only after robust discussions with industry.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Additionally, I must caution the Commission from making the same mistake on other pending rulemaking proposals where feedback from commenters reflects a similar imbalance in the Agency&rsquo;s approach.&nbsp; We must seek balance and compromise in our regulations, not only because we are legally obligated to do so, but also because it is the right thing to do.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<div> amends, CFTC Regulation 4.7, exemptions, commodity pool operators, trading programs
Summary:<br />Final rule updates CFTC Regulation 4.7, increasing monetary thresholds for QEPs, allowing monthly account statement distribution, and making technical amendments. <div>
<p><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today published a final rule that amends CFTC Regulation 4.7, a provision that provides exemptions from certain compliance requirements for commodity pool operators (CPOs) regarding commodity pool offerings to qualified eligible persons (QEPs) and for commodity trading advisors (CTAs) regarding trading programs advising QEPs.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The final rule amends various provisions of the regulation that have not been updated since the rule&rsquo;s original adoption in 1992. Specifically, the final rule:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>(1) Increases the monetary thresholds outlined in the &ldquo;Portfolio Requirement&rdquo; definition that certain persons may use to qualify as Qualified Eligible Persons;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>(2) Codifies exemptive letters allowing CPOs of Funds of Funds operated under Regulation 4.7 to choose to distribute monthly account statements within 45 days of the month-end;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>(3) Includes technical amendments designed to improve its efficiency and usefulness for intermediaries and their prospective and actual QEP pool participants and advisory clients, as well as the general public; and,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>(4) Updates citations within 17 CFR Part 4, and throughout the CFTC&rsquo;s rulebook, to reflect the new structure of Regulation 4.7.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The final rule will be effective 60 days after publication in the Federal Register.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>CPOs and CTAs must comply with the increased Portfolio Requirement thresholds in Regulation 4.7(a) by six months after publication in the Federal Register.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The optional monthly account statement reporting schedule for Funds of Funds operated under Regulation 4.7 is available to their CPOs as of the final rule&rsquo;s effective date, with compliance required upon election of that schedule by the CPO.</span></span></p>

<title>CFTC Charges Unregistered Florida Commodity Pool Operator And Its Chief Executive Officer With Futures Fraud</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-charges-unregistered-florida-commodity-pool-operator-and-its-chief-executiv/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-charges-unregistered-florida-commodity-pool-operator-and-its-chief-executiv/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced it filed a civil enforcement action in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida against&nbsp;Aureus Revenue Group LLC&nbsp;(Aureus), a Florida entity, and its owner and chief executive officer,&nbsp;Emir Jesus Matos Camargo&nbsp;(Matos) of Orlando, Florida. The complaint alleges they operated a fraudulent scheme in which they solicited at least $1.5 million from pool participants to invest in a commodity pool. They also misappropriated pool participant funds by paying Matos personal expenses and paying some pool participants using funds from other pool participants, in the manner of a Ponzi scheme.</p>
<p>In its continuing litigation against Aureus and Matos, the CFTC seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil monetary penalties, restitution, trading and registration bans, and a permanent injunction against further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations, as charged.</p>
<p>Case Background</p>
<p>As alleged in the complaint, from approximately September 2019 through November 2022, Matos fraudulently solicited customers by representing Aureus could guarantee commodity pool returns of 1.5&ndash;3.75% each month. Aureus and Matos also sent prospective pool participants a fictitious license to falsely show the CFTC licensed Aureus as an investment fund. This fictitious license contained a counterfeit CFTC seal, a forged signature of a former CFTC Commissioner, and a fictitious license number. In exchange for their contributions, they gave pool participants &ldquo;warranty checks&rdquo; &mdash; checks drawn on Aureus&rsquo; bank accounts for the full amount contributed. These warranty checks provided pool participants a false sense of security. In reality, the warranty checks were written on bank accounts with insufficient funds to honor the checks. Using these fraudulent representations, they solicited and received at least $1.5 million from at least 32 pool participants.</p>
<p>As alleged in the complaint, Aureus and Matos engaged in limited and unprofitable futures trading and instead misappropriated most of the money they received from pool participants. Some pool funds were misappropriated for Aureus&rsquo; benefit to pay certain pool participants guaranteed monthly returns using funds from other pool participants, in the manner of a Ponzi scheme, rather than from the defendants&rsquo; claimed trading profits. They used other misappropriated funds to pay for, among other things, Matos&rsquo; rent, living and travel expenses, and personal taxes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As further alleged in the complaint, Aureus failed to register with the CFTC as a commodity pool operator, and Matos failed to register with the CFTC as an associated person.</p>
<p>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this case are Elsie Robinson, Alan Simpson, Alison Auxter, Rachel Hayes, Christopher Reed, and Charles Marvine.</p>
<p>* * * * * *</p>
<p>CFTC&rsquo;s Commodity Pool Fraud Advisory</p>
<p>The CFTC has issued several customer protection&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/index.htm">Fraud Advisories and Articles</a>, including the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/fraudadv_commoditypool.html">Commodity Pool Fraud Advisory</a>, which warns customers about a type of fraud that involves individuals and firms, often unregistered, offering investments in commodity pools.</p>
<p>The CFTC strongly urges the public to verify a company&rsquo;s registration with the CFTC before committing funds. If unregistered, a customer should be wary of providing funds to that company. A company&rsquo;s registration status can be found using&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nfa.futures.org/basicnet">NFA BASIC</a>.</p>
<p>Customers and other individuals can report suspicious activities or information, such as possible violations of commodity trading laws, to the Division of Enforcement via a toll-free hotline 866-FON-CFTC (866-366-2382),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/complaint">file a tip or complaint online</a>, or contact the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whistleblower.gov/">Whistleblower Office</a>. Whistleblowers may be eligible to receive between 10 and 30 percent of the monetary sanctions collected paid from the CFTC Customer Protection Fund financed through monetary sanctions paid to the CFTC by violators of the CEA.</p>

<title>SIFMA, ICI, And DTCC Release “T+1 After Action Report” Industry Coordination Led To Successful Transition, Reducing Risk And Costs In The System</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sifma-ici-and-dtcc-release-t1-after-action-report-industry-coordination-led/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sifma-ici-and-dtcc-release-t1-after-action-report-industry-coordination-led/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), Investment Company Institute (ICI), and The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC) today released the &ldquo;<a href="https://www.sifma.org/resources/general/t1-after-action-report/"><em>T+1 After Action Report</em></a>,&rdquo; which reviews the general project timeline for the shortened settlement cycle, including its key milestones and achievements. It also discusses several of the obstacles overcome in the three-plus year transition, the groundswell of global participation with the U.S. move, and some of the initial data points and positive impacts of the shift.</p>
<p>SIFMA, ICI, and DTCC first began working on accelerating settlement from two days after trade date (T+2) to one day after trade date (T+1) in 2021, intending to reduce settlement risk across U.S. capital markets.&nbsp; The organizations collaborated on leading the industry&rsquo;s efforts to plan, coordinate and implement the successful transition to T+1, which became effective on May 28, 2024.&nbsp; Firms now can make better use of their capital and resources while promoting financial stability. Ultimately, T+1 has provided the appropriate balance between increasing efficiencies and mitigating risk for the industry.</p>
<p>The move to T+1 was successful, as demonstrated by various metrics:</p>
<p>Affirmations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nearly 95% of transactions are meeting the affirmation criteria by the 9:00 PM ET cutoff on the trade date, as set by The Depository Trust Company (DTC). This marks a notable improvement from the 73% affirmation rate recorded at the end of January 2024.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearing Fund:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a T+1 environment, the NSCC Clearing Fund decreased on average by US$3.0 Billion (23%) from the prior three-month average value of US$12.8 Billion in a T+2 environment to US$9.8 Billion. The NSCC Clearing Fund decreased on average by US$2.4 Billion (20%) from the prior month average valueof $12.2 Billion in a T+2 environment to US$9.8 Billion post T+1 implementation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fail Rates:</p>
<ul>
<li>The average CNS Fail Rate for July 2024 was 2.12%, consistent with T+2 settlement rates.</li>
<li>Similarly, the average DTC non-CNS fails rate was 3.31%. Again, consistent with T+2 settlement averages.</li>
</ul>
<p>The report highlights the workstreams undertaken to achieve T+1 including ETFs and international issues as well as the need for close coordination across the industry, with the participation of market participant firms, infrastructure providers, and industry associations in the U.S. and internationally.</p>
<p>The report covers the coordinated support and work the industry did before, during and after transition weekend, including an Industry Command Center hosted by SIFMA that was critical to the success of the go-live and was a key enabler of the smooth transition.</p>
<p>Finally, the report discusses why, despite the success of the U.S. move to T+1, moving to T+0 (or same-day settlement) is not simply the next step in the process.&nbsp; It would require a comprehensive independent review. While T+1 has brought many benefits, further accelerating to T+0 as an industry standard could introduce significant risks and complexities. Instead, the focus should remain on global market adoption of T+1.</p>

<title>eToro Reaches Settlement With SEC And Will Cease Trading Activity In Nearly All Crypto Assets - Firm Charged With Operating Unregistered Broker, Clearing Agency In Connection With Its Crypto Asset Trading Platform</title>

<div> settlement, eToro USA LLC, unregistered broker, unregistered clearing agency, crypto assets<br />
Summary:<br />
eToro USA LLC settled charges with SEC, paying $1.5 million for operating as unregistered broker and clearing agency facilitating crypto asset trading. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that eToro USA LLC has agreed to pay $1.5 million to settle charges that it operated an unregistered broker and unregistered clearing agency in connection with its trading platform that facilitated buying and selling certain crypto assets as securities. eToro has agreed to cease and desist from violating the applicable federal securities laws and will make only a limited set of crypto assets available for trading.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that, since at least 2020, eToro operated as a broker and clearing agency by providing U.S. customers the ability, through eToro&rsquo;s online trading platform, to trade crypto assets being offered and sold as securities, but eToro did not comply with the registration provisions of the federal securities laws.</p>
<p>eToro publicly announced that, going forward and subject to the provisions of the SEC&rsquo;s order in this matter, the only crypto assets that U.S. customers can trade on the company&rsquo;s platform will be Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ether. eToro publicly announced that it will provide its customers with functionality to sell all other crypto assets for only 180 days after the issuance of the SEC&rsquo;s order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By removing tokens offered as investment contracts from its platform, eToro has chosen to come into compliance and operate within our established regulatory framework. This resolution not only enhances investor protection, but also offers a pathway for other crypto intermediaries,&rdquo; said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;The $1.5 million penalty reflects eToro&rsquo;s agreement to cease violating applicable federal securities laws as it continues its U.S. operations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, eToro agreed to the entry of a cease-and-desist order, to pay a penalty of $1.5 million, and, within 187 days of the order, to liquidate any crypto assets being offered and sold as securities that eToro is unable to transfer to its customers, and return the proceeds to the respective customers.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Jon Daniels, Alison Levine, and Tiantong Wen, with assistance from Samuel Wasserman, Ben Kuruvilla, and Lisa Knoop. The case was supervised by Mark R. Sylvester and Jorge G. Tenreiro of the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit.</p>

<title>New Rules For Banks To Deliver Financial Stability And Investment - New Rules For Banks And Building Societies Announced Today Will Ensure The UK Financial System Is Resilient, Competitive And Promotes Investment In The UK Economy</title>

<div> reforms, Basel 3.1, PRA, capital, banking sector <br />
Summary: <br />
The Basel 3.1 reforms mark the end of post-2008 crisis capital reforms, providing certainty for UK banks to invest in growth. Lower capital requirements for SME lending and infrastructure projects support economic growth. The PRA's new rules also streamline mortgage lending and will come into force on 1 January 2026. Additionally, a simpler regime for smaller firms will be introduced. <br /> <div>
<p>The Basel 3.1 reforms are the final part of the internationally agreed Basel 3 framework. Today&rsquo;s proposals, announced by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), mark the end of the post-2008 crisis capital reforms and give the certainty industry will need to invest for growth. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves welcomed the reforms, saying they would deliver certainty for the banking sector to &ldquo;finance investment and growth in the UK&rdquo; ahead of a joint meeting with the Bank of England Governor to discuss them with CEOs of the UK&rsquo;s largest banks and building societies in No11 Downing Street. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves said: &nbsp;</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today marks the end of a long road after the 2008 financial crisis. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Britain&rsquo;s banks have a vital role to play in helping businesses to grow, getting infrastructure built and supporting ordinary peoples&rsquo; finances. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="last-child">These reforms will strengthen the resilience of our banking system and deliver the certainty banks need to finance investment and growth in the UK.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Economic Secretary to the Treasury Tulip Siddiq said: </strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>These new rules bring the UK in line with international standards while supporting the dynamism of the UK economy. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a balanced package that promotes the competitiveness of the UK banking system as well as economic growth.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
<p class="last-child">The PRA&rsquo;s new rules, including those already announced in December 2023, have both financial resilience and growth at their core, reflecting an increased focus on growth and competitiveness.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Banks and building societies will have to maintain sufficient capital against risks, such as loans not being repaid, to protect people and businesses from the fallout from a 2008-style financial crash.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The PRA&rsquo;s near-final rules also include a number of changes from its initial proposals that will support economic growth and competitiveness. The key changes made by the PRA will:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Lower its proposed capital requirements for lending to small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs). This will mean lending to SMEs continues to be supported, helping to deliver the government&rsquo;s ambition to make the UK the best place in the world to start and grow a business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Lower its proposed capital requirements for infrastructure projects, ensuring no increase on current requirements and supporting the UK&rsquo;s transition to net zero. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Streamline the approach banks can take to mortgage lending, by simplifying the approach to valuing residential property.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The PRA&rsquo;s new rules will come into force on 1 January 2026, providing the banking sector with the certainty it needs to prepare for the new requirements. The Treasury will repeal the legislation required for the PRA to move forward with the Basel 3.1 package. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The PRA published proposals for a simpler regime for smaller firms alongside its near-final Basel 3.1 rules. This regime will make it easier for smaller banks and building societies to lend by minimising the number of calculations they are required to make and introducing a single capital buffer.</p>

<title>New Research From SIX And Coalition Greenwich: Advanced Technologies To Revolutionize Market Data Landscape</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Cloud technology, API delivery, Artificial Intelligence, market data spending, data quality<br />
Summary: Technology is shaping market data decisions, with increased adoption of cloud and API delivery. AI/ML usage is anticipated to grow, driving market data spending. Quality and real-time data are crucial. <br /><br /> <div>
<p><span>Technology is now the main factor shaping decisions concerning market data across both the buy-side and sell-side. This is a key finding of new research published today and conducted by SIX, the global financial information provider, and Coalition Greenwich.</span></p>
<p><span><img alt="New Research: Advanced Technologies to Revolutionize Market Data Landscape" src="https://www.six-group.com/dam/images/financial-information/reference-pricing-data/market-data-study-2024-original.six-image.wide.1020.jpg" /><br /></span></p>
<p>The market data study &ndash; carried out from April to July 2024 &ndash; spans 67 respondents at asset managers, wealth managers and broker dealers in the U.S., U.K., Europe, and Asia. First&nbsp;<a href="https://www.six-group.com/en/newsroom/media-releases/2023/20230608-global-market-data-survey-greenwich.html#:~:text=Podcast-,Market%20Participants%20Prioritize%20Market%20Data%20Quality%20over%20Cost%2C%20According%20to,when%20choosing%20market%20data%20providers." target="_self">launched in 2023</a>, this is the second in a series designed to better understand the trends and challenges of consuming market data.</p>
<p>Adoption of cloud technology has increased significantly, with half of respondents now opting to receive data across both public and private cloud hosting applications, compared to a 30% adoption rate last year. The application of other advanced technologies&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;including API delivery formats &ndash; is also set to become more widespread, with 70% of institutions expecting a greater shift to APIs over the next three to five years. Looking ahead, investors anticipate using emerging technologies at surprisingly robust levels, with three quarters of respondents citing Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) as the lead factor to enhance market data delivery and consumption.</p>
<p>Compared to last year, this surge in interest can be attributed to real-time data becoming a competitive differentiator for market participants. While most respondents rely on multiple frequencies of data, including delayed, historical, and end-of-day, greater market demand for real-time information supports the adoption of more advanced technologies.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, spending on market data is projected to rise for the second year running, with growing budgets being allocated to equities, index, fixed-income, and ESG data sets. For some market participants, these increases could exceed 16%. However, study participants continue to prioritize data quality, accuracy and reliability over all other considerations when deciding on market data types, frequency and vendor, building on the trend that emerged in 2023.</p>
<p>Commenting on the findings, Roy Kirby, Head of Core Products, Financial Information, SIX said: &ldquo;New and emerging technologies are a transformative force. While the benefits are well known, market data delivery and access methods are shifting fast year on year. With a wide number and constantly evolving set of use-cases for market data, one thing is clear: access to quality, timely data is crucial. None of the benefits can be realized without a solid data foundation to build on &ndash; and this is where cloud and APIs will add greater value to market participants, and ultimately drive forward growth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;High-quality data is paramount to any type of data use, no matter how transformative it is. The use of generative AI by market data users is becoming increasingly apparent&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;especially for creating and supporting investment decision-making. This development is underscored by the shift toward higher frequencies of data and more efficient data delivery,&rdquo; added David Easthope, Senior Analyst for Coalition Greenwich Market Structure &amp; Technology and co-author of the paper.</p>

<div> SET, Thailand, anniversary, social enterprises, KBank
<br />
SET and KBank partner to provide SEs a new sales channel on K PLUS app, enhancing customer experience and supporting social causes.
<br /><br />Summary: SET and KBank collaborate to provide SEs with a new sales channel, helping them expand online presence and reach more customers. <div>
<p class="Default">The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET), commemorating its 50th anniversary, has joined forces with Kasikornbank (KBank) to provide social enterprises (SEs) with a new sales channel through K+ market on K PLUS app. This initiative aims to enhance customer experience and allow KBank&rsquo;s clients to support social causes through their purchases.</p>
<p class="Default">Seven SEs from the SET social impact network are spearheading this initiative: Living Social Enterprise, Art Story by Autistic Thai (Artstory), Turn To Art Co., Ltd. (Witshulada), De Cours Co., Ltd., Dee Mee Sook (Mai) Co., Ltd., THC (Thailand) Co., Ltd. (Yorice), and Haze Free Limited Partnership (Haze Free).&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Default"><b>SET Senior Executive Vice President Rongrak Phanapavudhikul</b> emphasized the crucial role of SEs in addressing social issues and reducing inequality in Thailand. Since 2017, SET has been working with the public and private sectors to strengthen the SE ecosystem. This effort has included providing business knowledge, developing skills, and facilitating partnerships between SEs and various organizations. However, product distribution and promotion via online platforms had been SEs&rsquo; pain points and this challenge led to the collaboration between SET and KBank. This partnership aims to help the pilot seven enterprises reach a broader customer base, increase brand awareness, and create sustainable growth opportunities. Simultaneously, the bank&rsquo;s customers can create positive social outcomes through their purchases.</p>

Summary: The Financial Policy Committee supports the descope of SDDTs from CCyB and CCoB to create the new SCB, maintaining resilience and effectiveness of UK CCyB. <br /><br /> <div>
<h2>Statement</h2>
<p>The Financial Policy Committee (FPC) welcomes today&rsquo;s publication by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) of its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation/publication/2024/september/strong-and-simple-framework-the-simplified-capital-regime-for-sddts-cp">Consultation Paper 7/24 &ndash; The Strong and Simple Framework: the simplified capital regime for Small Domestic Deposit Takers (SDDTs)</a>. The FPC supports the proposal to descope SDDTs from the Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB) and Capital Conservation Buffer (CCoB) to allow the creation of the new Single Capital Buffer (SCB) for these firms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SCB will simplify the capital regime for SDDT firms, while maintaining the overall level of resilience by keeping capital requirements and buffers for this cohort broadly similar compared to outside the SDDT regime. The FPC judges that the UK CCyB will continue to be effective in protecting the supply of credit to the UK real economy, as it continues to apply to the vast majority of lending by the banking system to UK households and firms.</p>

<h2>Speech</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Few things in the banking focused policy making universe seem to have stoked more debate in recent years than the Basel 3.1 package of reforms. This very public discussion has been a feature right across the UK, US and the EU. Thankfully, I can report that I haven&rsquo;t yet observed any adverts placed by UK finance on the Metropolitan line on my way into work each morning. Even without the aid of daily reminders, in the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) we have long been aware that for a significant package like this, it is important to get it right. Overall, the package supports the UK&rsquo;s growth and competitiveness, the resilience of the banking system, and alignment with global standards.</p>
<p>It has been a sustained effort all round to get it right. We issued our proposals for consultation in November 2022.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/september/phil-evans-speech-uk-finance-a-balanced-approach-to-finishing-basel-in-the-uk#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;From the very outset, it was an open consultation and we wanted extensive engagement with firms and other stakeholders. That was in a sincere effort to improve the package where it was needed. Where stakeholders had good evidence, we were open to taking it on board and adjusting our proposals. We had 126 consultation responses, covering 2000 pages, with 600 unique issues identified. We had 70 meetings with firms and associations.</p>
<p>Today, we have published the second and last instalment of our near-final rules. I will take you through&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk175084020"></a>the balanced approach we have taken to some of the biggest issues from our consultation paper. The first part of the near-final rules was published in December last year, covering market risk, counterparty credit risk and other areas. Today, I am covering some big pieces of credit risk and the output floor, where it is fair to say we had the greatest volume of feedback. I will also touch on the link with the Strong and Simple regime, where we have also published proposals regarding the capital regime for consultation as well today.</p>
<p>Before we get into the details, there are two things I&rsquo;d like to put squarely on the record. The first is my gratitude to my colleagues at the PRA who have worked so hard on this package for a long time to get it over the line. They have been totally committed and professional during a process that has certainly had its ups and downs. I would also like to thank all respondents for their time invested in engaging with the PRA because, in my view, the additional evidence base we have been able to draw upon has led to an improved package.</p>
<p>The second is that I should make totally clear right upfront that the adjustments we have made to get it right use UK data and are therefore applicable to the UK alone. They are not in any way a comment on what would be the right approach to implementing the package for any other jurisdiction.</p>
<h3>PRA approach</h3>
<p>For the PRA, how would I describe our overall approach to landing the near-final rules? What does &lsquo;getting it right&rsquo; mean? And why do I think it is an improvement on the consultation paper? I&rsquo;ll tackle those questions now in the context of the second package published today, but the answers are equally true of the first publication last December.</p>
<h4>An appropriate amount of capital</h4>
<p>The overall purpose of these Basel 3.1 reforms is to capture risk more accurately, so that firms can then hold a broadly appropriate amount of capital against that risk. The Annex to this speech covers that in a little bit more detail. Broadly appropriate means our aim is to avoid having too little capital for a particular activity, but not aim for more than is necessary either.</p>
<p>The consequences of significantly undercapitalising activities, relative to what the evidence suggests is needed, are a clear lesson from Silicon Valley Bank<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/september/phil-evans-speech-uk-finance-a-balanced-approach-to-finishing-basel-in-the-uk#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[2]</a></sup>. If you do this, then markets and depositors will focus on that weakness in a stress, and in the Silicon Valley case causing depositors to rapidly leave the bank. That in turn can leave the borrowing customers in a very weak position if the bank cannot continue to lend to them. Where borrowers suspect this might happen with their bank, it can sap the confidence of the borrowing businesses to invest and expand, and in turn is bad for growth. In short, customers of relatively weaker firms may be reluctant to take the risk of borrowing to fund and expand their business if their funding needs might be continuing over time. Here the past is no guide to the future; firms specialising in lending to any sector of the economy can in principle be drained of market confidence in a future stress if they are perceived to be undercapitalised.</p>
<p>But as I just indicated, we are not aiming to ask firms to hold too much capital against the risk either. That could make borrowing more expensive and less widely available, which in turn would also be bad for growth.</p>
<p>Looking to achieve the balance &ndash; between capital not being too low or too high &ndash; fits well with our various objectives, including the new secondary competitiveness and growth objective that will apply to our prudential regime going forward<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/september/phil-evans-speech-uk-finance-a-balanced-approach-to-finishing-basel-in-the-uk#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[3]</a></sup>. But we&rsquo;ve still got to operationalise what it means in practice. We&rsquo;ve done that through three lenses:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first lens is a bottom-up assessment of the activities firms undertake, one by one, seeking to ensure the assessment of the risk marries well with the level of capital we ask firms to hold against that activity.</li>
<li>The second lens is at the level of the package as a whole, by aligning with the overall global standard. We have aimed in our implementation to be aligned<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/september/phil-evans-speech-uk-finance-a-balanced-approach-to-finishing-basel-in-the-uk#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[4]</a></sup>&nbsp;with the Basel standard we had a big hand in creating.</li>
<li>The third is consideration of the impact of all parts of the package on growth and competitiveness, and the impact on competition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Implementing this approach necessarily puts a great deal of weight on the collection and assessment of evidence. Without it, maintaining the balance between having neither too little nor too much capital is difficult. That is precisely why the consultation period was extended to four months and has been especially important in executing our strenuously evidence-based approach in the near-final rules.</p>
<h4>Substantial changes in the final package</h4>
<p>The bottom line is that we have made substantial amendments to our proposals in response to consultation feedback and evidence. I will come back to the specifics of these in a moment, but the changes are particularly notable in the areas of lending to small firms and for infrastructure lending.</p>
<p>In some cases we have made changes where the evidence suggested too much conservatism in our original proposals. We have also made changes where the proposals would have been too difficult or costly to implement in practice, aiming instead for rules that work more proportionately and at lower cost to firms, whilst maintaining levels of safety and soundness. And we have also made changes based on the possible impact on growth and competitiveness.</p>
<p>I would argue that the presence of all these types of improvement is strong evidence that the FSMA framework works. The framework, designed by the Treasury and implemented by Parliament, puts rules in regulators rulebooks rather than legislation, subject to clear objectives chosen by Parliament, with a very strong emphasis on a high level of engagement with stakeholders and greatly beefed up accountability. The primary objective of promoting safety and soundness, as well as the secondary competitiveness and growth, and competition, objectives all shape the Basel 3.1 outcome. The result is that there are strong examples &ndash; for example on SME lending &ndash; where competitiveness and growth considerations have played an important role. In line though with my second lens from earlier, the overall package remains aligned with the underlying international Basel standard.</p>
<h4>Impact of the proposals</h4>
<p>In terms of the capital impact, we think there will only be a very small impact on requirements, on average, across UK firms. Once we have accounted for the offsetting effect from ensuring we don&rsquo;t double count in areas such as operational risk where we were already asking firms to hold additional capital in Pillar 2A, we think the impact will be less than 1% in aggregate on capital requirements phased in over 4 years. This is smaller than for our consultation proposals, and is clearly very small compared with the roughly 300%<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/september/phil-evans-speech-uk-finance-a-balanced-approach-to-finishing-basel-in-the-uk#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[5]</a></sup>&nbsp;increase we needed over the decade from the GFC to Covid. It is a smaller impact than in other major jurisdictions, in part because some of the risks that will now be addressed in Pillar 1 capital requirements were already captured elsewhere in the UK&rsquo;s Pillar 2 framework.</p>
<h3>What changes have we made since the consultation stage?</h3>
<p>I obviously don&rsquo;t have the time today to cover all of the issues in the package: there were 600 of them raised in the consultation feedback! You probably didn&rsquo;t sign up for a ten hour speech, and that level of detail is available in the Policy Statement. Instead, I&rsquo;ll cover some of the key themes.</p>
<h4>SME (Small and Medium Enterprises) lending</h4>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>first&nbsp;</strong>is the important topic of SME lending. We understand this matters for growth<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/september/phil-evans-speech-uk-finance-a-balanced-approach-to-finishing-basel-in-the-uk#footnote-7" id="footnote-ref-7"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[6]</a></sup>, and it has been one of the most commented upon parts of our consultation. We have made a number of significant changes.</p>
<p>The first is the introduction of a new definition of an SME, where feedback and supervisory evidence suggested that the definition we proposed was overly complex to implement. Our new simplified definition should reduce the operational burden on firms and slightly broaden the scope of exposures which qualify for the preferential treatment SME lending receives in our package.</p>
<p>We have also made changes to the proposals on secured SME lending on the standardised approach. Right from the beginning, we had a lot of questions in this area, as firms raised concerns the proposed risk weights were too high. Looking closely at the data, we have found it does support a change to policy for some secured commercial real estate (CRE) lending to SMEs. So, we have removed the risk weight floor &ndash; which we had proposed to maintain at today&rsquo;s level of 100% &ndash; for loans classified as regulatory real estate and which are not materially dependent on cashflows from the property. This will enable firms to reflect the benefit of holding real estate collateral against the secured SME loans. We have maintained the proposed 100% risk weight floor, however, where the repayment of the loan is dependent on the cash flow from the property. The PRA continues to consider CRE to be risky and for such exposures the firm is reliant on the CRE collateral for repayment of the loan<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/september/phil-evans-speech-uk-finance-a-balanced-approach-to-finishing-basel-in-the-uk#footnote-8" id="footnote-ref-8"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[7]</a></sup>.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk168080043"></a>Finally, there is the much debated issue of the SME support factor. Basel includes a new lower standardised approach risk weight for unsecured corporate SME lending. We had proposed to adopt that in our 3.1 proposals. The support factor, which was retained from our time as EU members, offers an additional risk weight reduction over and above that. Our assessment is that &ndash; purely using evidence based on an assessment of the risk of SME lending and its correlation with the business cycle &ndash; we should remove the EU-specific SME support factor under the standardised and IRB approaches. The analysis does, however, support adopting the new lower risk weight of 85% for corporate SME exposures and the other existing Basel risk weights in Pillar 1 calculations.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk168079781"></a>The net effect of that package for SME lending would be for only a small increase in capital requirements compared to today. But we do also understand, in line with the consultation feedback we received, that even though the change is small, SME lending matters for growth. So, we are making an additional change as we bring in the Basel package. Mindful of competitiveness and growth considerations we will take steps through an&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk166837124"></a>ongoing structural adjustment to Pillar 2 requirements to ensure that the removal of the support factors does not result in an increase in capital requirements for SME lending. The change will be available for all firms, including mid-tier and banks eligible for the &lsquo;Strong and Simple&rsquo; regime, and further details on how we implement this will be available in due course.</p>
<h4>Infrastructure lending</h4>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>second</strong>&nbsp;area to pick out is infrastructure lending. This is another area where we inherited an EU support factor that offers a risk weight reduction. While we did not receive convincing data to justify retaining the support factor purely based on an assessment of the risk, we did receive feedback on changes that would make our framework more risk sensitive. So, we are proceeding with removing the support factor, but we have also introduced a new, lower risk weight of 50% for &lsquo;substantially stronger&rsquo; project finance exposures that are subject to the so-called IRB slotting approach. This new lower risk weight represents a reduction that is greater than the support factor would provide for higher quality lending. And it is in addition to the lower standardised risk weight that we proposed for high quality project finance exposures in the &lsquo;operational&rsquo; phase.</p>
<p>These arguments are purely based on an assessment of the risk of infrastructure lending. But in parallel with the approach for SME lending, we are also very aware of the wider considerations around the impact on growth for infrastructure lending. So, mirroring the approach and rationale for SME lending, we have also introduced a similar ongoing structural adjustment to Pillar 2 requirements to ensure that the removal of the support factors does not result in an increase in capital requirements for infrastructure lending. As with the approach to SME lending, this will be available for all firms engaged in infrastructure lending, including mid-tier and banks eligible for the &lsquo;Strong and Simple&rsquo; regime.</p>
<h4>Conversion factors</h4>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>third</strong>&nbsp;area is conversion factors, which reflect the extent to which off balance sheet items are likely to come on to a firm's balance sheet. We received convincing data regarding the calibration of certain trade finance related conversion factors<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/september/phil-evans-speech-uk-finance-a-balanced-approach-to-finishing-basel-in-the-uk#footnote-9" id="footnote-ref-9"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[8]</a></sup>, which demonstrated that our proposal of 50% was too conservative and not commensurate with the risk. So, we have followed the evidence. We are lowering this conversion factor from 50% to 20%. Similarly, we are lowering the conversion factor for the &lsquo;other commitments&rsquo; category to 40%, except for UK residential real estate commitments where I think it fair to say that firms agreed with us that the 50% we proposed was more appropriate. The data suggest both adjustments are prudent and appropriately reflect the risk, as per our aim of having conversion factors that are neither too low nor too high. In doing so, these choices will also benefit our international competitiveness.</p>
<h4>Residential mortgages</h4>
<p><strong>Fourth</strong>, we have made several changes to our residential mortgage policy proposals under the Standardised Approach.</p>
<p>We received persuasive arguments to make our proposals on origination valuation more risk sensitive and operationally simpler. This is another good example of where feedback from firms has helped to make our proposals more efficient, while maintaining the basic principles around using origination loan-to-value. We are making a number of changes, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>to improve the risk sensitivity of mortgage valuations, we have added a &lsquo;backstop&rsquo; revaluation event every three or five years, depending on the specifics of the property. This avoids disadvantaging long-term products like lifetime mortgages by ensuring their valuations are not too stale.</li>
<li>we are reducing the operational burden of the valuation proposals by removing, completely, the requirement to adjust valuations to reflect a property value that would be sustainable over the life of the loan. Feedback suggested that &lsquo;sustainability&rsquo; would be very difficult to implement.</li>
<li>the need for downward revaluations will now be identified through a much more mechanistic, and therefore easier to implement, threshold of a 10% fall in house prices since the last valuation.</li>
<li>one area that isn&rsquo;t changing, but is worth mentioning because we&rsquo;ve had a lot of questions, is over the use of Automatic Valuation Models that allow the desk based generation of housing valuations. We had not intended to prevent firms using them, and are clarifying that their use is permitted.</li>
</ul>
<p><a id="_Hlk167110359"></a>Changes have also been made to our proposals for self-build mortgages &ndash; a small but important market &ndash; where based on the helpful evidence received, we think the risk weights we proposed were too high. We will allow self-build exposures to be treated as &lsquo;regulatory real estate exposures&rsquo; provided certain criteria are met, meaning the loan-splitting approach can be used to risk weight these exposures. This will be subject to an adjustment to the property value, given remaining uncertainty about the robustness of the valuation of unfinished properties.</p>
<p>We think this set of adjustments to the housing part creates a package that achieves the right balance between risk-sensitivity, prudence and cyclicality. Striving for that balance is clearly essential for such an important segment of our economy.</p>
<h4>Output floor</h4>
<p><strong>Finally</strong>, we&rsquo;ve made a technical change &ndash; but an important one &ndash; to the way firms calculate the output floor (see Annex for explanation of what the output floor does). This change is intended to improve the consistency between the standardised approach and the output floor calculation.</p>
<p>The issue revolves around how literally we should treat an Internal Ratings Based (IRB) firm bound by the backstop of the output floor as a standardised approach firm. Our initial proposals had prioritised simplicity, requiring no additional work from IRB firms to adjust their capital resources to reflect differences in the treatment of provisions in the standardised and IRB approaches. During the consultation, we heard from a number of firms who appreciated the intention of keeping the output floor simple, but who pointed out that in some cases the floor would be a less accurate measure of the capital needed under the standardised approach and IRB approaches. So, we're fixing that by introducing an adjustment to risk weighted assets when the output floor binds that mimics the standardised accounting treatment of provisions. The output floor is a key part of Basel 3.1, helping to level the playing field between SA and IRB firms, so if we need a slightly more complex approach to achieve that outcome, then it's the right thing to do.</p>
<h3><a id="_Hlk167110819"></a>Link with strong and simple</h3>
<p>When we published our near final Basel 3.1 rules this morning, we also released a range of related consultation documents on our work to create a &lsquo;Strong and Simple&rsquo; regime for domestically focused lenders. These propose meaningful simplifications to the capital regime for Small Domestic Deposit Takers, without weakening it. I won&rsquo;t cover those here because my colleague David Bailey will do them much greater justice in a forthcoming speech, but I did want to describe how the strong and simple approach is making use of the Basel 3.1 changes given the close links.</p>
<p>In our Basel 3.1 proposals, we had said that we were minded to use the Basel 3.1 risk weights as the starting point for the strong and simple capital regime. In the strong and simple consultation, we have proposed that, subject to a small number of simplifications described in the package, we will use the 3.1 risk weights in that regime.</p>
<p>The reason for the proposal is that in adopting our Basel 3.1 rules, we have assessed, activity by activity, how risky various types of business are. And then we have set risk weights appropriately, in our view neither too low nor too high. We have taken the view that if Basel 3.1 is our best estimate of the risk weights, then that is going to be true whether large firms or small firms are doing the activity. The risk is the risk in other words. As part and parcel of this view, the standardised approach to credit risk, used by all small firms in the strong and simple regime, is now much more risk sensitive and includes a significant narrowing of the gap between the standardised and modelled approaches for determining risk weights, which helps to facilitate competition.</p>
<h3>Timeline and the plan for implementation</h3>
<p>I said at the start of this talk that Basel 3.1 has been a long journey. Necessarily. But publishing near final rules is not the end of the story, because we need an implementation process which works for firms and works for the PRA.</p>
<p>On the timetable for implementing, the PRA has continued to monitor the implementation timelines of other jurisdictions and assessed the adequacy of the period between publication of PRA rules and their implementation. We have decided to move the implementation date for the Basel 3.1 standards by a further six months to 1 January 2026 with a transitional period of 4 years to ensure full implementation by 1 January 2030, in line with the proposals originally set out in CP16/22.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Let me wrap up.</p>
<p>First up, I know you will have more questions on the details of the topics I have covered today as well as other issues that I haven&rsquo;t touched on. Those are covered in the near-final Policy Statement and I&rsquo;ll be happy to take some questions.</p>
<p>Second, to re-iterate my thanks for the strong engagement we have had from stakeholders. It has helped to improve our package, in my view.</p>
<p>Third, our approach has been to listen to the feedback of stakeholders and engage extensively. We have aimed for risk weights that are neither too high nor too low, and in doing so provide a balance across a range of considerations. This includes advancing our primary objective and aligning with international standards. And it includes a significant role for considerations around competitiveness and growth and competition. Taking all of these factors as a whole, it has produced, in our view, a balanced approach to finishing Basel 3.1 in the UK.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/september/phil-evans-speech-uk-finance-a-balanced-approach-to-finishing-basel-in-the-uk#footnote-10" id="footnote-ref-10"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[9]</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Annex: What does Basel 3.1 deliver?</strong></p>
<p>The package is the last element of the Basel III set, which the PRA played an active and influential role in designing. The parts of Basel III that remain to be implemented focus on the calculation of risk-weighted assets (RWAs). These elements may be the final piece of the reform jigsaw, but they are essential. Without better risk capture, the overall package of Basel III reforms will not be as effective.</p>
<p>What does the Basel 3.1 package aim to achieve?</p>
<p>The high-level aims are twofold:</p>
<p><strong>Improve risk-sensitivity and reduce excessive variability</strong></p>
<p>The first is to improve the robustness of RWAs by improving risk-sensitivity and reducing excessive variability:</p>
<p>The global financial crisis revealed significant shortcomings in the calculation of risk weights. The standardised approaches should of course be simple, but not too crude or risk-insensitive. Basel 3.1 makes the standardised approaches better reflect the risk of firms&rsquo; exposures. An added benefit of this improvement &ndash; which is particularly important for the PRA in its longstanding effort to meet its secondary competition objective<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/september/phil-evans-speech-uk-finance-a-balanced-approach-to-finishing-basel-in-the-uk#footnote-11" id="footnote-ref-11"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[10]</a></sup>&nbsp;&ndash; is that the playing field is further levelled between the large number of smaller firms, the typical users of the standardised approaches, and larger firms using internal models.</p>
<p>The BCBS also noted a &lsquo;worrying degree of variability&rsquo; in the calculation of modelled risk weights. A number of studies have found material differences in the risk weights calculated by firms&rsquo; internal models for the same hypothetical portfolios of assets. Importantly, excessive variability in RWAs reduces the consistency and comparability of firms&rsquo; risk-weighted capital ratios. This is confidence draining. To improve matters, Basel 3.1 makes internal models unavailable to firms in areas where modelling is too difficult to perform robustly. In other areas, such as parts of the credit risk framework, the standards reduce the flexibility in modelling approaches. And in others, like market risk, there is an entirely new type of model measure.</p>
<p><strong>Introduce the output floor to backstop modelled risk weights</strong></p>
<p>The second aim is to contain the capital benefits of using internal models because of concerns about model risk and uncertainty. To achieve this, Basel 3.1 introduces an &lsquo;output floor&rsquo; &ndash; a &lsquo;backstop&rsquo; that stops modelled RWAs from falling too far below those of the standardised approaches.</p>
<p>Overall, the proposals make significant changes to the way firms calculate risk weights and, in doing so, address many of the issues that came to the fore during the global financial crisis.</p>

<p>Sharp-eyed readers of the Consultation Paper will have spotted that the new secondary growth and competitiveness objective does not technically apply to our Basel 3.1 rule-making powers. However when making Basel 3.1 rules we are required to &ldquo;have regard&rdquo; to international growth and competitiveness considerations and to alignment with international standards and we have leaned heavily on those considerations when developing the package, especially now that the new secondary objective for growth and competitiveness has come into force.</p>

<title>The UK Prudential Regulation Authority Publishes The Second Policy Statement On Basel 3.1 And Proposals On The Strong And Simple Capital Regime For Smaller Firms</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="page-section">
<p>Today, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) has published the second near-final<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;policy statement and rules covering the implementation of Basel 3.1 standards for credit risk, the output floor, reporting and disclosure requirements in response to consultation paper CP16/22. The near-final policy statement is relevant to all PRA-regulated banks, building societies, investment firms and financial holding companies (&lsquo;firms&rsquo;).</p>
<p>Based on latest data from firms, the PRA estimates that the Tier 1 capital requirements for major UK firms will be virtually unchanged by today&rsquo;s package, with an aggregate increase of less than 1% from January 2030 when the transitional arrangements come to an end.</p>
<p>The near-final policy statement will give certainty to firms on their future capital requirements and deliver a better balanced and risk-sensitive approach to calculating regulatory capital under the Basel 3.1 framework. It will also support financial and economic stability, and the growth and competitiveness of the UK, while remaining aligned to international standards. We have had particular regard to growth and competitiveness considerations given that the PRA&rsquo;s new secondary growth and competitiveness objective has now come into force.</p>
<p>The near-final policy statement takes account of feedback received through various channels which include 126 written responses received to CP16/22 as well as more than 70 meetings held with stakeholders to discuss their views. Some of the most material changes to the original proposals include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lower capital requirements for small and medium enterprise (SME) exposures:&nbsp;</strong>resulting in no increase in capital requirements relative to today, and improvements to reduce operational burdens, making it easier for firms to lend to SMEs;</li>
<li><strong>Lower capital requirements for infrastructure exposures:&nbsp;</strong>resulting in no increase in capital requirements relative to today;</li>
<li><strong>Lower capital requirements for trade finance-related activities</strong>: maintaining the existing UK capital requirements regulation (CRR) 20% conversion factor for &lsquo;transaction-related contingent items&rsquo;;</li>
<li><strong>A simpler, more risk-sensitive approach to valuing residential property</strong>; and</li>
<li><strong>An adjusted approach to calculating the output floor<sup>2</sup></strong><strong>:&nbsp;</strong>which improves the consistency between this, and the standardised approaches used by firms without model approval.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Implementation and next steps</strong></h3>
<p>To support a smooth implementation of the package and having considered feedback from the consultation as well as the implementation timelines of other jurisdictions, the PRA has decided to move the implementation date for the Basel 3.1 standards by a further six months to 1 January 2026 with a four-year transitional period ending on 31 December 2029.</p>
<h3><strong>Sam Woods, Deputy Governor of Prudential Regulation and CEO of the PRA said:</strong></h3>
<p>&lsquo;These rules will improve the way in which we regulate the banks in order to maintain safety and soundness and wider financial stability. We have made a number of important changes following consultation, and the resulting package will support growth and competitiveness while also ensuring that the UK aligns with international standards.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>The Strong and Simple capital regime</h3>
<p>We have also published a wider banking capital package of consultation papers including CP7/24 &lsquo;The Strong and Simple Framework: The simplified capital regime for Small Domestic Deposit Takers (SDDTs)&rsquo; which sets out proposals that would significantly simplify the capital regime for SDDTs whilst maintaining their resilience. In doing so, the proposals for the SDDT framework would also support a competitive, diverse and sustainable banking sector in the UK.</p>
<p>With the publication of CP7/24, the PRA has made significant progress towards tackling many of the issues with current regulation that small firms have raised in previous years.</p>
<p>The Strong and Simple CP proposes simplifications to all elements of the capital stack:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pillar 1 risk-weighted assets would be calculated using Basel 3.1 rules, with some simplifications for SDDTs;</li>
<li>Pillar 2 would be radically simplified; and</li>
<li>There would be a single, more constant and predictable capital buffer<a id="_Hlk175240464"></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the CP, the PRA has proposed that the implementation date for the simplified capital regime for SDDTs will be 1 January 2027. The consultation period closes on 12 December 2024.</p>

<p>The PRA has not made final rule instruments at this stage because HM Treasury is required to first revoke the relevant parts of the Capital Requirements Regulation by way of commencement regulation before the PRA can replace them in the PRA rules. Once the commencement regulation has been made, the PRA intends to make all the final policy materials, rules, and technical standards in a single, final policy statement. The PRA does not expect material changes between the near-final and final policy statement.</p>

<title>SET Advances Development Of Carbon Credit Trading Center, Promoting Thailand As ASEAN Leader In Greenhouse Gas Reduction</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/set-advances-development-of-carbon-credit-trading-center-promoting-thailand-as/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/set-advances-development-of-carbon-credit-trading-center-promoting-thailand-as/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In line with the Thai government's policy statement to parliament today which outlines plans to promote a green economy, achieve carbon neutrality, and establish Thailand as ASEAN's leader in carbon dioxide emission reduction, as well as positioning the country as ASEAN's hub for carbon credit trading through the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET), the Thai bourse recognizes the crucial role of building a comprehensive green economy ecosystem in collaboration with public and private sector partners to facilitate Thailand's transition to a low-carbon society.</p>
<p>Key initiatives include preparing and enhancing the business sector's capacity to adapt and capitalize on opportunities arising from this transition, as well as developing essential infrastructure, such as the SET ESG Data Platform. This platform will serve as a central hub connecting ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) data from businesses and investors - a critical component for developing a sustainable finance ecosystem.</p>
<p>In addition, SET has launched the SET Carbon system, a carbon footprint calculation tool for listed companies and businesses in the supply chain. This tool is aimed at improving greenhouse gas management efficiency, while also creating a Standard Master Trading Agreement to streamline carbon credit transactions.</p>
<p>A key mechanism supporting businesses in their transition towards net-zero greenhouse gas emissions is an efficient and transparent carbon credit trading center. SET is currently studying the development of regulatory mechanisms and trading systems for this purpose. In this endeavor, SET is collaborating with key stakeholders, including: The Securities and Exchange Commission; &nbsp;Department of Climate Change and Environment under Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment; and Thailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organization (Public Organization). The collaborative effort aims to design an appropriate model for carbon credit trading and push for the resolution of regulatory obstacles to achieve sustainability goals while simultaneously driving the country's economic and social progress</p>

<title>UK Lending Standards Board Announces Stronger Protections For SMEs Using Personal Guarantees</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: personal guarantees, Standards of Lending Practice, lenders, SMEs, FCA.

Summary:<br /><br />Updates to personal guarantee standards require annual checks, improved communication, and legal advice for SMEs' protection. LSB's findings and regulations aim to address issues and protect guarantors. <div>
<ul>
<li><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.lendingstandardsboard.org.uk/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Lending Standards Board (LSB)</a>&nbsp;to require lenders to carry out annual checks on the status of a personal guarantee<b>&nbsp;</b></li>
<li>Existing requirements on communications with guarantors have been updated<b>&nbsp;</b></li>
<li>Complaints about personal guarantees are rare among LSB&rsquo;s registered firms</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.lendingstandardsboard.org.uk/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">The Lending Standards Board (LSB</a>) has strengthened provisions on personal guarantees within the Standards of Lending Practice for business customers (&lsquo;the business Standards&rsquo;). The changes will help ensure lenders are clear with guarantors about what they are signing up to, and help avoid situations where a guarantor is surprised to find out they are personally liable for lending to a business.</p>
<p>The updates to the Standards include important new requirements for lenders as well as improvements to existing protections and guidance. The business Standards are recognised by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and are the only lending protections available to many UK SMEs.</p>
<p>Personal guarantees see a guarantor &ndash; typically, but not always, a company&rsquo;s director &ndash; agree to be held personally liable for lending to a business.</p>
<p>A need for updated guidance on guarantees was identified by the LSB&rsquo;s ongoing compliance work and was highlighted in the LSB&rsquo;s review of the business Standards, published in early 2024. The LSB found that lenders&rsquo; processes for reviewing guarantees could be working more effectively to ensure information remained current, particularly where lending had been repaid or where there had been changes at director level.</p>
<p>The key changes to the Standards and accompanying guidance on personal guarantees include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new requirement for lenders to provide guarantors with annual reminders that a personal guarantee remains in place. This will ensure lenders can maintain up-to-date records on who is liable for a guarantee and will help guarantors keep track of any liability. These reminders will serve as prompts for guarantors to speak to a lender if they are no longer associated with a business in receipt of lending, or if they believe the lending is no longer outstanding.</li>
<li>Updates to the requirements for lenders on advising potential guarantors of the need to seek independent legal advice about whether becoming a guarantor is the right choice for them.</li>
<li>Enhanced guidance for lenders on providing information to a guarantor about how the personal guarantee will function and their obligations under it.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Laura Mahoney, Head of Policy at the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.lendingstandardsboard.org.uk/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">LSB</a>, says</b>: &ldquo;Personal guarantees have the potential to have a significant impact on guarantors, so it&rsquo;s really important that their interests are protected when a guarantee is in use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Positively, we&rsquo;ve found that issues with guarantees among the LSB&rsquo;s registered firms are rare. Lenders typically only call on these guarantees as a last resort, and there are very few complaints about their use. But, we still felt there was scope to improve how lenders communicate with guarantors about how guarantees work and their potential impact, and to ensure lenders keep up-to-date information about a personal guarantee. Where there are issues, it&rsquo;s typically where a guarantor doesn&rsquo;t realise they are still liable for a guarantee after they&rsquo;ve left or sold a business &ndash; we&rsquo;ve updated the Standards to reduce the chances of this happening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While updating the Standards, we&rsquo;ve also considered the important role that guarantees can play in helping SMEs access the finance they need, quickly. We&rsquo;ve sought to add protections for SMEs and guarantors at the same time as avoiding adding friction to the lending journey that could leave SMEs facing worse outcomes because they can&rsquo;t access crucial funding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The updates to existing provisions in the Standards and accompanying guidance will apply from 12 September 2024. The new requirements on annual reminders regarding guarantees will apply from 8 September 2025 to allow lenders the time to put the necessary processes in place.</p>
<p><b>Use of Personal Guarantees Varies from Lender to Lender &ndash; And They&rsquo;re Called on Rarely</b></p>
<p>The LSB&rsquo;s review of its requirements on personal guarantees included an analysis of their use across the LSB&rsquo;s registered firm base. The prior lack of information about personal guarantees was an issue highlighted in the Federation of Small Businesses&rsquo; (FSB) December 2023 &lsquo;super-complaint&rsquo; to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) about the use of guarantees.</p>
<p>Using data provided by the LSB&rsquo;s registered firms who responded to the LSB&rsquo;s request for information, the LSB found that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal guarantees are used by lenders across the LSB&rsquo;s registered firms, but the situations in which they are used varies considerably from lender to lender &ndash; they are not a default requirement among registered firms as a whole and, approximately, just one-third of registered firms&rsquo; current lending to limited companies is supported by a personal guarantee.</li>
<li>Registered firms have their own thresholds and criteria for when they will request a personal guarantee. Requests for personal guarantees can depend on factors including the type of lending product a business has applied for.</li>
<li>Approximately 2% of personal guarantees are called on in a twelve-month period, with some firms calling on under 1% of guarantees. Calling on a guarantee does not always result in enforcement action (with some lenders restructuring or writing off lending instead).</li>
<li>Complaints regarding personal guarantees are in single figures for most firms, rising to tens of complaints for larger firms.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Scope of the Standards &amp; Further Changes</b></p>
<p>Given the limited statutory regulation for SME lending, the LSB&rsquo;s business Standards are the only lending protections for many UK SMEs. These Standards provide lending protections to registered firms&rsquo; SME customers with a turnover up to &pound;25m. By contrast, FCA protections are limited by the regulator&rsquo;s statutory perimeter, which excludes business lending above &pound;25,000 and lending to limited companies.</p>
<p>The LSB&rsquo;s work to update the business Standards has been carried out alongside a separate project by the FCA as it responds to the FSB&rsquo;s super-complaint. As the LSB&rsquo;s review has found, the overwhelming majority of personal guarantees are linked to lending to limited companies &ndash; and these companies sit outside the FCA&rsquo;s perimeter for SME lending. As such, any action the FCA takes will only apply to a small minority of SMEs.</p>

<div> Derivatives, Securities, Volatility, Trading, Futures
Summary:<br />Cboe launches S&amp;P 500 Variance Futures to hedge and capitalize on U.S. equity volatility. Contracts settle based on S&amp;P 500 Index. Accessible and capital-efficient. Ongoing efforts to expand product suite. <div>
<ul type="disc">
<li>New exchange-traded solution designed to hedge against and capitalize on U.S. equity market volatility moves</li>
<li>Product debuts at a critical time as market participants navigate uncertain macro environment</li>
<li>Reflects Cboe's ongoing efforts to expand access and functionality of its volatility product suite</li>
</ul>
<p>Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe: CBOE), the world's leading derivatives and securities exchange network, today announced that its&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4252290-1&amp;h=988607549&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cboe.com%2Fvariance-futures-pipeline-hub%2F&amp;a=new+Cboe+S%26P+500+Variance+Futures" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new Cboe S&amp;P 500 Variance Futures</a>&nbsp;(Ticker: VA) are planned to begin trading on Monday, September 23, on the Cboe Futures Exchange, LLC (CFE).</p>
<p>As investors continue to navigate an uncertain macroeconomic environment, the new Cboe S&amp;P 500 Variance Futures will aim to provide market participants with an additional tool to calculate implied volatility of the U.S. equity market as measured by the S&amp;P 500 Index, and to manage volatility risks and express directional views. The futures are designed to offer a streamlined approach to trading the spread between implied and realized volatility, enabling market participants to take advantage of discrepancies between market expectations and actual outcomes.</p>
<p>"Cboe's suite of proprietary products, including the highly popular SPX options and VIX options and futures, has served the needs of market participants globally for many decades," said Catherine Clay, Head of Global Derivatives at Cboe. "As investor needs for hedging, trading, diversification and asset allocation continue to evolve, we are committed to expanding our offerings to meet their demands. We look forward to launching the next generation of volatility products &ndash; including Cboe S&amp;P 500 Variance Futures and options on VIX futures coming later in October, subject to regulatory review &ndash; which we expect will further equip our customers with new and efficient tools to trade volatility."</p>
<p>"The launch of Cboe S&amp;P 500 Variance Futures comes at a crucial time when risk management is top of mind for many market participants, amid the backdrop of the upcoming U.S. election, shifting monetary policy and ongoing geopolitical tensions," said Rob Hocking, Head of Product Innovation at Cboe. "As demand for hedging and income generation rises, our goal is to broaden access to the derivatives markets by simplifying complex, capital-intensive strategies and making them more easily tradable in an exchange-listed, centrally cleared environment. For those looking to hedge against or capitalize on volatility moves, we believe this new product will offer an accessible and capital-efficient way to replicate the exposures of OTC variance swaps."</p>
<p>Cboe S&amp;P 500 Variance Futures are expected to appeal to a wide range of market participants with diverse investment objectives, including volatility traders and hedge funds seeking capital efficiency and transparency, institutional investors managing equity volatility risk and expressing directional views, portfolio managers aiming for enhanced diversification and risk premia capture, and dealers and market makers transitioning from OTC variance swaps to standardized products.</p>
<p>Noel Smith, Managing Partner and Chief Investment Officer at Convex Asset Management, said: "The introduction of Cboe S&amp;P 500 Variance Futures will be a useful and welcome addition to the volatility toolkit. Variance futures have a convex payoff structure compared to a linear payout with volatility. If long variance, holders might enjoy the benefits of enhanced tail convexity, and if there are liquidity issues at distant out-of-the-money strikes, long variance could continue to mitigate risk. Variance futures fill a useful gap in dispersion trading, tail hedging and relative value volatility arbitrage."</p>
<p>Keith DeCarlucci, Chief Investment Officer at Melqart Asset Management, said: "Having traded variance since 2002, being able to trade a simple cleared variance product will be a very welcome addition to our portfolio."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bill Looney, Head of Global Business Development at X-Change Financial Access (XFA), said: "XFA is encouraged by the relaunch of the Cboe S&amp;P 500 Variance Futures contract and its ability to provide the marketplace a listed alternative for trading variance. &nbsp;As a committed TPH holder, XFA, with its trading floor and electronic execution capabilities, looks forward to helping our clients &ndash; in all customer segments &ndash; access this innovative product."</p>
<p>The Cboe S&amp;P 500 Variance Futures contracts will settle based on a calculation[1]&nbsp;of the annualized realized variance of the S&amp;P 500 Index. The realized variance will be calculated once each day from a series of values of the S&amp;P 500 Index beginning with the closing index value on the first day a VA futures contract is listed for trading and ending with the special opening quotation (SOQ) of the S&amp;P 500 Index on the final settlement date of that contract.</p>
<p>The contracts will quote and trade directly in variance units, offering a simplified approach to managing and trading variance exposure. With a contract size of $1[2]&nbsp;and settlement aligned with standard SPX options (generally settling the third Friday of the month), these futures are designed to integrate seamlessly into market participants' existing trading strategies.</p>
<p>Additionally, Cboe expects to introduce&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4252290-1&amp;h=564536532&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cboe.com%2FVIX-OOF-pipeline-hub%2F&amp;a=trading+in+options+on+VIX+Futures+starting+October+14" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">trading in options on VIX Futures starting October 14</a>, subject to regulatory review. The planned launch of these products underscores Cboe's ongoing efforts to expand the accessibility and functionality of its SPX and VIX product suite to meet growing customer demand.

<div> Partnerships, Cryptocurrency, Investment scams, Customer education, Fraud awareness
Summary:
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s Office of Customer Outreach and Education (OCEO) partners with various organizations to distribute information on cryptocurrency investment scams and encourages reporting of fraudulent activity.<br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission&rsquo;s Office of Customer Outreach and Education (OCEO) today announced two partnerships to give customers targeted information about cryptocurrency relationship investment scams. Partnerships with multiple organizations are a cornerstone of OCEO&rsquo;s outreach efforts to expand its audience to include those people who trust the partner organizations and could benefit from OCEO anti-fraud information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Partnering with federal and state regulators as well as consumer protection groups and other organizations helps spread the CFTC&rsquo;s customer education message and hopefully reaches people before they can get scammed,&rdquo; said Office of Customer Education and Outreach Director Melanie Devoe. &ldquo;These partnerships focus on&nbsp;a relationship confidence fraud the perpetrators commonly refer to as &lsquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/RomanceScam.html">pig butchering</a>,&rsquo; that is estimated to cost Americans billions each year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>OCEO is partnering with the American Bankers Association Foundation along with other federal agencies and a private regulator to distribute an infographic to help consumers recognize and avoid so-called &ldquo;pig butchering&rdquo; fraud. The one-page infographic illustrates the scam&rsquo;s phases&mdash;from how victims are targeted and groomed to how the scam ends &mdash; and provides warning signs and steps to take if a person has been victimized. View the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/2024/09/OCEO_Cryptocurrency_Infographic.pdf">infographic</a>.</p>
<p>OCEO is also partnering with the U.S. Security and Exchange&nbsp;Commission&rsquo;s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and the North American Securities Administrators Association to develop and distribute an investor alert that gives customers a clear picture of how &ldquo;pig butchering&rdquo; scammers work their way into the minds and wallets of everyday, knowledgeable people. It targets individuals who think they would never fall for this type of scam by giving them an introspective on how these fraudsters have perfected their criminal craft to entice even the savviest investors.&nbsp;One way&nbsp;all investors can protect themselves is to stop the scam before it starts by not responding to unexpected or unsolicited text messages from unknown senders.&nbsp;Report them using the phone&rsquo;s &ldquo;report junk&rdquo; option or by forwarding unwanted texts to 7726 (SPAM). View the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/RelationshipInvestmentScam.html">alert</a>.</p>
<p>Additional Infographic Partners:</p>
<p>Federal Bureau of Investigations<br />Financial Industry Regulatory Authority<br />Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigation<br />U.S. Department of Homeland Security<br />U.S. Department of the Treasury, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network<br />U.S. Secret Service<br />U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</p>
<p>* * * *</p>
<p>If you or someone you know is a victim of a cryptocurrency investment fraud, report it to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ic3.gov/">www.IC3.gov</a>. In your complaint, please include as much information as possible in your report, including names of investment platforms, cryptocurrency addresses and transaction hashes, bank account information, and names and contact information of suspected scammers.

<title>Ontario Securities Commission Study Examines Role Of Artificial Intelligence In Retail Investing</title>

<div> experiment, artificial intelligence, investor decision-making, investment suggestion, OSC<br />
Summary: The Ontario Securities Commission conducted an experiment on the impact of AI on investor decision-making, finding potential benefits and risks.<br /> <div>
<p>The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) today released&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/investors/investor-research-and-reports/artificial-intelligence-and-retail-investing"><em>Artificial Intelligence and Retail Investing: Use Cases and Experimental Research</em></a>, a report detailing the results of a behavioural science experiment that focused on the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in supporting retail investor decision-making.</p>
<p>The experiment consisted of an online investment simulation to test how closely Canadians followed a suggestion for how to invest a hypothetical $20,000. Participants were told the suggestion came from one of three sources: a human financial services provider, an AI tool, or a human financial services provider using an AI tool (a &lsquo;blended&rsquo; approach). The research team then measured how closely participants adhered to the investment suggestion when investing their $20,000.</p>
<p>Results showed that participants who received the investment suggestion from a human using an AI tool (&lsquo;blended&rsquo;) adhered to the investment suggestion most closely, although this difference was not significant. Notably, there was no discernible difference in adherence to investment suggestions provided by a human or AI tool, indicating Canadian investors may be receptive to taking advice from an AI system.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This research highlights the opportunities AI can create for Canadian investors and market participants,&rdquo; said Leslie Byberg, Executive Vice President, Strategic Regulation at the OSC. &ldquo;It is important that we are agile and able to harness these opportunities while ensuring investor protection remains at the forefront of how we regulate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>OSC researchers also examined the current investor-facing use cases of AI in Canada and abroad. In doing so, they identified three broad use cases:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Decision support</span>&nbsp;involves AI systems that provide recommendations or advice to guide investment decisions.</li>
<li><span>Automation</span>&nbsp;consists of AI systems that automate portfolio and/or fund (e.g., ETF) management.</li>
<li><span>Scams and fraud</span>&nbsp;includes AI systems that either facilitate or mitigate scams targeting retail investors, as well as scams capitalizing on the &ldquo;buzz&rdquo; of AI.</li>
</ol>
<p>The report details both benefits and risks stemming from the first two use cases. For instance, AI systems could provide increased access to more affordable advice for investors, but there is also the possibility that systems may provide investors with advice that is biased or not relevant, appropriate, or accurate. As AI-enhanced scams and frauds may pose significant risks to investors, the OSC continues to research its use, as well as ways to provide effective investor protection and potential mitigation strategies.</p>
<p>This research builds on the OSC&rsquo;s existing research in the area of artificial intelligence and reinforces the benefit of using behavioural science as a policy tool by regulators. As AI continues to advance in capabilities, more research is needed to help capital markets stakeholders better understand the implications for retail investors.</p>
<p>The OSC partnered with the&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="http://www.bi.team/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Behavioural Insights Team</a><span>(BIT) to conduct this research.</span><br /><br /><span>For more information about investing, investor protection and behavioural science, visit&nbsp;</span><a class="ext" href="https://www.getsmarteraboutmoney.ca/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">GetSmarterAboutMoney.ca<span>&nbsp;</span></a><span>and sign-up for the OSC&rsquo;s popular e-newsletter,&nbsp;</span><a class="ext" href="https://www.getsmarteraboutmoney.ca/investor-news/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Investor News<span>&nbsp;</span></a>.&nbsp;<span>In addition,&nbsp;</span><a class="ext" href="https://www.getsmarteraboutmoney.ca/learning-path/community-outreach/osc-in-the-community/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">OSC in the Community</a></p>
<p>hosts events online and across Ontario to talk with people about investor education and protection.</p>
<p>The mandate of the OSC is to provide protection to investors from unfair, improper or fraudulent practices, to foster fair, efficient and competitive capital markets and confidence in the capital markets, to foster capital formation, and to contribute to the stability of the financial system and the reduction of systemic risk. Investors are urged to check the registration of any persons or company offering an investment opportunity and to review the OSC investor materials available at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.osc.ca/">http://www.osc.ca</a>.</p>

<title>Spanish Listed Companies Call For An Update Of Regulations To Facilitate Maximum Shareholder Participation In Their General Meetings</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/spanish-listed-companies-call-for-an-update-of-regulations-to-facilitate-maximum/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: Telematic meetings, Shareholder participation, Reform of regulations, Modernization, Spanish listed companies<br />
Summary: Technology enables telematic shareholder meetings, necessary reforms in Spanish regulations, and the active involvement of shareholders in listed companies.<br /><br /> <div>
<ul>
<li><span>Technology facilitates meetings to be held entirely telematically, enabling all shareholders to participate on an equal footing.</span></li>
<li><span>This model is widely implemented in other countries such as Germany or the United States.</span></li>
<li><span>The conference &lsquo;Shareholders&rsquo; Meetings in the 21st Century&rsquo;, organised by BME, analysed these new trends and the changes needed to encourage shareholder participation.</span></li>
<li><span>Major Spanish companies, such as Banco Santander, Telef&oacute;nica and Iberdrola, together with proxy solicitors, shareholder associations, magistrates, law firms and business law professors, shared their opinions on the modernisation of legislation on general meetings.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Spain's major listed companies agree on the need to reform current Spanish regulations so that each company can freely choose how to hold its General Meeting. The experts stress that in Spain the regulation of general meetings lacks the necessary flexibility to hold fully telematic meetings, which are already common in other European countries and in the United States, as well as being the preferred method for many shareholders and institutional investors, who in most cases reside in other countries.</p>
<p>This is one of the main conclusions of the conference &lsquo;Shareholders&rsquo; Meetings in the 21st Century: Permanent and telematic meeting model&lsquo;, organised by BME at the Palacio de la Bolsa de Madrid, which was attended by representatives of listed companies such as Santander, Telef&oacute;nica and Iberdrola, the Better Finance investors&rsquo; federation, the Georgeson consultancy firm and experts from law firms such as A&amp;O Shearman, Cuatrecasas and Garrigues, as well as magistrates, professors and members of the General Codification Commission.</p>
<p>Among other topics, the different round tables discussed technology, which already allows the holding of general shareholders' meetings completely telematically, a common practice in other countries and preferred by national and international institutional investors. However, current Spanish regulations require the possibility of two-way interventions in real time, which is unfeasible for companies with hundreds of thousands of shareholders.</p>
<p>Large listed companies have permanently open channels for the active participation of shareholders throughout the year and not limited to the day and time of the general meeting as required by current legislation. Thanks to these means in these companies, the majority of shareholders exercise their rights to information and proposals throughout the year and their right to participate in the meeting is exercised remotely before the meeting, transforming the general meeting into a continuous and auditable process of information and participation.</p>
<p>Javier Hernani, CEO of BME, welcomed the attendees and highlighted the importance of modernising the General Meetings. &rsquo;Better communication and interaction between issuers and investors would result in greater confidence in the market and, consequently, lower capital costs. It is therefore key for companies to facilitate maximum shareholder information and involvement in the company. In this regard, technology has opened up new channels of communication that must be explored in all their power and virtuality,&rsquo; said the CEO of BME.</p>
<p><span>The need to modernise regulations</span></p>
<p>During the conference, the necessary measures to advance in the active involvement of shareholders, current and future trends in the organisation of general meetings and proposals for reforming the current regulations in Spain were discussed. Shareholders' preferences on the format of the meetings (face-to-face, hybrid or telematic) and the legal limitations that hinder the holding of fully telematic meetings were assessed.</p>
<p>During the first panel discussion, about current and future trends in the organisation of general meetings, the speakers focused on policies and channels for the ongoing engagement of shareholders, highlighting their valuable contribution to the organisation of a successful board meeting. They also noted the importance of diversifying the means of information and participation available to shareholders, as well as the preference of institutional investors for remote participation, mainly before the meeting.</p>
<p>The second round table addressed the current comparative legal framework and proposals for reform of the Capital Companies Act. The group of experts stressed that the exclusively telematic meeting format used with very satisfactory results during the pandemic has fallen into disuse, despite its advantages for maximising participation in large companies with an international projection in their shareholding.</p>
<p>The conditions imposed by the Capital Companies Act make it difficult for these companies to convene their meetings exclusively by telematic means, without this mandatory regulation protecting the interests of shareholders and equal treatment among them more effectively.</p>
<p>The final roundtable focused on shareholders as the true protagonists of listed companies and featured the main board secretaries of top-tier listed companies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The representatives of large corporations highlighted their companies' efforts to respond to and even anticipate the expectations of shareholders and investors, as evidenced by the engagement measures presented during the conference, which form part of their respective corporate policies. In this context, they stressed the importance of striking a balance between mandatory legal rules and the self-regulation of listed companies, which should be able to choose the most appropriate general meeting model at any given time, depending on the circumstances and the interests present in their shareholder base.</p>
<p>The proposals for improving Spanish regulations and bringing them into line with the main European countries discussed at the conference are in line with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bolsasymercados.es/docs/BME/docsSubidos/Estudios-Articulos/BME-Whitepaper.pdf">White Paper on the competitiveness of Spanish financial markets</a>, published by BME, which includes 56 specific proposals. It is a work that benefited from the contributions of some thirty entities and a large number of participants and players in the Spanish capital markets.</p>

<div> Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators, Active consumer participation, Retail energy sector, Decarbonisation enabling tools, Dynamic pricing<br />
<br />Summary: The webinar will address consumer participation in the energy market, decarbonisation tools, the need for flexibility, and dynamic pricing contracts. <div>
<p>The EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) and the Council of European Energy Regulators (CEER) will hold a webinar to present the main findings and recommendations of their&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsEAwcDAFBQAUwJBwcBHVYLBAIdCw4EUBpQA1ZSAAZUVgFTVQMdBVIFVQtVBFcdB18BBx0GDgEEGg1XA1UZAlYDD1UPUFlWBgBSRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2024 Market Monitoring Report</a>: Active consumer participation is key to driving the energy transition: how can it happen? (to be published on 30 September 2024).</p>
<p>The retail energy sector must contribute to decarbonisation goals, but barriers to demand response and distributed energy resources persist (see the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsEAVIIWQJcBkxdVFdQHVYPUwMdC1wHVBpWUQYDAVBTVFVVD1MdBVIFVQtVBFcdB18BBx0GDgEEGg1XA1UZAlYDD1UPUFlWBgBSRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ACER report on barriers to demand response</a>). This requires barriers to entry to be dismantled and supportive investment frameworks to be created to enable small, climate-compatible flexibility resources to participate in all electricity markets on an equal footing with traditional centralised sources of flexibility.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The event will focus on the changes needed to the retail energy sector to help achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">When &amp; where?</span></p>
<p>The webinar will be held on Monday, 7 October 2024, from 14:00 to 15:00 CEST (online).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why join the event?</span></p>
<p>The energy transition will not occur without power system flexibility and the active participation of energy consumers. However, do consumers have the adequate tools to actively participate in the market? Are they truly benefiting from recent low (and even negative) wholesale electricity prices?</p>
<p>As more Europeans move to electric vehicles and heat pumps, electricity consumption will rise driving the need for demand-side flexibility by consumers. In this event, ACER and CEER will address:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decarbonisation enabling tools, such as smart meters and dynamic price contracts that allow consumers to play their part in the clean energy transition.</li>
<li>The importance of flexibility at consumer level, the need for efficient grid use, and the urgency of accelerating the roll-out of smart meters. It is necessary to create incentives for consumers to actively adapt their consumption when needed and for storage to be operated dynamically.</li>
<li>How dynamic pricing and flexible contracts can empower consumers and drive a sustainable energy future. Traditional fixed/flat price contracts are insufficient; embedding flexibility and participation in the electricity market is essential.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<div> ING, Siobhan Walker, Energy team, UK, renewables<br />
<br />Summary: ING appoints Siobhan Walker to lead the Energy team in the UK, supporting renewable energy growth and tripling power generation lending target. <div>
<p>Leading global wholesale bank ING, is pleased to announce the appointment of Siobhan Walker, as Head of ING&rsquo;s Energy team in the UK.</p>
<p>In this newly-created role, Siobhan will be responsible for overseeing the growth of ING&rsquo;s commitment to the Energy sector in the UK, one of the main European markets which is pivotal to further driving ING&rsquo;s energy transition efforts.</p>
<p>ING has long been an active player in the UK Energy sector, advising and leading financing projects across all of ING&rsquo;s energy subsectors: renewables (solar, wind, batteries), hydrocarbons &amp; new energies (more recently also waste-to-hydrocarbons, carbon capture), and utilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Siobhan has more than 25 years experience, leading international teams across multiple countries, products and sectors including relationship management, corporate finance and financial sponsors.</p>
<p>Siobhan will report ultimately to&nbsp;<b>Michiel de Haan, Global Head of Energy Sector, at ING</b>&nbsp;who said:</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;The UK has long been a key market for our renewable energy activities and a hub for&nbsp;ING&rsquo;s Global Energy Sector expertise, anchored by our Energy Project Advisory team who advise on projects and financing constructs across the world.&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;With the appointment of Siobhan we will further step up our engagement with the UK Energy and Energy Investment Community.&rdquo;&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The decision to establish a dedicated Energy sector team in the UK, reflects the ambition to grow ING&rsquo;s UK Energy engagement substantially. It will further support the bank&rsquo;s strong commitment to renewables growth,&nbsp;advancing sustainable energy solutions and driving innovation within the Energy Sector.</p>
<p><b>Malgorzata Kolakowska, CEO UK and Middle East, ING,</b>&nbsp;said:</p>
<p><i>"We are delighted to have Siobhan leading our Energy Sector team - which will be instrumental in achieving pioneering advancements and delivering on our ambition to be a leader in financing the sustainable transition.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><b>Siobhan Walker, New UK Head of Energy at ING,</b>&nbsp;said:</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;ING is already one of the top 10 Banks financing Energy transition globally, the dynamism of the UK Energy Sector makes this a key growth opportunity for our specialist finance and advisory teams.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Siobhan&rsquo;s appointment aligns with ING&rsquo;s new objective of tripling its power generation lending target. This includes lending for wind, solar and batteries to 7.5 billion euros a year by 2025 (three times the 2.5 billion euros target announced in 2022). This is&nbsp;in line with the International Energy Agency (IEA) standard &ndash; they say a tripling of renewable energy capacity by 2030 will be needed to put the world on a 1.5C trajectory.</p>
<p>With more than 700 employees at ING in the UK and clients that include more than 60% of the FTSE 100, Siobhan&rsquo;s appointment will play a&nbsp;key role in driving ING&rsquo;s Commercial strategy and achieving ING&rsquo;s ambition to be recognised as the best European bank.</p>

<title>ICE’s Global Natural Gas Markets Reach Record Liquidity</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ices-global-natural-gas-markets-reach-record-liquidity/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ices-global-natural-gas-markets-reach-record-liquidity/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Liquidity, Natural gas futures, Record open interest, Global platform, Energy derivatives<br />
Summary:<br />
ICE's global natural gas futures markets reached record open interest, with strong figures in U.S. Financial Gas and TTF futures. The platform supports efficient price risk management. <div>
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced record liquidity across its global natural gas futures markets including record open interest (OI) in U.S. Financial Gas futures and options markets and record OI in TTF futures.</p>
<p>On August 27, 2024, ICE&rsquo;s global natural gas futures markets reached record OI of 22.4 million contracts, up 15% year-over-year (y/y). In North America, ICE&rsquo;s U.S. Financial Gas futures and options markets hit a series of OI records in August and September including a record 11.7 million contracts on September 3, 2024, up 13% y/y. ICE&rsquo;s U.S. Financial Gas markets cover 70 hubs across North America allowing customers to manage regional supply and demand dynamics. Henry Hub markets, the U.S. natural gas benchmark, continues to see strong OI figures, up 26% y/y.</p>
<p>ICE TTF futures reached a series of OI records throughout August, including record OI of 2.1 million on August 29, 2024, up 53% y/y. TTF futures for Calendar year 2033 traded for the first time in August, meaning liquidity stretches out to 2033 in line with the U.S. benchmark Henry Hub, providing customers with the most liquid contracts globally to manage longer term exposure to natural gas prices. TTF options continue to see strong activity with OI at 2.2 million contracts, up 86% y/y.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The increasing interconnectedness of natural gas around the globe, driven by the liberalization of LNG, has implications for natural gas trade, pricing and the way market participants think about risk. With this in mind, ICE has worked for over two decades to create a global platform for natural gas trading that supports globalization of the fuel,&rdquo; said Trabue Bland, SVP, Futures Markets at ICE. &ldquo;ICE has built the broadest and most liquid range of natural gas benchmarks for customers globally that are integral to efficient price risk management as supply and demand dynamics evolve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to Henry Hub and TTF, ICE is home to the Canadian natural gas benchmark AECO, ICE&rsquo;s U.K. natural gas benchmark NBP, and ICE JKM LNG (Platts), the benchmark price for natural gas for North-East Asia. ICE&rsquo;s global natural gas portfolio is one part of its global energy markets which are the most liquid in the world to trade energy derivatives, with OI up 23% y/y at 59.2 million contracts.</p>

Summary:
Global equity markets show resilience, with a turnaround from early turmoil. The FTSE Mondo Visione Exchange Index reached a new high. Leading exchanges and standout performers noted. Herbie Skeete comments on the competitive landscape. The index tracks 33 publicly listed exchanges and trading floors.  <div>
<p>Global equity markets have shown remarkable resilience in a dramatic turnaround from early August's market turmoil. Initially shaken by U.S. recession fears and the unwinding of significant Japanese yen carry trades, investors worldwide quickly adopted a risk-off stance. However, by the end of the month, most market losses were recouped, demonstrating the inherent robustness of global exchanges.</p>
<p>The FTSE Mondo Visione Exchange Index closed at an unprecedented 79,764.95 points, marking a robust 8.2% increase from July's 73,726.02 points and setting a new all-time high for the index. This rally underscores renewed investor confidence and market adaptability in a fluctuating economic environment.</p>
<p>Leading the charge, the top five exchanges by market capitalisation at August's close include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intercontinental Exchange: USD92.64 billion</li>
<li>CME Group: USD77.67 billion</li>
<li>London Stock Exchange Group: USD72.15 billion</li>
<li>Deutsche Boerse: USD41.57 billion</li>
<li>Nasdaq: USD41.47 billion</li>
</ul>
<p>Highlighting the month's standout performers, the Multi Commodity Exchange of India recorded a stunning 20.6% increase in share price, with NZX and Brazil's B3 following closely at 17.9% and 16.6%, respectively. Conversely, Croatia's Zagrebacka Burza dd faced a 21.1% decline, alongside significant decreases in the U.K.'s Aquis Exchange (19.2%) and Kenya's Nairobi Securities Exchange (5.8%).</p>
<p>Herbie Skeete, Managing Director of Mondo Visione and Co-founder of the Index commented: "The Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) is solidifying its lead over the CME Group in our global exchange rankings, consistently capturing market share from CME's energy futures platform. Despite CME's strong annual profit growth in recent years, projected earnings suggest a slowdown, with anticipated interest rate cuts posing further challenges."</p>
<p>"In this competitive landscape, the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) remains a formidable presence, just behind CME Group in our ranking, prompting speculation about whether a merger of equals is on the cards".</p>

<div> London Stock Exchange, capital markets, government vision, reform, economic growth
Summary:
Government emphasizes importance of capital markets for economic growth. Plans for reforms and collaboration with industry initiatives to revitalize capital markets. <div>
<p><span>Launching the Capital Markets Industry Taskforce conference, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury set out the government&rsquo;s vision for the future of UK capital markets.</span></p>

<div class="gem-c-govspeak govuk-govspeak direction-ltr">
<div class="govspeak">
<p>Good morning and thanks for the invitation. It&rsquo;s so lovely to be here today, and it&rsquo;s one of my first addresses in my new role as City minister.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a very deliberate decision that I&rsquo;ve taken, because growth is the defining mission of this government, which you&rsquo;ve probably heard us say over and over again. From the top down to the centre out, we recognise the importance of capital markets to delivering this growth mission that we&rsquo;ve consistently talked about for the last few years. And As the Chancellor herself said &ndash; many of you will have heard at Barclays CEO forum recently &ndash; &ldquo;when the City succeeds, Britain succeeds&rdquo;. Nothing demonstrates that better than our capital markets.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just that when our markets do well, our economy does well. Already this year, more than &pound;20 billion worth of equity capital has been raised in London alone, more than three times what has been raised in the next three European exchanges combined &ndash; to support businesses to invest, to innovate and to grow.</p>
<p>And according to a New Financial report from 2020, 90% of large UK companies regularly use capital markets, supporting some 5.5 million jobs. It&rsquo;s not just large companies which benefit from our markets. Over the last five years combined, more than half of all capital raised in European growth markets was raised in London. And although these facts speak for themselves, I&rsquo;ll spell out what they say: that UK capital markets will underpin our mission of sustained and meaningful economic growth.</p>
<p>But I also know that for our capital markets, stability and just the right amount of risk is the formula for economic growth. Whilst too much political change can unbalance that formula by moderating the market&rsquo;s ability to signal opportunities for profit and risks of loss.</p>
<p>So let me be clear to everyone who has raised this with me. We will not pursue change for its own sake. The economist Adam Smith once wrote about an invisible hand, a metaphor for the forces that guide decision-making in the market. Well, I want you to be in no doubt &ndash; because in the marketplace of ideas, evidence will be the hand that guides our decision making in policy making generally and capital markets policy specifically. You can describe our approach to the existing program of capital markets reform with this timeless saying, which is &lsquo;if it ain&rsquo;t broke, don&rsquo;t fix it&rsquo;. I hope that reassures some of the people who&rsquo;ve raised this with me about continuity.</p>
<p>And while reviewing the existing plans for reform to a capital markets there&rsquo;s three things that I was struck by. Firstly, the proposals are technically rigorous. Secondly, they have the support of our financial services industry and its regulators. But lastly, and this is most importantly, I know they will support our mission of sustained and meaningful economic growth. And so I, and this government, will support them.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll begin that support by highlighting some of the most exciting policy initiatives. Some of which Julia and I were discussing when we came in. For example, the FCA&rsquo;s changes to our listing rules will revolutionise our markets. By making changes to rules on dual-class share structures, related party transactions and introducing a new international secondary listing category, we will directly align our markets with leading international counterparts and provide greater flexibility to firms and founders raising capital.</p>
<p>The impact of some of these changes are already being felt, and I&rsquo;m delighted that some firms are already taking advantage of them.</p>
<p>The government will also continue to collaborate with a number of industry driven initiatives. Working closely with our Industry Technical group led by Andrew Douglas, and building momentum towards faster settlement of securities trades. And I look forward to the final report of the Task Force led by Sir Douglas Flint on improving the current system of share ownership and eliminating the use of paper share certificates.</p>
<p>And we remain fully committed, as I just said before we came on, to take forward the new Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System &ndash; or PISCES &ndash; a world-first bespoke regulated market for private company shares. This will help investors to invest in exciting private companies and support innovative companies to grow - and ultimately to an IPO.</p>
<p>To my mind, government works best when it&rsquo;s underpinned by honest and open conversation. And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s very important to me to thoroughly examine the feedback from the consultation earlier this year, and to ensure that all of your opinions are properly reflected in our decision-making process.</p>
<p>And while it&rsquo;s clear to me that there is huge support for the PISCES project, it is also clear that on the issues of disclosure and market abuse we need to tailor our thinking further. So please be assured that my officials and I will continue working with you. And in that spirit, my officials will be in attendance at the roundtable on PISCES later today, and I&rsquo;ll ensure that all the conclusions from this roundtable are considered in our final proposal to ensure that PISCES does deliver on its promise.</p>
<p>But I know that we can go even further to restore competitiveness to our capital markets.</p>
<p>And of course, a lot of you will be looking forward to the Mansion House speech and the Budget later on, which will set out the plans for our sector in more detail. But I would urge you, if you haven&rsquo;t already, to look at the report &ldquo;Financing Growth&rdquo; &ndash; that I published earlier this year &ndash; which unapologetically puts really reinvigorating our capital markets at the heart of this government&rsquo;s growth mission. It&rsquo;s what we campaigned on, and it&rsquo;s what we intend to deliver in government.</p>
<p>They include proposals to encourage the investment of capital freed by Solvency II reforms into UK infrastructure and green industries. To empower the British Business Bank with a more ambitious remit, for example, providing match funding to spin out seed funds. And a landmark review of the UK&rsquo;s pensions and retirement saving landscape to explicitly consider the role of pension funds in capital and financial markets to boost both their returns and broader economic growth.</p>
<p>Confirming this review was one of the first announcements made by the Chancellor, and this phase will be led by my colleague Emma Reynolds, who is the Minister for Pensions. She will be speaking here later today. And I encourage you to join this, which is the session on the UK pensions landscape, because Emma will outline the exciting plans that we&rsquo;ve undertaken as a government.</p>
<p>So, I do recognise that these proposals are challenging. I&rsquo;m not naive about it.</p>
<p>But I am confident looking around this room today and seeing the expertise here, that if we work together, we will be delivering this, because sustained and meaningful economic growth is not just the government&rsquo;s mission, it&rsquo;s a mission that we share with everyone in this room.</p>
<p>So now let&rsquo;s go out and deliver it.</p>

<title>ASIC Warns Consumers Of Suspicious Investment Opportunities In Digital Gold Vaults</title>

ASIC warns about unlicensed entities promoting digital gold vault investments with promises of passive income through recruitment and referral on social media.<br /><br />Summary: ASIC warns about unlicensed entities promoting suspicious investment opportunities in digital gold vaults by luring consumers with promises of passive income and using social media for recruitment and referral. <div>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul>
<li>ASIC is alerting consumers about suspicious investment opportunities in digital gold vaults by unlicensed financial services entities.</li>
<li>Unlicensed entities are luring consumers with the promise of payment for recruitment and referral.</li>
<li>They use online articles and social media posts and groups, such as Instagram and Facebook, to provide details about the opportunities, targeting the consumer&rsquo;s network of family and friends.</li>
</ul>
<p>ASIC is aware of unlicensed entities promoting suspicious investment opportunities in digital gold vaults. These unlicensed entities are luring consumers by purporting to offer passive income and other benefits, such as payments, in return for recruiting or referring new investors.</p>
<p>The entities target trusted relationship-based networks, such as families and friends, and use online articles and social media posts and groups, such as Instagram and Facebook to provide details about the investment.</p>
<p>Consumers invest by obtaining the rights to use a digital gold vault with a certain storage capacity and for a specified period of time.</p>
<p>Other investors will then use the digital vault to store their virtual gold, and this allegedly generates a passive return for the initial consumer.</p>
<p>Consumers who invest normally have limited avenue for recourse in the event of a dispute as these entities are based overseas. The terms and conditions may also make it difficult to resolve any dispute.</p>
<p>ASIC is concerned because:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is an emerging trend in unlicensed entities promoting suspicious investment opportunities in digital gold vaults.</li>
<li>When investing in digital or virtual gold a consumer will commonly purchase tokens or units which are marketed as one-for-one by real gold bullion securely stored in professional vaults. Some digital gold token offerings are recorded on the blockchain and are held in a digital wallet, which can then be sold on an exchange.&nbsp; Alternatively, some digital gold offerings can be listed on securities exchanges such as the ASX, as exchange traded products (ETPs).</li>
<li>Depending on the structure, the investments in digital gold vaults may be a &lsquo;financial product&rsquo; under the&nbsp;<em>Corporations Act 2001</em>&nbsp;and entities offering these investments may require an Australian financial services (AFS) licence or authorisation pursuant to an AFS licence. Also depending on the structure, the investments may constitute a 'managed investment scheme' which may require registration under the&nbsp;<em>Corporations Act 2001</em>.</li>
<li>It can be difficult to verify whether the digital gold vaults in fact exist because the entities offering the vaults are typically based overseas. It is possible that the passive returns generated may actually be funds from new investors, resulting in some schemes potentially being ponzi schemes.</li>
<li>Some of these entities may also offer debit card products that allow consumers to withdraw cash and make purchases globally. These products may constitute a non-cash payment facility which is a &lsquo;financial product&rsquo; under the Corporations Act 2001. Issuers of financial products in Australia must generally hold an AFS licence.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you spot any suspicious investment opportunity by an unlicensed entity, please&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/contact-us/reporting-misconduct-to-asic/" title="Reporting misconduct to ASIC">report this to ASIC</a>.</p>
<p><strong>ASIC is Australia&rsquo;s corporate, markets and financial services regulator.</strong></p>

<div> Thematic review, Ethical investment, FMA, Disclosure, Guidance
<br />
The FMA has published insights from its supervision of funds with ethical features, identifying areas for improvement and planning to update guidance.
<br /><br />Summary: 
FMA published insights from its supervision of funds with ethical features, identifies areas for improvement, and plans to update guidance. <div>
<p>The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; has today published insights from its supervision of funds that claim to have ethical features. The insights are based off findings from reviewing disclosure documents, advertising, reporting on sustainability progress, and whether investments held by funds align with their sector exclusion policies.</p>
<p>The insights follow the FMA&rsquo;s 2022 thematic review of how managed investment scheme (MIS) managers had applied the FMA&rsquo;s disclosure framework for integrated financial products guidance issued in 2020. Ethical investment claims must comply with the fair dealing provisions in Part 2 of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013.</p>
<p>The FMA did not identify any situation where an issuer deliberately used ethical labelling or marketing without intending to implement an ethical investment strategy. It did see examples of confusing, unclear and inconsistent disclosure that may have made it difficult for investors to understand the product or whether ethical claims were being adhered to. The FMA provided feedback to all 10 MIS managers reviewed on areas for improvement, and the insights publication notes good practices for other issuers to consider.</p>
<p>FMA Executive Director of Response and Enforcement, Louise Unger, said: &ldquo;FMA research has shown that investors don&rsquo;t always investigate the underlying details of funds, and understandably place a lot of trust in issuers to deliver the advertised benefits of ethical investment products. It is therefore important for the FMA to maintain oversight of ethical investing disclosure, and this is now part of our business as usual supervision approach.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Next steps</h3>
<p>The FMA will engage with the market about how to best update its 2020 guidance. This will be a longer-term project, where we will seek views and insights from across the financial sector before drafting any proposed guidance.</p>
<p>We want to encourage issuers to provide clear, concise, and effective disclosure when they incorporate values-based or ethical factors into their financial products, which means including all material information and ensuring they avoid being misleading or deceptive. We also want investors to be able to rely on the claims made by issuers and make well-informed decisions about these issues.</p>
<p>The FMA welcomes engagement from anyone who wishes to share their views about what guidance on ethical investing should address. If you wish to indicate your interest and/or share your views on what FMA ethical investing guidance should include please email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:consultation@fma.govt.nz?subject=Ethical%20Disclosure%20Guidance">consultation@fma.govt.nz</a>&nbsp;with the subject line &ldquo;Ethical Disclosure Guidance.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Dissenting Statement Of CFTC Commissioner Caroline D. Pham On Request For Authority To Appeal From Court Order In Kalshi Matter</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span><span><span><span>Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Commissioner Caroline D. Pham issued the following statement on the Commission&rsquo;s vote on Monday to authorize the CFTC to appeal the September 6, 2024 order by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia regarding KalshiEX LLC:</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>&ldquo;From a procedural standpoint, the Commission has once again taken a &lsquo;ready, shoot, aim&rsquo; approach to the Commission&rsquo;s deliberations. I respectfully dissent because the Commission has been asked to grant a blank-check authorization to appeal from the U.S. District Court&rsquo;s order without sufficient information. To be clear, I do not have an issue with the CFTC potentially exercising our right to appeal. Rather, I continue to be concerned that the Commission is constantly rushed to vote before thinking it through. As I&rsquo;ve said before, bad process begets bad outcomes.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>&ldquo;If the Commission stated to the Court that it was unable to make an informed decision whether to appeal without the Court&rsquo;s opinion, how was the Commission all of a sudden able to decide on Monday to authorize an appeal? The Commission&rsquo;s actions do not match up with our words.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement091024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>&ldquo;Moreover, such a vote by the Commission was premature and should not have gone forward yet because the CFTC was, in fact, granted a 3-day administrative stay by the Court and a hearing is scheduled for Thursday, September 12. The Commission should see what happens first and respect the legal process before it takes a knee-jerk reaction to delegate its authority without all the facts.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></p>

<title>SEC Charges John Deere With FCPA Violations For Subsidiary’s Role In Thai Bribery Scheme - Company Falsely Recorded Payments As Legitimate Expenses</title>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Deere &amp; Company, which does business as John Deere, agreed to pay nearly $10 million to resolve SEC charges that it violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) arising out of bribes paid by its wholly owned subsidiary, Wirtgen Thailand. The company is an Illinois-based global manufacturer of agricultural machinery and heavy equipment.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that, from at least late 2017 through 2020, Wirtgen Thailand employees bribed Thai government officials with the Royal Thai Air Force, the Department of Highways, and the Department of Rural Roads to win multiple government contracts and also bribed employees of a private company to win sales to that company. The order finds that the bribes included cash payments, massage parlor visits, and international travel for the government officials and private company employees. According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, Wirtgen Thailand made approximately $4.3 million in profits as a result of these bribes. The improper payments were inaccurately recorded as legitimate expenses in Deere&rsquo;s books and records.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After acquiring Wirtgen Thailand in 2017, Deere failed to timely integrate it into its existing compliance and controls environment, resulting in these bribery schemes going unchecked for several years,&rdquo; said Charles E. Cain, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division&rsquo;s FCPA Unit. &ldquo;This action is a reminder for corporations to promptly ensure newly acquired subsidiaries have all the necessary internal accounting control processes in place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order found that Deere violated the recordkeeping and internal accounting controls provisions of the FCPA. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, Deere consented to the entry of the SEC&rsquo;s order requiring it to cease and desist from further violations and to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling approximately $5.4 million and a civil penalty of $4.5 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Michelle Ramos, Denise Hansberry, Sonali Singh, and Tracy L. Price of the SEC&rsquo;s FCPA Unit.</p>

<title>Not So Fast: Statement On In the Matter Of Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, Sept. 10, 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Is a car company&rsquo;s claim&mdash;proven by company speed tests&mdash;that its top-of-the-line sports car can go from 0-60 MPH in 2.9 seconds misleading if the company knows that its more conservative drivers do not press the pedal to the metal? The Commission&rsquo;s settlement with Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (&ldquo;Keurig&rdquo;) would suggest that it is. The Commission&rsquo;s Order finds that Keurig violated Exchange Act Section 13(a) and its accompanying Rule 13a-1, which require issuers to file complete and accurate annual reports, for making an analogous claim.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-keurig-091024#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;The disclosure standard embodied in this settlement may have the positive effect of dissuading companies from talking about immaterial items in their SEC filings, but it also will expose companies to endless second-guessing by the Commission unless they pad any statements they do make with a mountain of caveats. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>
<p>Keurig&rsquo;s purported violation of the Exchange Act hinges on what it means for an item to be &ldquo;effectively recyclable.&rdquo; In 2014, Keurig set a sustainability goal of making 100% of its pods recyclable by 2020. To that end, Keurig researched options and &ldquo;determined that pods made of polypropylene number 5 plastic (&lsquo;PP5&rsquo;), sold in packaging with certain specific consumer recycling instructions, would achieve this goal.&rdquo; By the end of 2020, all the pods Keurig manufactured for sale in the United States and Canada were made of the recyclable material. Additionally, Keurig performed tests using tracking chips and radio frequency identification readers to track the pods through the recycling process. These tests showed that &ldquo;pods typically could be successfully sorted from other materials to make it to a stage of the recycling process from which items have the potential to be sorted into groups of various materials for purchase by parties who might further process the materials for their potential reuse.&rdquo; Notwithstanding the testing results, two recycling companies involved in the testing &ldquo;conveyed significant negative feedback to Keurig regarding the commercial feasibility&rdquo; of recycling the pods. Both companies &ldquo;indicated to Keurig that they did not presently intend to accept pods&rdquo; for recycling, and one company explained that &ldquo;there is simply not a sufficient benefit for small format materials, and/or hard-to-recycle materials&mdash;including K-Cups pods&mdash;to make the financial case for inclusion as part of curbside recycling programs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After receiving the testing results and the negative feedback from two recycling companies, Keurig stated in its Form 10-K in 2019 and 2020 that the pods &ldquo;can be effectively recycled&rdquo; (&para;12-13). Specifically, in the &ldquo;Corporate Responsibility&rdquo; section under the heading &ldquo;Sustainable Packing&rdquo;, Keurig&rsquo;s 2019 10-K stated:</p>
<p>We are on track to make allK-Cup pods sold in theU.S.recyclable by the end of 2020, having converted allK-Cup pods sold in Canada to a recyclable format in 2018. The new pods are made of polypropylene #5 plastic, a material that is accepted curbside for recycling by many communities, and we have conducted extensive testing with municipal recycling facilities to validate that they can be effectively recycled.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-keurig-091024#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Similarly, in the same section, under the same heading, Keurig&rsquo;s 2020 10-K stated:</p>
<p>In December 2020, we achieved our goal of making all K-Cup pods sold in the U.S. recyclable by the end of 2020, having converted all K-Cup pods sold in Canada to a recyclable format in 2018. The new pods are made of polypropylene #5 plastic, a material that is accepted curbside for recycling by many communities, and we have conducted extensive testing with municipal recycling facilities to validate that they can be effectively recycled. We continue to engage with municipalities and recycling facilities to advance the quantity and quality of recycled polypropylene and have committed $10 million toward the advancement of polypropylene recycling in the U.S. through the Polypropylene Recycling Coalition, an effort led by The Recycling Partnership and funded by leading brands, recyclers, converters and producers of polypropylene.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-keurig-091024#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>The Commission concludes that the statements &ldquo;that [Keurig&rsquo;s] recyclability testing had validated that pods could be &ldquo;effectively recycled&rdquo; were incomplete and inaccurate because they did not also disclose the negative feedback from recycling companies involved in the testing concerning the recyclability of pods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Commission both misreads Keurig&rsquo;s statement and overreacts to its own misreading. The pods were recyclable: Keurig chose a type of plastic that was recyclable and ran tests to show that the pods could be recycled. That claim all Keurig&rsquo;s statements reasonably should be read to say. Branding Keurig&rsquo;s Forms 10-K as incomplete or inaccurate because Keurig did not also disclose that two recycling companies &ldquo;did not presently intend to accept pods&rdquo; for &ldquo;commercial feasibility&rdquo; reasons misreads Keurig&rsquo;s statement that the pods&nbsp;<i>could</i>&nbsp;be recycled as an implicit assertion that the pods&nbsp;<i>would</i>&nbsp;be recycled. This reading, however, places far too much weight on the word &ldquo;effectively.&rdquo; In the Commission&rsquo;s view, the pods cannot be &ldquo;effectively&rdquo; recycled because two recycling companies were uninclined to accept them for curbside recycling. But would the Commission also have determined that the pods could not be &ldquo;effectively&rdquo; recycled if all recycling companies accepted them, but most consumers simply threw them in the trash bin because it was easier? In both cases&mdash;the recycling company seeking profits and the consumers seeking convenience&mdash;the pods could be effectively recycled, but intervening decisions by a third-party meant that it was probable that they would not be recycled. The former fact is not rendered false or misleading by the latter consequence of the intervening decision.</p>
<p>In any event, even if one were to accept the Commission&rsquo;s misreading of Keurig&rsquo;s statements, the Order nowhere states that they were material. The closest the Order comes to addressing materiality is a statement that &ldquo;sales of pods comprised a significant percentage of net sales of Keurig&rsquo;s coffee systems business segment&rdquo; in 2019, which appears in the same paragraph with the statement that &ldquo;[c]onsumer research conducted by Keurig Green Mountain in 2016 indicated that, for certain consumers, environmental concerns were a significant factor, among others, considered when deciding whether to purchase a Keurig brewing system.&rdquo; At most, these statements might be read to suggest that pod sales were a material portion of Keurig&rsquo;s revenue in 2019. But &ldquo;consumer research&rdquo; indicating that &ldquo;certain consumers&rdquo; identified &ldquo;environmental concerns&rdquo; as one factor &ldquo;among others . . . when deciding whether to purchase a Keurig brewing system&rdquo; in 2016 may or may not offer useful insight into what factors are significant to consumers in 2019. Moreover, the Order&rsquo;s description of the 2016 consumer research does not even show that recyclability was a material consideration for investors in 2016, let alone 2019. That some&nbsp;<i>consumers</i>&nbsp;thought, among other factors, about environmental factors does not mean that the recyclability of pods was material to&nbsp;<i>investors</i>.</p>
<p>Rarely does the Commission bring standalone Section 13(a) and Rule 13a-1 charges. Telling to me is the absence of other charges&mdash;such as charges under Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, Securities Act Section 17(a), or even under Exchange Act Rule 12b-20, which requires issuers to add to their statements or reports such further material information, if any, as may be necessary to make the required statements, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. I do not believe that Keurig&rsquo;s recyclability statements support such charges because I do not think that they are false or misleading, which means there is no basis for Section 13(a) and Rule 13a-1 charges either. The Commission&rsquo;s pedantic parsing of Keurig&rsquo;s recyclability statements and its $1.5 million penalty do little to disguise the weakness of this case. On the bright side, next time you get pulled over for speeding, you will have an excuse: &ldquo;I am doing it to keep my car company&rsquo;s 10-K from being misleading.&rdquo;</p>

<div> Transparency, Volatility, Stress testing, Capital requirements, Fairness
Summary:<br /><br />The speaker addresses the recent stress test results, emphasizing its value but raising concerns about its lack of fairness, transparency, and its compliance timeframe. She suggests a path forward with proposals for improvement. <div>
<p>Thank you for the invitation to join you.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240910a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;Given the recent conclusion of the Board's stress test, it seems timely to share my thoughts on the stress testing program. In the past, I have noted reservations about the stress testing process, so today I'd like to discuss in greater detail the benefits, challenges, and issues I would like to see resolved as the stress testing program evolves in the future.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240910a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a></p>
<p>Earlier this summer, the Board announced the results of the supervisory stress tests. At a high level, all 31 banks subject to the test remained above their minimum common equity tier one (CET1) capital requirements from the hypothetical recession scenario.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240910a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;Under this scenario, banks would have absorbed projected hypothetical losses of nearly $685 billion, and would have experienced an aggregate CET1 capital decline of 2.8 percent.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240910a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;The hypothetical scenario included a 40 percent decline in commercial real estate prices, a substantial increase in office vacancies, a 36 percent decline in house prices, a spike in unemployment to a peak of 10 percent, and related declines in economic output.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240910a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;This year also saw the introduction of "exploratory" stress scenarios, which included two different funding stress scenarios, and for a subset of banks, included two trading book loss scenarios.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240910a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;The Board's press release announcing the results reported that large banks are well positioned to weather a severe recession and remain above minimum capital requirements.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240910a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a></p>
<p>More recently, the Fed announced the final individual capital requirements for all large banks, effective on October 1, 2024.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240910a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;The firm-specific capital requirements are "informed by" the stress test results, and include a 4.5 percent minimum capital requirement, a stress capital buffer that is set at a minimum of 2.5 percent, and if applicable, a capital surcharge for the most complex banks that is based on each firm's systemic risk.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240910a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;The announcement of this year's results also noted the modification of the stress capital buffer for a single firm based on a reconsideration request. While firms subject to the stress test have long had the ability to request reconsideration&mdash;and many have done so in the past&mdash;this was notable as it was the first time that a reconsideration request was successful in producing a change to a firm's stress capital buffer.</p>
<p>As we conclude this most recent cycle of stress testing&mdash;and as many firms begin to turn to the next round&mdash;I think it is helpful to pause and consider whether and how the process could be improved. My remarks today will address the value of stress testing on bank safety and soundness and on financial stability, my concerns about the current implementation of the stress test, and finally what I see as a potential path forward. I hope this discussion leads to a broader consideration of stress testing, its role in the current prudential framework as a supervisory tool, and as a mechanism to set large bank capital standards through the stress capital buffer.</p>
<p><strong>The Value of Stress Testing</strong><br />Let me start by emphasizing that my remarks today should not be interpreted as a wholesale criticism of the stress testing process and framework. I firmly believe that stress testing is and will remain a valuable mechanism that provides insights that can inform supervision and can inform the public about how the largest and most complex banks would fare under a severe stress scenario. This exercise helps us gauge a bank's capital position and determine whether it has sufficient capital to absorb losses and continue lending during an economic stress event.</p>
<p>In practice, stress testing provides a very granular assessment of a firm's risk, one that is more refined and risk-sensitive than capital standards alone. It relies on detailed balance sheet information&mdash;fixed at a particular date in the past&mdash;to do a deeper analysis of the firm's financial condition at that point in time. By subjecting this balance sheet to a hypothetical shock, we develop a better sense of not only the firm's risk, but also the firm's capacity to respond and adapt to changing economic conditions. This type of analysis would be impractical to conduct on a continuous basis, but it is a useful periodic supplement to ongoing capital requirements and can be used to support more robust supervisory practices.</p>
<p><strong>The Need for Reform</strong><br />While there are many virtues of stress testing, as currently implemented and executed there are several significant drawbacks. These drawbacks arguably make the process less fair, transparent, and useful than it could and should be.</p>
<p>I have long supported and argued in favor of fairness and transparency in the bank regulatory framework.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240910a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;The rules and supervisory practices that comprise this framework should be consistent among firms, and consistent over time. Banks should have a clear understanding of these rules to allow them to make informed business decisions that consider the impact of the regulatory framework. But we also know that the diversity and variability of bank business models can present a challenge to the clarity of the framework. Clarity is needed both to promote equitable treatment among banks with different business models, and to create rules that are fair over time. This allows firms to anticipate regulatory expectations as their business activities and balance sheets evolve in response to, among other things, changing economic conditions. Each bank is unique, and one need look no further than the balance sheets, business activities, and risk profiles of large banks to observe this variability. But the onus is on regulators to ensure that over time, regulations and supervisory practices are applied fairly and consistently, and that evolution in the framework is accompanied by appropriate transparency for regulated entities.</p>
<p>The challenge of creating rules that are fair and transparent is nowhere more notable than in stress testing. Stress testing serves an important role in our regulatory framework, but one that requires evolution to ensure relevancy and effectiveness. To date, the evolution of stress testing has focused on refining the tests to be more robust over time and to provide more granular risk information about these banks. While these incremental improvements have been helpful, the task of addressing identified problems is equally important.</p>
<p>To be clear, these problems extend beyond model accuracy and consistency across firms. While by no means a comprehensive list, I would like to address four of my concerns in particular: (1) volatility in firm results from year to year, (2) the challenge of linking stress testing outcomes with capital through the stress capital buffer, (3) the broad lack of transparency, and (4) the overlap with other capital requirements like the overlap between the global market shock in stress testing and the market risk rule under the Basel III endgame proposal.</p>
<p><strong>Volatility</strong><br />One area of particular concern is the year-over-year volatility in stress testing results. Many of the stress test design features are intended to promote consistency across firms&mdash;the exercise uses a common scenario design, and subjects similarly situated firms to stress testing at the same frequency. This format allows for comparisons across firms and can provide important supervisory insights as regulators can look across firms to find common risk factors that could affect multiple firms&mdash;and lead to more significant and widespread economic impacts&mdash;in a stress event. But we have seen that stress test results for several firms vary considerably from year to year based on the interaction of the specific scenario being tested with a firm's business model, changes to the model, and each firm's balance sheet. This variability then flows through to the stress capital buffers that apply to the largest firms.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240910a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a></p>
<p>Some variability is to be expected as the risk factors and balance sheet composition of the tested firms both change over time. However, the test results observed year over year often produce results that are not predictable in advance&mdash;for example, some of the volatility we see is not based on fundamental changes to a tested bank's business model.</p>
<p>The link between stress testing and capital also creates a practical timing issue for firms. The time frame for compliance with stress capital buffers compounds the issue of excessive year-over-year volatility. While many capital requirements give firms a runway to comply and adjust capital planning projections going forward, stress capital buffers allow a very brief window of time for firms to comply.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240910a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a>&nbsp;As a real-time example, this year's preliminary stress capital buffer requirements were announced in late June, with required compliance by October 1st.</p>
<p>This concern is experienced differently across firms&mdash;for example, some firms can likely predict that they will be subject to the stress capital buffer "floor," which perhaps can help with longer-term capital planning. But for those firms whose stress capital buffers exceed the floor, this short turnaround can pose significant planning challenges. Although banks historically have not been required to raise capital to meet higher stress capital buffer results, volatility is not a nonissue. As a matter of practice, banks maintain management buffers&mdash;additional capital in excess of capital and regulatory buffer requirements&mdash;to ensure that they operate at levels significantly above the "well-capitalized" threshold. Unexpectedly steep increases in stress capital buffers may force firms to recalibrate or reconsider their management buffer, perhaps operating at a higher level than would otherwise be necessary to account for known volatility in stress capital buffers over time.</p>
<p>This variability is not without cost. Firms engage in capital planning over a long-term planning horizon. Significant variability can disrupt these practices and require firms to hold more capital and higher capital management buffers than prudent business practices would indicate.</p>
<p><strong>The link between stress testing and capital&mdash;the stress capital buffer</strong><br />As currently implemented, the stress test exercise presents a single hypothetical shock to a firm's balance sheet, with the goal of better understanding firm performance and risks in the face of this stress. But the test is not intended to be&mdash;nor is it in practice&mdash;<em>predictive&nbsp;</em>of an actual stress event that the firm would experience. During the banking stress of 2023, the key risk factor was rapidly rising interest rates, and yet this type of economic stressor was not included in any past iteration of the test design.</p>
<p>Why do we select one scenario and use that hypothetical to establish binding capital requirements for many firms regardless of their business model? What incentives does this system create as regulators design scenarios?</p>
<p>Unquestionably, stress testing can provide valuable insights to inform supervision. Testing multiple stress scenarios could provide additional information that could be used to probe the unique risks and resilience of particular firms. And it could provide regulators and the public with a clearer understanding of financial stability risks across firms under different plausible future states of the world.</p>
<p>But a more robust use of stress testing would require rationalizing the link between stress testing and capital to ensure that any change in overall calibration was driven by an intentional process that results in a reasonable policy outcome. As a practical matter, testing additional scenarios raises the question of what consequences should flow from a multi-scenario testing regime. Would such an approach&nbsp;<em>require&nbsp;</em>across-the-board capital increases, as regulators calibrate stress capital buffers based on the most severe outcome of any tested scenario for each firm? Or should regulators pick a common scenario to calibrate stress capital buffers for all firms, even in a multi-scenario stress testing regime? Or should regulators take a different approach and sever the link between stress testing and capital requirements?</p>
<p>The link between stress testing and capital raises important policy questions about the optimal level of capital, but ultimately should not dissuade us from using stress testing to better understand firm-specific and broader financial stability risks. At the same time, we need to pay careful attention to the design of all capital requirements&mdash;including not just the stress capital buffer, but also other risk-based capital requirements, leverage requirements, and long-term debt requirements&mdash;to ensure that the overall calibration of these requirements is proportionate to risk. In my view, an up-calibration of capital requirements through an expanded scenario-testing regime would not be supportable based on the underlying risks.</p>
<p><strong>Transparency</strong><br />One persistent issue with the stress tests is the lack of public transparency around the models. This opacity frustrates bank capital management and allocation. When a bank engages in an activity or prices a product or service, as a sound business practice, they must anticipate the financial consequences and the accompanying risks. Before making any decisions, a bank will often try to project the anticipated costs and revenues. In addition, the bank will want to evaluate the projected growth of the business or activity over time, determine whether the activity complements other existing products and services, and decide whether there will be sufficient customer demand to justify the cost based on the contemplated pricing levels and margins. One important consideration in this exercise is the cost of capital. Banks often quantify the cost of capital and "allocate" those costs across various business lines.</p>
<p>The capital requirements and supervisory risk assessment of activities are important inputs for bank decision-making. Banks benefit when they understand the regulatory perception of their activities. That feedback is often a critical part of the supervisory process. A regulatory perspective is embedded in stress testing, through the common parameters, assumptions, and conditions that will be used in the exercises. But much of this work remains hidden from public scrutiny and from the financial institutions subject to the stress tests. Providing access to this information&mdash;making clear the regulatory perspective&mdash;by improving the transparency of the process would enable banks to better manage their business and make more informed decisions.</p>
<p>Of course, greater disclosure is not without its detractors. A common criticism of increased transparency is that disclosing the more granular parameters of particular calculations would lead to "gaming" of the test by large banks seeking to optimize their capital. The underlying premise of this concern seems to be that the stress tests are and must be static over time, and that if firms make changes to their activities that have no economic consequences&mdash;but instead are used only for "gaming" purposes to reduce stress losses&mdash;that regulators are limited in making further changes. I think this misinterprets the dynamism and review that should complement the stress testing process. Greater disclosure and transparency should be accompanied by a careful review of how firms incorporate and use any additional information, and to the extent that gaming activity is identified, further changes to the test design may be appropriate.</p>
<p>Another criticism is that by disclosing test results, all firms&mdash;including in their internal stress testing practices&mdash;will "converge" on a common standard and that this standard will in some way increase risk. For example, if firms' stress testing practices are uniform, but include some flawed assumption or parameter, this could create a systemic weakness. Put differently, the model "monoculture" caused by greater transparency could miss important systemic risks. We should ask whether more granular disclosures would override the informed risk assessments of banks in managing their business&mdash;would all firms simply adopt whatever the regulators are doing in the supervisory stress test, undermining the utility of other practices like internal stress tests? However, we should not think about stress testing in isolation&mdash;supervision informed by stress testing, and ongoing improvements to supervisory stress testing can operate as a backstop to address risks that may accompany more transparency.</p>
<p>I am concerned about changes that could undermine the utility of both regulatory and internal stress testing at large firms. Regulators should not seek to take risk-management decisions away from banks. But greater transparency, debate, and discussion of test parameters need not lead to a dilution of standards. These discussions could actually promote a cycle of continuous improvement and feedback. We have seen over time that the regulatory stress tests are not static. As regulators learn more, they adjust and adapt different elements of the exercise in light of lessons learned from the process.</p>
<p>The issues of transparency around the stress tests extend beyond just disclosure. The reconsideration process itself could be improved by developing a more transparent process and clearer standards against which reconsideration requests will be evaluated. While this year saw a positive development with the Board for the first time changing a firm's stress capital buffer requirement in response to a request for reconsideration, the high failure rate of such requests over time shows the need for rethinking and revisiting the process.</p>
<p><strong>Overlap with other capital requirements</strong><br />Finally, as I have noted in the past, we must ensure that each element of the capital framework operates in a complementary and not contradictory way, and that requirements are calibrated proportionate to risks. Failing to appropriately calibrate capital and risk requirements creates risks&mdash;incentivizing banks to curtail activities that are assigned a punitive capital treatment and devoting more resources to activities that are assigned an inappropriately low capital risk weighting. Over time, these dynamics can have real-world market and economic consequences, resulting in negative outcomes for customers and economic activity.</p>
<p>When we view capital requirements in their totality, one potential overlap can be found in the proposed changes to the market risk capital rules and operational risk rules with the "global market shock" and operational risk elements of the supervisory stress testing framework. We need to ensure that the risks captured and methodologies underpinning these distinct requirements do not lead to an over-calibration of capital requirements for activities that support the important role of U.S. capital markets in the global economy.</p>
<p><strong>The Path Forward</strong><br />As we look ahead to the future of stress testing, I think we need to carefully consider how the current framework can be improved. These issues&mdash;volatility, the link between stress testing results and capital and the short capital implementation compliance time frame, the lack of transparency, and the overlap between the global market shock in stress testing with the market risk test of Basel III&mdash;can all be addressed and should be prioritized in the ongoing evolution of the stress testing framework and stress capital buffer requirements. It is important that regulators consider the lessons learned from past tests and feedback from banks and other members of the public to ensure that stress testing is fair, transparent, and more useful going forward.</p>
<p>First, we need to address the excessive year-over-year volatility, which flows through to the calculation of stress capital buffers. As I noted, capital planning for many firms is a long-term enterprise, and excessive volatility and unpredictability of stress capital buffer levels can increase costs and complicate capital allocation and management. Of course, the goal is not to eliminate variability over time&mdash;variability based on changing economic conditions and changing firm business activities and balance sheets&mdash;but rather to blunt the excessive volatility observed over the history of stress testing.</p>
<p>There are many possible ways to limit excessive volatility while maintaining the value of the Board's stress tests. For example, one solution could be to average results over multiple years, so a firm's stress capital buffer would move in smaller increments through the averaging process. Another possibility is to constrain variability in annual stress test scenario design.</p>
<p>Countercyclicality in the design of the regulatory stress tests&mdash;where the stress experienced by firms is more severe when economic conditions are better&mdash;acts as a counterweight to the inherent procyclicality of risk models. This approach "eases" capital requirements (through lower stress capital buffers) as economic conditions decline. But this countercyclicality is also a driver of volatility, and we should look more closely as to whether our attempts to adjust for countercyclicality are appropriate through the lens of stress test volatility.</p>
<p>Second, I think there is a benefit to promoting greater transparency in stress testing, particularly as it relates to the disclosure of the underlying models. Stress testing need not be an exercise shrouded in secrecy, and the Federal Reserve has shown in the past that improvements are possible. For example, in 2019, the Board adopted new principles that guide the design of the stress tests, and promoted greater transparency.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240910a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a>&nbsp;In addition to these principles, the Board moved to provide more information about its stress testing models, including ranges of loss rates for actual loans held, portfolios of hypothetical loans with loss rates estimated by the Board's models, and more detailed descriptions of the Board's models (including some granular information about certain equations and variables used in the models).<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240910a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;While these were positive steps in promoting transparency, the announcement of design principles and enhanced disclosures did not go far enough in my view, and we have seen that even after several years, firms continue to struggle to understand and anticipate the results of supervisory stress tests and the accompanying stress capital buffer requirements.</p>
<p>The simple solution here seems to be disclosure of more granular information about all of the models used in stress testing. In my view, disclosure of these models&mdash;and even subjecting the models to appropriate notice and comment processes and public feedback&mdash;would not undermine the goal of the stress tests of having a regulator-created model that is separate and distinct from the internal models used by firms. Regulators would still control the contours and content of the models but would have the benefit of public feedback. If we believe in the validity and reasonableness of our model design choices, we should not shy away from public feedback.</p>
<p>Third, we should adjust the compliance framework for stress capital buffers. Firms should not be forced to comply with higher capital requirements after only a few months' notice but should have a reasonable time frame for compliance. I would note that a longer compliance runway is particularly important in a world in which testing is opaque and volatility continues to be excessive. To the extent that these more fundamental issues are addressed, this may mitigate the need for a shorter compliance window.</p>
<p>Finally, as we move forward with Basel III implementation, we need to take a careful look at whether market risk and operational risk requirements are overlapping and redundant with the "global market shock" and operational risk elements of stress testing and think about the calibration of these requirements in the aggregate. Would these tests in tandem produce excessively calibrated capital requirements, and if so, what would the impact be on U.S. capital markets? In my view, there are strong indications that as currently formulated, the combination of these requirements would result in an excessive calibration of risk-weighted assets for market making and trading activities. And of course, we must think broadly about the optimal level of capital in the banking system, taking into account the full range of risk-based and leverage capital requirements and long-term debt requirements.</p>
<p>There are many possible ways to move forward with stress testing, and the proposals I have offered above are merely a subset of possible changes that could improve the process and address many of the known deficiencies. But I believe there is a growing awareness of the need for a fundamental rethink and strategic reform of stress testing, and any such process must acknowledge and address these known issues within the framework.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240910a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a></p>
<p><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong><br />Thank you again for the invitation to join you today. The stress test is an important supervisory tool, and I think it is imperative that we work to continually improve it. I have laid out a number of my concerns about the current practice, and some potential areas to explore in terms of improvement. But I also think it is imperative to listen to a wide range of stakeholders about the path forward.</p>

From 2000&ndash;2024, six firms were subject to the stress capital buffer "floor" of 2.5 percent, while other firms above the floor have seen significantly greater volatility. While the operation of the stress capital buffer floor has reduced volatility for these six firms and several others that have been subject to the floor at some point in time, this set of firms also has been subject to a higher stress capital buffer charge than would have been indicated by the results of the stress test. More than half of all firms subject to the stress test from 2000&ndash;2005 have experienced a change in their applicable stress capital buffer of at least 1 percent over time.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> TSX30, Toronto Stock Exchange, dividend-adjusted share price, energy, electrification
Summary:<br /><br />TSX30 ranks top 30 performing companies on TSX. Hammond Power Solutions tops list with 928% share price increase. Energy, mining, and technology sectors drive growth. Shift to value investing seen. Graduations from TSXV. 17 companies on leading indices. Consistent performers in previous rankings. <div>
<p class="sizeable">Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) today announced its sixth annual TSX30&reg;, a ranking of the top 30 performing companies based on dividend-adjusted share price performance over a three-year period. The 2024 list underscores how these companies are driving advancements in sectors such as energy, electrification, and critical minerals, while delivering strong investor returns and shaping Canada's economy.</p>
<p class="sizeable">Topping the 2024 TSX30 is Hammond Power Solutions Inc. (TSX:HPS.A), a company that enables electrification through its broad range of dry-type transformers, power quality products, and related magnetics, with a dividend-adjusted share price that has increased 928% over the past three years. Collectively, TSX30 companies represent over $380 billion in market capitalization, having added an impressive $210 billion during that period &mdash; nearly a quarter of a trillion dollars in value creation &mdash; while achieving an average dividend-adjusted share price appreciation of 234%.</p>
<p class="sizeable">"This year's TSX30 reflects the leadership and innovation of Canadian companies as Canada transitions to a cleaner energy future," said Loui Anastasopoulos, CEO, Toronto Stock Exchange. "These top performers are shaping the future of Canada's economy and ensuring our strengths in energy and mining align with the emerging technology sector to keep Canada competitive on the global stage."</p>
<p class="sizeable">Adrian Thomas, CEO, Hammond Power Solutions, added, "Being named the top company in the 2024 TSX30 underscores both our commitment to driving progress in the energy sector and our team's ability to adapt and thrive in dynamic markets. We are proud to play a role in the energy transition space and strive to meet the evolving needs of a changing world."</p>
<h2 class="sizeable">Sector leadership: Interconnected industries driving growth</h2>
<p class="sizeable">The 2024 ranking is dominated by three sectors &mdash; Oil &amp; Gas, Industrial Products &amp; Services, and Mining &mdash; accounting for 25 of the 30 companies on the list. This strong representation reflects the interconnected nature of these industries and their continued contributions to Canada's economic prosperity, particularly as Canada navigates energy security in the current environment and the transition to cleaner sources of energy.</p>
<h2 class="sizeable">Energy: Balancing security and innovation</h2>
<p class="sizeable">Energy companies feature prominently on the 2024 TSX30, representing over half of the issuers. Amid global geopolitical tensions, these companies play an important role in ensuring a reliable energy supply. Athabasca Oil Corp. (TSX:ATH), for example, is a notable contributor to current energy needs while reducing the carbon intensity of its operations through transformational technologies.</p>
<h2 class="sizeable">Industrials and mining: Supporting the energy transition</h2>
<p class="sizeable">The Industrial Products &amp; Services sector, which includes companies like Hammond Power Solutions, can provide support and infrastructure for energy transition and electrification projects. The Mining sector is also growing, driven by demand for critical minerals needed for electric vehicles (EVs), batteries, and low-carbon and renewable energy. Half of this year's TSX30 mining companies focus on base metals crucial for these technologies. Cameco Corporation (TSX:CCO), a uranium production company and a pure-play investment in the growing demand for nuclear energy, has seen renewed interest, underscoring the importance of critical minerals in the shift to a low-carbon economy.</p>
<h2 class="sizeable">Technology: Catalyst for navigating energy transition</h2>
<p class="sizeable">Technology companies are a driving force behind the growth across energy and related industrial sectors. Celestica Inc. (TSX:CLS), a company that offers solutions for grid stability and EV infrastructure, ranked second in the 2024 TSX30. Celestica's 706% dividend-adjusted share price increase emphasizes the importance of technology in helping navigate the transition to a lower-carbon future.</p>
<h2 class="sizeable">Investor trends: A shift towards value investing</h2>
<p class="sizeable">The 2024 TSX30 indicates a changing investor focus from growth investing to value investing, with a preference for companies with positive cash flow and a history of consistent dividends. Nearly two-thirds (63%) of the 30 companies paid dividends, averaging a 2.8% yield. This is significantly higher compared to the eight dividend-paying companies on the 2021 TSX30, which had an average yield a full percentage point lower. This trend reflects the appeal of stable, cash-generating companies in a volatile market.</p>
<p class="sizeable">Other highlights from the 2024 ranking include:</p>
<ul class="sizeable">
<li><span>Graduations from TSX Venture Exchange (TSXV) to TSX</span>: Nine of this year's TSX30 companies graduated from TSXV, showcasing how this unique two-tiered ecosystem can nurture emerging businesses in growing their market capitalization and investor exposure.</li>
<li><span>Representation on leading indices</span>: 17 of the companies are included on either the S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index* or S&amp;P/TSX 60 Index*, enhancing their visibility among investors globally.</li>
<li><span>Consistent performers</span>: 14 of the 2024 TSX30 companies have appeared in previous TSX30 rankings (since 2019), with their collective dividend-adjusted share prices up 210% and market capitalization rising 147% during that time.</li>

<div> Securities and Exchange Commission, public good, disclosure, financial institution, restructuring
<br />
Summary:<br />
Disclosures by financial institutions in times of stress are crucial. Regulations and safeguards should be in place to protect investors and ensure investor confidence. <div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Good morning. Thank you, Roger, for the kind introduction. As is customary, I&rsquo;d like to note that my views are my own as Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and I am not speaking on behalf of my fellow Commissioners or the staff.</p>
<p>Pro bono publico. For the public good.</p>
<p>Adam Smith, known as the father of modern economics, noted in The Wealth of Nations more than 200 years ago that the whole economy benefits when the price of information is lowered, or information is free.</p>
<p>Reliable, comparable, accessible data benefits everyone. No one private entity, though, has the incentive to create reliable, comparable, and accessible data, even if they themselves may benefit from others doing so. Thus, such data is a public good.</p>
<p>President Franklin Roosevelt and Congress understood this when they laid out a basic bargain in our securities laws: Investors get to decide which risks to take so long as those companies raising money from the public make what Roosevelt called, &ldquo;complete and truthful disclosure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nearly 40 years later, economist George Akerlof published a paper about how markets price goods in the face of uncertainty about the quality of such goods. He discussed the used car market to illustrate the importance of disclosure in the pricing of both good cars and lemons.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-peterson-institute-091024#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;His thesis applies just as well to the securities markets. Without credible disclosure, a market unravels.</p>
<p>Now let me turn to something else that is good for the public.</p>
<p>My dad ran a small business in Baltimore. If he got into trouble and couldn&rsquo;t make payroll on a Friday, the city wasn&rsquo;t going to come to his rescue on Monday.</p>
<p>Whether it was my dad&rsquo;s small business or a large financial firm, this is good for the public. First, it helps promote the efficient use and allocation of resources and capital. Second, it better aligns incentives toward good economic ideas and products and away from excessive risk taking. In essence, it lowers moral hazard.</p>
<p>History is replete with times when tremors in one corner of the financial system or at one financial institution spill out into the broader economy. When this happens, workers, families, investors, and businesses inevitably get hurt.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-peterson-institute-091024#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Thus, around the globe, regulation and safeguards have been put in place to lower the risk of financial institution failures to the public.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, there was a consensus to further enhance those regulations. Governments worked with financial institutions to create mechanisms for private sector capital market investors to bear the costs of failures, through what&rsquo;s called &ldquo;loss absorbing capital.&rdquo; In the face of a potential failure, large financial institutions would conduct a major recapitalization. Though such a restructuring has yet to occur at any global systemically important financial institution, the goal is to protect taxpayers by having private sector investors bear the costs of the institution&rsquo;s problems.</p>
<p>That brings me back to the public good of disclosure.</p>
<p>If a large financial institution is restructured, the market&rsquo;s need for disclosure doesn&rsquo;t go away. Indeed, I believe the market&rsquo;s need for robust disclosure becomes all the more critical. First, it is the best way to ensure that investors, counterparties, and depositors will have sufficient confidence to remain with the firm. Second, it&rsquo;s critical to addressing Akerlof&rsquo;s issue of lemons: the uncertainty of the quality of financial institutions&mdash;the restructured one as well as others.</p>
<p>Further, the time to best prepare for that disclosure is when there isn&rsquo;t a tornado.</p>
<p><span>Communities that Need the Disclosure</span></p>
<p>The success of a large financial institution restructuring will be deeply dependent on addressing questions which will be on the minds of multiple communities.</p>
<p>First, disclosures will be important to the securities holders, including any remaining debt holders (both at the holding company and its affiliates) and the new equity (or rights) holders following a restructuring.</p>
<p>Second, disclosures will be critical to the financial institution&rsquo;s counterparties, including swaps, repurchase agreement (repo), and securities lending counterparties, as well as clearinghouses.</p>
<p>Third, depositors (particularly uninsured depositors) will want a close look at disclosures.</p>
<p>All of these communities will be focused on a set of questions that can be boiled down to: Should they stick with the financial institution or cut their risks?</p>
<p>In 1995, when Barings Bank in London was on the brink, I was a partner of Goldman Sachs, working in Japan overseeing fixed income and currency trading. While my partners were still asleep in New York, I made the call that no money or securities were going out to what sure looked like a lemon to me.</p>
<p>In the face of uncertainty and lacking updated disclosures, there&rsquo;s simply too great an asymmetry in incentives.</p>
<p>On the one hand, if everything works out, investors, counterparties, and depositors could get a return for sticking with an institution. On the other hand, if things don&rsquo;t work out, such parties may lose a significant amount of money. So, the natural reaction of many will be to manage downside risk, ring fence, and protect their own houses.</p>
<p>Further, other market participants will be considering selling on the news, through short selling or credit default swaps.</p>
<p>In the absence of confidence on the parts of investors, counterparties, and depositors, taxpayers and the official sector will bear the costs. Contagion also will more readily spread. What I am saying is that transparency is one indispensable step in regaining market participant&rsquo;s trust.</p>
<p><span>Market Needed Disclosures</span></p>
<p>At a minimum, upon the opening of markets on the Monday following a restructuring, market participants will be seeking disclosures to address the key question these communities are facing: What risks are there if they stay, and has the restructuring solved the problems that caused the institution to become a lemon?</p>
<p>Based on financial sector history, it&rsquo;s rare that the problems which led to a financial institution failure were solely due to liquidity issues. So, though the management team or members of the official sector may emphasize that it&rsquo;s just a matter of liquidity, market participants will be looking for disclosures addressing valuation, solvency, and viability.</p>
<p>Thus, investors, counterparties, and depositors will benefit from answers to the following questions:</p>
<p>First, what does the restructured financial institution look like, including what are its pro forma financials and the institution&rsquo;s current judgment about any material impairments, or asset revaluations?</p>
<p>To the extent a financial institution&rsquo;s problems are related to its assets, market participants will be looking for financial disclosures regarding adjustments for the financial institution&rsquo;s current judgment about the assets, any material impairments, or revaluations. Absent such disclosure, interested communities will be left with uncertainty about the quality of the assets and ultimately the quality of the financial institution itself. In essence, they&rsquo;re left wondering, how big was the hole and has it yet been adequately filled? Is this institution still a lemon?</p>
<p>Second, what&rsquo;s the business narrative of the restructured financial institution? Market participants will be looking for robust disclosures about what problem or problems got the institution into the mess in the first place. Further, what is the core business strategy going forward? The narrative about the restructured financial institution needs to provide investors, counterparties, and depositors confidence that the restructuring sufficiently addresses whatever underlying solvency, liquidity, or other material problems had existed.</p>
<p>Third, who is running the operation, and who is the new management team?</p>
<p>Fourth, what is the nature of government support specifically for this institution? Is the government support just for depositors, or is it broader than that?</p>
<p>A financial institution may not have all the answers that weekend. The more it lacks answers to these questions, however, the more difficult it will be for the restructuring to be successful.</p>
<p>Just as important as the information to be disclosed is when it&rsquo;s disclosed. To maximize the chance of success, my view is that the disclosure be released by the time markets open in Asia after the restructuring. Given how such events generally will occur over a crisis weekend, that&rsquo;s likely to be on Monday morning Asia time&mdash;or Sunday afternoon in the U.S. and Sunday night in Europe. In the absence of such timely disclosure, the capital markets will be left with uncertainty as to the quality of the restructured financial institution.</p>
<p>Back to Akerlof&rsquo;s lesson about signals, it&rsquo;s not just about confidence in the financial institution being restructured, but it&rsquo;s important at such times for other institutions to consider additional disclosure. Other institutions likewise will need to keep the markets apprised about their current financial situation. Otherwise, as Akerlof said, &ldquo;good cars may be driven out of the market by the lemons.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-peterson-institute-091024#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;Lack of confidence in one financial institution can spread to others.</p>
<p>Many Peterson Institute participants may be more familiar with this from the history of monetary policy, Gresham&rsquo;s law: bad money drives out good.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-peterson-institute-091024#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p><span>Disclosure and U.S. Securities Law</span></p>
<p>My main focus of this speech is on the public good of disclosure by financial institutions, particularly in the context of the restructuring of a large financial institution.</p>
<p>During discussions about financial institution disclosures with market participants and regulators, the SEC is regularly asked about what is required under U.S. securities laws. As important as the details of securities laws are, though, the goal is to have private sector investors&mdash;rather than the taxpayers&mdash;bear the brunt of a systemically important financial institution&rsquo;s restructuring. The best way to achieve that is through robust disclosures that meet market expectations, not just legal requirements.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the focus on what is required by U.S. law is understandable, given that the U.S. represents more than 40 percent of the world&rsquo;s capital markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-peterson-institute-091024#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;Of the 29 global systemically important financial institutions, 19 are reporting companies under the Securities Exchange Act.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-peterson-institute-091024#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>Further, many financial institutions have subsidiaries that may themselves come under U.S. disclosure obligations. Those that aren&rsquo;t reporting companies are likely to be accessing U.S. capital markets in other ways, such as through entering into swaps or funding transactions, selling securities, and advising clients.<i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>To the extent any of these systemically important financial institutions access U.S. capital markets, they have to comply with U.S. securities laws.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-peterson-institute-091024#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>First, institutions that are offering or selling securities must make sure their disclosures are not materially misleading. Thus, to the extent financial institutions after a restructuring want to access the public U.S. capital markets, they will need to make material disclosures regarding the restructuring. To the extent these financial institutions are accessing private capital markets, any disclosure that is made also must meet the standard of not being materially misleading.</p>
<p>Second, when offering or selling securities to U.S. investors, an institution must register the offering with the SEC or qualify for an exemption. The conversion of debt to equity itself is an offer or sale of securities. Converting debt directly to equity, however, may have an available exemption from the Securities Act of 1933, such as under Section 3(a)(9).<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-peterson-institute-091024#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;By contrast, converting debt into some form of interim right (which later is to be exchanged into equity) may not meet the requirements of a 3(a)(9) exemption.</p>
<p>Third, there is a requirement for current reporting of certain material events. For U.S. issuers, this is done by filing a Form 8-K. Foreign private issuers do so through filing a Form 6-K if the information is required by home country law, stock exchange rules, or otherwise distributed to shareholders.</p>
<p>Fourth, there&rsquo;s a requirement not to trade on material nonpublic information. In addition, for U.S. issuers, under Regulation Fair Disclosure (FD), if material information is disclosed to certain persons, that material information also must be disclosed to the broader market.</p>
<p>Overs the years, SEC staff has had ongoing constructive discussions with regulators from around the world on how their respective plans would work under U.S. securities laws.</p>
<p><span>Planning for Robust Disclosure</span></p>
<p>As I said earlier, the time to best prepare is when there isn&rsquo;t a tornado. Congress understood this when they included important provisions about resolution planning in the Dodd-Frank Act.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-peterson-institute-091024#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;Since that time, much work has done by financial institutions and regulators around the globe to implement and enhance these plans.</p>
<p>Given how important prompt disclosures will be to the success of any such restructuring, the lawyers, accountants, and management of global systemically important financial institutions should be including in their plans how they would prepare for the disclosures that the capital markets would demand on the Monday (Asia time).<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-peterson-institute-091024#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p>This is not an easy task. I do think, though, that it&rsquo;s critical to think through and anticipate such disclosures, including both what is legally required and what the markets will demand. It&rsquo;s best that an institution knows who will be tasked (and those individuals are prepared) to write disclosures during the crisis weekend. We stand ready to continue discussions with firms and their authorities on these issues.</p>
<p><span>Conclusion</span></p>
<p>The age-old need for disclosure&mdash;as Smith, Roosevelt, and Akerlof understood&mdash;creates a public good. It is relevant in normal times and times of stress. Absent full disclosure, investors are left in the dark, reliant on speculation and rumors, unable to distinguish between lemons and non-lemons.</p>
<p>There are no exemptions from the animal spirits of markets hungering for disclosure, particularly in times of stress.</p>
<p>Disclosure by financial institutions, in the context of the restructuring of a large financial institution, is integral to ensuring investor confidence.</p>
<p>The best way to have private sector investors&mdash;rather than the taxpayers&mdash;bear the brunt of a restructuring is through robust disclosures that meet market expectations.</p>
<p>Pro bono publico.</p>

<div> Cooperation, Financial Stability, Banking, Climate-Related Risk, Digital Finance
Summary:<br /><br />The U.S.-UK Financial Regulatory Working Group discussed economic outlook, banking issues, sustainable finance, digital finance, operational resilience, capital markets, and non-bank sector developments. <div>
<p>The tenth official meeting of the U.S.-UK Financial Regulatory Working Group (Working Group) took place in Washington, D.C., on September 3, 2024.</p>
<p>Officials and senior staff from HM Treasury and the U.S. Department of the Treasury were joined by representatives from independent regulatory agencies, including the Bank of England, Financial Conduct Authority, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and Securities and Exchange Commission. Participation varied across themes, with participants expressing views on issues in their organizations&rsquo; respective areas of responsibility.</p>
<p>The Working Group meeting emphasized close ongoing UK and U.S. cooperation in a number of areas and focused on several key themes, including: 1) the economic and financial stability outlook, 2) banking issues, 3) digital finance and operational resilience, 4) sustainable finance and climate-related financial risk, 5) capital markets, and 6) developments in the non-bank sector.</p>
<p>The meeting opened with a broad discussion of the UK and U.S. economic and financial stability outlooks, with participants taking stock of current economic trends and market conditions and considering broader global factors. UK Treasury outlined the UK government&rsquo;s core mission to deliver sustainable economic growth and the work to provide stability and certainty to the financial services sector in order to support growth in the wider economy.</p>
<p>On banking issues, participants offered an overview of developments in their domestic banking systems and banking regulation, including resolution-related developments and proposed Basel III-based revisions to capital requirements. The UK outlined the findings from the Bank of England&rsquo;s second assessment of the resolvability of the eight major UK banks, and the legislative progress in the Bank Resolution Bill. Participants noted the importance of ongoing dialogue among international partners when implementing these initiatives and reforms.</p>
<p>The Working Group exchanged views about sustainable finance and climate-related risk in line with their respective mandates. Representatives provided updates on climate-related disclosures for investors, including the UK&rsquo;s approach in light of the International Organization of Securities Commissions&rsquo; recent endorsement of the International Sustainability Standards Board&rsquo;s disclosure standards. Relevant participants discussed transition plan practices and noted the recent announcement of the IFRS Foundation to assume responsibility for the disclosure-specific materials published by the UK Transition Plan Taskforce, with a view to developing educational materials and considering updated application guidance. UK authorities discussed the industry code of conduct for environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings and data providers and the Transition Finance Market review.&nbsp;Participants also discussed rules on sustainability disclosure requirements for financial products, including fund names and anti-greenwashing rules, noting international initiatives on these topics. UK authorities outlined their ongoing work to embed the supervision of climate-related financial risks and update existing supervisory expectations on climate risk management to more closely align with international regulatory guidelines. The parties exchanged views on the progress of work in multilateral fora, including in the G20 Sustainable Finance Working Group and the Financial Stability Board (<abbr title="Financial Stability Board">FSB</abbr>).</p>
<p>Participants discussed issues related to digital finance and operational resilience. Representatives exchanged views on their respective approaches to artificial intelligence (AI) and both current and future AI use cases within financial services. U.S. and UK authorities discussed ways to work together, including as appropriate through international bodies, to leverage the potential benefits and address the risks of AI in financial services. Participants discussed recent developments in the financial sector&rsquo;s use of tokenization, highlighting the role tokenization and other related developments may play in the international capital markets and payments landscape. Participants also reiterated the importance of effective regulation to address risks and continued bilateral and international engagement within the sector and among authorities. The Working Group also discussed work underway to enhance cross-border payments, including under the G20 Cross-Border Payments Roadmap, which notes that greater regulatory alignment is key to the successful implementation of the Roadmap, and at the G7. Participants shared recent developments in their respective work on payments modernisation.</p>
<p>On operational resilience, participants noted ongoing international cooperation and shared regulatory updates. Participants continued discussions on regulation of critical third parties to the financial sector and about increasing bilateral cooperation on this topic.&nbsp;The Working Group also discussed ongoing work to promote responsible innovation and comprehensive supervision and regulation in the areas of digital finance and operational resilience, including through the bilateral Financial Innovation Partnership.</p>
<p>Participants conferred on capital markets regulation. Following the shift to the shorter T+1 settlement cycle in May, U.S. participants shared observations on the transition. UK authorities provided an update on the progress the UK is making towards T+1 through its Technical Group of industry experts. UK Treasury set out the UK government&rsquo;s ambition to reinvigorate capital markets to drive investment and innovation in the economy. UK regulators updated participants on recently implemented changes to the UK Listing Rules.</p>
<p>The Working Group continued with a discussion of developments in non-bank financial intermediation (<abbr title="non-bank financial intermediation">NBFI</abbr>) and the importance of fostering resilience in the&nbsp;<abbr title="non-bank financial intermediation">NBFI</abbr>&nbsp;sector.&nbsp;Participants discussed their respective domestic agendas, including on money market funds and open-ended funds. Noting the cross-border nature of&nbsp;<abbr title="non-bank financial intermediation">NBFI</abbr>, participants discussed their continued international engagement on the topic, and specifically on the&nbsp;<abbr title="Financial Stability Board">FSB</abbr>&rsquo;s work, to address vulnerabilities arising from leverage in the&nbsp;<abbr title="non-bank financial intermediation">NBFI</abbr>&nbsp;sector and work to improve market participants&rsquo; preparedness to meet margin calls. Participants acknowledged the importance of continuing the implementation of&nbsp;<abbr title="non-bank financial intermediation">NBFI</abbr>&nbsp;reforms at the domestic level.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the event, the Working Group agreed to reconvene in May 2025, while noting the importance of continued open dialogue on shared priorities.</p>
<p>The U.S.-UK Financial Regulatory Working Group is an ongoing biannual dialogue established in 2018 to deepen bilateral regulatory cooperation and to enhance: financial stability; investor protection; fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and capital formation across both jurisdictions.</p>

<title>SIFMA Statement On Basel III Endgame U.S. Implementation</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sifma-statement-on-basel-iii-endgame-us-implementation/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sifma-statement-on-basel-iii-endgame-us-implementation/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>SIFMA issued the following statement from president and CEO Kenneth E. Bentsen, Jr. on U.S. implementation of the Basel III Endgame, following a speech today from Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr announcing regulators&rsquo; plan to re-propose:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We commend the agencies for recognizing the need for both &lsquo;broad and material revisions&rsquo; and further public comment and analysis, and we look forward to reviewing the re-proposal in detail. The original proposal received an unprecedented volume of comments raised by a diverse group of stakeholders. SIFMA has long argued that any policy changes must recognize the role of our capital markets, the deepest, most liquid and efficient, as a core component of the broader U.S. economy. Any re-proposal should make substantial improvements to market risk proposals and should be considered with the existing stress testing requirements.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-8">
<p>Thank you for inviting me to speak today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20240910a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;Since I joined the Federal Reserve Board as Vice Chair for Supervision, I have spoken many times about the importance of bank capital to the safety and soundness of banks and the stability of the financial system.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20240910a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;It is critical that banks have the capacity to continue lending to households and businesses through times of stress. Bank capital is a key component of this resilience. And bank capital rules help to ensure that banks are holding capital commensurate with the risks of their activities and the risks that they pose to the U.S. financial system. But capital has costs too. As compared to debt, capital is a more expensive source of funding to the bank.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20240910a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;Thus, higher capital requirements can raise the cost of funding to a bank, and the bank can pass higher costs on to households, businesses, and clients engaged in a range of financial activities. These activities are critical to a well-functioning economy that works for everyone. That's why it is important to get the balance between resiliency and efficiency right.</p>
<p>Today, I'll return to these themes in the context of two rules of great public interest: The Basel III endgame proposal and the proposal to adjust the capital surcharge for global systemically important banks (G-SIB).<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20240910a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a></p>
<p><strong>The path forward</strong><br />A little over a year ago, the Board sought comment on those two proposed rules, which would modify risk-based capital requirements for large banks. We received a great number of comments on the provisions in the proposal, as well as on the justifications and analysis that underlie those provisions.</p>
<p>Since that time, we have been hard at work analyzing the comments and the data we collected to evaluate the combined impact of these proposals. We have spoken with a wide range of stakeholders, including banks, academics, public interest groups, consumers, businesses, other regulators, Congress, and others. As you would expect in a project as technical and consequential as this one, I have had many productive meetings with Board colleagues and our fellow federal bank regulatory agencies, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).</p>
<p>This process has led us to conclude that broad and material changes to the proposals are warranted. As I said, there are benefits and costs to increasing capital requirements. The changes we intend to make will bring these two important objectives into better balance, in light of the feedback we have received. The changes to the endgame proposal have been a joint effort with my counterparts at the FDIC and the OCC.</p>
<p>I intend to recommend that the Board re-propose the Basel endgame and G-SIB surcharge rules. This will provide the public the opportunity to fully review a number of key broad and material changes to the original proposals and provide comment. We will accept public comments on any aspect of the Basel endgame and G-SIB surcharge proposals.</p>
<p>The changes in the endgame re-proposal will cover all major areas of the rule: credit risk; operational risk; and market risk. Banks with assets between $100 and $250 billion would no longer be subject to the endgame changes, other than the requirement to recognize unrealized gains and losses of their securities in regulatory capital.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20240910a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;These changes reflect the feedback we have received from the public, improve the tiering of the proposal, and better reflect risks. I will also recommend changes to the G-SIB surcharge proposal to better align the capital surcharge for a G-SIB with its systemic risk profile.</p>
<p>Taken together, the re-proposals would increase aggregate common equity tier 1 capital requirements for the G-SIBs, which are the largest and most complex banks, by 9 percent. For other large banks that are not G-SIBs, the impact from the re-proposal would mainly result from the inclusion of unrealized gain and losses on their securities in regulatory capital, estimated to be equivalent to a 3 to 4 percent increase in capital requirements over the long run. The remainder of the re-proposal would increase capital requirements for non-GSIB firms still subject to the rule by 0.5 percent.</p>
<p>While these proposed changes affect some of the most important aspects of the proposals, the agencies have not made final decisions on any aspect of the re-proposals, including those that are not explicitly addressed in the re-proposal. The public should not view any omission of a potential change in these re-proposals as an indication that the agencies will finalize a provision as proposed. We continue to consider comments already received on the 2023 proposal, and we will consider those comments together with any comments submitted on the re-proposals as part of any final rulemakings. This is an interim step. Let me reiterate that we are open to comments on any aspect of the proposals. Now, I will turn to the changes.</p>
<p><em>Credit risk</em><br />I will begin with an overview of the changes I will recommend to the capital requirements for credit risk, which protect against the risk that a bank's loans will not be fully repaid. These changes include reducing the risk-weights for residential real estate and retail exposures, extending the scope of the reduced risk weight for certain low-risk corporate debt, and eliminating the minimum haircut for securities financing transactions.</p>
<p>First, I intend to recommend that the Board lower the proposed risk-weighting for loans secured by residential real estate and loans to retail customers. The original proposal introduced more risk-sensitive approaches for residential real estate and retail exposures, but calibrated them to be higher than the Basel standard to promote domestic competitive equity. The agencies received significant comments on the proposed calibrations. Some commenters argued that the elevated risk weights would overstate the risk for these loans given their loss history. Others argued that the risk weighting would affect home affordability and homeownership opportunities, particularly for first-time homebuyers, minority communities, and low- and moderate-income borrowers, and could reduce the availability and affordability of retail credit.</p>
<p>I will recommend that we reduce the calibration for residential real estate exposures so that it is in line with the calibration developed in the Basel process. With this change, all-in capital requirements, including for operational and credit risk, will be lower on average than they are currently for mortgages up to 90 percent loan-to-value ratio, and about the same as they are now for mortgages up to 100 percent loan-to-value. With respect to loans to retail customers, I intend to recommend that we adopt the Basel standard, with two exceptions &ndash; first, we would lower the capital requirements for credit card exposures where the borrower uses only a small portion of the commitment line, and second, we would lower the capital requirement for charge cards with no pre-set credit limits.</p>
<p>The second proposed change related to credit risk would extend the reduced risk weight for low-risk corporate exposures to certain regulated entities that a bank judges to be investment grade and that are not publicly traded. The original proposal provided this preferential treatment only to investment-grade corporates that were publicly traded because the financial disclosure requirements for these entities facilitate market participants' assessments of their financial condition, which in turn provide additional information for banking organizations to use when assessing these entities' credit risk. There were many comments that the preferential treatment should be extended further, including to regulated entities that are also subject to substantial regulatory discipline and substantial transparency requirements. Consistent with our objective of increasing risk sensitivity in capital requirements, I plan to recommend to the Board that we extend the reduced corporate risk weight to regulated entities &ndash; including regulated financial institutions that are not banks, such as pension funds, certain mutual funds, and foreign equivalents &ndash; that are investment-grade but not publicly traded.</p>
<p>Third, I intend to recommend that the Board not adopt the capital treatment associated with minimum haircut floors for securities financing transactions. The proposal included heightened capital requirements for repo-style transactions and eligible margin loans that did not meet minimum margin requirements. While consistent with the Basel standard, several other major jurisdictions have not adopted this approach. Not adopting the minimum haircut floors will allow time to seek greater international consensus on this important topic before deciding on whether and how to implement such an approach in the United States.</p>
<p><em>Equity Exposures</em><br />Let me speak to the treatment of tax credit equity financing exposures. I plan to recommend that we significantly lower the risk weight for tax credit equity funding structures, given the lower inherent risk in these structures compared to many other equity investments. The revised lower risk weight for these exposures of 100 percent would reflect this lower risk and be consistent with the approach we take for other tax credit investments, such as the low-income housing tax credits.</p>
<p><em>Operational risk</em><br />Next, let me speak about three changes I intend to recommend for the proposed capital treatment of operational risk, which is the risk of losses from inadequate or failed processes, such as from fraud or cyberattacks. First, I plan to recommend that we no longer adjust a firm's operational risk charge based on its operational loss history. This change will reduce fluctuations in a bank's operational risk capital requirements over time.</p>
<p>Second, I plan to recommend to the Board that we calculate fee income on a net basis in calculating its contribution to the operational risk capital requirement. The original proposal would have measured the contribution of fee-based activities based on gross revenues, instead of net income, which is revenues minus expenses. Moving to net income for fee-based activities&mdash;specifically, by netting noninterest income and expenses (except for operational losses)&mdash;would produce more consistency in how operational risk is measured across bank activities, as interest and trading income and expenses are already measured on a net basis under the proposal. This change would also produce more consistent operational risk capital requirements across banks because the approach is less sensitive to the differences in accounting practices across banks.</p>
<p>Third, I plan to recommend to the Board that we reduce operational risk capital requirements for investment management activities to reflect the smaller historical operational losses for these activities relative to income. The agencies received comments suggesting that some fee-based business lines have incurred meaningfully lower operational losses than other business lines. We have found evidence that investment management has historically experienced noticeably low operational losses relative to income produced.</p>
<p><em>Market risk and derivatives</em><br />Now, I'll speak to the capital treatment for a bank's trading activities and its derivatives activities. The endgame proposal included a number of important improvements relative to the current market risk capital framework, including to incorporate lessons learned from the 2007-09 financial crisis that have not been sufficiently addressed in the current framework. It would permit firms to use internal models to capture the complex dynamics of most market risks but would put certain constraints on banks' models and provide fallbacks in areas where modeling practices are not adequate.</p>
<p>We received numerous comments on ways to improve this part of the proposal. I plan to recommend that we make changes to facilitate banks' ability to use internal models for market risk. For example, the re-proposal will introduce a multiyear implementation period for the profit and loss attribution tests that are used to confirm that models are working as intended. This extended transition period would allow banks to gain experience with the tests and provide time to improve their systems and processes and address any potential gaps in data and model performance. In addition, the re-proposal would contain a few additional adjustments to improve incentives for a firm to model its exposures.</p>
<p>Moreover, we will clarify that uniform mortgage-backed securities positions would be treated as having a single obligor, regardless of whether they were issued by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. This change will enable firms to recognize hedging across these securities.</p>
<p>With respect to derivatives activities, I plan to recommend that the Board adjust the capital treatment for client-cleared derivatives activities by reducing the capital required for the client-facing leg of a client-cleared derivative. This change would better reflect the risks of these transactions, which are highly collateralized and subject to netting and daily margin requirements. This also would avoid disincentives to client clearing, which I'll return to later.</p>
<p><em>Tiering</em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span><br />Let me turn to tiering. The largest, most complex firms should be subject to the most stringent requirements, in light of the costs that their potential failure would impose on the broader financial system and thus on businesses and households. Under the re-proposal, G-SIBs and other internationally active banks would be subject to the most stringent set of requirements, including the new credit risk and operational risk requirements, and the revised frameworks for market risk and CVA frameworks.</p>
<p>Capital requirements for large banks that are not G-SIBs can be simpler while still supporting resilience. I am recommending a number of changes to better reflect this principle. For firms with assets between $250 and $700 billion that are not G-SIBs or internationally active, the re-proposal would apply the new credit risk and operational risk requirements; however, it would apply the frameworks for market risk and CVA frameworks only to firms that engage in significant trading activity. Further, the re-proposal would revert to the simpler definition of capital &ndash; the numerator in the capital ratio &ndash; for these firms that is currently in place, with the exception of applying the requirement to reflect unrealized losses and gains on certain securities and other aspects of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). The re-proposal would maintain this element to better reflect interest rate risk in capital, a problem that played a major role in last March's bank failures.</p>
<p>For large banks with assets between $100 and $250 billion, the re-proposal would not apply the credit risk and operational risk frameworks of the expanded risk-based approach to these banking organizations, maintaining a simpler capital framework for these less complex firms. For these firms, the re-proposal would also revert to the simpler definition of capital for these firms that is currently in place, with the exception of applying the requirement to reflect unrealized losses and gains on certain securities and other aspects of AOCI.</p>
<p><strong>G-SIB surcharge proposal</strong><br />As I noted, last July, we sought comment on proposed revisions to the G-SIB surcharge, to better reflect the systemic risk of each G-SIB. In particular, the proposal would make adjustments to limit "window dressing" by requiring banks to report indicators as average values instead of on a point-in-time basis. It would also reduce "cliff effects" by calculating a G-SIB's capital surcharge in 0.1 percent increments instead of 0.5 percent increments. And the proposal would adjust how we measure some systemic indicators to better align them with risk.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20240910a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a></p>
<p>The goal of the 2023 proposal was to improve the risk sensitivity of the G-SIB surcharge. Commenters provided helpful feedback regarding the proposal's potential impact on certain types of activities, such as client clearing of derivatives. We are still considering these comments, but let me speak to areas where I will recommend making changes to the original proposal.</p>
<p>First, I'll speak to the treatment of cleared derivatives. The proposal would have increased the extent to which client-cleared derivatives contribute to a bank's G-SIB surcharge, to promote consistency of the measure. However, commenters argued that the measure might result in higher costs and more volatility for derivative end users and might reduce incentives to provide clients' access to central clearing. While it is important for our capital rules to be risk-sensitive, it is also important that we consider the impact of our rules in the broader market context. Central clearing of derivatives is a critical tool that can help improve transparency and reduce systemic risk. To avoid disincentives for client clearing, I intend to recommend to the Board that we not adopt the proposed changes to capital requirements associated with client clearing.</p>
<p>Second, let me speak to changes in the surcharge proposal that I will recommend to keep the measures we use up-to-date. The U.S. G-SIB surcharge was set nearly nine years ago, and the growth in the economy since 2015 has meant that G-SIBs' measures of systemic risk have increased, even for firms whose share of domestic or global economic activity has not increased. The Board noted the potential for this effect in the original 2015 G-SIB rule. While it did not provide a mechanism to automatically adjust for economic growth at that time, the Board stated that it would periodically reevaluate the framework.</p>
<p>As part of the G-SIB re-proposal, I intend to recommend that we improve the calculation of the capital surcharges for G-SIBs by reflecting changes in the global banking system since the Board adopted the G-SIB surcharge in 2015. In addition, for the future, I intend to recommend that we account for effects from inflation and economic growth in the measurement of a G-SIB's systemic risk profile. As a result, a G-SIB's surcharge would not change based simply on growth in the economy.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20240910a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />The journey to improve capital requirements since the Global Financial Crisis has been a long one, and Basel III endgame is an important element of this effort. These re-proposals bring us closer to completing the task.</p>
<p>The broad and material changes to both proposals that I've outlined today would better balance the benefits and costs of capital in light of comments received, and result in a capital framework that appropriately reflects the risks of bank activities and is tiered to the banking sector. They also bring the proposals broadly in line with what other major jurisdictions are doing. And what does this all mean? A safer and fairer banking system. My goal, throughout my nearly 30 years in this field, has always been to help ensure that the banking system can support households and businesses of all types, during good times and bad.</p>
<p>In addition to the re-proposals outlined today, we are looking carefully at how our stress test complements the risk-based capital rules to help ensure our overall framework supports a resilient and effective banking sector. We are attentive to the interactions across all components of our capital framework as well as the combined burden and benefits, and we take these issues seriously. In all of our work, we will continue to seek an approach that helps to ensure financial system resiliency and supports the flow of credit to households and businesses. It is most imperative that we get this right.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p><a name="fn2"></a>2. See Michael S. Barr, "<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20221201a.htm">Why Bank Capital Matters</a>" (speech at the American Enterprise Institute, Washington, DC, December 1, 2022), and Michael S. Barr, "<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/barr20230710a.pdf">Holistic Capital Review (PDF)</a>" (speech at the Bipartisan Policy Center, Washington, DC, July 10, 2023).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn3"></a>3. Under standard corporate finance theory, a firm should be indifferent between debt and equity, but in practice, as compared to debt, equity is a more expensive source of funding to a bank given the structure of our laws and markets, the presence of deposit insurance and other government support, and other factors. See, e.g., Franco Modigliani and Merton H. Miller, "<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1809766">The Cost of Capital, Corporation Finance and the Theory of Investment</a>,"&nbsp;<em>The American Economic Review</em>&nbsp;48 (June 1958): 261&ndash;297, and Ron J. Feldman, Gary H. Stern, and Paul A. Volcker,&nbsp;<em>Too Big to Fail: The Hazards of Bank Bailouts</em>&nbsp;(Washington: Brookings Institution Press, 2009).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn4"></a>4. The G-SIB surcharge is an additional layer of capital just for the G-SIBs, and it is measured on several factors of each G-SIB, specific to their individual risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn5"></a>5. To the extent that such a firm has large trading operations, it would also be subject to the revised market risk framework.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn6"></a>6. With regard to the adjustments to address window dressing and cliff effects, these will have a one-time impact on banks that carefully manage their operations to lower surcharge buckets, but should improve the efficiency and risk-sensitivity of the measure over time.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn7"></a>7. The re-proposal would update the method 2 coefficients to reflect changes from 2015 until the present using a methodology that is consistent with the Board's original calibration in 2015. Specifically, the supplemental proposal would update the method 2 coefficients for each of the systemic indicators for the size, interconnectedness, complexity, and cross-jurisdictional activity categories from 2015 until the present using the most recent available two-year average of aggregate global indicator amounts and the corresponding three-year average of euro/U.S. dollar exchange rates. Going forward, it would also include a mechanism to annually adjust the method 2 coefficients for each of the systemic indicators for the size, interconnectedness, complexity, and cross-jurisdictional activity categories based on U.S. inflation and real economic growth. This mechanism would use a three-year moving average of annual nominal U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) growth to adjust these coefficients on an annual basis.&nbsp;</p>

<title>SEC Charges Keurig With Making Inaccurate Statements Regarding Recyclability Of K-Cup Beverage Pod</title>

<div> SEC, Keurig Dr Pepper, K-Cup, recyclability, civil penalty
Summary: Keurig Dr Pepper charged by SEC for inaccurate recyclability claims, omitted concerns from recycling companies, to pay $1.5 million penalty.<br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. with making inaccurate statements regarding the recyclability of its K-Cup single use beverage pods. To settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges, Keurig agreed to pay a $1.5 million civil penalty.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, in annual reports for fiscal years 2019 and 2020, Keurig stated that its testing with recycling facilities &ldquo;validate[d] that [K-Cup pods] can be effectively recycled.&rdquo; But Keurig did not disclose that two of the largest recycling companies in the United States had expressed significant concerns to Keurig regarding the commercial feasibility of curbside recycling of K-Cup pods at that time and indicated that they did not presently intend to accept them for recycling. In fiscal year 2019, sales of K-Cup pods comprised a significant percentage of net sales of Keurig&rsquo;s coffee systems business segment, and research earlier conducted by a Keurig subsidiary indicated that environmental concerns were a significant factor that certain consumers considered, among others, when deciding whether to purchase a Keurig brewing system.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Public companies must ensure that the reports they file with the SEC are complete and accurate,&rdquo; said John T. Dugan, Associate Director of the Boston Regional Office. &ldquo;When a company speaks to an issue in its annual report, they are required to provide information necessary for investors to get the full picture on that issue so that investors can make educated investment decisions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that Keurig violated Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13a-1 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the findings in the order, Keurig agreed to a cease-and-desist order and to pay a civil penalty of $1.5 million.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Michael Franck, Cassandra H. Arriaza, Susan Cooke, and Michele T. Perillo of the Boston Regional Office.</p>

<p>Two new ETFs: the BETA ETF Nasdaq-100 3x lev and the BETA ETF Nasdaq-100 2x short are now available on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. The two new investment solutions have been delivered to the Polish market by BETA ETF. Dom Maklerski BOŚ is the market maker and offering coordinator.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>BETA ETF Nasdaq-100 3x lev and BETA ETF Nasdaq-100 2x short are two more solutions in the active ETF segment delivered by BETA ETF to the Polish market</span></li>
<li><span>The new ETFs are listed in Polish zloty</span></li>
<li><span>GPW offers 13 ETFs, including 11 which are BETA ETF products</span></li>
<li><span>BETA ETF is a brand of investment funds created in cooperation between BETA Securities Poland and AgioFunds TFI</span></li>
<li><span>Dom Maklerski BOŚ is the market maker and offering coordinator</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Two new investment solutions from BETA ETF have been listed on the GPW Main Market today: the BETA ETF Nasdaq-100 3x lev and the BETA ETF Nasdaq-100 2x short. These active ETF segment solutions are primarily intended for active investors who closely follow the market.</p>
<p>GPW sees great potential in the ETF segment. August 2024 brought new records in the segment as the monthly turnover value reached an all-time high of PLN 167.0 million. On 5 August 2024, investors generated a record-high EOB turnover in ETFs at PLN 34 million. The most popular ETFs were those issued by BETA ETF for the WIG20short index (~PLN 10.3 million) and the WIG20lev index (PLN 6 million).</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;ETFs have won the recognition of investors worldwide thanks to their simplicity and broad investment opportunities. We are pleased that the ETF offer on GPW is constantly growing.&nbsp;Our mission is to introduce products that meet the needs of investors, whether they prefer passive or active investment strategies, with or without leverage.&nbsp;The listing of ETFs in the Polish zloty brings a number of benefits, such as lower transaction costs, simpler access and easier tax treatment, which makes these instruments more attractive to Polish investors,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;said Michał Kobza, Member of the GPW Management Board.</p>
<p>The new BETA ETFs are not suitable for investors who prefer the &ldquo;buy-and-hold&rdquo; passive strategy.&nbsp;Leveraged investments involve additional risks as both losses and gains are multiplied.&nbsp;Investors should be aware of these risks and ready to incur possible significant losses in the short term.&nbsp;It is also important that investors understand the consequences of holding a position in short ETFs where increases in the underlying index lead to losses on the ETF.</p>
<p>The turnover and the number of transactions in Beta ETFs year to date has been more than 40% higher than in the same period of 2023, and BETA ETFs have raised PLN 60 million in new assets in this period.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Our two new, quite unique leveraged and short investment solutions, the BETA ETF Nasdaq-100 3x lev and the BETA ETF Nasdaq-100 2x short, fill the market niche between traditional equities and the far more leveraged futures, CFDs, and structured certificates.&nbsp;These ETFs rely on synthetic replication using futures contracts on the Nasdaq-100. They also employ a strategy to hedge the foreign exchange risk arising from investing in the US market.&nbsp;The recent popularity of the BETA ETF WIG20lev and BETA ETF WIG20short has proved that investors are looking for solutions that would allow them to earn above-average returns in the short term while accepting higher investment risk.&nbsp;We are pleased that the products we offer are increasingly finding their way into investors&rsquo; portfolios and are being covered by brokerage firms&rsquo; research,</em>&rdquo; said Kazimierz Szpak, President of BETA Securities Poland (BETA ETF).</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Today's new listing of two new ETFs in the BETA ETF product range marks a significant step in the development of our investment offering.&nbsp;Since the launch of our partnership with Beta Securities Poland, which enabled the listing of the first BETA ETF WIG20TR on the Warsaw Stock Exchange in January 2019, we have been consistently expanding our offering to include passively managed and actively managed funds.&nbsp;By launching innovative products such as the active ETFs BETA ETF Nasdaq-100 3x lev and BETA ETF Nasdaq-100 2x short, we support the development of the capital market with tools which lay the foundation for modern investing and enable investors to react dynamically to changing market conditions,&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>said Marek Arent, Member of the Management Board of AgioFunds TFI (BETA ETF).</p>
<p>The existing BETA ETF offering expands the range of investment options to 11 products.&nbsp;BETA ETF is a brand of investment funds created in cooperation between BETA Securities Poland and AgioFunds TFI.&nbsp;Dom Maklerski BOŚ is the market maker and offering coordinator.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s new listing of the two ETFs attests to the continued development of the Beta ETF product range, which will now exceed ten ETFs. The new BETA ETF Nasdaq-100 3x lev and BETA ETF Nasdaq-100 2x short will expand the range of available foreign market index funds to include a fund that allows investors to earn a return when the index is falling and a fund that offers the possibility of investing with leverage.&nbsp;Both ETFs are aimed at active investors seeking high returns who accept increased risk.&nbsp;The ETFs can be an interesting alternative to OTC CFDs and investment certificates.&nbsp;We congratulate BETA Securities Poland on these new listings and appreciate the strategic cooperation in the creation of ETFs which are increasingly popular among investors.&nbsp;On this occasion, DM BOŚ has prepared an offer of attractive fees for clients and will be happy to work with them,&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>said Radosław Olszewski, President of Dom Maklerski BOŚ.</p>
<p>ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) are designed to track (replicate) a stock market index. ETFs offer the possibility of constant (daily) creation and redemption of investment certificates. Portfolio closed-end investment fund certificates, i.e. ETF units within the meaning of the Exchange Rules, are listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange in the same way as shares, they can be freely bought and sold, and their liquidity is supported by a market maker (brokerage firm).</p>
<p>***</p>

<div> Gemini, crypto adoption, ownership, regulatory concerns, ETFs
Summary:
Crypto ownership remains steady in US and UK, with a rise in France and a drop in Singapore. Regulatory concerns a barrier, majority hodl for long term, spot crypto ETFs bring growth, crypto becomes US election issue for the first time. Resilience shown by investors in latest downturn.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Today, crypto platform Gemini released its&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="http://email.prnewswire.com/ls/click?upn=u001.qLV-2BmgSD8kFAFsE6x-2BKUxVCI9sn2NehgzKh5EIISyqLGJnisHYgDfcyn4-2BShtM30qQrT_pIbxPfpDI69aAybPrpOfg1n6CWmKMnb3conIyNKCYgr-2BTRqxLAwMRExIXLpGb5DJVjcuoqzI9JwBqBarGl-2BkmZRsaUY7Mr8iKPyr9PTsjVSHD-2BuCMP5lXucY4pD82LHwTQg5AZRVJFjGjIsQjd-2BSzOfuNoNq0VMNvNfdu62TKEuFB4-2B-2B0OdZqVHykIAL86Elqzf3Ss3X26PpGJiPE-2FG7uzJ61C0RFq6kll7XZRisKlrqGMDMwDcUerE1eTRAo1Kkc06l7Ab0qxZ8FBtZqNkxhg4j8WcYqkMMdh74qXB-2FTuaVVgPFCeLMXpemGiJVJJrCtbaDf-2BmKlKOzLoJf9msIOYsQ63u7owKseYZrku1TUzM-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2024 Global State of Crypto report</a>, finding that crypto adoption remained steady across the United States (21%) and United Kingdom (18%) from 2022 to 2024. The number of crypto owners in France (18%) rose slightly from 2022 (16%), while Singapore ownership dropped slightly from 30% to 26%.</p>

<p>The consistency in ownership is due in part to&nbsp;crypto owners' attitudes toward the asset class. Nearly two in three crypto owners across these geographies (65%) report buying and holding cryptocurrency for its long-term investment potential, and nearly two in five (38%) hold cryptocurrency as a hedge against inflation.<br /><br />On November 14, 2022, the combined value of the top 100 cryptocurrencies had&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="http://email.prnewswire.com/ls/click?upn=u001.SH2rn1fYDrsFUom0sxl58IM7h1E7d-2F0b5DQcaBOjoa14YyrBcAcQ1eQ3cuAdtwK7tG8R-2Fnh97tOscenIuCo5hoFmbRenspU7h1E9zvIeSrXeadRbSUyZEw7bNPYk3S1D-2FfDX4gHhjIdFnHb1kA0K1A-3D-3DRUVD_pIbxPfpDI69aAybPrpOfg1n6CWmKMnb3conIyNKCYgr-2BTRqxLAwMRExIXLpGb5DJVjcuoqzI9JwBqBarGl-2BkmZRsaUY7Mr8iKPyr9PTsjVSHD-2BuCMP5lXucY4pD82LHwTQg5AZRVJFjGjIsQjd-2BSzOfuNoNq0VMNvNfdu62TKEuFB4-2B-2B0OdZqVHykIAL86Elqzf3Ss3X26PpGJiPE-2FG7uzJ61C0RFq6kll7XZRisKlpG9qjHdsCJZO9uwtj1E5SLa3A47txJnlmsdgZBcFUnxHZbtHfBylzZnzcbl8PibARTvub3IatYNtMDKOEEVefnM596dkTylAtxGsSZ71yMmrmV-2Fathz9BPVsVNZ0gq7WY-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">dropped to $830 billion</a></span>, down from $2.7 trillion the year earlier. In 2024. The number of past owners rose slightly in each geography, suggesting that some crypto owners left the market during the downturn. However, more than 70% of past owners report a potential return to the market.<br /><br />Other key findings include:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><b>Lack of regulatory clarity is a barrier to entry:&nbsp;</b>In the US and UK, nearly two in five (38%) non-owners cited regulatory concerns as a barrier to investing in crypto. In France, nearly one in three (32%) said the same, and in Singapore nearly half (49%) of respondents said crypto regulations were a concern.</li>
<li><b>The majority of crypto owners want to allocate 5% or more to digital assets:&nbsp;</b>The majority (57%) of crypto owners say they are comfortable making crypto a core part of their investment portfolio. More than one in four (27%) of past owners said the same, signaling many may soon be re-entering the crypto market.</li>
<li><b>The gender gap in crypto ownership persists, but women are just as likely to HODL:</b>&nbsp;The split between male and female ownership was slightly more pronounced in 2024 compared to 2022, with 69% of crypto owners identifying as male and 31% identifying as female, compared to 58% and 42% in 2022, respectively. However, women are just as likely as their male counterparts to buy and hold for the long term.</li>
<li><b>Spot crypto exchange traded funds (ETFs) bring growth:&nbsp;</b>In the US, nearly two in five (37%) cryptocurrency owners surveyed said they hold some crypto through an ETF. More than one in ten (13%) own crypto exclusively through an ETF, suggesting they entered the market through ETFs when they were introduced this year.</li>
<li><b>Crypto has become a US election issue for the first time:</b>&nbsp;The vast majority of crypto owners in the United States (73%) plan to consider a candidate's digital asset policies when they vote for the next president of the United States.</li>
</ul>
<p>"Crypto investors have proven their resilience over numerous market cycles throughout the years, and the latest downturn was no exception," said Marshall Beard, COO at Gemini. "The introduction of spot crypto ETFs in the United States and the significant headway towards thoughtful regulation in many jurisdictions globally has positioned the industry for strong growth as retail investors rejoin the crypto market or get started for the first time."<br /><br />The countries surveyed in the 2024 State of Crypto study were selected because they are nations where Gemini either currently operates or is exploring operations in the future. In addition to the United States, United Kingdom, France, and Singapore, Gemini also surveyed Turkey for the first time this year.<br /><br />Turkey is overwhelmingly positive toward crypto, with the majority of respondents (58%) reporting owning crypto. An even larger majority of both owners and non-owners (65%) said they were likely to purchase crypto in the next year. Crypto owners in Turkey were significantly more likely to actively trade crypto (62%) compared to owners in other countries surveyed (43%).<br /><br /><b>Methodology<br /><br /></b>The 2024 Global State of Crypto report is based on a survey conducted with 6,000 adults across the US, UK, France, Singapore, and Turkey. The survey was conducted online between May 23, 2024 and June 28, 2024 on behalf of Gemini by Data Driven Consulting Group. The total sample has been balanced and is generally representative of the adult population in each country ages 18 to 75 with household incomes of $14,000 USD or more. Data cited in the report as "2022" was from a survey conducted online between November 23, 2021 and February 4, 2022, also on behalf of Gemini by Data Driven Consulting Group.</p>

<div> charged, Mr Olumide Osunkoya, crypto ATMs, FCA, registration <br />
<br />
Olumide Osunkoya charged by FCA for unlawfully running unregistered crypto ATMs processing £2.6m, first criminal prosecution, warning of high risk. <br />
Summary: The FCA charged Mr Olumide Osunkoya for running unregistered crypto ATMs, processed £2.6m, first criminal prosecution, warning of high risk. <div>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has charged Mr&nbsp;Olumide Osunkoya,&nbsp;who is 45 and resides in London, for unlawfully running multiple crypto ATMs without FCA registration. Crypto ATMs are machines that allow you to buy or convert money into cryptoassets.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>Mr Osunkoya is accused of running crypto ATMs, which processed &pound;2.6m in crypto transactions across multiple locations between 29 December 2021 and 8 September 2023 without the required registration.</p>
<p>The charges mark the FCA's first criminal prosecution relating to unregistered cryptoasset activity under the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017 (MLRs). These are also the first charges brought against a person accused of running a network of crypto ATMs in the UK.</p>
<p>The charges follow the FCA&rsquo;s recent operation, working in partnership with law enforcement agencies, to tackle illegally operated crypto ATMs across the country.</p>
<p><span>Therese Chambers, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA said</span>:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Our message today is clear. If you're illegally operating a crypto ATM, we will stop you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you&rsquo;re using a crypto ATM, you are handing your money directly to criminals. Criminals can exploit crypto ATMs to launder money globally.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There are no legal crypto ATM operators in the UK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The defendant will appear before Westminster Magistrates&rsquo; Court on 30 September 2024.</p>
<p>The FCA continues to warn people that if you buy crypto, you should be prepared to lose all your money. Crypto remains largely unregulated in the UK and is high-risk.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<ol>
<li>Mr Osunkoya&rsquo;s date of birth is 7 February 1979.</li>
<li>The FCA has been the anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CTF) supervisor of UK cryptoasset businesses since 10 January 2020.</li>
<li>Firms that want to provide cryptoasset services that come within the scope of the money laundering regulations&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/cryptoassets-aml-ctf-regime/registering" title="Cryptoassets: AML / CTF regime - Registering with the FCA">must register with the FCA</a>.</li>
<li>We register firms who meet our standards for anti-money laundering and terrorist financing controls. We have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/cryptoassets-information">published information on those regulatory standards</a>. We also provide firms with support during the registration process, including pre-application meetings.</li>
<li>Mr Osunkoya first acted as a director of a company, Gidiplus Ltd, and later as a sole practitioner. He is being charged with two offences under Regulations 86 and 92 of the MLRs for operating crypto ATMs without FCA registration. He is also charged with two offences under the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981 relating to false documents created and used during the above activity, and an offence of possession of criminal property under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 relating to the suspected proceeds of his crypto ATM business.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Regulation 92 of the MLRs states that where a body corporate, like GidiPlus Ltd, commits such an offence, an officer of that body corporate, such as a director of that body, is also guilty of the underlying offence where it was either committed with the consent or connivance of the officer, or is otherwise attributable to any neglect on the part of the officer.&nbsp;</li>
<li>On 28 August 2024,&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.kent.police.uk/news/kent/latest/policing-news/medway-trader-first-in-uk-to-be-charged-with-crypto-atm-offence/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kent Police charged an individual for running a single crypto ATM without FCA permission<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>. This was the first charge of its kind brought against an individual in the UK.</li>
<li>In 2023, the FCA visited and inspected 34 locations across the UK suspected of hosting crypto ATMs. This resulted in the FCA disrupting 26 machines operating unlawfully across the country.</li>
<li>The FCA&rsquo;s site inspections were done in collaboration with law enforcement agencies such as the South West Regional Organised Crime Unit, Bedfordshire Police, Hertfordshire Police, and the Metropolitan Police.</li>
<li>The FCA published a list of&nbsp;<a href="https://register.fca.org.uk/s/search?predefined=U">cryptoasset businesses</a>&nbsp;that are operating without our authorisation.</li>

<div> Platform, FX options, block trading, CME Group, Medusa
Summary: 
Digital Vega and CME Group launched FX options block trading service on Medusa platform, enabling OTC workflows, central clearing, and increased liquidity. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p><span>Digital Vega,</span><span>&nbsp;the leading FX Options e-trading platform and provider of FX Options trading solutions,&nbsp;</span>and CME Group, the world&rsquo;s leading derivatives marketplace, today announced the launch of a new FX options block trading service. Currently available for client testing, buy-side firms will be able to use existing OTC workflows on Digital Vega&rsquo;s multi-bank platform Medusa to request quotes and trade blocks of FX options on futures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Market participants will be able to leverage Digital Vega&rsquo;s established connectivity, GUI and workflow technology to request prices in CME Group&rsquo;s centrally cleared FX options from multiple Liquidity Providers in competition.&nbsp; These options can be significantly more margin efficient versus traditional OTC options for those subject to Uncleared Margin Rules.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enabling customers to negotiate and trade risk-transfer blocks via Digital Vega&rsquo;s Medusa platform is an exciting development in the electronification of the FX options market,&rdquo; said<strong>&nbsp;Chris Povey, Executive Director and Head of FX Options, CME Group</strong>.&nbsp;&ldquo;This partnership lowers the barriers to entry for buy-side clients looking to gain the margin and operational benefits of our centrally cleared FX options by allowing them to use existing OTC workflows and lean on OTC relationships.&nbsp; In addition, clients could gain access to new liquidity given there is no requirement for bilateral credit relationships.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Trading CME Group</span><span>&rsquo;s FX</span><span>&nbsp;blocks on Digital Vega&rsquo;s multi-dealer platform, provides a seamless execution solution to both buy-side and sell-side participants. Pricing and execution is in a format familiar to OTC traders, with deep liquidity provided by a broad group of market makers, and booking to a single central counterparty. This mitigates counterparty credit risk and generates potentially significant capital, margin, and operational efficiencies. Transaction reporting to CME ClearPort is automated and immediate, with detailed post-trade reporting and analytics available,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<strong>Mark Suter, Executive Chairman and Co-Founder, Digital Vega.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>He added, &ldquo;Our new service provides liquidity access for more clients and market makers to trade with each other without having to establish new bilateral credit agreements, which we expect will result in increased liquidity for the market as a whole. We are encouraging clients to onboard to this service now so that they can fully test the system before they begin trading.&rdquo;</span></p>

<title>Oxera Note On Market Data Fees And Revenues</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/oxera-note-on-market-data-fees-and-revenues/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/oxera-note-on-market-data-fees-and-revenues/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Analysis, Market data fees, Revenues, ESMA, Regulation 
Summary:<br />Market data revenues stable. Pricing reasonable. Shift in display vs non-display data use. Small impact on end-investors. Overregulation concerns. Encourage ESMA to consider findings. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>With the debate around the costs of data in EU equity trading markets ongoing, FESE has commissioned Oxera to undertake an analysis on the evolution of market data fees and revenues since MiFID II. This study builds on similar analysis Oxera conducted in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oxera.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/design-of-equity-trading-markets-1.pdf">2019</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oxera.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Oxera-note-whats-the-data-on-market-data-updated-8-July-2022.pdf">2022</a>.</p>
<p>The note is particularly relevant in the current debate as it is published in the context of ESMA&rsquo;s consultation on the RTS on Reasonable Commercial Basis, which closed at the end of August (see our response&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fese.eu/blog/fese-response-to-the-esma-consultations-on-rcb-and-rts/">here</a>).</p>
<p>Oxera&rsquo;s analysis shows, inter alia, that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Market data revenues from stock exchanges have remained relatively stable over recent years;</li>
<li>This is consistent with the overall price of market data not having increased much overall. The note also considers the trends for different types of fees for display, non-display and redistribution licenses.&nbsp;</li>
<li>When considering the wider value chain, the cost of exchange data for end-investors is relatively small.</li>
</ul>
<p>In our view, the findings show that exchange market data pricing has remained reasonable, when considering the evolution of revenues and fees. The use of display data has decreased, while that of non-display data has increased, leading to a rebalancing of fees to reflect this shift. Additionally, fees have been adjusted to allow smaller clients to pay less. This is also happening in a context where costs have risen significantly in recent years due to a variety of factors such as increased regulation, general inflationary pressures, and the competition for talent. Exchange market data revenues have remained relatively stable and continue to represent only a small portion of the overall market data spend in the industry.</p>
<p>We encourage ESMA to consider the findings of this note in their work on the RTS on RCB, along with our response to the recent consultation. In the latter, we elaborate on the potential consequences of overregulation, including but not limited to a potential overreliance on the cost base alone to calculate the fees, and provide targeted suggestions to help shape the upcoming RTS effectively.</p>

<title>SET Market  Report For August 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/set-market-report-for-august-2024/</link>

<div> Rate cuts, capital flows, emerging markets, Thai stock exchange, derivatives market
Summary:<br />Chair Powell hints at rate cut, boosting market. Thai stocks rise with buybacks, tax incentives. TFEX sees higher trading volume.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jerome Powell, speaking at the annual Jackson Hole Economic Symposium, expressed confidence that inflation is within reach of the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target, with rate cuts on the horizon. Powell's speech has shaped market expectations for the first rate cut at the Fed's September meeting. As a result, capital flows are likely to shift towards equities and bonds in emerging markets with strong fundamentals, and a correction on Wall Street appears increasingly imminent following the recent upsurge.</p>
<p><b>SET Senior Executive Vice President Soraphol Tulayasathien</b> said that external factors have propelled the SET Index higher, while internal factors have simultaneously bolstered investor confidence. These internal factors include the clearer political landscape following the parliamentary vote for a new prime minister, stronger-than-expected Thai economic growth, and listed companies&rsquo; robust second-quarter earnings. Thai listed companies have consistently adopted share buybacks as a tool for financial liquidity management. Treasury stock activities reflect confidence among listed companies&rsquo; executives that the current share prices remain below their intrinsic value, prompting buying demand from investors. Moreover, analysts project increased fund flows for the remaining period of this year, supported by the government&rsquo;s tax incentive for investment in Thailand ESG Fund and the clear launch path of Vayupak Fund 1, which features a minimum return guarantee. These favorable factors are expected to attract investor interest and strengthen confidence in the Thai capital market.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Key highlights for August</b><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<ul>
<li>At the end of August 2024, the SET Index closed at 1,359.07 points, up 2.9 percent from the previous month, moving in line with other indices in the region. As a result, the benchmark index pared its loss to a mere 4.0 percent from the end of 2023.</li>
<li>For the eight months to August, industry groups that outpaced the SET Index were Technology, Consumer Products. and Agro &amp; Food Industry.</li>
<li>SET&rsquo;s and mai&rsquo;s average daily trading value in August 2024 fell 21.4 percent over the same period last year to THB 46.03 billion (approx. USD 1.37 billion) but soared 21.1 percent from the preceding month. For the first eight months of 2024. The average daily trading value dropped 22.2 percent over the same period a year before to THB 44.40 billion.&nbsp; </li>
<li>In August, there were no new listings on SET and mai.</li>
<li>The Thai stock exchange&rsquo;s forward P/E ratio at the end of August 2024 was 14.9 times, above the Asian stock markets&rsquo; average of 12.9 times. The historical P/E ratio stood at 16.4 times, exceeding the Asian stock markets&rsquo; average of 15.1 times.</li>
<li>Dividend yield ratio at the end of August 2024 was 3.50 percent, higher than the Asian stock markets&rsquo; average of 3.16 percent.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Derivatives Market</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Thailand Futures Exchange (TFEX)&rsquo;s daily trading volume in August 2024 averaged 498,404 contracts, up 31.2 percent from the previous month largely due to the higher trading volume of SET50 Index Futures and Single Stock Futures. For the first eight months of 2024, TFEX&rsquo;s daily trading volume dropped 18.3 percent over the same period last year to 444,557 contracts mainly due to the decline in trading volume of Single Stock Futures and SET50 Index Futures.</li>

<title>ASIC Calls On Product Issuers To Review Distribution Practices For DDO Compliance</title>

<div> surveillance, distribution obligations, product issuers, consumer questionnaires, stop orders
<br />
ASIC conducted surveillance on product issuers' distribution practices, finding flaws in consumer questionnaires leading to stop orders. Issuers must improve due diligence, marketing, and monitoring.
<br /><br />Summary:ASIC conducted surveillance on product issuers' distribution practices, finding flaws in consumer questionnaires leading to stop orders. Issuers must improve due diligence, marketing, and monitoring. <div>
<p><span>ASIC is calling on product issuers to ensure distribution practices are up to scratch, pointing to flawed consumer questionnaires being the catalyst for some recent interim stop orders.</span></p>
<p><span>The call to action follows ASIC&rsquo;s latest design and distribution obligations (DDO) surveillance, which looked at the obligation for product issuers to take reasonable steps to support appropriate distribution of their products. Poor product design and distribution puts consumers at risk of financial harm as they can end up with products that don&rsquo;t meet their needs.</span></p>
<p><span>ASIC reported the findings of its surveillance of 19 issuers of high-risk investment, insurance and credit products between October 2023 and August 2024 in&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-795-design-and-distribution-obligations-compliance-with-the-reasonable-steps-obligation/" title="REP 795 Design and distribution obligations: Compliance with the reasonable steps obligation">Report 795&nbsp;</a></span><a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-795-design-and-distribution-obligations-compliance-with-the-reasonable-steps-obligation/" title="REP 795 Design and distribution obligations: Compliance with the reasonable steps obligation"><em>Design and distribution obligations: Compliance with the reasonable steps obligation</em></a>&nbsp;(<span>REP 795).</span></p>
<p><span>ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland said while issuers had made inroads, improvements across the board are still required, so consumers can feel confident that the products they purchase suit their needs.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;This review provides a snapshot of compliance with the design and distribution obligations across multiple industries and products. Where there are opportunities to improve, we expect product issuers and distributors to reflect on the report&rsquo;s findings and improve their distribution practices,&rdquo; Mr Kirkland said.</span></p>
<p><span>ASIC&rsquo;s review revealed:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>many issuers had limited due diligence arrangements to assess and monitor third party distributors </span>&nbsp;</li>
<li><span>some issuers of high-risk products were relying on broad search terms in online marketing </span>&nbsp;</li>
<li><span>many issuers used poor quality consumer questionnaires, and</span>&nbsp;</li>
<li><span>only a few issuers monitored consumer outcomes and product performance.</span>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><span>The report recommends issuers improve distribution practices regarding the selection and supervision of distributors, training staff, marketing materials, consumer questionnaires, and information and monitoring outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Since the design and distribution obligations took effect in late 2021, ASIC has taken action to improve compliance with the law. We have commenced five civil proceedings, with three successful outcomes to date, issued over 80 stop orders and published the results of seven reviews,&rdquo; Mr Kirkland said.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&ldquo;In&nbsp;</span><a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-151mr-asic-successful-in-first-ddo-case-against-firstmac/"><span>ASIC&rsquo;s case against Firstmac</span><span>&nbsp;Limited</span></a><span>, the Federal Court found Firstmac breached its obligations when it sent product disclosure statements for one of its products to existing term deposit holders, without first taking reasonable steps to ensure consistency with its target market determination for the product.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&ldquo;While we await a decision on the penalty, this ruling highlights the importance of having a clear policy on distribution obligations that is circulated to customer-facing staff, who also receive appropriate training and monitoring.&rdquo;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Today, ASIC also released minor updates to Regulatory Guide 274 Product design and distribution obligations (RG 274) to provide greater clarity around ASIC&rsquo;s guidance on the appropriateness requirement for target market determinations (TMDs).  The changes to RG274 will not require product issuers to update their TMDs. </span></p>
<p><span>Mr Kirkland said DDO compliance remains a key focus for ASIC.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p><span>The DDO regime aims to help consumers obtain appropriate financial products by requiring issuers and distributors to have a consumer-centric approach to the design and distribution of products. Under</span>&nbsp;<span>DDO, an issuer must take reasonable steps that will, or are reasonably likely to, result in distribution being consistent with the TMD.</span></p>
<p><span>REP 795 follows Report 762&nbsp;</span><em>Design and distribution obligations: Investment products&nbsp;</em><span>(</span><a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-762-design-and-distribution-obligations-investment-products/"><span>REP 762</span></a><span>) and Report</span><span> </span><span>770&nbsp;</span><em>Design and distribution obligations: Retail OTC derivatives</em><span>&nbsp;(</span><a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-770-design-and-distribution-obligations-retail-otc-derivatives/"><span>REP 770</span></a><span>). </span></p>
<p><span>As part of&nbsp;</span><span>ASIC&rsquo;s latest review, ASIC</span>&nbsp;<span>raised concerns with a number of&nbsp;</span><span>issuers&nbsp;</span><span>who agreed to make</span><span>&nbsp;changes to improve their compliance with the reasonable steps obligation.&nbsp;</span><span>ASIC also issued two interim stop orders after observing reliance on a poor-quality consumer questionnaire by an issuer of a high-risk investment product (refer&nbsp;</span><a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-109mr-asic-issues-ddo-stop-orders-against-trademax-australia/"><span>24-109MR</span></a><span>). </span></p>
<p><span>ASIC has issued two other interim stop orders for similar concerns related to poor-quality questionnaires (refer&nbsp;</span><a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-120mr-asic-issues-ddo-stop-order-against-australian-unity-funds-management/"><span>24-120MR</span></a><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2023-releases/23-141mr-asic-issues-first-ddo-stop-order-for-failure-to-take-reasonable-steps-in-cfd-distribution/"><span>23-141MR</span></a><span>). These stop orders were revoked after the entities made changes to the questionnaires and, in some cases, to other areas relating to compliance with the reasonable steps obligation.</span></p>

<div> Research, Artificial Intelligence, Financial Services, Governance, Risks
<br />
The FMA researches AI use in NZ financial services, aiming to understand benefits, risks, and governance structures for responsible innovation.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash;&nbsp;has today published research on the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in New Zealand&rsquo;s financial services sector.</p>
<p>The research, undertaken as part of the&nbsp;FMA&rsquo;s occasional paper series, draws on responses from financial service providers in asset management, banking, financial advice and insurance.</p>
<p>FMA Chief Economist, Stuart Johnson, says, &ldquo;We reviewed how AI is currently used in New Zealand financial services and firm&rsquo;s plans for future applications. We sought to understand both the benefits and the risks to inform more oversight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;AI is a transformative technology, and application is evolving at pace. As financial services integrate AI, understanding its potential and limitations is crucial. Our findings emphasise the need for a balanced approach to harness AI's benefits while addressing governance and risk concerns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are aware that AI adoption in financial services offers significant opportunities but also presents emerging risks. Our research shares how institutions are beginning to navigate these challenges and the importance of robust governance structures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our focus on AI governance and risk management reflects our commitment to ensuring that financial innovations are introduced responsibly. By understanding current practices and future directions, we aim to support a balanced regulatory approach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Effective AI integration requires careful consideration of data quality, technology choice, and documentation. Our research underscores these aspects as critical for minimising risks and ensuring ethical use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The FMA is technology-neutral and pro-innovation. We believe that&nbsp;New Zealanders should have access to the same technological advancements as those in other countries.&nbsp;We want to see firms leverage AI to improve consumers&rsquo; experiences in financial markets and services. We are pleased that our&nbsp;discussions with stakeholders have revealed that firms are adopting AI with the goal of improving customer outcomes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The FMA will&nbsp;host a roundtable on 1 October 2024 with the study participants to further explore how AI and GenAI is being used in New Zealand&rsquo;s financial services and how firms are managing risks.</p>

<title>SEC As EQCF: Statement On Public Company Accounting Oversight Board; Notice Of Filing Of Proposed Rules On A Firm’s System Of Quality Control And Related Amendments To PCAOB Standards, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, Sept. 9, 2024</title>

<div> Revamp, PCAOB, Quality control, Audit deficiency rates, Implementation challenges
Summary:
The article discusses the concerns about the newly adopted quality control standard QC 1000 by the PCAOB, highlighting issues with design requirements, ambiguous expectations, intersection with other standards, and the questionable effectiveness of the external quality control function (EQCF). It also questions the compliance costs and the potential for firms to exit the market due to the standard. The article further addresses the concerns raised by commenters and poses critical questions to the PCAOB and the SEC. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Auditors play a critical role in maintaining healthy capital markets. Comprehensive, dynamic quality control systems help audit firms fulfill their mission. Troublingly high audit deficiency rates, though likely attributable to multiple causes, suggest that the five-year-long effort by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (&ldquo;PCAOB&rdquo; or &ldquo;Board&rdquo;) to revamp its outdated quality control standards was warranted.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-qc1000-090924#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Getting the quality control standard right, however, would have required more time for additional pointed questions, comment, reflection, and revision. The PCAOB, now with the Commission&rsquo;s assent, cut the process short and put out QC 1000, a standard that still needs work. Accordingly, I am unable to support it.</p>
<p>Ironically, with respect to a standard that focuses on quality control, the Commission has failed to perform the external quality control function which Congress entrusted to us. Congress established the PCAOB, a nonprofit corporation, &ldquo;to oversee the audit of public companies that are subject to the securities laws, and related matters, in order to protect the interests of investors and further the public interest in the preparation of informative, accurate, and independent audit reports . . . .&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-qc1000-090924#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Congress directed the PCAOB to establish audit standards, including quality control standards.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-qc1000-090924#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;For these standards to become effective, Congress required Commission approval under the same process that we use in considering whether to approve self-regulatory organizations&rsquo; rules.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-qc1000-090924#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;That process affords the Commission the discretion to institute proceedings to consider whether to approve a rule.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-qc1000-090924#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;Because one Board member dissented and numerous commenters expressed serious concerns with the PCAOB&rsquo;s final standard, we should have instituted proceedings to afford us, the PCAOB, and the public more time to think about this standard. Instead, wishing away any difficulties, we are rushing an approval order out the door.</p>
<p>The standard will pose many significant implementation challenges, but several concerns particularly stand out. First, even though many registered firms do not perform audits of issuers or broker-dealers,&nbsp;<i>all</i>&nbsp;registered firms must design a quality control system that complies with QC 1000. Firms, as part of the current registration process, file a quality control statement.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-qc1000-090924#_edn6" name="_ednref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;The comprehensive and prescriptive QC 1000, however, requires much more, which is the basis for concerns about the design-only requirement, which requires firms&mdash;regardless of whether they will use them&mdash;to design quality control systems.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-qc1000-090924#_edn7" name="_ednref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;For the up to sixty percent of registered firms that are not performing issuer or broker-dealer audits,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-qc1000-090924#_edn8" name="_ednref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;designing a quality control system that satisfies QC 1000 will be difficult, costly, and pointless. Difficult because a firm that is not auditing issuers or broker-dealers&mdash;or planning to do so in the near-term&mdash;will be designing a hypothetical system.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-qc1000-090924#_edn9" name="_ednref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;Costly because QC 1000 is more rigorous and prescriptive than other quality control standards these firms might be using.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-qc1000-090924#_edn10" name="_ednref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;Pointless because QC 1000&rsquo;s design exercise is tailored specifically for audits of issuers and broker-dealers, meaning it is hypothetical and of little benefit to investors for firms not doing these audits.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-qc1000-090924#_edn11" name="_ednref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;Even a firm that might want to take on issuer or broker-dealer audits eventually might want to wait to design a quality control system closer to the time it begins considering whether to take on engagements since a generic quality control system may&mdash;despite that firm&rsquo;s best effort&mdash;be inapt for the task at hand. Neither the Commission nor the PCAOB is bothered by the likelihood that firms may deregister rather than comply with the design requirement in QC 1000.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-qc1000-090924#_edn12" name="_ednref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;The Commission and the PCAOB both wave away questions about whether the Board has legal authority to adopt a design-only requirement that applies to firms that do not perform audits of issuers or broker-dealers.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-qc1000-090924#_edn13" name="_ednref13">[13]</a></p>
<p>Second, despite the Board&rsquo;s frequent emphasis that QC 1000 strikes the right balance between prescription and principles-based obligations and that its expectations are clear, the standard leaves lots of room for second-guessing through inspections and enforcement. The standard has many prescriptive elements that are not risk-based, such as requiring all identified engagement deficiencies to be remediated. Throughout the proposing release, the Board suggests that prescribed elements will satisfy QC 1000 expectations, only to add an immediate &ldquo;however&rdquo; that pulls the props out from under this clarity.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-qc1000-090924#_edn14" name="_ednref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;The Board&rsquo;s pithy description of the fluid nature of the quality objective selection process&mdash;the standard &ldquo;set[s] forth a floor rather than a ceiling&rdquo;&mdash; could be applied to just about every aspect of QC 1000.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-qc1000-090924#_edn15" name="_ednref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;A firm&rsquo;s quality control system should be tailored to its unique risks and circumstances, but, as written, the standard will pose many implementation challenges and perhaps scare people away from taking leadership roles because the scope of their liability under such a far-reaching and ambiguous standard is unclear.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-qc1000-090924#_edn16" name="_ednref16">[16]</a></p>
<p>Third, the Board did not take adequate account of how QC 1000 will interact with other quality control standards from other standard setters. Firms might have to maintain multiple quality control systems or juggle inconsistencies across the different standards.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-qc1000-090924#_edn17" name="_ednref17">[17]</a>&nbsp;A firm&rsquo;s quality control system, for example, might be effective under another quality control standard but not QC 1000.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-qc1000-090924#_edn18" name="_ednref18">[18]</a>&nbsp;To address competitive concerns, the Board could have allowed small firms to design and operate their quality control systems under either QC 1000 or one of the other standards.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-qc1000-090924#_edn19" name="_ednref19">[19]</a>&nbsp;As one commenter explained, &ldquo;implementing yet an additional (or in many cases, a third) new standard intending to address the same objectives will distract limited firm resources away from continuous audit quality improvement&rdquo; and could cause firms to &ldquo;spend more time differentiating between and ensuring compliance over the multiple standards across multiple jurisdictions.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-qc1000-090924#_edn20" name="_ednref20">[20]</a>&nbsp;In a bit of having one&rsquo;s regulatory cake and eating it too,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-qc1000-090924#_edn21" name="_ednref21">[21]</a>&nbsp;while the Board deems these other QC standards insufficiently similar in coverage and prescription to allow them to substitute for QC 1000, the similarities are more than sufficient when calculating implementation costs,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-qc1000-090924#_edn22" name="_ednref22">[22]</a>&nbsp;and even compliance dates.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-qc1000-090924#_edn23" name="_ednref23">[23]</a></p>
<p>Fourth, because the requirement that large audit firms establish an external quality control function (&ldquo;EQCF&rdquo;) differed materially from what was proposed, many questions remain unanswered.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-qc1000-090924#_edn24" name="_ednref24">[24]</a>&nbsp;The responsibilities of the EQCF must include, at a minimum, &ldquo;evaluating the significant judgments made and the related conclusions reached by the firm when evaluating and reporting on the effectiveness of its QC system.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-qc1000-090924#_edn25" name="_ednref25">[25]</a>&nbsp;What does this role entail in practice? What procedures must the EQCF follow to reach and document its review? When must that review take place? What if its judgments differ from the firm&rsquo;s judgments? Does this role&rsquo;s specificity, which differs from the proposal, require some or all large firms to set up a new audit quality oversight function, or are the functions they already have in place sufficient? If this function is new, who would be likely to perform such a function? What type of liability might the EQCF face?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-qc1000-090924#_edn26" name="_ednref26">[26]</a>&nbsp;Does the answer differ depending on whether the person is an auditor? Does the EQCF requirement broaden the PCAOB&rsquo;s reach to parties over which it has no legal jurisdiction? Will EQCFs be subject to firm discipline? Will the firms have to share confidential information with the EQCF, and what are the legal implications of doing so? Given the likely expense of the requirement as adopted, should the threshold for application of the requirement be higher&mdash;perhaps applying only to firms that audit more than 500 issuers, as some commenters suggested? The PCAOB submitted a lengthy comment letter to the file, which attempted to address some of these questions,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-qc1000-090924#_edn27" name="_ednref27">[27]</a>&nbsp;but the post-standard commentary of the Board is not the way to address fundamental questions about a role that was first fleshed out in the Board&rsquo;s adopting release.</p>
<p>As I noted at the start, quality control is important, and I am glad the PCAOB is focused on it. Much of the Board&rsquo;s work is good and the PCAOB staff dedicated commendable effort to this critical project, but this standard is not ready for prime time. We need more public input, which would have required the Board to repropose or us to take the step of instituting proceedings. I appreciate all the work that the staff at the Commission has done over the past several months. A lot of midnight oil has been burned. Thank you especially to the staff in the Offices of Chief Accountant and General Counsel and the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. I do have some questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>For OGC: The Commission&rsquo;s Order describes &ldquo;the statements in the PCAOB [August 2024] response letter as being on par with statements made by the Board in the Adopting Release about the scope and application of the QC 1000 requirements.&rdquo; Are they binding on the PCAOB? Are they binding on PCAOB registered firms? If statements in the letter conflict with the PCAOB&rsquo;s adopting release, which controls?</li>
<li>Is requiring audit firms that do not audit issuers or broker-dealers to design quality control systems that comply with the new standards a backdoor way to expand the PCAOB&rsquo;s jurisdiction beyond the audits of issuers and broker-dealers?</li>
<li>According to the PCAOB, &ldquo;approximately 51% of firms have not performed an engagement under PCAOB standards for an issuer or broker-dealer in the past five years.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-qc1000-090924#_edn28" name="_ednref28">[28]</a>&nbsp;How does the PCAOB plan to enforce compliance with QC 1000 for firms in general and, more specifically, for firms that do not audit issuers or broker-dealers?</li>
<li>Some commenters looked back to SOX 404 implementation, which was notoriously costly for auditors and issuers, for a sense of what QC 1000 implementation might require. The PCAOB noted the potential relevance of the SOX 404 experience to QC 1000: &ldquo;Section 404 is similar to QC 1000 in that Section 404 was a policy shock that led large public companies to improve their internal control practices. In addition, while QC 1000 is not an internal control framework per se, it does reflect similar principles as COSO, the industry standard control framework that was widely relied upon to implement Section 404.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-qc1000-090924#_edn29" name="_ednref29">[29]</a>&nbsp;Should we expect the same kinds of problems and expenses for auditors and issuers that we saw with the introduction of SOX 404? What steps is the PCAOB taking to mitigate the risk that SOX-404-like problems arise?</li>
<li>Will the information provided to the PCAOB on Form QC have confidentiality protections even though it is provided outside of the inspections process and thus not subject to SOX &sect; 105(b)(5)(A)?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-qc1000-090924#_edn30" name="_ednref30">[30]</a>&nbsp;If not, what adverse consequences might flow from this information being available to the public?</li>
<li>The Commission&rsquo;s Order states that &ldquo;1,194 of the 1,554 (i.e., 77%) firms registered with the PCAOB are unlikely to incur significant incremental costs under QC 1000.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-qc1000-090924#_edn31" name="_ednref31">[31]</a>&nbsp;That 23% of firms will incur significant incremental costs is striking. Why didn&rsquo;t the PCAOB afford these firms additional time for compliance?</li>
<li>For DERA: The PCAOB acknowledges that QC 1000 could cause firms to exit, raise costs for audit clients, deter mergers and acquisitions, and exacerbate the talent crisis in the audit profession, but finds silver linings in each of those clouds. The Board&rsquo;s reasoning at times seems strained. For example, with respect to the increased demand on firm personnel, the Board explains that: &ldquo;To meet increased demand for staff resources, some firms may choose to hire additional experienced staff. It is possible that the labor demand shock could result in increased wages and potentially higher audit fees, which could be exacerbated by the concentration of large firms in the audit market. Higher wages could in turn help firms attract and retain a skilled workforce or encourage qualified individuals to take essential roles at firms.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-qc1000-090924#_edn32" name="_ednref32">[32]</a>&nbsp;How plausible is that scenario?</li>
<li>Given that the Commission often imposes PCAOB-registered-auditor requirements on auditors who serve entities other than public companies or broker-dealers, how has the staff taken into account the increased costs for these entities resulting from the heightened quality control standard?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-qc1000-090924#_edn33" name="_ednref33">[33]</a></li>
<li>Why does the standard set a fixed annual evaluation date of September 30? Why not, as one commenter suggested, allow firms to select a date that, for example, &ldquo;align[s] their quality control period with their fiscal year end to emphasize the role of quality in a partner&rsquo;s performance and compensation&rdquo;?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-qc1000-090924#_edn34" name="_ednref34">[34]</a></li>
<li>Although more than twenty years have passed since the Board adopted its interim QC standards, audit firms have not sat idle. As the Board relays, &ldquo;[m]any firms have implemented a number of changes to their QC systems to remediate their QC deficiencies. Changes brought about through remediation are wide-ranging and can touch upon all major elements of the current QC standards.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-qc1000-090924#_edn35" name="_ednref35">[35]</a>&nbsp;The Board then goes on to list a long list of substantive changes and trends associated with industry-led QC improvements.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-qc1000-090924#_edn36" name="_ednref36">[36]</a>&nbsp;Given this progress, what do you anticipate will be the largest changes to firms&rsquo; quality control systems arising from this standard?</li>

<p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-qc1000-090924#_ednref16" name="_edn16">[16]</a>&nbsp;The Board says that &ldquo;to achieve an appropriate tone at the top, . . . it is not enough for firm leadership to &lsquo;talk the talk.&rsquo; They also have to &lsquo;walk the walk.&rsquo;&rdquo; PCAOB Adopting Release at 111. True enough, but in light of the ramped up liability firm leadership will face under QC 1000, will firms be able to find suitable individuals willing to take that first step into the minefield? As the Board explains, individuals&rsquo; liability is very much in view: &ldquo;Under QC 1000, the individuals who are assigned specific responsibilities with respect to the QC system could be charged with violations if they fail to comply with those enumerated responsibilities, as well as for contributing to firm violations or failing reasonably to supervise. . . . Those individuals must exercise due professional care (see paragraph .10), and their failure to properly discharge their duties&mdash;for example, to establish or direct the establishment of certain QC-system reporting lines (see paragraph .14b), to certify the firm&rsquo;s Form QC report to the PCAOB (see paragraphs .14d and .15b), or to timely communicate certain information to others (see paragraphs .16b and .17b)&mdash; would constitute violations of QC 1000. So while current QC standards generally require either a primary violation by the firm to trigger an individual&rsquo;s potential liability under Rule 3502 or a primary violation by another associated person to trigger a supervisory person&rsquo;s potential liability under Section 105(c)(6) of Sarbanes-Oxley, QC 1000 creates a framework in which an individual&rsquo;s failure to discharge prescribed responsibilities could give rise to individual liability without regard to whether primary violations were committed by another. That is not to say, however, that the individuals filling the roles specified in paragraphs .11 and .12 of QC 1000 no longer can be charged with contributing to violations by the firm or for failing to reasonably supervise an associated person who commits certain violations.&rdquo; PCAOB Adopting Release at 85. For key roles, including being &ldquo;ultimately responsible and accountable for the QC system as a whole,&rdquo; the board insists on having one person bear the responsibility. QC 1000.11.&nbsp;<i>See also</i>&nbsp;QC 1000.12 (noting that specified roles &ldquo;cannot be shared, but rather must be assigned to only one individual&rdquo;).</p>

Such firms will be able to leverage the investments they make to comply with the requirements of these other standards when meeting the requirements of QC 1000.

<div> advertisements, Investment advisers, SEC, violations, civil penalties
Summary:
Nine investment advisers settled charges with the SEC for violating the Marketing Rule, disseminating untrue or unsubstantiated advertisements, and agreed to pay civil penalties. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against nine registered investment advisers for violating the Marketing Rule by disseminating advertisements that included untrue or unsubstantiated statements of material fact or testimonials, endorsements, or third-party ratings that lacked required disclosures. All nine firms have agreed to settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges and to pay $1,240,000 in combined civil penalties.</p>
<p>The nine firms and their penalties are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abacus Planning Group Inc. agreed to pay a civil penalty of $150,000;</li>
<li>AZ Apice Capital Management LLC agreed to pay a civil penalty of $70,000;</li>
<li>Beta Wealth Group, Inc. agreed to pay a civil penalty of $80,000;</li>
<li>Droms Strauss Advisors Inc. agreed to pay a civil penalty of $85,000;</li>
<li>Howard Bailey Securities LLC agreed to pay a civil penalty of $90,000;</li>
<li>Integrated Advisors Network LLC agreed to pay a civil penalty of $325,000;</li>
<li>Professional Financial Strategies Inc. agreed to pay a civil penalty of $60,000;</li>
<li>Richard Bernstein Advisors LLC agreed to pay a civil penalty of $295,000; and</li>
<li>TS Bank d/b/a Callahan Financial Planning agreed to pay a civil penalty of $85,000.</li>
</ul>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s orders find that Abacus and Callahan Financial published advertisements with untrue statements about third-party ratings and that Callahan Financial posted an advertisement falsely claiming that it was a member of an organization that did not exist. The SEC&rsquo;s orders find that AZ Apice, Callahan Financial, Droms Strauss, and Integrated Advisors disseminated advertisements that claimed to provide conflict-free advisory services, which the firms were not able to substantiate. According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, Beta Wealth disseminated advertisements that it could not substantiate regarding an award provided to a firm principal. According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, Howard Bailey disseminated advertisements claiming to contain two testimonials, but neither actually came from current clients. It also advertised endorsements that did not disclose that the endorser was a paid, non-client of Howard Bailey in videos, on social media, and on physical objects such as bags and flags. Finally, as set forth in the orders, Abacus, Beta Wealth, Professional Financial, and Richard Bernstein Advisors included in their advertisements third-party ratings, some of which were more than five years old, without disclosing the dates on which the ratings were given or the periods of time upon which the ratings were based.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Marketing Rule&rsquo;s provisions regarding truthfulness, substantiation, and disclosure are critical to protecting investors. The advertisements at issue in each of these actions violated the Marketing Rule and posed a serious risk of misleading investors,&rdquo; said Corey Schuster, Co-Chief of the SEC Division of Enforcement&rsquo;s Asset Management Unit.&nbsp; &ldquo;Investment advisers must comply with all aspects of the Marketing Rule, and we will continue to hold them accountable when they fail to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, all of the firms consented to the entry of orders finding that they violated the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and ordering them to be censured, cease and desist from violating the charged provisions, comply with certain undertakings, and pay the civil penalties referenced above.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s ongoing investigation of potential Marketing Rule violations is being conducted by Marilyn Ampolsk, Jonathan Menitove, Donna Norman, and Emily Shea and supervised by Colin Forbes, Brianna Ripa, Andrew Dean, and Mr. Schuster, all of the Asset Management Unit.&nbsp; The team was assisted by Alex Lefferts of the Division of Enforcement&rsquo;s Office of Investigative and Market Analytics and Janet Grossnickle, Julia Gilmer, Jennifer Paul, Jennifer Sawin, Austin Chen, and David Marcinkus of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Investment Management.</p>

<div> Securities and Exchange Commission, Crypto-assets, Safeguarding, Distributed Ledger Technology, Accounting Consultations
Summary:<br />The SEC Chief Accountant discussed arrangements for safeguarding crypto-assets, including for bank holding companies, brokers, and distributed ledger technology. <div>
<p><span>Introduction<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/munter-speech-safeguarding-crypto-assets-09-09-24#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>[1]</span></a></span></p>
<p>Thank you to the AICPA for inviting me to speak with you today. Let me begin by saying that I am here in my official capacity as the Chief Accountant of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the views I express here are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Commission, the Commissioners or other members of the staff.</p>
<p>As many of you may know, in March 2022, the staff of the Division of Corporation Finance and the Office of the Chief Accountant published Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (&ldquo;SAB 121&rdquo;)<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/munter-speech-safeguarding-crypto-assets-09-09-24#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;to communicate views of the staff regarding the accounting by entities that have obligations to safeguard crypto-assets held for their platform users. The views expressed in SAB 121 were the direct result of consultations from entities seeking the staff&rsquo;s views on their accounting for certain crypto-asset safeguarding arrangements. The staff views communicated in SAB 121 remain unchanged&mdash;the staff believes that an entity with safeguarding arrangements that align with the fact pattern described in SAB 121 should present a liability on its balance sheet to reflect its obligation to safeguard the crypto-assets held for others, along with a corresponding asset that is separate and distinct from the crypto-assets held for others. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the issuance of SAB 121, entities have requested the views of the staff in the Office of the Chief Accountant on the accounting for a variety of other fact patterns involving the use of distributed ledger technology and the safeguarding of crypto-assets that present varying degrees of legal, technological, and regulatory risks and uncertainties. In certain cases, entities have demonstrated how the specific risks and uncertainties involved in their fact patterns are different than those contemplated in SAB 121. Today, I would like to highlight certain observations from recent accounting consultations with entities where the staff in the Office of the Chief Accountant has not objected to an entity&rsquo;s conclusion that its arrangement was not within the scope of SAB 121 and that it should not recognize a liability for an obligation to safeguard crypto-assets held for others. In each of the accounting consultations I&rsquo;ll describe, the staff&rsquo;s conclusion was based on the specific facts, circumstances, representations, and warranties by the entity and its outside advisers, including in legal opinions, with respect to the entity&rsquo;s arrangement.&nbsp; Those conclusions would not necessarily be the same for different fact patterns.</p>
<p><span>Bank Holding Companies</span></p>
<p>Starting with a recent accounting consultation from an entity that is a bank holding company, the entity requested the staff&rsquo;s views on the accounting for its obligations within a regulated bank subsidiary (the &ldquo;Bank&rdquo;) to safeguard crypto-assets for institutional customers only. In this specific fact pattern, the Bank held the cryptographic private key information that provides access to the crypto-assets being safeguarded by the Bank. While no individual factor was determinative, the entity provided the following facts and representations, among others, to support its conclusion that it sufficiently mitigated the unique risks and uncertainties present in its arrangements to safeguard crypto-assets, such that it should not recognize a liability on its balance sheet for an obligation to safeguard crypto-assets:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, prior to the consultation, the Bank obtained written approval from its prudential regulator at the state level for its specific proposed crypto-asset safeguarding activities following the regulator&rsquo;s review of the governance and risk management practices designed for those activities. The Bank also engaged with its primary federal prudential regulator, consistent with the regulator&rsquo;s stated expectations.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/munter-speech-safeguarding-crypto-assets-09-09-24#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;The entity stated that the Bank has comprehensive operational controls in place to mitigate risks associated with holding a private key for its customers&rsquo; blockchain wallets. The entity also stated that these controls and processes are subject to continuous supervision and oversight by the Bank&rsquo;s prudential regulators, including certain limitations on the types of crypto-assets that can be safeguarded for customers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Bank will hold its institutional customers&rsquo; crypto-assets in what it stated would be a bankruptcy-remote manner. Each customer&rsquo;s crypto-assets will be held in an individual blockchain wallet for which the customer is the beneficial owner. This wallet is segregated from wallets that hold crypto-assets for other customers or for the entity, and from other assets. The Bank also stated that it has entered into crypto-asset safeguarding contractual agreements with its institutional customers that limit the Bank&rsquo;s activities to holding and transferring crypto-assets based on customer instructions, with no ability for the Bank to use or otherwise rehypothecate its customers&rsquo; crypto-assets.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The entity obtained a legal opinion from outside counsel supporting its &ldquo;bankruptcy-remote&rdquo; conclusion that based on the manner and legal structure in which the Bank will safeguard the crypto-assets, in the event of insolvency, the crypto-assets should not be the property of the Bank receivership estate and should not be available for distribution by the FDIC as receiver to the Bank&rsquo;s creditors.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Bank negotiated with its institutional customers the contractual terms and conditions to be included in its crypto-asset safeguarding agreements that clearly set forth the standard of care the Bank will be responsible for exercising and the scope of the Bank&rsquo;s liability, thereby mitigating risks that the Bank will be exposed to liability for blockchain-specific risks that are outside of the Bank&rsquo;s direct control.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>And finally, the entity stated that it has a robust process for assessing regulatory, legal, and technological risks and uncertainties on an ongoing basis specific to each particular crypto-asset the Bank is considering safeguarding for its institutional customers.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the specific facts and representations presented by the entity regarding the crypto-asset safeguarding activities to be performed by the Bank, the staff did not object to the entity&rsquo;s conclusion that the arrangement was not within the scope of SAB 121 and that it should not recognize on its balance sheet a safeguarding liability measured based on the fair value of the crypto-assets the Bank is responsible for holding for its institutional customers. The entity noted that it would provide disclosure in its SEC filings about the extent of crypto-assets safeguarded and the relevant risk factors and impacts to risk management, as well as the significant judgments made in reaching its accounting policy conclusion.</p>
<p><span>Introducing Brokers and Dealers</span></p>
<p>The staff has also addressed a number of fact patterns where a registered broker-dealer is involved in facilitating the purchase, sale, and holding of crypto-assets by others (i.e., an introducing broker-dealer). These registered introducing broker-dealers have generally entered into an arrangement with a third party (which may be an unaffiliated third party or an affiliate of the introducing broker-dealer) through which the third party will provide crypto-asset trade execution and safeguarding services for customers of the introducing broker-dealers. The introducing broker-dealer, or a related party of the introducing broker-dealer, typically provides an interface that allows the introducing broker-dealer's customers to submit crypto-asset transaction orders and then transmits those transaction orders to the third party for fulfillment.</p>
<p>In these entity-specific consultations, and in similar fact patterns where an introducing broker-dealer is involved in arrangements through which customers invest in or hold crypto-assets, the staff has communicated that it would not object to a conclusion that, for the introducing broker-dealer, the arrangement is not within the scope of SAB 121 and the introducing broker-dealer should not recognize a liability on its balance sheet to reflect an obligation to safeguard crypto-assets related to the crypto-assets held for its customers at the third party given the existence of the following facts and circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>No Possession of the Cryptographic Key.</span>&nbsp;Neither the introducing broker-dealer, nor a person or entity acting as agent for the introducing broker-dealer, has rights to, or controls or possesses in any manner, the cryptographic private key information (or any part or portion of the information) necessary to transfer any crypto-assets held by the third party on behalf of the customer.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>The Third Party is the Agent of the Customer.</span>&nbsp;The third party is the agent of the customer and does not act as an agent of the introducing broker-dealer with respect to the safeguarding, transfer, or disposition of the crypto-assets or funds the third party holds on behalf of the customer, and both the third party and the introducing broker-dealer acknowledge the absence of an agency relationship. In these consultations, the staff has found the combination of the following factors persuasive evidence that the third party is acting as an agent of the customer rather than the introducing broker-dealer:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> 
<ul>
<li>First, the introducing broker-dealer has an express written agreement with the customer that the broker-dealer will not serve as agent for the customer with respect to the safeguarding, transfer, or disposition of the crypto-assets or funds held by the third party on behalf of the customer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> 
<ul>
<li>The introducing broker-dealer has clear and prominent disclosure (e.g., in marketing materials, on customer interfaces) that safeguarding, transfer, or disposition services are provided by the third party and not by the broker-dealer or its agents.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> 
<ul>
<li>The third party treats the customer as a direct accountholder and is solely responsible for providing account information, including statements and confirmations, directly to the customer with respect to the crypto-assets and funds the third party holds on behalf of the customer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> 
<ul>
<li>The customer has a contractual relationship with the third party whereby the customer has the legal authority and practical ability to transmit instructions directly to the third party (without the intermediation of the broker-dealer) with respect to the safeguarding, transfer, or disposition of any crypto-assets or funds held by the third party on behalf of the customer, including instructions to move a crypto-asset to another location or wallet outside of the third party&rsquo;s control, and to transfer funds derived from the sale of a crypto-asset or otherwise held by the third party to the customer&rsquo;s bank account without any involvement of the introducing broker-dealer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> 
<ul>
<li>The third party provides the customer with up-to-date information (e.g., phone number, email address, web-portal) with which the customer can contact the third party directly.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> 
<ul>
<li>The third party is responsible for resolving any complaints or disputes that the customer may have relating to the safeguarding, transfer, or disposition of the crypto-assets or funds that the third party holds on behalf of the customer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> 
<ul>
<li>And finally, the customer's crypto-asset account at the third party will continue to exist and the third party will continue to take instructions from the customer with respect to the safeguarding, transfer, or disposition of the customer's crypto-assets even if: (a) the customer closes its securities account at, or otherwise terminates its commercial relationship with, the introducing broker-dealer; or (b) the introducing broker-dealer ceases to operate or is subject to a formal liquidation proceeding or receivership.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Legal Opinion.&nbsp;</span>The introducing broker-dealer obtains an opinion from outside legal counsel that supports the following three assertions:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> 
<ul>
<li>First, the third party is acting as an agent for the customer, and not the introducing broker-dealer, with respect to the safeguarding, transfer, or disposition of the crypto-assets or funds the third party holds on behalf of the customer; &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> 
<ul>
<li>Second, the broker-dealer has no contractual obligation under applicable law to compensate the customer for any loss arising from the third party&rsquo;s safeguarding, transfer, or disposition of crypto-assets or funds it holds on behalf of the customer; and</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> 
<ul>
<li>Third, crypto-assets or funds that the third party holds on behalf of the customer would not be included in the estate of the broker-dealer if the broker-dealer were subject to a formal liquidation proceeding or receivership.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Other Uses of Distributed Ledger Technology</span></p>
<p>In addition to the fact patterns I&rsquo;ve just described regarding an entity&rsquo;s involvement in the safeguarding of crypto-assets for others, the staff of the Office of the Chief Accountant has also received accounting consultations from entities where distributed ledger or blockchain technology is used to facilitate certain types of transactions. For example, the staff has seen fact patterns where distributed ledger technology is utilized by entities to track holdings and transfers of traditional financial assets. In some fact patterns, these traditional financial assets have been issued in &ldquo;tokenized&rdquo; form representing a bond or fractional share of a bond on a distributed ledger.</p>
<p>While the staff&rsquo;s determination is based upon specific facts and circumstances, in many cases the staff has not objected to an entity&rsquo;s conclusion that its arrangement was not within the scope of SAB 121 and that it should not recognize a liability on its balance sheet to reflect an obligation to safeguard crypto-assets for others. In this regard, the staff has seen fact patterns where the design of the distributed ledger technology system allows the entity to control recording issuances and/or transfers of assets, including the ability for the entity to correct errors, if needed. Additionally, the staff has seen fact patterns where entities were able to attribute legal ownership of the traditional assets to their specific customers, which can also involve interoperability of the distributed ledger with traditional recordkeeping systems that are maintained by the entity (for example, reconciliation with customer databases and non-distributed ledger systems for customers to submit instructions to purchase, sell, or transfer their assets).</p>
<p><span>Conclusion</span></p>
<p>In summary, the staff&rsquo;s views in SAB 121 remain unchanged, and absent particular mitigating facts and circumstances, the staff believes an entity should record a liability on its balance sheet to reflect its obligation to safeguard crypto-assets held for others. I believe that such financial reporting provides relevant, timely information that investors need to assess the unique risks and uncertainties related to safeguarding crypto-assets for others. As I&rsquo;ve highlighted today, the staff has recently addressed particular fact patterns related to crypto-assets and distributed ledger technology that were not contemplated by SAB 121. In those instances, given the specific facts and circumstances of different arrangements, the staff has not objected to entities&rsquo; conclusions that the particular arrangement was not within the scope of SAB 121 and that they should not record a crypto-asset safeguarding liability on-balance sheet.</p>
<p>As always, we remain available for consultations<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/munter-speech-safeguarding-crypto-assets-09-09-24#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;with any entity who requests the staff&rsquo;s views on their accounting conclusions, including those related to obligations to safeguard crypto-assets for others.</p>

<title>Modernizing Audit Firm Quality Control Standards, SEC Commissioner Jaime Lizárraga, Sept. 9, 2024</title>

<div> Audit, Sarbanes-Oxley Act, QC standards, PCAOB, compliance
<br />
Summary: 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires PCAOB to establish and modify quality control standards for audit firms to address deficiencies and protect investors. It has recently adopted a modernized, risk-based standard, including an external quality control function for larger firms, to improve compliance and protect the public interest. 
 <div>
<p>The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, enacted unanimously in the U.S. Senate and nearly unanimously in the U.S. House, explicitly required the PCAOB (&ldquo;Board&rdquo;) to establish, and modify, quality control (&ldquo;QC&rdquo;) standards. This important law required the Board to establish expert advisory boards to make recommendations on QC standards. When registering with the Board, auditing firms are required to include a statement on QC policies. And when inspecting audit firms, the Board is required to evaluate QC systems.</p>
<p>Congress enacted these provisions in 2002 to address accounting fraud and systemic misconduct in financial reporting by several public companies. The law also addressed the failure of several audit firms to fulfill their role as gatekeepers. These events undermined public and market confidence in the financial reporting system of the time.</p>
<p>Congress advanced the general principle that strong QC systems are a powerful tool at auditors&rsquo; disposal and are essential for protecting investors. They ensure consistency in the preparation and issuance of informative, accurate, and independent audit reports.</p>
<p>Current QC standards were developed decades ago. The auditing environment has changed significantly since that time, but the standards have lagged far behind.</p>
<p>Audit deficiencies reported by Board inspectors in recent years suggest that some firms&rsquo; QC systems are not providing reasonable assurance that its personnel comply with the firm&rsquo;s standards of quality.</p>
<p>Recent Board inspection reports indicate that 46 percent of the engagements reviewed in 2023 had at least one significant deficiency, compared to 40 percent in 2022, and 34 percent in 2021. This is a concerning trend.</p>
<p>For several years, the Board&rsquo;s advisory groups have generally supported strengthening the QC standard.</p>
<p>This past May, the Board adopted an integrated, risk-based standard, one that sets out quality objectives and key processes for all firms&rsquo; QC systems.</p>
<p>This modernized standard achieves a careful balance between a risk-based approach and standardized requirements. The result is a common baseline that fosters predictability and a level playing field.</p>
<p>All Board-registered firms are required to design a QC system that complies with the new standard. But the part of the standard requiring an external quality control function (&ldquo;EQCF&rdquo;) applies only to firms that audit more than 100 issuers annually. In 2023, only 14 firms, out of a total of more than 1600 registered firms, met this threshold.</p>
<p>The EQCF is based on the notion that a second pair of impartial eyes can be helpful when evaluating the significant judgments and conclusions that an audit firm has made with respect to its QC system. This provision has been informed by, and evolved from, extensive stakeholder input over many years.</p>
<p>As required by law, the Commission&rsquo;s staff has determined that the Board&rsquo;s amendments to an audit firm&rsquo;s system of quality control standards is consistent with Title I of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and associated rules and regulations. Following its own thorough review of the Board&rsquo;s efforts, Commission staff has also determined that the amendment is necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors and is recommending Commission approval.</p>
<p>Because the amendments will help audit firms design, implement, and operate more effective QC systems, and potentially contribute to improved compliance with professional audit standards, I am pleased to support the staff&rsquo;s recommendation.</p>

<br /><br />Summary: The Women in Clearing Series features female leaders in the clearing industry. Elena Tonetto shares her career journey and insights. <div>
<p>Following the successful launch of the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12789353/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><b>Women in Clearing Network</b></a>,<b>&nbsp;</b>in March 2024 we launched&nbsp;<b>EACH&rsquo;s Women in Clearing Series</b>, an initiative with the objective of featuring a key female leader on a regular basis to inspire other professionals in the industry.</p>
<p>This month&rsquo;s leader is&nbsp;<b>Elena Tonetto</b>.&nbsp;Elena is a government affairs professional currently working as Senior Policy Adviser at EACH, the trade organisation representing the interests of European CCPs. She joined EACH in April 2019 and is currently responsible for the EACH policy and legal work, coordinating advocacy campaigns and educational projects to raise awareness about the clearing world and the crucial role played by CCPs in maintaining financial stability. Her previous experience includes different government affairs positions in the banking industry, consulting and the Council of the European Union.</p>
<p>Elena&nbsp;has kindly shared the following insights about her personal and professional journey by responding to three questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>What was the aspect of yourself that you had to work on the most to get where you are now?</b></li>
</ul>
<p>There are several aspects of myself that I have worked on all these years (and still do!). Most importantly, the ability to rely on myself and my own ability to handle situations I had not encountered before. My journey began with the decision to move to Brussels with no family, friends or a network of contacts, and having to build up all of these things over time. It continued with the discovery of the small but challenging world known as the &ldquo;EU Bubble&rdquo; and, with it, the need to quickly adapt to a fast moving and extremely diversified environment I was not used to before. This is still going on today with the new - but stimulating! - challenges I often face when it comes to working in an Association that comprises of Members from a wide variety of European countries, who sometimes have different positions and points of views. This has definitely taught me to develop my diplomacy skills and the mindset to forge a compromise whenever possible.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>What key tip would you give for professionals to successfully develop in their careers?</b></li>
</ul>
<p>I would definitely encourage young professionals to choose a path that they enjoy and that fits with their personality. You should have an open-minded attitude towards opportunities you may not have thought of before, and should not be afraid to change direction if need be. My other advice is to surround yourself as much as possible with leaders, and people in general, that support your choices and are eager to help you developing your skills, encouraging you to push your boundaries further and further.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>How do you see the future of clearing in 10 years?</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The clearing sector has received more and more attention since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 and the G20 in Pittsburgh of 2009. The importance of having a robust and competitive European clearing environment has also been acknowledged, for instance through the negotiations of EMIR 3.0. I believe that clearing will continue to play a prominent role in the EU agenda in the next years, because of the many characteristics of this industry which contribute to financial stability and resilient financial markets. Such characteristics, which CCPs are constantly committed to, concern for instance ensuring that the highest levels of operational resilience are guaranteed. And of course, I very much hope that the Women In Clearing Network, that I have happily contributed to setting up, will continue to thrive in the next 10 years and beyond!</p>
<p>You can learn more about Elena by reading the attached document and using this&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://eachccp.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Elena-Tonetto_Senior-Policy-Adviser-EACH.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>.</p>
<p>We would like to thank Elena for her contribution, and we look forward to continuing this EACH&rsquo;s Women in Clearing Series by hosting many skilled women leaders to inspire other professionals in the clearing sector!<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<title>SEC Approves A New PCAOB Quality Control Standard - New Standard Is Designed To Drive Registered Public Accounting Firms To Significantly Improve Their Quality Control Systems</title>

<div> audit, quality control, PCAOB, SEC, standard <br />
<br />
The SEC approved PCAOB's new quality control standard, QC 1000, to improve audit practices, requiring firms to identify and respond to risks. It takes effect on Dec. 15, 2025.<br />
Summary: The SEC approved PCAOB's new quality control standard, QC 1000, to improve audit practices, requiring firms to identify and respond to risks. It takes effect on Dec. 15, 2025. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today approved the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board&rsquo;s (PCAOB) new quality control (QC) standard and related amendments to its standards, rules, and forms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>QC 1000,&nbsp;<em>A Firm&rsquo;s System of Quality Control</em>, establishes an integrated, risk-based quality control standard that will require all registered public accounting firms to identify specific risks to their practice and design a quality control system that includes appropriate responses to guard against those risks. Registered firms that perform engagements under PCAOB standards will be required to implement and operate the QC system. The new quality control standard focuses on an audit firm&rsquo;s accountability and continuous improvement of its audit practice and will require an annual evaluation of the firm&rsquo;s QC system and related reporting to the PCAOB, certified by key firm personnel. In addition, firms that annually issue audit reports for more than 100 issuers will be required to establish an external quality control function (EQCF) composed of one or more persons who can exercise independent judgment related to the firm&rsquo;s QC system.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An auditing firm is ultimately a professional services firm, and it needs to ensure the quality of the services it provides,&rdquo; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. &ldquo;I am pleased to approve this standard because it will improve the quality control systems of auditors, and thus better protect investors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Current PCAOB quality control standards were developed almost 30 years ago by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants before the accounting fraud scandals of the early 2000s that led to the creation of the PCAOB pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. QC 1000 addresses changes in the audit practice environment since that time and leverages what the PCAOB has learned through two decades of experience in its inspections and enforcement programs, including, for example, the increasing participation of other firms and other outside resources in firm engagements, the role of firm networks, and the evolving use of technology.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Effective QC systems provide critical investor protections by driving continuous improvement in firms&rsquo; audit quality in support of the issuance of informative, accurate, and independent audit reports,&rdquo; said Paul Munter, the SEC&rsquo;s Chief Accountant. &ldquo;QC 1000 is an integrated risk-based QC standard that strikes an appropriate balance that can be applied by firms of varying sizes and complexities along with a set of mandates tailored to the size of the firms&rsquo; audit practices, which should assure that QC systems are designed, implemented, and operated with an appropriate level of rigor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>QC 1000 and the related amendments to other PCAOB standards, rules, and forms will take effect on Dec. 15, 2025.</p>

<p><span><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered a consent order requiring&nbsp;<span>Yakov Cohen&nbsp;</span>to disgorge $7 million in ill-gotten gains received from his participation in a fraudulent binary options scheme.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The order resolves the allegations against Cohen in the CFTC&rsquo;s August 12, 2019 lawsuit against Cohen and co-defendants&nbsp;<span>Yossi Herzog</span>,<span>&nbsp;Lee Elbaz</span>,<span>&nbsp;Shalom Peretz</span>,<span>&nbsp;Yukom Communications Ltd.</span>,&nbsp;<span>Linkopia Mauritius Ltd.</span>,&nbsp;<span>Wirestech Limited d/b/a BigOption</span>,<span>&nbsp;WSB Investments Ltd.</span>,&nbsp;<span>d/b/a BinaryBook</span>,<span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;Zolarex Ltd</span>,<span>&nbsp;d/b/a BinaryOnline</span>.<span>&nbsp;</span>[See CFTC Press Release<span>&nbsp;</span>No.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/7995-19"><span>7995-19</span></a><span>] The lawsuit is pending against the co-defendants.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Case Background</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The order finds, beginning on approximately March 26, 2014 and continuing through approximately September 2017, Cohen and his co-defendants fraudulently solicited individuals in the United States and elsewhere to trade binary options through websites</span><span>&nbsp;using fictitious trade names such as BigOption, BinaryBook, and BinaryOnline. The defendants falsely represented their interests were aligned with their customers&rsquo; interests, when they actually profited from their customers&rsquo; losses. The defendants also falsely claimed the offered binary options were actual transactions subject to objective market conditions, when they were merely book entries whose outcomes were manipulated by the defendants or others acting at their request.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>In addition, the defendants misrepresented their financial expertise, basis for compensation, physical location, and the identity of their employees and agents; falsely claimed customers&rsquo; funds were &ldquo;safeguarded separately&rdquo; when in fact they were commingled with the defendants&rsquo; own funds and transferred through off-shore bank accounts, including those controlled by Cohen; and falsely stated the binary options they offered were profitable, when in fact approximately 95% of customers lost money. Cohen received at least $7 million from the scheme.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Parallel Criminal Action</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>On February 13, 2019, Cohen was indicted by the United States Attorney for the District of Maryland and charged with wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud on the same conduct charged in CFTC&rsquo;s complaint. [<i>United States v. Yakov Cohen,&nbsp;</i>19 cr 77-1 PX (D. Md. 2024)] After pleading guilty to the charges, on August 15 Cohen was sentenced to 66 months in prison and ordered to pay a $7 million penalty. The disgorged funds will be returned to customers who suffered losses in connection with the fraudulent conduct through a victim fund administered by Department of Justice.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The CFTC thanks and acknowledges the assistance of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, Financial Supervision Commission of Bulgaria, Central Bank of Hungary, and Israel Securities Authority.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this case are Elizabeth N. Pendleton, Heather Dasso, Stacie Pan, Elizabeth Streit, Scott R. Williamson, and Robert T. Howell.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<title>Statement On Quality Control In Auditing, SEC Chair Gary Gensler, Sept. 9, 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, the Securities and Exchange Commission is considering whether to approve a final standard regarding the quality control systems of audit firms. I am pleased to approve this standard because it will improve the quality control systems of auditors, and thus better protect investors.</p>
<p>Without high-quality audits, investors won&rsquo;t receive complete and truthful financial disclosures. Without strong quality control systems, auditors can't consistently conduct high-quality audits.</p>
<p>Nearly 70 years after the stock market crash of 1929, our financial system was once again breaking down. Fraud in financial reporting and accounting eventually led to historic bankruptcies, such as Enron and WorldCom.</p>
<p>Congress responded by passing the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Their vision led to reforms establishing the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) as an independent watchdog over the auditors of public companies and registered broker-dealers.</p>
<p>Previously, auditing standards were set by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), a professional association. The profession was writing its own rules. That&rsquo;s an inherent conflict. To correct course, the PCAOB was tasked with setting enhanced auditing standards. The expectation was that the Board would produce a more appropriate set of standards going forward.</p>
<p>The existing PCAOB quality control standards, however, are still those that were carried over twenty-two years ago from the AICPA on an interim basis.</p>
<p>The auditing profession has changed in the 21<span>st</span>&nbsp;century, and the Amendments we are considering today are long overdue. To put in context how important it is to update the quality control standards, the PCAOB found that 46 percent&mdash;nearly half&mdash;of the auditing engagements it reviewed in 2023 fell short of obtaining sufficient appropriate audit evidence.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-statement-qc1000-090924#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>An auditing firm is ultimately a professional services firm, and it needs to ensure the quality of the services it provides. Those who rely on the auditors' professional opinion must be able to trust that opinion. That trust, though, is based on the assumption that the firm has strong quality control. It's important, therefore, that firms have a system in place to ensure quality control.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s proposed standard achieves that goal in four ways.</p>
<p>First, the proposed standard requires firms to proactively identify and manage risks within their quality control systems.</p>
<p>Second, the proposed standard reinforces the risk-based requirements by requiring ongoing monitoring and remediation&mdash;thus, driving continuous improvement.</p>
<p>Third, the standard holds the firm&rsquo;s leadership accountable in the event of quality control shortfalls.</p>
<p>Finally, the standard has varying requirements that differ based upon the size and nature of the firm&rsquo;s audit practice &mdash; thus, it's not one-size-fits-all. For instance, while all firms have to design a quality control system, only those that perform engagements under PCAOB standards are required to implement and operate the QC system. Firms would also have flexibility in how they achieve the required quality control objectives.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the 13 largest firms that annually issue audit reports for over 100 issuers are required to have one or more independent persons evaluate the firm&rsquo;s significant judgments and conclusions on the effectiveness of its QC system.</p>
<p>Twenty-two years after the passage of Sarbanes-Oxley, I&rsquo;m proud to support the PCAOB&rsquo;s proposed changes to instill greater trust among investors and issuers in our markets.</p>
<p>I would like to thank the staff and Board members of the PCAOB for their diligent work on these matters.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also like to thank members of the SEC staff for their work on this proposal, including:</p>

<title>Statement On The PCAOB’s Quality Control Standard — QC 1000, SEC Commissioner Mark T. Uyeda, Sept. 9, 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Chair Gensler. Today, the Commission considers whether to approve an updated standard of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the &ldquo;PCAOB&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Board&rdquo;) governing audit firms&rsquo; quality control (&ldquo;QC&rdquo;) systems.</p>
<p><span>Process for Approving QC Standard Calls into Question the Commission&rsquo;s Effective Oversight of the PCAOB</span></p>
<p>When Congress gave the Commission oversight of the PCAOB, it provided a process for approving the PCAOB&rsquo;s rules and standards that was similar to other self-regulatory organizations such as FINRA and the national securities exchanges.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-qc1000-090924#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;This process provides for a notice and comment period and gives the Commission 90 days<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-qc1000-090924#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;to approve or disapprove the rule.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-qc1000-090924#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;If the Commission needs more time to consider the rule, then it can extend the period for an additional 90 to 150 days.</p>
<p>Today is the end of the initial 90-day period for the updated QC standard. During this period, several commenters raised concerns that the PCAOB had not provided the public with an opportunity to consider the requirement for certain firms to adopt and implement an external quality control function (&ldquo;EQCF&rdquo;) during its rulemaking process and that the final requirement was not a logical outgrowth from the Board&rsquo;s proposal.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-qc1000-090924#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>On August 16, 2024, the PCAOB filed a 28 page letter, with nearly 19 pages dedicated to the EQCF requirement, in an attempt to respond to the commenters&rsquo; concerns.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-qc1000-090924#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;This explanation was significantly more expansive than PCAOB&rsquo;s QC standard adopting release, which only spent five and one-half pages on the EQCF requirement.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-qc1000-090924#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;In response to the PCAOB&rsquo;s letter, the Commission received two letters shortly before the Labor Day weekend calling for additional information and guidance.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-qc1000-090924#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>Given the flurry of new feedback, it would have been prudent for the Commission to extend the process to allow for a thoughtful consideration of the standard, particularly the EQCF requirement. These comment letters are an important part of the process for considering whether to approve or disapprove the updated QC standard. This is especially the case when the PCAOB&rsquo;s letter provided additional justifications for the EQCF requirement that were not part of the adopting release. To properly exercise its oversight responsibilities, the Commission should take the time to consider concerns raised by market participants and the PCAOB&rsquo;s responses.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Commission did not do that. Two weeks after receiving the PCAOB&rsquo;s August 16 letter and one day after receiving a market participant&rsquo;s letter calling for additional information, the Commission issued the notice for today&rsquo;s meeting,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-qc1000-090924#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;indicating its intention to not extend the consideration period beyond the initial 90-day period.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-qc1000-090924#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p>The Commission could have used more time to allow more market participants to express their views on the PCAOB&rsquo;s letter and for the PCAOB to provide additional guidance. This could have resulted in a better standard that would benefit the PCAOB, audit firms, audit clients, and most importantly, investors. It is unfortunate that the Commission has chosen not to do so. This decision is puzzling when the Commission has routinely used the extension for rules of FINRA and the national securities exchanges,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-qc1000-090924#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;upon which the Commission&rsquo;s process for approval of PCAOB standards is based.</p>
<p><span>Design-Only Requirement Imposes Unnecessary Costs and Demonstrates a Paternalistic Approach to Regulation</span></p>
<p>In addition, I am concerned with the standard&rsquo;s requirement that every PCAOB-registered firm, even those without a current audit engagement subject to PCAOB standards, must&nbsp;<i>design</i>&nbsp;a compliant QC system. While the requirement to&nbsp;<i>implement</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>operate</i>&nbsp;an effective QC system applies only to firms performing engagements, the standard&rsquo;s &ldquo;design-only&rdquo; requirement imposes costs without attendant benefits. This requirement may disproportionately burden smaller audit firms that do not have current engagements but may be seeking smaller public companies, broker-dealers, and others<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-qc1000-090924#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;as clients.</p>
<p>Several commenters expressed similar concerns.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-qc1000-090924#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;In dismissing these concerns, the Commission states that, without the design-only requirement, there would be a risk that &ldquo;firms could be unprepared to accept and perform engagements.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-qc1000-090924#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;However, neither the Commission nor the PCAOB has presented data to demonstrate that firms cannot design, implement, and operate a compliant QC system upon starting an engagement. In defending the design-only requirement, the Commission demonstrates its paternalism by implying that public companies and broker-dealers engaging an audit firm cannot make their own judgments on the preparedness of a firm, simply because the firm had not designed a QC system before the engagement. In a competitive market for audit services, firms that are unable to successfully perform engagements will not receive engagements.</p>
<p>The PCAOB&rsquo;s rationale is equally unpersuasive. The Board states that the design-only requirement &ldquo;is consistent with our investor protection mandate.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-qc1000-090924#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;But if a firm does not have any engagements, exactly which investors are being protected? The PCAOB states that &ldquo;investors and companies considering engaging the firm could reasonably expect that any firm that could pursue such an engagement would already have a PCAOB-compliant QC system designed and ready for implementation and operation.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-qc1000-090924#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;However, if investors are adequately protected by having the implementation and operation requirements apply only upon an engagement, why are they not similarly protected if the design requirement also applies at that time? The idea that firms that have not designed a QC system pre-engagement are incapable of doing so upon engagement is not supported in the record.</p>
<p><span>Conclusion</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Fast and furious&rdquo; might be a good theme for summer movies, but not for agency rulemaking. To be clear, my concern is not about whether there&nbsp;<i>should be</i>&nbsp;strong quality control requirements; there should be. The question is when. Having quality controls when there are no engagements provides little benefits. Because of the unnecessary costs and paternalistic approach of the updated QC standard&rsquo;s design-only requirement, as well as my concerns with the process, I do not support today&rsquo;s action, which I find arbitrary and capricious. However, I thank the PCAOB&rsquo;s members and staff and the Commission staff, especially those from the Office of the Chief Accountant, the Office of the General Counsel, and the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, for their work on the recommendation.</p>

<title>EBA Launches 2024 EU-Wide Transparency Exercise</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-size: 11px;">​The European Banking Authority (EBA) launched today the 2024 EU-wide transparency exercise. Ahead of the 2025 stress tests, this year's transparency exercise will offer preliminary and valuable insights into the health and resilience of Europe's banking sector. The results will be published at the end of November, together with the release of the Risk Assessment Report (RAR).</span></p>
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<div>
<p>​The EBA started today the annual interaction with over 100 major EU banks participating in the transparency exercise. As in the previous years, the exercise will rely solely on supervisory reporting data and will cover capital positions, profitability, financial assets, risk exposure amounts, sovereign exposures and asset quality.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>​Background</h4>
</div>
<div>
<p>The EU-wide transparency exercise has become a cornerstone of the EU banking sector supervision since 2011. It provides increasingly comprehensive data and state-of-the-art visualisation tools, with the aim of enhancing transparency and confidence in the resilience and stability of the EU financial system. This exercise complements the EBA&rsquo;s bi-annual stress test and uses supervisory reporting data to provide a clear picture of banks' capital strength, risk exposures and asset quality. In 2019, the exercise was expanded to quarterly disclosures, thus significantly increasing the amount of data available to the public.&nbsp;</p>

<div> SEC, whistleblower, companies, penalties, violations
Summary: SEC fined seven companies for violating whistleblower rules, impeding individuals from reporting securities violations, and required changes to relevant agreements.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against seven public companies for using employment, separation, and other agreements that violated rules prohibiting actions to impede whistleblowers from reporting potential misconduct to the SEC. To settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges, the companies agreed to pay more than $3 million combined in civil penalties.</p>
<ul>
<li>Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc., agreed to pay a $1,386,000 civil penalty;</li>
<li>a.k.a. Brands Holding Corp. agreed to pay a $399,750 civil penalty;</li>
<li>AppFolio, Inc., agreed to pay a $692,250 civil penalty;</li>
<li>IDEX Corporation agreed to pay a $75,000 civil penalty;</li>
<li>LSB Industries agreed to pay a $156,000 civil penalty;</li>
<li>Smart for Life, Inc. agreed to pay a $19,500 civil penalty; and</li>
<li>TransUnion agreed to pay a $312,000 civil penalty.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;The SEC&rsquo;s whistleblower program strengthens market integrity by providing protection and incentives for those who come forward and report potential violations of the securities laws,&rdquo; said Jason J. Burt, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Denver Regional Office. &ldquo;According to the SEC&rsquo;s orders, among other things, these companies required employees to waive their right to possible whistleblower monetary awards. This severely impedes would-be whistleblowers from reporting potential securities law violations to the SEC.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ensuring that potential whistleblowers can communicate directly with the Commission is a critical part of the SEC&rsquo;s oversight mandate,&rdquo; said Creola Kelly, Chief of the SEC&rsquo;s Office of the Whistleblower.</p>
<p>The firms were each charged with violating whistleblower protection Rule 21F-17(a), which prohibits any action to impede an individual from communicating directly with the SEC staff about a possible securities law violation. Each of the firms has agreed not to violate this rule in the future and has taken steps to remediate the violations, including making changes to the relevant agreements.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation, which is ongoing, is being conducted by Eric Day of the Denver Regional Office with assistance from Helena Engelhart Bean and the staff of the SEC&rsquo;s Office of the Whistleblower, including Kelly Breakey and Elizabeth McMurray, and is supervised by Danielle R. Voorhees, Nicholas P. Heinke, and Mr. Burt, also of the Denver Regional Office.</p>

<div> DTCC, FICC, GSD, record-setting activity, Sponsored Service<br />
Summary:<br />
DTCC’s FICC GSD cleared record USD$9.2 trillion in daily activity, 42% increase year-over-year, reaching peak volume in Sponsored Service. <div>
<p>The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the premier post-trade market infrastructure for the global financial services industry, today announced that its Fixed Income Clearing Corporation&rsquo;s (FICC&rsquo;s) Government Securities Division (GSD) successfully cleared a record-setting USD$9.2 trillion in daily activity on September 3. This new milestone follows the previous peak volume of USD$8.8 trillion in daily activity on July 31, a 4.5 percent increase. In the past 12 months, GSD's total activity increased 42 percent year-over-year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The continued and persistent volume growth that we are seeing across GSD, as well as across access models, is a testament to the value of central clearing with FICC, including reduced risk and capital and balance sheet relief,&rdquo; said Laura Klimpel, Managing Director and Head of DTCC&rsquo;s Fixed Income and Financing Solutions. &ldquo;FICC&rsquo;s GSD has become a crucial component to the smooth functioning of the U.S. Treasury market, a responsibility we take very seriously. Our recent achievements in daily transaction volumes underline FICC&rsquo;s strong capacity to accommodate increasing volumes and market volatility, and well position us to support clients for the SEC&rsquo;s new rules for expanded U.S. Treasury Clearing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to this growth, on September 3, GSD&rsquo;s Sponsored Service reached a peak volume of USD$1.414 trillion in cleared U.S. Treasury activity.</p>

<div> breached, rules, Nasdaq Stockholm, Arctic Securities AS, fine
Summary: Arctic Securities AS breached Nasdaq Stockholm rules, resulting in a fine of SEK 2,000,000 and the cancellation of its permission to act as Certified Adviser. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Disciplinary Committee of Nasdaq Stockholm (the &ldquo;Exchange&rdquo;) has found that Arctic Securities AS (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) has breached the rules of Nasdaq First North Growth Market (the &ldquo;Rulebook&rdquo;) and therefore decided to cancel the company&rsquo;s permission to act as Certified Adviser and ordered the company to pay a fine of SEK 2,000,000.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Disciplinary Committee concludes that the Company has breached the following rules of the Rulebook after having terminated the agreements of all three employees acting as Designated Contact Persons.</p>
<ul>
<li>Item 5.1.4 of the Rulebook includes an ongoing obligation to monitor the Issuer&rsquo;s fulfilment of the Rulebook. During the notice periods for the Designated Contact Persons, the Company has not fulfilled this ongoing obligation.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The Company also breached item 5.8.2 of the Rulebook by not notifying the Exchange of the change regarding the Designated Contact Persons.</li>
<li>The Company further failed to meet the requirement in item 5.2.1 of the Rulebook for having at least two full-time Designated Contact Persons.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Disciplinary Committee concludes that the Company during a prolonged period has not met the fundamental requirements regarding Designated Contact Persons that the Rulebook places on a Certified Adviser, as well as failed to inform the Exchange of changes immediately. The Disciplinary Committee views the breaches of the Rulebook as very serious. A fine shall therefore be imposed. Considering the Company during the period did not entirely lack resources to perform its obligations as Certified Adviser and that the breaches do not seem to have had any negative effects on issuers for which the Company acted as Certified Adviser, the amount of the fine is set to SEK 2,000,000. The Disciplinary Committee further cancels the Company&rsquo;s permission to act as Certified Adviser on First North Stockholm with immediate effect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Disciplinary Committee&rsquo;s decision is available at:</p>

This new digital marketplace will serve as the central hub for all JSE data products and services.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span>The launch of the Marketplace is a major milestone in the JSE&rsquo;s digital growth journey. The bourse has digitised client contracting for index agreements and introduced Trade Explorer for member analytics services. With its core data now cloud-hosted, the JSE is gearing up to launch a virtual storefront that allows clients to easily purchase data online.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span>By leveraging DataBP's advanced platform, the Marketplace will simplify client onboarding, streamline product development and automate data access entitlements and billing processes. The new data Marketplace will enable customers and redistributors to access a wide range of products efficiently. Additionally, the platform will host third-party content and analytics services, enhancing the value of the JSE&rsquo;s proprietary data and expanding the distribution capabilities of the cloud marketplace.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span>&ldquo;DataBP is excited to provide our cloud data marketplace solution to our partners at JSE,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<strong>Mark Schaedel, CEO of DataBP</strong>. &ldquo;JSE has developed a comprehensive cloud distribution platform with the intent of integrating all of its commercial information services under this cloud marketplace. Together we have developed a dynamic product catalog and order configuration process which integrates with data licensing and automated data access. We are proud to partner with clients who are combining content and cloud services to unlock value for their customers and drive product innovation. At DataBP, we are committed to leveraging cloud-native technologies to streamline commercial market data practices. We look forward to continuing our partnership with JSE and supporting their success in the marketplace.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p align="left"><span><strong>Mark Randall, Director of Information Services at the JSE</strong>, emphasised the strategic importance of this initiative. &ldquo;Migrating data offerings to the cloud is a key part of JSE&rsquo;s Information and Communications Technology (ICT) strategy. It not only reduces infrastructure costs but also increases flexibility,&rdquo; said Randall. &ldquo;This offering marks the successful completion of the first phase of our market data modernisation strategy. Ultimately, the JSE aims to leverage cloud services to provide clients with analytics and insights, rather than just raw data.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p align="left"><span>In support of this effort, the JSE also provides real-time market data, historical data, analytical tools and indices, hence playing an essential role in ensuring the overall integrity and efficacy of the market. By embracing technological advancements and maintaining a strong focus on regulatory compliance, customer support and data, the JSE reaffirms its position as a centre of innovation for financial markets on the African continent.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span>This holistic approach not only enhances the JSE&rsquo;s service offerings but also contributes to the overall health and transparency of the financial landscape. As part of the JSE&rsquo;s next phase of growth, this collaboration and the launch of the cloud marketplace is a strategic move that underscores its commitment to leveraging technology for market enhancement. By introducing the cloud marketplace, the JSE is not only improving the scalability, reliability and efficacy of its data products but also positions itself at the forefront of market innovation. This step is a testament to the JSE&rsquo;s dedication to providing world-class products and services.</span></p>

<ul type="square">
<li><span>Elevated volatility drives trading activity in equity derivatives, record FX futures volume</span></li>
<li><span>Securities market turnover rises to highest in two-and-a-half years</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Singapore Exchange (SGX Group) today released its market statistics for August 2024. Elevated volatility following the market dislocation in the earlier part of the month drove trading activity in equity derivatives as well as record foreign exchange (FX) futures volume.</p>
<p>Derivatives traded volume rose 4% year-on-year (y-o-y) in August to 24.6 million contracts, with daily average volume (DAV) up 8% y-o-y at 1.1 million contracts. Securities daily average value (SDAV) climbed 28% y-o-y to S$1.4 billion, as market turnover increased 22% y-o-y to S$28.8 billion &ndash; the highest since March 2022.</p>
<p>Key highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Retail investors&rsquo; net purchases hit new high in 2024:&nbsp;</span>On SGX Securities, retail investors net purchased S$685 million, the highest in 10 months, adding positions in index stocks as well as small and mid-caps. Cash SDAV climbed 20% m-o-m in August to S$1.3 billion, the highest since March 2022. Growth in activity originated from both institutional and retail clients and across stock segments. Over the volatile first five trading days of August, Singapore&rsquo;s stock market was consistently the most actively traded among ASEAN peers. Year-to-date returns from the Straits Times Index (STI) stood at 6.7%, even as the benchmark declined 0.4% m-o-m to 3,442.93.</li>
<li><span>More FX futures records:&nbsp;</span>SGX USD/CNH FX Futures traded volume gained 25% y-o-y in August to 3.4 million contracts, lifting total futures volume on SGX FX by 33% y-o-y to a record 5.6 million contracts. DAV of SGX KRW/USD FX Futures rose to a new high of 17,483 lots, a 66.5% jump month-on-month (m-o-m), as the effect of the yen carry trade unwind spilled over to other funding currencies.</li>
<li><span>Liquid and accessible equities venue:&nbsp;</span>Through the volatility in early August across both cash and derivatives, SGX Equity Derivatives provided global investors with continuous price discovery even as trading limits were triggered in onshore markets. SGX Nikkei 225 Index Futures volume increased 8% in August on both a y-o-y and m-o-m basis to 933,551 contracts. GIFT Nifty derivatives traded volume climbed 18% y-o-y to 2 million contracts, with month-end open interest (OI) at a record 293,258 lots (US$15 billion notional).</li>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority Cancels Rockfort Markets’ Derivative Issuer Licence Following High Court Appeal</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-cancels-rockfort-markets-derivative-iss/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> cancelled, Rockfort Markets Limited, derivative issuer licence, contravened licence obligations, FMA

Summary:<br />Rockfort Markets Limited's derivative issuer licence was cancelled by FMA due to multiple, material contraventions of licence obligations. Rockfort failed to comply. <div>
<p>The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash;&nbsp;has cancelled Rockfort Markets Limited&rsquo;s1&nbsp;(Rockfort) Derivative Issuer (DI) licence. The cancellation took place on 19 July 2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA initially decided to cancel Rockfort&rsquo;s licence in March 2023 because it was satisfied Rockfort materially contravened its licence obligations. Rockfort appealed the FMA&rsquo;s decision to the High Court and obtained orders preventing publication of any information relating to the case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rockfort argued it only breached four of its licence obligations, that the breaches were not material, that the FMA was wrong to find it no longer met the requirements for a licence, and that a more lenient regulatory response would have been sufficient to deal with its non-compliance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Justice Edwards dismissed Rockfort&rsquo;s appeal on the above points in November 2023. Rockfort appealed the High Court judgment to the Court of Appeal and the non-publication order remained in place; however, it has now discontinued its appeal and the FMA can publish the case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Reasons for cancellation&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Rockfort&rsquo;s licence was cancelled because the FMA was satisfied Rockfort materially contravened eight of its licence obligations. They included, but were not limited to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Failure to comply with a Direction Order issued to Rockfort on 3 March 2021.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Failure to maintain adequate and effective systems, policies, processes, and controls to ensure compliance with its obligations under the standard conditions of its licence (including in relation to its advertising) in an effective manner.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Failure to maintain the same or better standard of capability, governance, and compliance as was the case when the FMA assessed Rockfort's initial licensee application.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Rockfort&rsquo;s product disclosure statement did not contain mandatory information relating to hedging counterparties.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The FMA found that Rockfort was no longer capable of effectively performing the role of a DI. The FMA also had reason to believe that Rockfort would be likely to contravene its market service obligations in the future.</p>
<p>The FMA engaged with Rockfort in 2019 and 2020 in relation to potentially false or misleading advertising. On both occasions Rockfort did not fully comply with the FMA&rsquo;s requests to remove the advertising. In March 2021, the FMA ordered Rockfort to remove what it considered to be false or misleading advertising on its website. The advertising in question suggested Rockfort was licenced to provide forex and share broking activities when those were not covered by its licence. The FMA subsequently found the advertising remained on Rockfort&rsquo;s website in August 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FMA General Counsel, Liam Mason, said: &ldquo;Removing a market licence is one of our most significant interventions. In this instance, due to the serious and widespread nature of the contraventions, Rockfort&rsquo;s compliance history, and the fact the FMA failed to see any improvement following our earlier actions, the FMA believes that Rockfort is not fit to hold a licence. Cancelling Rockfort&rsquo;s licence is an appropriate and proportionate response to the multiple, material contraventions of its licence obligations.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA imposed additional specific conditions and requested Rockfort close out the few remaining open derivatives contracts it had with customers ahead of the licence cancellation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notes&nbsp;</p>
<p><sup>1</sup>Rockfort Markets changed its trading name to RockGlobal on 15 May 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rockfort was issued a DI licence by the FMA in 2018. The FMA cancelled Rockfort&rsquo;s licence under section 414(3) of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013.&nbsp;</p>

<div> charges, Esmark Inc., James P. Bouchard, tender offer, Securities and Exchange Commission
Summary:<br />SEC settled charges against Esmark Inc. and James P. Bouchard for falsely announcing a tender offer for U.S. Steel. They agreed to pay civil penalties. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against Esmark Inc. and its founder, chairman, and former CEO, James P. Bouchard, for publicly announcing a tender offer to purchase U.S. Steel Corporation for $35 per share even though Esmark lacked the financial means to consummate the offer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, on Aug. 14, 2023, at Bouchard&rsquo;s direction and approval, Esmark announced an offer for all issued and outstanding shares of U.S. Steel for $35 per share, which would have required $7.8 billion in cash to complete. The following day, Bouchard appeared on a cable news program and said that Esmark had $10 billion available in cash committed to the deal and would not put up any of Esmark&rsquo;s assets as collateral. The order finds that these statements were false because Esmark did not have the $7.8 billion in cash required to complete the purchase of U.S. Steel, and, therefore, Esmark and Bouchard did not have a reasonable belief that they would have the means to purchase the securities needed to complete the announced tender offer for U.S. Steel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bouchard and Esmark could not have completed the tender offer for U.S. Steel that they announced,&rdquo; said Antonia M. Apps, Director of the New York Regional Office. &ldquo;Investors should be able to trust companies&rsquo; and executives&rsquo; public statements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that Esmark and Bouchard violated Section 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 14e-8 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, Esmark and Bouchard agreed to cease and desist from committing or causing any future violations of these provisions and to pay civil penalties of $500,000 and $100,000 respectively.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Alicia Guo, Lindsay S. Moilanen, and George D. O&rsquo;Kane and was supervised by Thomas P. Smith, Jr. of the New York Regional Office.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<div> enhanced AR rules, principals, monitoring, review, FCA
Summary:<br />Principals must effectively monitor their Appointed Representatives, carrying out self-assessments, annual reviews, and using a range of checks. FCA will take swift action where standards not met. <div>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has set out good practice and areas for improvement to help principal firms effectively monitor their Appointed Representatives (ARs).</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>The findings follow a review of how principals are meeting its enhanced AR rules, introduced in December 2022. The analysis involved a telephone survey with 251 principals and in-depth assessments of documentation from 23 firms.</p>
<p>Examples of good practice from principals included keeping clear documentation to show compliance with the FCA&rsquo;s enhanced rules and using a broad range of checks and information to oversee and monitor ARs&rsquo; activities.</p>
<p>But the FCA found some firms were taking a tick-box approach to complying with its rules, relying on basic information like website checks, or using self-declarations from their ARs, to demonstrate effective oversight.</p>
<p>The review also found:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>1 in 5 principals had not carried out a required self-assessment or annual review of their ARs.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Approximately half of principals were not regularly reviewing their AR agreements.</li>
<li>A third of principals were not using data or management information to keep tabs on whether ARs were acting within the scope of AR agreements.</li>
<li>Most firms had not changed their AR onboarding or termination procedures since the rules were introduced.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Jane Savidge, Interim Head of Department for Appointed Representatives said</span>:</p>
<p>'Some firms have been embedding our rules well, but some aren&rsquo;t getting the basics right and are taking a &lsquo;bare minimum&rsquo; approach.</p>
<p>'Principals must have clear, written AR agreements from the outset and effectively monitor their ARs to make sure they act within scope.'</p>
<p>The FCA has followed up directly with firms in the review and will take swift action where it sees principals not meeting its standards in the future.</p>

<div> Fed Chairman, U.S. Economy, Monetary Policy, Labor Market, Inflation<br />
Summary:<br />
Fed Chairman discusses the outlook for the U.S. economy and implications for monetary policy. He sees evidence of labor market softening and supports reducing the federal funds rate.<br /> <div>
<p>Thank you, Eric, and thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240906a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;My topic is the outlook for the U.S. economy and the implications for monetary policy, a set of judgements that have, of course, been influenced by this morning's jobs report. When I scheduled this speech several months ago, I knew it might be challenging to speak a few hours after the release of such an important piece of data. But we like to say that monetary policy must be nimble, so that means policymakers must be nimble also. Not&nbsp;<em>Simone Biles nimble</em>, but nimble. As you will hear, I believe the data we have received this week reinforces the view that there has been continued moderation in the labor market. In light of the considerable and ongoing progress toward the Federal Open Market Committee's 2 percent inflation goal, I believe that the balance of risks has shifted toward the employment side of our dual mandate, and that monetary policy needs to adjust accordingly.</p>
<p>Looking back at the economic data over the first six months of 2024, it portrayed an economy slowly cooling and not showing signs of significant weakening. The labor market had been gradually moderating for the past year or so, and although inflation rose in the first quarter, it then retreated in the second, and there was a widespread view heading into the second half of the year that the FOMC was on track to achieve a much desired but unusual "soft landing."</p>
<p>Then the July jobs report came in unexpectedly soft. Job creation slowed and the unemployment rate increased by two tenths of a percentage point to 4.3 percent, the highest since October 2021. There was speculation that weather-related issues might have distorted these results and, in fact, the unemployment rate ticked down in this morning's release. But, overall, the August report along with other recent labor data tend to confirm that there has been a continued moderation in the labor market.</p>
<p>The ups and downs in the data over time highlight what I consider the right approach to meeting the FOMC's dual mandate goals&mdash;I believe we should be data dependent, but not overreact to any data point, including the latest data. When we faced a period of banking instability in the spring of 2023, there were calls from some to stop rate hikes despite inflation still running over 5 percent. But there were other tools in hand to deal with that stress, monetary policy did not overreact, and the FOMC continued tightening policy. When inflation fell unexpectedly in the second half of last year, we did not overreact and immediately cut the policy rate. Then when inflation accelerated in the first quarter, we did not overreact and raise rates despite some calls to do so. I will be looking at these last two employment reports in combination with all other data as we head into the September FOMC meeting to decide the best stance of policy. I believe our patience over the past 18 months has served us well. But the current batch of data no longer requires patience, it requires action.</p>
<p>Today's jobs report continues the longer-term pattern of a softening of the labor market that is consistent with moderate growth in economic activity, the details of which I will get into in a moment. As I said at the outset, considering the progress we have made on getting inflation back to target, I believe that the balance of risks is now weighted more toward downside risks to the FOMC's maximum-employment mandate.</p>
<p>While the labor market has clearly cooled, based on the evidence I see, I do not believe the economy is in a recession or necessarily headed for one soon. The collective set of economic data indicates to me that the labor market and the economy are performing in a solid manner and the prospects for continued growth and job creation are good, with inflation near 2 percent. I continue to believe that this can occur without substantial harm to the labor market. But I also believe that maintaining the economy's forward momentum means that, as Chair Powell said recently, the time has come to begin reducing the target range for the federal funds rate.</p>
<p>In the rest of my remarks, I will lay out my reasons for believing that the economy and employment will likely keep growing as inflation moves toward 2 percent. The first of these is the large body of evidence that economic activity is continuing to grow at a solid pace. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at a 2.2 percent annual rate in the first half of this year and recent data indicates that growth is continuing at around this pace in the third quarter.</p>
<p>Retail sales were stronger than expected in July and showed that households continue to spend as their finances, in the aggregate, remain healthy. The increase was fairly broad based across goods categories. While many online retailers offered discounts last month, this was not a dominant factor in the solid results. Although manufacturing output fell in July and the August Institute for Supply Management manufacturing survey pointed to weak production and new orders, the similar survey for the larger, nonmanufacturing sector was consistent with a modest expansion of activity.</p>
<p>As for the labor market, on balance, the data that we have received in the past three days indicates to me that the labor market is continuing to soften but not deteriorate, and this judgement is important to our upcoming decision on monetary policy. As I said earlier, Wednesday's report on job openings in July was consistent with a moderating labor market. Meanwhile, the four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance has risen gradually since January but has changed little on net in the past two months, with initial claims remaining fairly low.</p>
<p>The jobs report for August, released this morning, supported the story of ongoing moderation in the labor market. After rising to 4.3 percent in July, the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.2 percent in August. Taking a longer perspective, the unemployment rate over the past 16 months has increased gradually but fairly steadily from 3.4 percent to 4.2 percent in today's release. Payrolls rose by 142,000 in August compared with 89,000 in July, leaving the three-month average payroll gain at 116,000, compared with the 267,000 average in the first quarter and 147,000 in the second. Accounting for revisions to the jobs numbers that we received in August, that level is a bit below what I see as the breakeven pace for job creation that absorbs new entrants to the workforce and keeps the unemployment rate constant.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240906a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a></p>
<p>July marked the first time that the three-month average unemployment rate has increased by at least a half of a percentage point above its 12-month low, which was 3.6 percent in July 2023. This breached a threshold established by the Sahm rule, which observes that when this has occurred in the past, it has been a reliable indicator of the economy entering a recession.</p>
<p>While this is a correlation that certainly bears attention, I want to make a few cautionary points about relying on such rules in deciding that a recession has begun. As we have seen in the recent past with other supposedly reliable recession rules, such as an inverted yield curve, there is more to forecasting economic outcomes than the relationships between a couple of variables.</p>
<p>First, these rules are nothing more than a mechanical, statistical description of past economic outcomes&mdash;they do not seek to explain what economic forces drive the relationship between the data, nor are they based on the totality of economic data. All recessions rules do is pick up a correlation between movements in economic data and the dates of recessions or other outcomes. A second point is that, setting aside the unusual circumstances of the 1981&ndash;82 recession, recessions occur when a major shock hits the economy.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240906a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;In the absence of a big negative shock, an inversion of the yield curve or a triggering of the Sahm rule doesn't necessarily mean we are entering a recession.</p>
<p>Third, recession rules typically pick up demand-driven recessions. But this is not why unemployment is rising now. GDP forecasts for the current quarter all show solid growth, labor market data show lay off rates are stable, and consumer spending is growing at a healthy rate. These data suggest demand is fairly strong. Instead, most of the increase in the unemployment rate is from workers entering the labor force and not finding jobs right away. So, the recent rise in the unemployment rate appears to be more of a supply-side-driven phenomenon, not demand driven.</p>
<p>And lastly, it should be clear to everyone that many pre-pandemic economic relationships have not proven to be good policy guides post-pandemic. Reliance on old lessons from inverted yield curves to predict a recession, a Phillips curve to predict inflation, or a flat Beveridge curve to predict the movement in the unemployment rate have all led to mistaken economic forecasts.</p>
<p>While I don't see the recent data pointing to a recession, I do see some downside risk to employment that I will be watching closely. But at this point, I believe there is substantial evidence that the economy retains the strength and momentum to keep growing, supported by an appropriate loosening of monetary policy.</p>
<p>Let me now turn to the outlook for inflation. With the labor market cooling, it doesn't surprise me that wage growth has slowed to a pace consistent with the FOMC's price-stability goal, and this is supporting ongoing progress toward that objective. The employment cost index grew at an annualized rate of 3.5 percent from March to June, and the 12-month change was 3.9 percent for private sector workers, the lowest since late 2021.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240906a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;Average hourly earnings, reported in today's jobs report, rose at a three-month annualized pace of 3.8 percent in August, the same as the 12-month change.</p>
<p>Inflation in July continued to show progress toward the FOMC's goal. The price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), the Committee's preferred inflation measure, increased at a monthly pace of 0.2 percent in July for both total and core PCE inflation. Core PCE inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is a good guide to underlying inflation, and it increased 2.7 percent over the past 12 months. Given the downward trajectory of monthly readings, I also look at the 6- and 3-month annualized rate. These stand at 2.6 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively. These numbers are good news and suggest that our restrictive policy stance has put us on the right path to attain our 2 percent inflation target.</p>
<p>Looking across the components of inflation, one can see the breadth of the disinflation. Over 50 percent of categories in the total and core market baskets had annualized monthly inflation less than 2.5 percent in August. In fact, the index of core goods prices has reverted to its historical pattern of slight deflation, reflecting normalized supply after the disruptions of the pandemic as well as ongoing technological and productivity advances. Meanwhile, services price inflation has slowed as wage growth has slowed, since labor is a large input for much of the service sector. Overall, I see significant and ongoing progress toward the FOMC's inflation goal that I expect will continue over the remainder of this year.</p>
<p>Now let me discuss the implications of this outlook for monetary policy. As I said at the outset, considering the achieved and continuing progress on inflation and moderation in the labor market, I believe the time has come to lower the target range for the federal funds rate at our upcoming meeting. Reducing the policy rate now is consistent with many versions of the Taylor rule, which suggest reducing the policy rate is appropriate given the data in hand.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I do not expect this first cut to be the last. With inflation and employment near our longer-run goals and the labor market moderating, it is likely that a series of reductions will be appropriate. I believe there is sufficient room to cut the policy rate and still remain somewhat restrictive to ensure inflation continues on the path to our 2 percent target.</p>
<p>Determining the appropriate pace at which to reduce policy restrictiveness will be challenging. Choosing a slower pace of rate cuts gives time to gradually assess whether the neutral rate has in fact risen, but at the risk of moving too slowly and putting the labor market at risk. Cutting the policy rate at a faster pace means a greater likelihood of achieving a soft landing but at the risk of overshooting on rate cuts if the neutral rate has in fact risen above its pre-pandemic level. This would cause an undesired loosening of monetary policy.</p>
<p>Determining the pace of rate cuts and ultimately the total reduction in the policy rate are decisions that lie in the future. As of today, I believe it is important to start the rate cutting process at our next meeting. If subsequent data show a significant deterioration in the labor market, the FOMC can act quickly and forcefully to adjust monetary policy. I am open-minded about the size and pace of cuts, which will be based on what the data tell us about the evolution of the economy, and not on any pre-conceived notion of how and when the Committee should act. If the data supports cuts at consecutive meetings, then I believe it will be appropriate to cut at consecutive meetings. If the data suggests the need for larger cuts, then I will support that as well. I was a big advocate of front-loading rate hikes when inflation accelerated in 2022, and I will be an advocate of front-loading rate cuts if that is appropriate. Those decisions will be determined by new data and how it adds to the totality of the data and shapes my understanding of economic conditions. While I expect that these cuts will be done carefully as the economy and employment continue to grow, in the context of stable inflation, I stand ready to act promptly to support the economy as needed.</p>
<hr align="left" size="1" width="33%" />
<p><a name="fn1"></a>1. The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn2"></a>2. The preliminary estimate of the annual benchmark revision to the establishment survey data, which was announced on August 21, suggests that payroll growth between April 2023 and March 2024 will likely be revised down early next year by about 68,000 per month on average. The implications for payroll growth beyond March are less clear.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn3"></a>3. The 1981&ndash;82 recession was triggered by tight monetary policy in an effort to fight mounting inflation. For more information about this recession, see&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/recession-of-1981-82">Federal Reserve History</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn4"></a>4. The employment cost index is a valuable measure of compensation growth because it covers non-wage benefits and accounts for shifts in the shares of workers in different occupations and industries.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tradeweb Markets Inc. (Nasdaq: TW), a leading, global operator of electronic marketplaces for rates, credit, equities and money markets, today reported record total trading volume for the month of August 2024 of $50.9 trillion (tn)<a href="https://www.tradeweb.com/newsroom/media-center/news-releases/tradeweb-reports-record-august-2024-total-trading-volume-of-$50.9-trillion-and-record-average-daily-volume-of-$2.21-trillion/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>[1]</span></a>. Average daily volume (ADV) for the month was a record $2.21tn, an increase of 53.9 percent (%) year-over-year (YoY).<a href="https://www.tradeweb.com/newsroom/media-center/news-releases/tradeweb-reports-record-august-2024-total-trading-volume-of-$50.9-trillion-and-record-average-daily-volume-of-$2.21-trillion/#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span>[2]</span></a>&nbsp;Excluding the impact of the ICD acquisition, which closed on August 1, 2024, total ADV for the month of August was up 35.7% YoY.</p>
<p>Tradeweb CEO Billy Hult said: "Our record volumes in August highlight the strength of Tradeweb&rsquo;s platform, which now includes ICD. The significant growth across our key markets, particularly in U.S. government bonds and global repurchase agreements, underscores the continued trust our clients place in us to deliver solutions that enhance transparency, efficiency, and innovation in our markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In August 2024, Tradeweb records included:</p>
<ul>
<li>ADV in U.S. government bonds</li>

<ul>
<li>Record U.S. government bond volumes were supported by record ADV across our institutional and wholesale client sectors and strong ADV growth in retail. Increased adoption across a range of protocols and favorable market conditions contributed to the increase in volume. The addition of r8fin continues to contribute positively to wholesale volumes. Despite subdued summer issuance, European government bond volumes increased YoY, led by strong growth in UK Gilts ahead of the new issuance announced for early September.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Mortgage ADV was up 32.3% YoY to $230.7bn.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> 
<ul>
<li>August To-Be-Announced (TBA) activity was driven by robust roll trading activity and significant participation from fast-money accounts. Increased client adoption of specified pool trading led to record volumes for the month.</li>

<ul>
<li>Swaps/swaptions &ge; 1-year ADV was up 5.4% YoY to $402.3bn and total rates derivatives ADV was up 35.7% YoY to $727.4bn.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp; 
<ul>
<li>Strong volume in swaps/swaptions &ge; 1-year was driven by ongoing institutional client activity and strong tailwinds from global political uncertainties. Compression activity, which carries a lower fee per million, declined 22% YoY. Central banks continued to contribute to increased volatility due to active discussions on rate movements. Clients continued to utilize the request-for-market (RFM) protocol for risk transfers. Emerging markets swaps growth remained strong. QTD compression activity was lower than 2Q24.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span><span>credit</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<title>Nasdaq Implements AxiomSL Revenue Recognition Change</title>

<div> revenue, AxiomSL, accounting change, Nasdaq, growth outlook<br />
Summary:<br />
Nasdaq implements accounting change for AxiomSL revenues, recognizing 100% ratably over contract term. Reaffirms growth outlook and expectations for 2024.  <div>
<p align="left">Nasdaq, Inc.&nbsp;(Nasdaq: NDAQ) today announced that it has implemented a change to the accounting treatment of the revenues associated with AxiomSL on-premises subscription contracts. This change was previously referenced during Nasdaq&rsquo;s second quarter earnings and is related to the finalization of the&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP purchase accounting in connection with the Adenza acquisition.</p>
<p>The accounting change reflects the frequent and ongoing mandatory updates to AxiomSL&rsquo;s regulatory reporting software, which are critical to the utility and value of the product for its clients. Going forward, Nasdaq will recognize 100% of AxiomSL on-premises subscription revenue ratably over the contract term, whereas Adenza previously recognized approximately 50% of AxiomSL&rsquo;s total contract revenue upfront and the remainder over the contract term.</p>
<p>Beginning in the third quarter of 2024, Nasdaq's financial and operational results will reflect the new accounting treatment. In its third quarter 2024 results, Nasdaq will record a net&nbsp;$32 million&nbsp;one-time, non-cash GAAP revenue reduction for the period&nbsp;November 1, 2023&nbsp;through&nbsp;June 30, 2024, reflecting the net impact of the accounting change on AxiomSL subscription revenue since the close of the acquisition. This&nbsp;$32 million&nbsp;net reduction consists of a decrease of&nbsp;$34 million&nbsp;related to the November and&nbsp;December 2023&nbsp;periods, which will be excluded from our non-GAAP third quarter 2024 results, partially offset by a net increase of&nbsp;$2 million&nbsp;related to the January through&nbsp;June 2024&nbsp;period.</p>
<p>This change enhances Nasdaq&rsquo;s financial reporting, as AxiomSL&rsquo;s revenues will more closely align with the annualized recurring revenue (ARR) and cash economics of its on-premises subscription contracts. There are no changes to professional services revenues or to AxiomSL&rsquo;s cloud-delivered license revenues, which are already recognized as ratable over the life of the contract. This change also does not impact AxiomSL&rsquo;s historical ARR or cash flows.</p>
<p><span>2024 Expectations and Medium-Term Growth Outlook</span><br />Nasdaq reaffirms its medium-term growth outlook for all divisions, sub-divisions, and AxiomSL and Calypso combined. Nasdaq also reaffirms all 2024 expectations shared in its second quarter 2024 earnings call and expects the Regulatory Technology sub-division to grow within its medium-term revenue growth outlook range for full-year 2024. Nasdaq will provide additional details in the accompanying presentation and publicly announced conference call on this topic.</p>
<p><span>Conference Call</span><br />As previously announced, Nasdaq will host a conference call today,&nbsp;September 6, 2024, at&nbsp;8:00 AM ET&nbsp;to discuss this announcement in more detail. All participants can access the conference via webcast and related materials through the Nasdaq Investor Relations website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=PADs9mp1CYxmygjkTHh-dvOpZmg9dnYyqBlflCL_7UY9m6vLQR3fd1o1TBqP3lVXfcGQlhI39VJfjCftJprGJuLnpefJG0u3NHbEDIK_mhs=" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://ir.nasdaq.com/</a>.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Publishes Decisions Against 3 Individuals, And Fines And Bans A Fourth, For Reckless Pension Transfer Advice</title>

<div> Financial Advisers, St Martin's Partners LLP, FCA, Pension Transfer, Upper Tribunal <br />
The FCA banned and fined four individuals from SMP for providing risky pension transfer advice, disregarding customers' financial needs.<br /><br />Summary: The FCA banned and fined four individuals from SMP for providing risky pension transfer advice, disregarding customers' financial needs. <div>
<p><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<div class="copy-block__call-out">
<p><span>Mr Adrian Douglas, Mr Liam Martin and Mr Frank Oxberry have each referred their Decision Notices to the Upper Tribunal. The findings outlined in the Decision Notices given to them reflect the FCA&rsquo;s belief as to what occurred and how it considers their conduct should be characterised. The proposed action outlined in their Decision Notices will have no effect pending the determination of the references by the Tribunal whose decision will be made public on its website.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Tribunal will determine, in the case of the decision to impose a financial penalty what (if any) the appropriate action is for the FCA to take, and remit the matter to the FCA with such directions as the Tribunal considers appropriate and, in relation to the decision to make prohibition orders or a decision to withdraw approval, whether to dismiss the reference or remit it to the FCA with a direction to reconsider and reach a decision in accordance with the findings of the Tribunal.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Mr Alec Cuthbert agreed to settle the FCA&rsquo;s case against him and therefore has not made a reference to the Tribunal of our decision to take action. The Final Notice given to him has not been the subject of any judicial finding. It includes criticisms of Mr Oxberry who has been given a Decision Notice in relation to the same matter. As above, Mr Oxberry disputes his Decision Notice and has referred it to the Upper Tribunal for determination.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p><span>The FCA has decided to ban 2 financial advisers and 2 partners at St Martin&rsquo;s Partners LLP (SMP) from working in financial services, and collectively fine them &pound;590,544. The regulator considers the 4 were responsible for a pension transfer advice model that put at risk people&rsquo;s guaranteed retirement benefits.</span></p>
<p><span>Between October 2015 and July 2016, SMP&rsquo;s advice model put 547 customers at significant risk of transferring out of guaranteed defined benefit pensions into investments which were unlikely to be suitable for them, including investments in hotel developments in Cape Verde offered by The Resort Group Plc.</span></p>
<p><span>Many of those customers were brought to SMP by &lsquo;introducer&rsquo; firms, including First Review Pension Services Ltd (FRPS), a subsidiary of The Resort Group. In the FCA&rsquo;s view, SMP had clear indications of the link between FRPS and The Resort Group.</span></p>
<p><span>SMP&rsquo;s advice model did not take into account the information required to assess the suitability of a pension transfer or how the benefits of the customer&rsquo;s existing scheme compared to the new investment. SMP did not intend it to.</span></p>
<p><span>Adrian Douglas and Liam Martin, both qualified pension advisers, played important roles in designing and operating the transfer advice model used at the Essex-based firm.</span></p>
<p><span>SMP&rsquo;s two partners, Mr Oxberry and Mr Cuthbert, had oversight of the firm and its advisers. They did not ensure that due diligence was carried out on either FRPS or at least 16 other introducer firms involved in the model.</span></p>
<p><span>A requirement was agreed in November 2016 that stopped SMP using the advice model.</span></p>
<p><span>Therese Chambers, Joint Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight, said:</span></p>
<p><span>'People need to be able to trust the advice they receive about their pensions. But these 4 individuals put SMP&rsquo;s customers in danger of giving up guaranteed retirement income for high-risk investments, like overseas hotel developments. They received significant financial benefit in doing so, at the expense of their customers.</span></p>
<p><span>'There was a reckless disregard for customers&rsquo; financial situation, their needs through retirement and how their existing benefits compared to the proposed alternative. It is right the FCA takes steps to prevent these people from working in the financial industry and impose penalties.'</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA has decided to fine Mr Oxberry &pound;241,869, Mr Martin &pound;128,356 and Mr Douglas &pound;128,356 and ban them from working in financial services. They have referred the FCA&rsquo;s decisions to the Tribunal.</span></p>
<p><span>Mr Cuthbert has been fined &pound;91,963 and banned from working in financial services. Mr Cuthbert agreed to settle his case and has not referred the FCA&rsquo;s decision to the Tribunal.</span></p>
<p><span>SMP is now in liquidation. To date, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) has paid over &pound;13.4m in compensation to SMP&rsquo;s clients as a result of losses suffered following advice they received.</span></p>

Jeremy Skule, to Take on Expanded Role as Executive Chair of Nasdaq&rsquo;s Financial Crime Management Technology Business</span> </li>
</ul>
<p>Nasdaq (Nasdaq: NDAQ), today announced a new leadership structure including leadership appointment for its Financial Crime Management Technology business, designed to support the business&rsquo; strong momentum and continuing its growth trajectory.</p>
<p>Effective today,&nbsp;
Brendan Brothers, EVP, Head of Financial Crime Management Technology, and Verafin Co-Founder will step back from his current executive responsibilities and will transition into a senior strategic advisory role until at least&nbsp;December 31, 2024.</p>
<p>Coinciding with Brothers&rsquo; transition to an advisory role, Nasdaq will implement a new leadership structure for Financial Crime Management Technology with the establishment of an Executive Chair position.</p>
<p>
Stephanie Champion, current SVP and Head of Sales, will succeed Brothers as EVP and Head of Nasdaq Verafin, responsible for overseeing the business. A 13-year&nbsp;Verafin&nbsp;veteran, Champion brings a breadth of expertise across the anti-financial crime industry, a deep and robust client network, and a track record of growth and performance. Throughout her tenure, Champion has held several key leadership roles at Nasdaq Verafin, including as the head of the mid-market and enterprise business units, where she led the product, client onboarding and success, and sales teams. Most recently, Champion was responsible for the strategy supporting Nasdaq Verafin&rsquo;s growth in the upmarket client segment which has resulted in the signing of four Tier-1 and four Tier-2 bank clients in under 18 months. She has been instrumental in driving the business&rsquo; consistent, strong revenue growth over the past several years as the business continues to attract banks of all sizes to its unique, modern technology solutions to support their crime-fighting efforts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to express my sincere gratitude to Brendan for his numerous contributions to&nbsp;Verafin&nbsp;and his role as a driving force behind the company&rsquo;s founding through to its position today as the leading anti-financial crime platform,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>
Adena T. Friedman, Chair and Chief Executive Officer of Nasdaq</span>. &ldquo;I am very excited to appoint Stephanie and Jeremy in their new leadership roles. As the new Head of Nasdaq Verafin, Stephanie will be responsible for the business&rsquo; strategic and operational performance. She brings deep expertise and client relationships that she has developed over her 13 years in the business, as well as serving as a true culture carrier for the organization. Her leadership has been essential to the acceleration of our upmarket growth strategy. As Executive Chair, Jeremy will oversee the strategic direction of the business. He brings over a decade track record of strategic leadership and business expansion at Nasdaq, and I am confident their partnership best positions us to solve one of the financial system&rsquo;s largest, most complex challenges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am thrilled to take on the leadership role at such a pivotal and exciting time in Nasdaq Verafin&rsquo;s journey,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>
Stephanie Champion, EVP and Head of Nasdaq Verafin</span>. &ldquo;Being part of the wider Nasdaq platform has transformed our ability to drive sustained, scalable growth across the global market of financial institutions of all sizes. We continue to drive strong growth across the small- and medium-sized banking space while we make significant inroads into the Tier 1 and 2 segments. I look forward to the continued partnership with Jeremy and the wider Nasdaq Verafin leadership team as we capitalize on the opportunities ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Financial crime is a&nbsp;$3 trillion&nbsp;drag on the financial system &ndash; a major, global challenge and a problem that Nasdaq Verafin is uniquely placed to address,&rdquo; said&nbsp;
Jeremy Skule,&nbsp;<span>EVP, Chief Strategy Officer, and Executive Chair of Financial Crime Management Technology</span>. &ldquo;I am excited to take on this expanded role and look forward to continuing to work with the Nasdaq Verafin team to advance our leading solutions to help financial institutions eradicate financial crime from their networks.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span>Speaker</span>: Sarah Pritchard, executive director of markets and international<br /><span>Event</span>: The Capital Markets Industry Taskforce conference<br /><span>Delivered</span>: 6 September 2024<br /><br /></p>
<h2>Key messages</h2>
<ul>
<li>We are continuing with our ambitious package of reforms to strengthen the UK&rsquo;s position in global wholesale markets.</li>
<li>After undertaking the biggest change to the listing rules in over three decades, we followed up weeks later with a package of measures to further boost the UK&rsquo;s position as a global and vibrant financial centre.</li>
<li>Success isn't measured in days, weeks or months. Success is measured in the long-term economic growth of UK capital markets.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>In its first year, the Great North Run was advertised as a local fun run. It has now grown into one of the biggest races in the country.</p>
<p>On Sunday, 60,000 runners will make their way along the 13.1 mile route from Newcastle to South Shields. The more than &pound;25m it raises each year for charity relies on more than one person&rsquo;s half marathon on one particular day.</p>
<p>It relies on the collective thousands of hours in training. Analysing vast amounts of data on smart watches or on Strava. It's the interplay of individual performances in one competitive race.</p>
<p>Likewise for capital markets, it's not about one individual player. It&rsquo;s about the entire ecosystem coming together so participants can compete, grow and achieve the best results. And for the greater good of a thriving economy.</p>
<p>With your support, we continue to deliver on our ambitious programme of work to strengthen the UK&rsquo;s position in global wholesale markets.</p>
<p>While we have crossed many milestones, we are not finished yet. Like a long-distance runner attempting to complete the six major marathons across the world to receive the coveted six-star medal, we have many races to come.</p>
<h2>Listings reform</h2>
<p>Regulation has a role to play in making sure UK capital markets are race fit. That is why we have undertaken the biggest change to the listing rules in over three decades.&nbsp;<br /><br />It is now exactly 6 weeks since our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/FCA%20overhauls%20listing%20rules%20to%20boost%20growth%20and%20innovation%20on%20UK%20stock%20markets">new listing rules</a>&nbsp;became operational on 29 July.</p>
<p>Over the years the rules governing listed companies in the UK had grown in reach and complexity. With fewer people taking advantage of those complex rules.<br /><br />Taken as a package, and in light of market evolution, we were told that the regime created disproportionate burdens and restrictions on companies with ambitions to innovate and grow.</p>
<p>Some went so far as to say that listing in the UK was being lost as a consideration. The regime was just too complex with too many barriers. And in the low-interest rate environment, private equity markets were racing ahead. Maintaining the status quo wasn&rsquo;t an option if we wanted to reverse long-term decline. But it wasn&rsquo;t easy either.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we engaged extensively with all parts of the market to listen to all views. Our aim throughout was to start an inclusive and thorough debate to make sure all voices were heard.</p>
<p>We tried to build consensus as much as possible rather than compromise on everything. That can result in decisions no one supports.</p>
<p>And we sought consensus through a discussion on risk appetite &ndash; to inform the decisions we have now made which we hope will support capital markets for decades to come.</p>
<p>We looked at our regime holistically and determined that a change in philosophy was needed &ndash; moving towards a more disclosure-based regime, which puts the right information in the hands of investors so they can make their own decisions.</p>
<p>This is a better approach for modern markets. It recognises that investors make their own decisions, daily, on where, how and what to invest in.</p>
<p>We concluded that a 'one size fits all' regulator-prescribed approach, written in 2024, would not provide sufficient flexibility for the range of companies who may wish to list. And risks becoming out of date very quickly.</p>
<p>The new rules introduce a simplified regime that maintains high standards, one that is right for the UK, compares well internationally and one which we hope will help boost UK stock markets.</p>
<p>Companies listed in the UK will still be expected to uphold high standards regarding disclosure and corporate governance. And shareholders retain the ability to exercise good stewardship to influence company behaviour and hold the management of the companies they co-own to account.<br /><br />These remain important and longstanding pillars of the UK markets. We want investors in UK listed markets to have access to timely and appropriate disclosures to make informed investment choices, in a more diverse market of opportunities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have been clear from the outset that these changes will shift the dial on risk, but we made this choice in recognition that capital markets are increasingly international. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The investor base has evolved and become more global. UK investors are investing in jurisdictions where they see competitive companies with the promise of attractive returns, and where the frictions we have now removed do not exist. Companies are operating and going public across borders. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Put simply, companies raising capital and investors deploying it have global choices. We want them to choose the UK.</p>
<p>We want to support investors to make their own choices too about the companies they invest in, through timely and appropriate disclosures. And we want to show the regulatory dynamism, which some wags may say is a somewhat oxymoronic phrase, that one commentator credited us with recently. We&rsquo;ve come a long way and as you know the journey isn't over yet.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Public offers and admissions to trading regime&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Just like Sifan Hassan competing for the 5,000m, 10,000m and the marathon at the Paris Olympics, we have not stood still. She continually raised her own bar and ran all three courses in the same week, including the hardest Olympic marathon ever.</p>
<p>Indeed, step by step we continue to run at pace to support the whole ecosystem of the UK&rsquo;s capital markets.</p>
<p>Just 2 weeks after we confirmed the listing rules reform, we set out proposals for a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/consultation-papers/cp24-12-consultation-new-public-offers-admission-trading-regulations-regime-poatrs" title="CP24/12: Consultation on the new Public Offers and Admission to Trading Regulations regime (POATRs) ">new public offers and admissions to trading regime</a>, to make it cheaper and easier for companies to raise money in the UK.</p>
<p>We progressed this work in tandem because we know the importance of making sure the whole markets ecosystem works. Our proposals were informed by close engagement with the markets.</p>
<p>As part of the process, we set up brand new ways of working through bitesize &lsquo;Engagement Papers&rsquo; (or &lsquo;EPs&rsquo;). Not just because we love acronyms at the FCA, but because we were keen to work differently to solicit views early and openly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are proposing more proportionate rules on the disclosures companies are required to make when they seek to admit securities to a regulated market.&nbsp;While we intend to retain prospectus for initial admissions, we will require a prospectus in far fewer cases for further issuances of securities.</p>
<p>This recognises that once issuers already have securities on UK public markets, the wider regulatory framework ensures a high level of transparency and ongoing reporting.</p>
<p>But we will still accept voluntary prospectuses for those issuers that want FCA approved documents, for example to support cross-border capital raising.</p>
<p>High quality disclosures are important. They should evolve with market developments. That is why we proposed some enhancements to prospectus disclosures in relation to sustainability, particularly on climate-related matters and debt instruments marketed as having sustainability-linked features or use of proceeds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new framework will allow a more proportionate and agile approach to regulation. It adopts the same philosophy as our listings reform &ndash; with a disclosure-based approach that seeks to encourage a rebalanced risk appetite while keeping high standards.&nbsp;We want to get the balance right.</p>
<p>Although our proposals are already informed by a huge amount of prior market input via our engagement papers, we want to know what you think.</p>
<p>Please submit your views online by 18 October.</p>
<h2>Investment research</h2>
<p>Next on the starting line were new rules that give asset managers greater freedom in how they pay for investment research, by allowing the &lsquo;bundling&rsquo; of payments for research and trade execution. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We commissioned data surveys and arranged roundtables to test drive our proposals. It meant we could race forward with our proposals at the point of formal consultation.</p>
<p>We saw that investors are largely getting the research they need, but that there can be operational complexities and unnecessary burdens in doing so. This had adverse impacts on small asset managers.</p>
<p>We listened to these concerns.</p>
<p>Our final rules are shaped by four key themes:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Flexibility</span>: To work across different types of asset managers.&nbsp;</li>
<li><span>Adaptability</span>: Making it easier for asset managers to buy research across borders.</li>
<li><span>Investor protection</span>: Guardrails to ensure sufficient investor protection and good outcomes, for example to make sure investors do not absorb the cost of less disciplined overconsumption of low-quality research. &nbsp;</li>
<li><span>Preserving competition</span>: To ensure bundled payments do not impede competition in distinct markets.</li>
</ul>
<p>We intend to have in place similar requirements for pooled funds. Rest assured we will get the market&rsquo;s input, so the all the practicalities are considered. Please look out for our consultation very soon.</p>
<h2>Digital securities sandbox and PISCES</h2>
<p>As we race ahead with reforms, we are changing how we engage the market. Markets are always evolving and we know that we cannot stand still as we focus on growth and innovation. We want to be agile, but we want our interventions to be evidence-based and future-proof.</p>
<p>And you can expect us to take the same approach in convening, listening and engaging as we explore ways to harness these opportunities.</p>
<p>Including by helping companies to innovate and scale, while initially remaining private, by creating the world&rsquo;s first private intermittent capital exchange system &ndash; or PISCES.</p>
<p>The PISCES platform will give new investors an opportunity to help companies access new capital to grow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Growth companies need to meet their own funding requirements to contribute to the overall growth of the economy. This is sometimes referred to as a &lsquo;growth escalator&rsquo;. Companies will access the escalator in different ways, and the primary, secondary and private markets along that journey. The FCA has a role ensuring regulation doesn't get in the way of companies accessing the capital they need as they move upwards.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve ushered in a new era with our package of capital markets reform and the new Digital Securities Sandbox will allow firms to keep up the pace. The sandbox allows firms to test drive innovative new technologies for trading and settling assets, in a live regulatory environment.</p>
<p>We will continue to work with the Bank of England, government and industry to harness new technologies while protecting the integrity and cleanliness of UK markets.</p>
<h2>Value for money framework</h2>
<p>When we think about capital markets, it is not enough to just think about issuers. We need to consider the whole investment ecosystem.&nbsp;Pensions schemes are significant investors in capital markets, and it is important that they think carefully about how the best returns can be generated for consumers. This can also have a beneficial impact overall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why does that matter?</p>
<p>16 million people are actively saving for their retirement into defined contribution pension schemes, and the vast majority are in the default investments offered to them.</p>
<p>We are proposing greater transparency and metrics that drive a shift from cost to value. It could make a difference for the savings of millions of people and help them get the value they deserve. Here our race becomes a relay.</p>
<p>Never one to jump the gun, we are running the first leg but we&rsquo;ll work closely with&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-work-pensions" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DWP<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/en" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Pensions Regulator<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;to gather feedback and insight so we can pass the baton and reach the finish line. On pensions you need a whole system approach. This Value for Money Framework does that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important we get this right and we welcome feedback on whether the proposals are right for consumers and for businesses.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Before 11 July, many of you may have thought the Listing Rules reforms could not have been delivered. That it would have been too difficult to have a public debate on a shift in risk appetite and it would have been impossible for regulators to support that. That it would have been too difficult to be bold where there are strong differences of view in the market. That the regulator wouldn&rsquo;t listen. Or that the market wouldn&rsquo;t tell the regulator what it really thinks.</p>
<p>As I stand before you today, I hope that we can all take confidence from the reforms we have delivered or are consulting on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Confidence that bold reforms are possible &ndash; even where there are diverging views. Confidence that we will listen and confidence that you and market participants will tell us what you think. Confidence that the FCA will work at pace to deliver.</p>
<p>We are continuing with our ambitious package of reforms to strengthen the UK&rsquo;s position in global wholesale markets.</p>
<p>You can expect us to take the same professional approach in all of this. A willingness to listen, to convene where there are differing views, to make difficult decisions where needed, and to focus on delivery and outcomes.</p>
<p>That outcome is a strong UK capital market. Companies will go where the opportunities exist and we want to set the right race conditions so they can choose the UK.</p>
<p>These changes better reflect the risk appetite needed to achieve growth and a more diversified market. We are putting the choice back to issuers, investors, and markets.</p>
<p>Regulation is only one part of the answer; these changes alone will not guarantee growth so we&rsquo;re continuing to work closely with government and industry to achieve sustainable growth together.</p>
<p>This is a marathon not a sprint. Success isn't measured in days, weeks or months. Success is measured in the long-term economic growth of UK capital markets. It&rsquo;s measured in a greater range of companies choosing to list in the UK, grow in the UK and compete on the global stage.</p>

<li><span>The Capital Markets of Tomorrow report is aimed at revitalising the UK investment landscape.</span></li>
<li><span>The document from the Capital Markets Industry Taskforce* puts retail investors front and centre of future plans.</span></li>
<li><span>Retail share ownership levels among UK households has more than halved over the past 20 years.</span></li>
<li><span>Research from HL shows that too many people are sitting on excess cash savings which could be deployed in the economy and delivering longer term returns</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>*The UK Capital Markets Industry Taskforce (CMIT) comprises CEOs, chairs and industry leaders representing private and publicly listed companies, asset owners and managers, and advisory services that support their access to capital and investments.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets, Hargreaves Lansdown:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&lsquo;&rsquo;It&rsquo;s clear there is a great deal of work which needs to be done to boost investment in&nbsp;<span><span>London listings</span>&nbsp;</span>and help power up economic growth.<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>This report makes some helpful suggestions on revitalising the UK investment landscape to help lay the groundwork for long-term expansion.</span></p>
<p><span>Retail investors are enthusiastic holders of UK equities, helping provide the capital for companies to expand. Of those equities held on HL&rsquo;s platform, 80% of the trades in the last year were on the London markets. But greater efforts need to be made to encourage more people to start investing.</span></p>
<p><span>As the report points out, Britain has had a strong tradition of pensions savings and direct retail investment in shares. This peaked with the privatisations of the 1980s and 1990s and continued through the dotcom boom of the early 2000s. But it&rsquo;s shocking to see that retail share ownership levels among UK households have more than halved over the past 20 years.</span></p>
<p><span>Research from HL shows that too many people are sitting on excess cash savings, which could be deployed in the economy and delivering longer term returns.&nbsp; Our latest Savings and Resilience Barometer into the efficient use of money from April 2024 shows that over 12 million households have excess cash savings.&nbsp; These could be redeployed to pensions and investments which have the potential to deliver higher returns.</span></p>
<p><span>In many ways, it's not surprising people have been turned off from dipping their toe into investing. All too often they have been left out of initial public offerings on the stock market, only able to get a small foot in the door after institutional investors have taken their pickings. Time after time retail investors are left disappointed by the their small allocation in IPOs. &nbsp;HL was significantly oversubscribed for the Raspberry Pi IPO, which only allocated &euro;8million to retail investors. This shows there are still matters on the supply side to fix. It&rsquo;s heartening to see that retail investors will be pushed more towards the centre of future plans through the FCA&rsquo;s proposed reforms of the listings and prospectus regime.</span></p>
<p><span>Tax wrappers like ISAs and SIPPs make all the difference to people building their pots for the future and for major events in their lives.&nbsp; ISAs are part of the furniture &ndash; in a good way. They&rsquo;ve been around for 25 years and are well established and well loved. Of course, like anything we&rsquo;ve been wedded to for 25 years, we can always think of ways they could improve. But while small changes would be welcome, its essential they do not over-complicate the landscape and that tax-free allocations are either increased or at the very least maintained.</span></p>
<p><span>What would also help simplify retail investing and encourage more people to take the plunge into the stock market is reducing the Lifetime ISA (LISA) penalty from 25% to 20%. The 25% penalty not only claws back the government bonus to save, but also applies an additional 6.25% penalty based on the net amount invested. It would give investors more confidence to use this highly useful tax wrapper to climb onto the housing ladder or save for retirement with the knowledge that they won&rsquo;t be penalised if their circumstances change.&rsquo;&rsquo;&nbsp;</span></p>

<title>Securities Commission Malaysia Cautions Public On Investment Scams Using Fake Information Memorandums</title>

<div> Scam, Investment, Information Memorandums, Securities Commission Malaysia, Endorsement<br />
<br />
The Securities Commission Malaysia warns of a new investment scam using fake Information Memorandums claiming endorsement by the SC. Investors urged to verify and report.<br />
Summary:<br />Immediate action taken including police report and adding company to Investor Alert List. SC warns public to verify investment claims and report suspicious activities. <div>
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) today cautioned the public on a new investment scam which uses fake Information Memorandums (IM)<sup>1</sup> to procure investment from the public, falsely claiming that it has been lodged with or endorsed by the SC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the Capital Markets and Services Act 2007 (CMSA), unlisted public companies issuing IMs to raise funds are required to lodge them with the SC within seven days of issuance to potential investors. However, the lodgment of an IM does not constitute an endorsement by the SC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this case, the SC found that the company represented to investors that it has issued an IM purportedly lodged with the SC, thus misleading investors and lending credibility to its investment scheme. The SC confirms that the company did not lodge any IM with the SC and suspects that it is part of an investment scam.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Immediate action has been taken including filing a police report and adding the company on SC&rsquo;s Investor Alert List at <a href="https://www.sc.com.my/investor-alert-list">https://www.sc.com.my/investor</a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/investor-alert-list">-</a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/investor-alert-list">alert</a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/investor-alert-list">-</a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/investor-alert-list">list</a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/investor-alert-list">.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SC views this matter seriously, as such an act may lead the public to believe that the SC endorses and approves the investment product.</p>
<p>The public is strongly encouraged to verify any claims using the name of the SC or any of its officers, and to report this as well as any suspicious activities or investment information to the SC. This will help protect investors from potential risks and assist them in making informed investment decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The public can verify investment offers through the SC Investment Checker at <a href="http://www.sc.com.my/investment-checker">www.sc.com.my/investment</a><a href="http://www.sc.com.my/investment-checker">-</a><a href="http://www.sc.com.my/investment-checker">checker</a><a href="http://www.sc.com.my/investment-checker">.</a></p>
<p>For reports or enquiries, the SC&rsquo;s Consumer and Investor Office can be reached at +603 6204 8999 or through email via <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="mailto:aduan@seccom.com.my" title="aduan@seccom.com.my">aduan@seccom.com.my</a></span>.&nbsp;</p>

<title>SEC Charges Former Finance Director At CIRCOR International With Accounting Fraud - Company Settles SEC’s Charges For Related Accounting Controls Violations; Avoids Penalties Based On Self-Report, Cooperation, And Remediation</title>

<div> SEC, fraud charges, CIRCOR International Inc., financial reporting, internal accounting controls
Summary: SEC charges Nicholas Bowerman for fraud at CIRCOR International, leading to misleading financial statements. CIRCOR settles related internal accounting charges. 

Summary:<br /><br />SEC files fraud charges against former CIRCOR International finance director. CIRCOR settles internal accounting charges. No penalty due to self-reporting. <div>
<p><span><span>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced fraud charges against Nicholas Bowerman, a former finance director of CIRCOR International Inc., a formerly publicly traded technology manufacturer. The SEC alleges that Bowerman&rsquo;s fraud led to the company making misleading statements to the public about the company&rsquo;s financial performance from 2019 through 2021. The SEC also announced related settled internal accounting charges against CIRCOR.</span></span></p>
<p>Bowerman worked at CIRCOR&rsquo;s U.K.-based business unit, Pipeline Engineering. According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint against Bowerman, between 2019 and 2021, Bowerman manipulated CIRCOR&rsquo;s internal accounting records by falsifying Pipeline Engineering&rsquo;s financial results before they were included in CIRCOR&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements. The complaint further alleges that Bowerman concealed his misconduct by manipulating account reconciliations, falsifying certifications, fabricating bank confirmation documents, and misleading CIRCOR&rsquo;s management and independent auditors. The SEC&rsquo;s separate order against CIRCOR finds that the company failed to devise and maintain sufficient internal accounting controls concerning financial statement preparation, reconciliation processes, and access to bank accounts. Because of these deficiencies, CIRCOR was unable to prevent Bowerman&rsquo;s fraud and, as a result, overstated by millions of dollars its performance for fiscal years 2019 and 2020 and the nine months ending October 3, 2021.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, the SEC did not seek a civil penalty against CIRCOR because CIRCOR self-reported its financial reporting violations to the SEC shortly after commencing an internal investigation and thereafter provided substantial cooperation to the staff, including providing detailed examples of Bowerman&rsquo;s unsupported and unauthorized adjustments, summarizing interviews of witnesses located outside the United States, and making CIRCOR employees and external forensic accountants available for interviews. CIRCOR also promptly implemented remedial measures, which included strengthening its internal accounting controls, hiring additional experienced finance and accounting personnel, and canceling compensation scheduled to be paid to a former executive officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While this matter involves serious violations of the securities laws, once the company became aware of the violations, it promptly self-reported, cooperated, and remediated the gaps in its accounting systems,&rdquo; said Nicholas P. Grippo, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Philadelphia Regional Office. &ldquo;As also reflected in other recent Commission resolutions, this kind of response by a corporate entity can lead to significant benefits including, as here, no penalty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, charges Bowerman with violating the antifraud, financial reporting, books and records, and internal accounting controls provisions of the federal securities laws and seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order against CIRCOR finds that CIRCOR violated the financial reporting, books and records, and internal accounting controls provisions of the federal securities laws. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s finding, CIRCOR agreed to cease and desist from further violations of the charged securities laws.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Christine R. O&rsquo;Neil, Samika N. Osbourne, and Brian R. Higgins, and supervised by Brendan P. McGlynn, all of the Philadelphia Regional office. The SEC&rsquo;s litigation against Bowerman will be conducted by Judson T. Mihok and supervised by Gregory R. Bockin, also of the Philadelphia Regional Office.</p>

<p><span>Speaker:&nbsp;</span>Sarah Pritchard, executive director, markets and executive director, international<br /><span>Event:&nbsp;</span>The Financial Crime Summit, London<br /><span>Delivered:&nbsp;</span>05/09/2024<br /><span>Note:</span> This is a drafted speech and may differ from the delivered version</p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fighting financial crime is a priority for the FCA and a key commitment in our 3-year strategy.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Consistent with the national economic crime plan and fraud strategy, our work is based on a partnership approach. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Financial crime is not just an issue for the financial sector, but for other sectors too, sharing data and intelligence is a vital tool in staying one step ahead. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Picture the scene.</p>
<p>London, 1666: a labyrinth of narrow streets, lined with wonky wooden buildings hunched tightly together.</p>
<p>On a balmy evening in early September, a small flame ignites in a local bakery.</p>
<p>As first, it seems like a minor incident. No big deal. Just a small fire that can be pretty easily managed.</p>
<p>But as the flames begin to spread, the fire leaps from house to house, street to street, growing stronger and more ferocious.</p>
<p>People try to stop the spread, but they don&rsquo;t use the right tools. Their efforts are unfocused and uncoordinated.</p>
<p>Soon, the fire grows out of control, and before you know it, the blaze has swallowed vast swathes of the city &ndash; taking lives and livelihoods with it, transforming the London skyline forever.</p>
<p>Now think of financial crime as that spark in the bakery.</p>
<p>Sure, it may start small &ndash; just a minor fraud or a simple scam. But if left unchecked, if not targeted and contained, it can grow into something much larger &hellip; sweeping through the economy, damaging businesses, damaging livelihoods and damaging trust in our financial systems.</p>
<h2>Fighting financial crime &ndash; focusing on outcomes</h2>
<p>Like the firebreaks that could have saved much of London, a targeted approach to tackling financial crime is what I want to talk about today.</p>
<p>An approach that uses data to spot outliers and issues.</p>
<p>An approach where we share what that data is telling us &ndash; and what good practice and poor practice look like &ndash; so everyone can understand the outcomes we expect.</p>
<p>Because a targeted, and outcomes-focused approach is essential if we are to bear down on financial crime in an effective and proportionate way.</p>
<h2>A targeted approach to enforcement</h2>
<p>Of course, we are, first and foremost, a regulator.</p>
<p>And we enforce our regulations with vigour.</p>
<p>Because financial crime costs every one of us here today &ndash; consumers and firms alike.</p>
<p>It violates the financial systems we rely on to live our everyday lives and uses them against us &hellip; It fuels all manner of harmful activities from terrorist financing to money laundering, to fraud &hellip; And it damages the integrity of our markets, undermining our international competitiveness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why fighting financial crime is a key commitment in the FCA&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/corporate/our-strategy-2022-25.pdf" title="Our Strategy 2022 to 2025">3-year strategy</a>.</p>
<p>Cases are complex and can be difficult to prosecute, but where we see harm and where our objectives are engaged, we will use all of the tools in our regulatory &ldquo;toolbox&rdquo; to respond.</p>
<p>In the last financial year, we charged 21 individuals with financial crime offences; the highest number of charges we have achieved in any single year.</p>
<p>In 2023 we secured 3 times as many freezing orders as in 2022, restraining more than &pound;21m in assets of individuals under investigation.</p>
<p>And just last month we took firm&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/pwc-fined-failing-alert-fca-suspected-fraudulent-activity-london-capital-finance-plc" title="PwC fined &pound;15 million for failing to alert the FCA to suspected fraudulent activity at London Capital &amp; Finance plc">enforcement action against the auditor PwC</a>, fining it &pound;15m for failing to alert us to suspected fraudulent activity.</p>
<p>So, we are using our powers more assertively than ever.</p>
<h2>Preventing fires breaking out</h2>
<p>But I do not want us to be constantly hosing down fires where they arise.</p>
<p>I want us to also be making strategic interventions to stop them breaking out in the first place.</p>
<p>That means working with partners across the whole UK system, through the UK&rsquo;s public and private partnerships and the&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/economic-crime-plan-2023-to-2026" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Economic crime plan 2023 to 2026 | GOV.UK">economic crime plan<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;at the same time as driving a more integrated and targeted approach to tackling financial crime across the FCA.</p>
<p>A first step is how diligent and assertive we are at the gateway with those seeking authorisation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rightly a rigorous process.</p>
<p>We want firms to have the right systems and controls in place before we authorise them, so they aren&rsquo;t used to facilitate financial crime.</p>
<p>In the last financial year, 36% of Annex 1 firms &ndash; that is firms seeking to register with us for anti-money laundering purposes only &ndash; withdrew their applications, or had their applications rejected.</p>
<p>It is our job to make sure standards are met. And we make no apology for that.</p>
<p>Let me be clear though &ndash; we don&rsquo;t&nbsp;<em>want&nbsp;</em>to reject applications.</p>
<p>Those firms who have the right standards, following the guidance and expectations that we have clearly set out, can and will achieve registration.</p>
<p>And I would like to see more of this &ndash; more firms meeting the money laundering standards that we expect, first time round.</p>
<h2>Innovative and data-led</h2>
<p>When it comes to countering financial crime, we know we must embrace change to stay ahead of the criminals.</p>
<p>Whether it is pre-empting the way they use new technology such as AI, or coming together to share and interrogate data &hellip; we must be vigilant, constantly improving our systems and controls against those seeking to exploit them.</p>
<p>One area where our innovative methods are bearing fruit, is in reducing the risk to consumers of illegal or non-compliant financial promotions.</p>
<p>Using data and technology, we have increased our capacity to identify illegal financial promotions on websites or social media.</p>
<p>We are tackling fraud faster by scanning approximately 100,000 websites every day to identify those that appear to be scams.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/financial-watchdog-stops-thousands-misleading-ads-promotions" title="Financial watchdog stops thousands of misleading ads and promotions">Over 10,000 potentially misleading adverts</a>&nbsp;were either amended or withdrawn because of our action in 2023 &ndash; an increase of 17% on 2022.</p>
<p>And last year we hosted a 3-day investment fraud tech sprint drawn from regulatory, intelligence and law enforcement agencies to design new ways to tackle this type of fraud.</p>
<p>Using the FCA&rsquo;s own supervisory reach, we have also created a dedicated financial crime function within our Consumer Investments department &ndash; an area where we have seen evolving threats of financial crime and fraud.</p>
<p>Their work is proactive and highly targeted: identifying outliers, spotting trends earlier and snuffing out threats before they spread like wildfire.</p>
<p>For example, a high turnover of money laundering reporting officers, frequent changes to a firm&rsquo;s registered name, or significant changes to the nature of service provided post FCA-authorisation, are all risk indicators that can raise a red flag.</p>
<p>Over the past 18 months the team have been out on unannounced spot visits, gathering evidence and intervening to prevent harm.</p>
<p>This has included placing requirements on firm&rsquo;s permissions, imposing asset restrictions and, in certain cases, even stopping firms providing financial services altogether.</p>
<p>More of that assertiveness I was talking about earlier.</p>
<p>We are working with other regulatory and law enforcement partners too. In July we were pleased to join with the National Crime Agency (NCA) and 7 UK banks as part of a&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/ground-breaking-public-private-partnership-launched-to-identify-criminality-using-banking-data" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Ground breaking public private partnership launched to identify criminality using banking data | NCA">major NCA-led project<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;to identify and act against organised crime.</p>
<p>A joint team analysed account data shared by participating banks that suggested potential criminality.</p>
<p>As well as identifying several new organised crime networks, the project has delivered vital intelligence in support of wider NCA and law enforcement investigations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an innovative approach, and one yielding real outcomes.</p>
<p>It also highlights the importance of having the FCA at the table alongside industry and law enforcement to answer the question: what will the regulator think of this?</p>
<h2>Taking a system-wide approach</h2>
<p>And while of course the financial services sector must continue to take the lead, it&rsquo;s important to emphasise we are part of a whole system response &ndash; a bucket brigade, if you will, to tackling and extinguishing financial crime.</p>
<p>As part of the national economic crime plan and&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fraud-strategy" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Fraud strategy | GOV.UK">fraud strategy<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>, we are working with partners to support system-wide improvements.</p>
<p>Because we are clear it takes the efforts of both public and private sectors &ndash; including regulated firms themselves &ndash; to reduce and prevent financial crime.</p>
<p>In the past year, we have taken a leading role in influencing Big Tech companies to stop scams and illegal ads from appearing on their platforms.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve worked with the likes of Google, Bing, Meta and others, and they now ban paid-for adverts for UK financial services that are not approved by an FCA-authorised firm.</p>
<p>We have also worked with Apple and Google to remove apps from their stores that breach our financial promotions rules, further protecting UK consumers.</p>
<p>This risk-based approach really works when outcomes are aligned, and the risk is collectively managed across multiple industries. And it&rsquo;s a powerful example of how targeted, proportionate action can lead to positive outcomes.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, we are using our powers through the Office for Professional Body Anti-Money Laundering Supervision (OPBAS) to improve standards in the legal and accountancy sectors.</p>
<p>In the last financial year, OPBAS used its powers to direct 2 Professional Body Supervisors (PBSs) to take action to remedy money laundering shortfalls. Just one example of how OPBAS is using an increasing range of regulatory tools and powers to hold PBSs accountable.</p>
<h2>Our joint efforts are working</h2>
<p>Financial crime is notoriously difficult to quantify.</p>
<p>But the data tells us that the system-wide work to block fraud at source, educate consumers and disrupt those engaged in fraud, is having an impact.</p>
<p>The latest&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/crimeinenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2024" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Crime in England and Wales: year ending March 2024 | ONS">ONS crime figures<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;for the last financial year showed that fraud had decreased by 10%, with reductions in bank and credit account fraud, advance fee fraud, and other fraud also falling.</p>
<p>The rate of growth in the number of investment fraud victims slowed from 28% in 2022 to 4% in 2023.</p>
<p>Moreover, the reported losses suffered by victims reduced by 40% in 2023, compared to 2022.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s genuine progress &ndash; but progress that needs to be sustained. That&rsquo;s why fighting financial crime will remain at the heart of the next FCA multi-year strategy.</p>
<h2>Proportionality</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m often asked if our response to financial crime is proportionate.</p>
<p>I know that the cost of financial crime compliance, including customer due diligence and anti-money laundering, can be significant.</p>
<p>What I would say is that all the right elements are now in place to shape that debate.</p>
<p>As part of our outcomes-based mindset towards financial crime, we are sharing our approach, expectations and findings more publicly and more frequently than ever.</p>
<p>Since April 2023, we have published 5 reviews of firms&rsquo; financial crime controls, sharing good and poor practice across the sector &hellip; so that firms can target their approach and know what good looks like.</p>
<p>Once we have those basics in place, using the right data to calibrate risk and respond accordingly, it&rsquo;s easier to see outliers &ndash; and then easier to take forward a more meaningful discussion on proportionality.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So where does this leave us? I come back to the importance of being driven by the outcomes we wish to achieve.</p>
<p>357 years ago today, the Great Fire was raging just metres from where we gather today.</p>
<p>The lessons learned from that disaster are as relevant now as ever.</p>
<p>If our strategy isn&rsquo;t right, if we don&rsquo;t use the right tools, if we just spray water around in a disordered fashion, we might dampen the surroundings, but the fire will continue to burn.</p>
<p>But by working together, all hands to the pump &hellip; equipped with the right tools and aiming directly at the flames &hellip; we can prevent small sparks from becoming devastating infernos that threaten the financial health of our entire nation.</p>
<p>I look forward to continuing to work with you all on this.</p>

<div> Euronext Dublin, IPOready 2025, pre-IPO programme, Irish companies, strategic financing<br />
<br />
Summary: Euronext and Irish government launch IPOready 2025 program to equip Irish CEOs/CFOs with skills for strategic financing, including IPO, supported by Enterprise Ireland and ISIF. <div>
<p class="BodyText1">The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Peter Burke and Euronext Dublin, formerly the Irish Stock Exchange, have today launched the recruitment for Euronext&nbsp;<em>IPOready 2025&nbsp;</em>in Ireland<em>,&nbsp;</em>at an event on the historic Market Floor at Euronext Dublin<em>.</em>&nbsp;This is the latest edition of Euronext&rsquo;s leadership programme designed to equip executives with the skills to scale and secure growth financing, up to and including through an Initial Public Offering (IPO).&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyText1">Commencing in January 2025, this six-month pre-IPO educational programme offers a blend of interactive workshops, international networking events with peers, investor pitches, and tailored mentoring sessions for CEOs and CFOs of scaling Irish companies. It is crafted to equip company leaders with the essential skills and insights needed to assess and pursue strategic financing options, including how to achieve a successful IPO to support long-term business expansion.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyText1">Recognising the vital role that homegrown enterprises play in the Irish economy, Euronext IPOready in Ireland has been instrumental in guiding over 55 indigenous alumni companies on options for financing their growth journeys. Recent alumni from the last programme include CWSI, Fortus Group, Mail Metrics, and Neurent Medical.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyText1">Niall Jones, Head of Listing for Ireland and UK at Euronext, commented on the launch, &ldquo;<em>Our mission is to empower indigenous SMEs by providing them with the tools and skills they need to pursue the right financing options for them to fuel their growth. Part of the programme educates executives about the path and benefits to an IPO, and how equity capital markets can support the growth of their companies, not just at the time of IPO but on an ongoing basis as well</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyText1">Euronext IPOReady supports fast-growing European companies considering a listing on a Euronext market in the coming years, providing executives with the tools and insights they need to achieve a successful IPO. The award-winning programme has now been adopted as the pre-IPO strategic financing programme across the pan-European Euronext network and will be conducted in nine countries simultaneously in 2025. In the past 5 years, Euronext has welcomed 540 IPOs, raising &euro;47bn. Since 2015, IPOready and its Euronext predecessor, TechShare have assisted over 1,080 companies in making more informed decisions about their funding options. Indeed, 29 IPOready alumni have gone public across Europe since 2025, raising a total of &euro;1.4bn upon listing.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">In his address at the launch event on Thursday, Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Peter Burke, said: &ldquo;<em>The IPOready programme is a valuable resource for Irish SMEs, providing them with the tools and knowledge to explore new avenues of growth through equity capital markets. My department is committed to supporting initiatives that empower our indigenous companies to scale and succeed globally. This programme not only enhances the prospects of individual businesses but also strengthens the overall resilience and competitiveness of the Irish economy. I encourage our ambitious indigenous companies to take full advantage of this opportunity as they prepare for future growth</em>."</p>
<p class="BodyText1">IPOready is delivered in partnership with Enterprise Ireland and the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF), building on the success of six previous editions since 2015.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">In his remarks about the partnership with Euronext Dublin, Leo Clancy, CEO, Enterprise Ireland, said:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Enterprise Ireland is committed to helping Irish business go global by supporting Irish owned companies to grow and scale. The IPOready&nbsp; 2025 programme provides an opportunity for businesses who wish to compete on the global stage to learn and gain insights from investors, executives and advisors who have played a part in the success of world-leading Irish companies. We are delighted to support this programme which equips companies looking to achieve scale with the skills to access strategic finance to support their growth journey and advice on taking their company public.&rdquo;</em></p>

<div> consultation, network code, demand response, renewable energy, electricity markets
Summary: 
ACER proposes EU-wide network code on demand response, integrating renewable energy, and facilitating access to electricity markets for smaller actors. Consultation and stakeholder webinar available. <div>
<p>On 8 May 2024, ACER&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsPUgcBU1FXUkxcAQdRHVYJB1MdCgkJAxoGAQQCDApWAQ5UBVcdWVMFVw9TDFEdBwgEBh0GCQJRGlcEAwcZUARUVwECBlgCUQIFRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">received</a>&nbsp;the electricity system operators&rsquo;&nbsp;proposal&nbsp;for an EU-wide network code on demand response.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsBBlVUBAVUVUwKBgcCHVYMUVUdUwpXXhpTAQQGBQFTUw4BVwAdWVMFVw9TDFEdBwgEBh0GCQJRGlcEAwcZUARUVwECBlgCUQIFRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">proposal</a>, submitted by the EU Distribution System Operators Entity (EU DSO Entity) and the European Network of Transmission System Operators (ENTSO-E), also suggests amendments to the related existing legal framework.</p>
<p>ACER has already made several amendments to the system operators&rsquo; proposal to ensure it aligns with the existing legal framework, follows the European principle of proportionality (e.g. measures must be appropriate, necessary and not excessive) and maintains legal clarity. ACER is now consulting on its&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsCVwIGVwVQAEwJUFVXHVZfAFQdCwEBURoCUwZSAQMNUw5UDlMdWVMFVw9TDFEdBwgEBh0GCQJRGlcEAwcZUARUVwECBlgCUQIFRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">revised draft</a>&nbsp;to gather stakeholders&rsquo; feedback early in the process.</p>
<p>Based on the input received, ACER will further amend the draft network code and related legal framework before submitting the final recommendation to the European Commission by March 2025.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why is this network code relevant?</span></p>
<p>Demand response is key for integrating the growing share of renewable energy and new electricity loads (e.g. resulting from heat pumps and electric vehicles) in a cost-efficient way.</p>
<p>In developing this draft network code, ACER is contributing to a more cost-efficient and clean energy transition by facilitating access to EU wholesale electricity markets for smaller actors, including consumers.</p>

<div> improvements, authorisations service, intervention, fair complaint resolution, financial crime<br />
Summary: The FCA has shown significant improvements in its authorisations service, increased intervention to stop harm to consumers, improved fair complaint resolution, taken strong action to tackle financial crime, and introduced new rules to protect consumers in the crypto market.<br /><br /> <div>
<p align="left"><span>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has published its&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/annual-reports/annual-report-2023-2024" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Annual Report</a>,</span><span>&nbsp;which shows significant improvements in its authorisations service.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p align="left"><span>Recognising the vital role that the regulator plays in enabling new financial services firms&rsquo; ability to meet regulatory standards to get off the ground, the FCA has improved its authorisation process. Now&nbsp;</span><span>98% of cases,</span><span>&nbsp;including applications by wholesale market firms,</span><span>&nbsp;are assessed within statutory deadlines, up from 89% in Q1 of 2022/23</span><span>.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><span>Overseas wholesale financial firms wishing to operate in the UK can also benefit from pre-application support from the FCA. The regulator has also recently completed the biggest reform to the listing rules in more than three decades. These changes support economic growth by helping firms access the capital they need to grow.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><span>Other highlights include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><strong>Intervening to stop harm to consumers more quickly</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><span>The FCA</span>&nbsp;<span>has continued to improve how it detects problem firms and individuals, which helps earlier intervention. For example, it doubled the cancellation of firm authorisations in 2023 to 1,261 and used its powers to intervene against 34 firms, who caused serious concerns, up 68% on 2022.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><strong>Improved fair complaint resolution and compensation</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><span>The FCA has taken strong action to make sure firms are compensating consumers, promptly and fairly, when things go wrong. This year it intervened with almost 100 lenders to make sure they were supporting borrowers in financial difficulty,&nbsp;<span class="NormalTextRun SCXW120726293 BCX0">and&nbsp;</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW120726293 BCX0">the FCA expects</span>&nbsp;that approximately 270,000 customers will receive close to &pound;60 million in compensation. At the same time, through its work on prevention, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) levy on the industry has fallen to a ten-year low.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><strong>Strong action to tackle financial crime</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><span>Since April 2023, the FCA has charged 21 people with financial crime offences which is the highest number of charges it has made in a single year. In 2023, it secured 9 freezing orders, 6 more than in 2022, and restrained &pound;21.1m in assets of individuals under investigation.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><strong>Protecting consumers in the crypto market</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><span>The FCA has introduced new rules that require cryptoassets promotions to UK consumers to be clear, fair and not misleading. This helps consumers better understand what they are buying, and the risks involved.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><strong>Protecting consumers</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><span>Since 31 July 2023, more than 42,000 firms must make sure they can evidence good outcomes for consumers for any new and existing &lsquo;on sale&rsquo; products and services, and for closed &lsquo;not on sale&rsquo; products since 31 July 2024, in line with the Consumer Duty.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

We delivered 27% growth in total credit ADV year-over-year, driven by a 34% increase in U.S. high-grade, a 25% increase in emerging markets, a 19% increase in Eurobonds, and a 49% increase in municipal bonds. We also generated record portfolio trading ADV of $988 million. Our leadership position in the global credit institutional e-trading space remains strong, and we are beginning the roll-out of X-Pro to our global client base later this month.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>General Notes Regarding the Data Presented</b></p>
<p>Reported MarketAxess volume in all product categories includes only fully electronic trading volume. MarketAxess trading volumes and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&ldquo;FINRA&rdquo;) Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (&ldquo;TRACE&rdquo;) reported volumes are available on the Company&rsquo;s website at&nbsp;<a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.marketaxess.com%2Fvolume&amp;esheet=54117825&amp;newsitemid=20240904692881&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=investor.marketaxess.com%2Fvolume&amp;index=1&amp;md5=bd7c6f4ffd5409d671d641e97391460d" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">investor.marketaxess.com/volume</a>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>In addition, for periods beginning with January 2024, the Company has made changes to the market volume data used to calculate estimated market share for Municipal and U.S. Government Bonds. For Municipal Bonds, the Company previously used estimates, derived from data issued by the Municipal Securities Rule Making Board (&ldquo;MSRB&rdquo;), including estimates for new issuance, commercial paper and variable-rate trading activity, and excluded these volumes from the estimated market volume data. While the Company still uses estimates, the new methodology for identifying and excluding these volumes from the market volume data is now based on MSRB &ldquo;flags&rdquo; to identify new issuance, commercial paper, and variable-rate volumes. For U.S. Government Bonds, the previous data source for estimated market volumes was the Federal Reserve Bank&rsquo;s Reported Primary Dealer U.S. Treasury Bond Trading Volumes, which was reported on a one-week lag. The new source for U.S. Government Bond trading volumes is FINRA&rsquo;s U.S. Treasury TRACE data. The Company believes that the refined methodology used for Municipal Bonds, and the new data source for U.S. Government Bonds, provides more accurate measures of estimated market volumes and estimated market share. Prior comparable periods have been recast retrospectively for both Municipal and U.S. Government Bonds to conform to the updated presentation of the data. The new estimated market volume data is also available on the Company&rsquo;s website at&nbsp;<a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.marketaxess.com%2Fvolume&amp;esheet=54117825&amp;newsitemid=20240904692881&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=investor.marketaxess.com%2Fvolume&amp;index=2&amp;md5=6647ede5ca999532ece30b53017ea928" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">investor.marketaxess.com/volume</a>&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span><span>BNP Paribas Asset Management (&lsquo;BNPP AM&rsquo;) announces today the launch of the first two equities funds in its innovative Active Beta exchange-traded funds (&lsquo;ETFs&rsquo;) range.&nbsp;<span>BNP Paribas Easy Sustainable Japan UCITS ETF</span></span></span><span><a href="https://mediaroom-en.bnpparibas-am.com/news/bnp-paribas-asset-management-launches-two-esg-active-beta-equity-etfs-5ca3f-0fb7a.html?utm_medium=campaign&amp;utm_source=wiztopic&amp;utm_campaign=BNP+Paribas+Asset+Management+launches+two+ESG++Active+Beta+Equity+ETFs#footnote-full-1" id="footnote-marker-full-1-1">[1]</a></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>and&nbsp;<span>BNP Paribas Easy Sustainable US UCITS ETF</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>are sub-funds of the BNP Paribas Easy Irish ICAV and began listing on 03 September on Euronext Paris and will be listed later this month on Deutsche B&ouml;rse Xetra.</span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The BNP Paribas Easy Active Beta ETF range is an innovative suite combining a traditional indexing approach with an active integration of BNPP AM&rsquo;s proprietary ESG methodology. These ETFs are designed for investors who are seeking a more focused approach to sustainability, one that can be adapted quickly to evolving regulations and label criteria, while keeping a relatively low tracking error.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Key highlights of our Active Beta ETFs:</span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Beta exposure to mainstream benchmarks</span></li>
<li><span>Minimising tracking error</span><span><a href="https://mediaroom-en.bnpparibas-am.com/news/bnp-paribas-asset-management-launches-two-esg-active-beta-equity-etfs-5ca3f-0fb7a.html?utm_medium=campaign&amp;utm_source=wiztopic&amp;utm_campaign=BNP+Paribas+Asset+Management+launches+two+ESG++Active+Beta+Equity+ETFs#footnote-full-2" id="footnote-marker-full-2-1">[2]</a></span><span>&nbsp;versus the investment universe</span></li>

</ul>
<p><span><span><span>Marie-Sophie Pastant, Head of Index &amp; ETF Strategies - Portfolio Management at BNPP AM comments:</span></span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><span>"</span></em><em><span>These two new launches are the natural next step of our Active Beta range. Our aim is to develop a new segment of equity funds aiming to be as close as possible to mainstream benchmarks, with ex ante TE between 1% to 1.5%, while integrating solid ESG features developed by BNPP AM. Those funds will decarbonate by 50% their starting universe.</span></em><em><span>"</span></em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>BNP Paribas Easy Sustainable Japan UCITS ETF</span>&nbsp;is an Article 8 fund according to SFDR regulation, seeking a Sustainable Investment of at least 55% while providing exposure to the Japanese equity market. The Benchmark Index is MSCI Japan Net Total Return Index.</p>
<p><span>BNP Paribas Easy Sustainable US UCITS ETF</span>&nbsp;is an Article 8 fund according to SFDR regulation, seeking a Sustainable Investment of at least 45% while providing exposure to the US equity market. The Benchmark Index S&amp;P 500 Net Total Return Index.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Both funds integrate BNPP AM&rsquo;s ESG approach and integrate PAB exclusions which makes them both eligible to sustainable labels criteria (French SRI label and Toward Sustainability label).</span></p>

Offering ETFs that combine a recognised ESG approach, high sustainable investment and ambitious decarbonisation target, while providing the benefits of index-based investing, including a reasonable tracking error, will answer the increasing demand from institutional clients and distributors to integrate ESG factors in their portfolio.&rdquo;</span></em>&nbsp;</span></p>

<title>DiffusionData Releases Diffusion 6.11 - Community Feedback Has Major Impact On New Enhancements In Latest Version Of Diffusion</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> performance, usage monitor, cluster-aware, topic view, session filtering
Summary:
Diffusion 6.11 introduces major performance improvement, usage monitoring, cluster-aware enhancements, topic view mapping, and session filtering features. The update aims to enhance developer productivity and operational efficiency. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a class="OWAAutoLink safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.diffusiondata.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">DiffusionData</a></span></span>, the pioneer and leader in real-time data streaming and messaging solutions, today announced the release of Diffusion 6.11. The latest developer-centric enhancements to the framework aim to speed and simplify development, reduce operational costs, and ensure reliable and efficient delivery of real-time data.</p>
<p>Grethe Brown, CEO of DiffusionData, said: &ldquo;Many of the enhancements we&rsquo;ve introduced in 6.11 have been driven by an ongoing dialogue with our Diffusion community. It&rsquo;s important for us to understand the evolving requirements of our clients and address those when introducing improvements to our framework. The enhancements reflect some of the daily challenges faced by developers and are intended to improve operational productivity. &nbsp;&nbsp;The feedback from our amazing customers continues to fuel our innovations in real-time data.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Enhancements in Diffusion 6.11 include:</p>
<p><b>Major Improvement in Distributed Update Performance</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b>In previous releases the performance of updates in a clustered environment was significantly slower than that of a single server. With this release, asynchronous operations are applied to bring cluster performance comparable to a single server.</p>
<p><b>Usage Monitor</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b>In 6.11, a new usage monitoring feature has been introduced. This provides customers with the ability to collect certain usage statistics in files that can then be sent to DiffusionData periodically so that their usage of the framework can be assessed. This allows DiffusionData to have a far better view on how Diffusion is being used and provide customers with feedback on their usage to improve the overall technology experience.</p>
<p><b>Other enhancements in 6.11 include:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Cluster-aware Session Event Listener:</b>&nbsp;a new API has been added to replace the previous session properties listener. This brings the ability to listen for events related to sessions across a cluster of servers, as well as new filtering capabilities.</li>
<li><b>Topic View Scalar Path Mapping Extension:</b>&nbsp;an enhancement to allow topic views to include parent paths when creating views of the topic tree.</li>
<li><b>New &lsquo;Environment&rsquo; Session Property</b>: a new fixed session property has been added to provide additional information about connecting clients, and enable more powerful filtering of sessions.</li>
<li><b>New &lsquo;Matches&rsquo; Comparison for Session Filtering</b>: session filters can now make use of regular expressions for matching sessions.</li>
<li><b>Ability to Turn Delta Compression Off for Update Streams</b>: users can now suppress delta generation in update streams. Disabling delta compression can reduce the CPU workload at the client at the cost of increased bandwidth.</li>
<li><b>Fetching Topic Sizes</b>: it is now possible to fetch the sizes of topics without transferring the topic payload. &nbsp;Sizes are also displayed in the Diffusion Management Console.</li>
<li><b>Diffusion Management Console Improvements</b>: the Diffusion Management Console has had several improvements. These include a new intuitive way to define and manage topic views, and a new structural browser for JSON values.</li>

<div> Collaboration, Solactive, Evolve ETFs, Canada Utility Index, ETF
<br />
The Solactive Canada Utility Index, launched in partnership with Evolve ETFs, offers exposure to stable Canadian utility sectors with potential for long-term growth.
<br /><br />Summary: The index provides exposure to stable Canadian utility sectors, with potential for long-term growth through targeted and diversified investments. <div>
<p><strong>Solactive is pleased to announce the extension of its collaboration with Evolve ETFs with the launch of the Solactive Canada Utility Index. This index provides targeted exposure to essential industry sectors that form the backbone of Canada&rsquo;s economy, including utilities, pipelines, and telecommunications. These sectors are known for their low volatility and ability to generate consistent income, even in turbulent market environments, and are positioned to benefit from potential long-term trends.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.solactive.com/downloads/Guideline-Solactive-SOLCAUT.pdf">Solactive Canada Utility Index</a>, consists of the largest Canadian companies in the extended utility sector and ensures diversified exposure across the portfolio by equally weighting each component. The index first selects the top four companies by free float market capitalization from each of the three key categories: utilities, pipelines, and telecommunications. Subsequently, the ten remaining companies with the highest free-float market capitalization across all sectors are selected. This fully rule-based index is rebalanced quarterly to maintain an optimal mix of established market leaders and evolving players within the Canadian broader utility landscape.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The ETF listed on 4<span>th</span>&nbsp;September on the Toronto Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol &ldquo;UTES&rdquo;.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Timo Pfeiffer, Chief Markets Officer at Solactive, comments:</span>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;We are excited to partner with Evolve ETFs on this launch. The Solactive Canada Utility Index captures the performance of the stable yet dynamic utilities sector in Canada. This collaboration underscores our commitment to delivering innovative index solutions that meet the evolving needs of investors.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>&ldquo;With over $7 billion in assets, we are excited to announce another addition to our growing lineup of covered call funds,&rdquo;&nbsp;</em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">says Raj Lala, President and CEO at Evolve ETFs</span>.&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Utilities are a staple in Canadian portfolios, offering stable dividends, low volatility, and long-term growth potential.

<div> Private Debt, European SME Debt Fund III, BNP Paribas Asset Management, Senior Debt, Private Assets<br />
Summary: 
BNP Paribas Asset Management announced the final close of the BNP Paribas European SME Debt Fund III, with EUR 741 million, targeting SMEs and mid-caps in Continental Europe. The fund has won the confidence of around twenty institutional investors and is classified as Article 8 under SFDR. It targets a portfolio of 70 SMEs and Mid-caps that are champions in their respective sectors and has already financed more than 40 companies at this stage. The success of this third senior debt vintage demonstrates the relevance of the model implemented by BNP Paribas Asset Management's private asset platform, offering investors a differentiating product in this growing market. <div>
<p><span><strong>BNP Paribas Asset Management (&lsquo;BNPP AM&rsquo;) announces the final close of the BNP Paribas European SME Debt Fund III (&lsquo;Fund III&rsquo;), with EUR 741 million, above the initial target of EUR 600 million. The&nbsp;</strong><strong>SME Debt Fun</strong><strong>d III</strong><strong>&nbsp;fund finances Small and Medium sized Enterprises (&lsquo;SMEs&rsquo;) and Mid-cap companies in Continental Europe in the form of secured bullet loans. Since its creation in 2016, BNPP AM&rsquo;s private debt activity helped more than 250 companies develop their business with more than EUR 1.7 billion deployed.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>This third vintage has won the confidence of around twenty institutional investors from six different countries, including insurers, pension funds, asset managers and intergovernmental organizations. This success consolidates BNP Paribas Asset Management's position in the dynamic corporate private credit market. This fast-growing market offers investors the opportunity to diversify their asset allocation, with an attractive risk-return profile. It also provides successful companies with an additional opportunity to finance their long-term growth.</span></p>
<p><span>Fund III targets a portfolio of 70 SMEs and Mid-caps that are champions in their respective sectors and has already financed more than 40 companies at this stage. As per the two previous vintages, Fund III has a distinctive positioning in the private debt universe thanks to its very high granularity, combined with a strong selectivity of financing opportunities. This is made possible by the well-established partnership between the fund's management team and BNP Paribas' banking networks, which represent an important but not exclusive part of the identification of the financed companies.</span></p>
<p>Classified as Article 8 under SFDR<sup>1</sup>, Fund III integrates companies&rsquo; environmental and social characteristics in its investment process.</p>
<p><span>Christophe Carrasco, Head of Private Debt at BNPP AM, comments:</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Senior European private credit offers a compelling option for SMEs and mid-caps, as one of the key elements for a company to strengthen its leading position, or to bolster global innovation efforts. As far as investors are concerned, private credit offers an attractive risk-return profile with a significant illiquidity premium over the bond market with counterparties that have dominant positions in their specialised sectors.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>David Bouchoucha, Head of Private Assets at BNPP AM, adds:</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;The success of this third senior debt vintage demonstrates the relevance of the model implemented by our private asset platform. The combination of unique market access thanks to the BNP Paribas Group, with the selectivity of experienced management teams, and a rigorous attention to ESG criteria, makes it possible to offer investors a differentiating product in this growing market.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Fund III is managed by BNPP AM's Private Assets division, created in January 2023. It consists of more than 100 investment professionals and currently manages and advises EUR 40 million in assets.</span></p>

<div> Regulatory Guide 16, ASIC, external administrators, controllers, statutory reports<br />
Summary: ASIC updated guidance for reporting alleged misconduct by external administrators and controllers, focusing on professional judgment and timely reporting.<br /> <div>
<p>ASIC has today released its updated regulatory guidance for external administrators and controllers when reporting and lodging statutory reports about alleged misconduct.</p>
<p>The updates to Regulatory Guide 16&nbsp;<em>External administrators and controllers: Reporting of possible offences and misconduct</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/for-finance-professionals/registered-liquidators/applying-for-and-managing-your-liquidator-registration/rg-16-external-administrators-and-controllers-reporting-of-possible-offences-and-misconduct/" title="RG 16 External administrators - Reporting and lodging">RG 16</a>) follow&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-072mr-asic-consults-on-misconduct-reporting-guidance-for-external-administrators-and-controllers/" title="24-072MR ASIC consults on misconduct reporting guidance for external administrators and controllers">an extensive consultation process</a>&nbsp;that included targeted industry roundtables to seek input into our proposed changes.</p>
<p>ASIC released Consultation Paper 377&nbsp;<em>Guidance for reporting by external administrators and controllers: Updates to RG 16</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/consultations/cp-377-guidance-for-reporting-by-external-administrators-and-controllers-updates-to-rg-16/" title="CP 377 Guidance for reporting by external administrators and controllers: Updates to RG 16">CP 377</a>) in April 2024.</p>
<p>Our responses to the key issues raised by respondents in CP 377 included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a dedicated contact point for external administrators and controllers to raise questions with ASIC in relation to the preparation and lodgement of reports of misconduct. We encourage external administrators and controllers to raise questions through our new dedicated e-mail address &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:ISR&amp;SSRquestions@asic.gov.au">ISRandSSR.Questions@asic.gov.au</a></li>
<li>Retaining ASIC&rsquo;s existing guidance that external administrators and controllers can lodge multiple initial statutory reports to enable flexibility in reporting.</li>
<li>Retaining indicative timeframes given the importance of timely reporting. While we do not require lodgement within these timeframes, we encourage this approach.</li>
<li>Clarifying in the guidance that an external administrator or controller may use their professional judgement to form the view that it is necessary to undertake further inquiries to meet their reporting obligations in the particular circumstances. Our guidance is now focused on the minimum steps required to comply with the reporting obligations, and we have not included prescriptive guidance through checklists or examples for that reason.</li>
</ul>
<p>Report 793&nbsp;<em>Response to submissions on CP 377 Guidance for reporting by external administrators and controllers</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-793-response-to-submissions-on-cp-377-guidance-for-reporting-by-external-administrators-and-controllers/" title="REP 793 Response to submissions on CP 377 Guidance for reporting by external administrators and controllers">REP 793</a>) provides more detail on responses to the submissions received during the consultation process.</p>
<p>ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said, &lsquo;We appreciate the valuable feedback we received during the consultation on RG 16 which has sharpened the updates to our guidance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Our expectation is that external administrators and controllers will exercise their professional judgement in reporting misconduct to ASIC. Our updates to RG 16 are intended to clarify what external administrators and controllers need to report on and when, so that they can apply professional judgement with greater confidence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ms Court added, &lsquo;We are also working on a comprehensive review of our internal processes for ingesting, screening, analysing and, where required, acting on the reports we receive. We will consider the issues raised in the feedback we received during the consultation on RG 16 as part of that review.&rsquo;</p>
<p>ASIC will support members of the profession as they transition to the updated guidance through ongoing industry liaison. We will also continue to monitor whether we require any additional updates to RG 16 in response to law reform, case law or stakeholder feedback.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>RG 16 provides guidance to external administrators and controllers on their obligation to report to ASIC possible offences and misconduct, and for liquidations where the company may be unable to pay its unsecured creditors more than 50 cents in the dollar.</p>
<p>There have been a number of developments that have influenced the need for updates to RG 16. These include the expansion of case law, legislative reforms (including simplified liquidation reporting), and feedback from the inquiry into corporate insolvency in Australia by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services (the Committee).</p>
<p>In particular, the Committee recommended that until a comprehensive review of the current statutory reporting obligations can occur, ASIC should consider whether any timely changes can be made to the reporting thresholds and how it responds to insolvency practitioner reports.</p>

<div> enforce, CoFI, supervision, insurance, regulatory<br />
Summary:<br />
Jane Brown, Head of Insurance at FMA, discussed recent regulatory investigations, enforcement cases, the CoFI regime, and FMA's supervision approach. <div>
<p>Tēnā koutou katoa,</p>
<p>Ko Kōtirana te whakapaparanga mai,</p>
<p>Ko Manawatū te whenua tupu,</p>
<p>Ko Kiwitea te kāinga,</p>
<p>Kei Te Whanganui-a-Tara au e noho ana,</p>
<p>Ko Jane taku ingoa,</p>
<p>Tēnā tātou katoa.</p>
<p>Thank you for inviting me here. The title of my segment today is regulatory investigations. It&rsquo;s a serious topic and I will have to choose my words carefully. My aim in this speech is to apply more of a supervisory lens to give an overview of the last few years, and how the FMA and the insurance sector can best learn from recent enforcement cases and work together under the CoFI regulatory regime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those of you who don&rsquo;t know me, I&rsquo;m Jane Brown, Head of Insurance at the Financial Markets Authority. Before joining the FMA, I was the General Counsel at Te Kāhui Inihua o Aotearoa / The Insurance Council of New Zealand for six years. In my current role, I have built up the FMA&rsquo;s insurance team both in terms of numbers and understanding of the sector that we regulate ahead of CoFI coming into force. And because I take every opportunity I have to do so, I will say that I am very fortunate to have a team that is eager to engage with and understand the sector at both an operational, and also a strategic level.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s conference theme is &ldquo;regeneration&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a fitting theme for the city we are in given all that it and its people have been through. The FMA and the insurance sector are also on a regeneration journey of sorts, as we prepare for a new way of regulating the conduct of financial service providers. Additionally, there is an element of regeneration in terms of the FMA and the insurance sector&rsquo;s relationship &ndash; but more on that later.</p>
<h3>Recent cases</h3>
<p>The FMA and Reserve Bank of New Zealand&rsquo;s joint Conduct and Culture review of banks and life insurers in 2019, and the FMA&rsquo;s review of fire and general insurers in 2021, uncovered some examples of poor practices negatively impacting customers and unfair treatment. Now, no one at the FMA will talk about ongoing investigations, no matter who is standing on the stage, and my focus is on the supervision of insurers, so what I want to do here instead is look at what we as regulator, and you as regulated firms or representatives of regulated firms, can learn from recent cases.</p>
<p>In eight cases, the FMA&rsquo;s Enforcement team took civil proceedings under the Fair Dealing provisions within the Financial Markets Conduct Act. They stemmed from false or misleading statements in marketing material for financial products, and in many of the cases with insurance companies, were for failing to apply multi policy discounts to customers who were entitled to them. The FMA was particularly concerned by the length of time these failures went unchecked. Some cases stretched back decades, resulting in significant breaches, customer harm, and millions of overcharged premiums.</p>
<p>For the FMA this work was time and resource intensive, stretching over multiple years, in part due to the complexity and breadth of each issue.</p>
<p>In the FMA&rsquo;s view, and that of the Courts, the relationship between insurers and their customers is one of trust. Customers should rightfully expect to be treated fairly by their insurer and that agreements between the two parties will be honoured. The deficiencies in IT systems and lack of oversight by the insurers administering the products broke that trust.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t already, I encourage all of you to read the judgments that have come out of the proceedings we have taken, something I&rsquo;m also working my way through. They provide incredibly useful insights into the Court&rsquo;s view of bad conduct and what firms should be thinking about when considering what fair treatment looks like.</p>
<p>These issues were often associated with more than one product or one aspect of business. In these situations, the FMA expects firms to test other parts of their business, or other products, to ensure similar problems haven&rsquo;t arisen.</p>
<p>The FMA has also shown it is willing to use alternative regulatory tools available to it. In one case, the FMA chose to issue a warning to one provider for failings similar to the eight proceedings. This case was a good example of the FMA&rsquo;s action being proportionate to the seriousness of the offending, number of customers affected, and the remedial work undertaken by the provider.</p>
<h3>Self-Reporting</h3>
<p>A key issue that the response to the Conduct and Culture work has flushed out is self-reporting.</p>
<p>Among our minimum expectations for those we supervise, and for good conduct risk management, is that issues and potential breaches should be self-reported to the FMA. This is a sign that entities take their legal and licensing obligations seriously - and by informing us, they will endeavour to fix the issues quickly.</p>
<p>When the self-reported issues have the potential to reveal significant breaches or involve risks and harms to customers, we may investigate further and it can result in us using our regulatory or enforcement tools and remedies.</p>
<p>It is also worth reminding you of our view of what best practice &ldquo;self-reporting&rdquo; looks like. If there is an issue a firm discovers that requires remediation for customers, or shows that systems or processes are not delivering promised outcomes, that&rsquo;s not good news. But it is here where firms start to make the choices that matter. The right way or the wrong way. The right way involves promptly informing your board, bringing the issue to the FMA, and ensuring timely remediation and communication with customers.</p>
<p>Waiting until firms think the problems have fully bottomed out, before making first contact with the FMA, or your customers may be tempting. Instead, we urge firms to prioritise stopping the harm as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The choices an entity makes after discovering the problem will be relevant to the FMA&rsquo;s enforcement response and will often influence our view of the entity&rsquo;s overall conduct. However, self-reporting cannot provide immunity from potential action and even litigation, especially if the issues are significant, systemic or have led to customer harm.</p>
<p>The nature of the underlying misconduct itself will always be the driving factor in assessing the appropriate response. The more serious the misconduct &ndash; to consumers or to the market &ndash; the more likely it is we will take strong enforcement action, irrespective of how it was reported to us. And that makes sense, not just for the FMA, but for any law enforcement agency. The FMA has said it before &ndash; a confession does not absolve responsibility. No one thinks poor conduct or breaches of the law should go without accountability.</p>
<h3>CoFI</h3>
<p>Many of you will be aware of this recent history. But there is a key point I want to raise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the period before the Conduct of Financial Institutions regime comes into force. The only tools the FMA has to deal with the historic issues I&rsquo;ve set out is its fair dealing powers under the FMC Act. The FMA hasn&rsquo;t licensed insurers for conduct, there&rsquo;s no other tools for us to use other than investigations or enforcement. What CoFI does is provide us with a licensing regime, and a whole heap of tools such as monitoring, supervision, direction orders, stop orders, and the broader range of soft tools we have at our disposal, like guidance, like media interviews, like this speech.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would now like to turn to what the FMA&rsquo;s supervision approach will look like under CoFI. The Conduct of Financial Institutions regime (CoFI) introduces a new regulatory regime to ensure registered banks, licensed non-bank deposit takers, and in your case, licensed insurers, comply with the fair conduct principle when providing relevant services to consumers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fair conduct principle is the overarching principle of CoFI that a financial institution must treat consumers fairly. It is important that consumers get the financial products and services they need throughout their life, when they need them, and have trust and confidence that those products and services will perform as expected and meet customers' needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CoFI supports a greater focus on good conduct risk management and customer outcomes, proactively analysing how products are performing for customers (not just the business), communicating clearly and regularly with customers and acting quickly if something is not working as it should be. An outcomes focus&nbsp;requires thinking about and implementing good effective practice and the results this will achieve, not just complying with prescriptive rules set by law. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA sees this as a continual journey: good conduct and treating customers fairly needs to be ongoing and ever-evolving rather than being a one-off project. Embedding good practice now will smooth the transition to the new conduct regime &ndash; a good conduct programme is as much about change management and cultural change as it is about compliance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, to supervision. CoFI will allow the FMA to evolve into a more fully fledged conduct regulator with a range of proactive tools - as well as litigation where necessary - to influence conduct and consumer outcomes into the future. Fair dealing powers can only be reactive. They exist to correct behaviour where things have gone wrong. These are necessary, but not sufficient, for either preventing poor conduct outcomes or encouraging good outcomes.</p>
<p>Under CoFI we will be focusing more on the outcomes resulting from treatment of consumers rather than just on the methods financial institutions have chosen to comply with CoFI obligations. We believe that financial institutions know their businesses best and are best placed to determine the most effective actions to achieve CoFI obligations and objectives.</p>
<h3>And how do we assess conduct?</h3>
<ul>
<li>By running monitoring reviews to assess how firms are complying with obligations and demonstrating they are serving the needs of customers</li>
<li>Undertaking &lsquo;thematic reviews&rsquo; of the sector to understand how different firms conduct themselves on a particular topic of interest</li>
<li>Acting on information (such as complaints) from customers and market participants themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p>When investigations and action are required, we will still take an approach proportionate to the misconduct to achieve an appropriate market outcome. We are also committed to taking strong action and holding individuals and entities accountable when they break the law and fail to meet the standards that are expected of them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you or your clients are all well into the application process for your CoFI licence. With a little over six months until the regime gets underway, the FMA strongly encourages all firms that require a CoFI licence to get their application in before the end of 2024, to ensure a smooth transition into the regime that begins on 31 March 2025.</p>
<p>The FMA has received several applications so far, and approved more than half a dozen, but that&rsquo;s fewer than we would have expected by now given how close we are to go time. We are currently engaging closely with a wide variety of firms who need a licence and are proactively engaging with smaller firms in particular, such as non-bank deposit takers and Credit Unions.</p>
<p>Some firms have told us that they are likely to seek an exemption to requiring a fair conduct programme. There are also some firms who have indicated to us that they are likely to seek an exemption from the regime as a whole. We would really encourage those firms to have a Plan B, in terms of getting a CoFI licence. The law is very clear about what is expected. A licence application takes around 60 working days for the FMA to process. If a firm is not licensed by 31 March 2025, they will not be able to offer financial services for their retail customers. FMA staff are here to help and support firms in getting ready for CoFI, and we encourage firms to reach out if they have any questions. We are committed to an open and educative approach, so all financial markets participants&nbsp;have clear and well-understood responsibilities.</p>
<p>One of the other ways our regulatory approach is developing is in the ways we are thinking about the costs and benefits of our regulatory approach. Where it&rsquo;s appropriate, and where we are able, we&rsquo;ll look to remove unnecessary burden, and we always remain alert to how our actions can impact firms.</p>
<h3>Concluding statement</h3>
<p>So, in short, the FMA has been busy these past few years when it comes to its regulatory investigations. It has come at a time of significant change for both the FMA and the sector. We are moving from a reactive, to proactive supervisory approach of financial institutions under CoFI.</p>
<p>Our work in this space will continue and change as we embed the CoFI regime in our day-to-day operations. We won&rsquo;t be on this journey alone, we want to take you there with us, well hopefully not down the investigations route, but I hope you get my point.</p>
<p>The FMA, along with its Council of Financial Regulators partners, recently set its vision for New Zealand&rsquo;s insurance sector. We want an insurance sector that is forward-looking, fair, stable competitive and efficient, promoting informed and confident participation by consumers and businesses. We aim to do this by working with you all as part of a co-ordinated system of prudential and conduct regulators. CoFR will continue to work closely with you all to ensure that this vision is achieved.</p>
<p>I said this in my first speech as an FMA employee earlier this year but it&rsquo;s worth reiterating. We all want the same end result. That is for businesses to grow successfully and support their customers by treating them fairly and putting their interests at the heart of their decision-making. For those professionals that help industry with financial services regulation, we understand and support the work you do. We know that keeping an open dialogue with all our stakeholders will be critical to our success in both the short-term, delivering the up-coming changes, but also the long-term, in order to foster the fairest financial sector in the world.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Broker-Dealer Nationwide Planning And Two Affiliated Investment Advisers With Violating Whistleblower Protection Rule - NJ-Based Firms Impeded Clients From Voluntarily Reporting Information To The SEC</title>

<div> SEC, charges, settlement, violations, whistleblower
Summary:
SEC announces charges against three affiliated registrants for impeding clients from reporting violations. Firms to pay $240,000 in penalties. Violations of whistleblower protection rule.<br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against three affiliated registrants, Commission-registered broker-dealer Nationwide Planning Associates, Inc. and investment adviser NPA Asset Management, LLC, and state-registered investment adviser Blue Point Strategic Wealth Management, LLC, for impeding brokerage customers and advisory clients from reporting securities law violations to the SEC. The firms agreed to pay combined civil penalties of $240,000 to settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, from May 2021 through February 2024, Nationwide, NPA, and Blue Point collectively asked 11 retail clients to sign confidentiality agreements in connection with payments made by the entities to the clients&rsquo; investment accounts. The payments were intended to compensate the clients for losses caused by the firms&rsquo; alleged breaches of federal or state securities laws. The order finds that the agreements contained provisions that impeded clients from reporting potential securities law violations to the SEC by permitting communications only where the SEC first initiated an inquiry. As described in the order, some of the agreements further required the clients to represent that they had not reported the underlying dispute to the SEC or to another securities regulator and would forever refrain from such reporting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pure and simple, investors need to be able to report complaints or evidence of wrongdoing to the SEC without impediment,&rdquo; said Corey Schuster, Co-Chief of the Enforcement Division&rsquo;s Asset Management Unit.&nbsp; &ldquo;We will continue to hold firms accountable for putting roadblocks between us and their investors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that Nationwide, NPA, and Blue Point each violated Rule 21F-17(a) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, a whistleblower protection rule that prohibits taking any action to impede an individual from communicating directly with SEC staff about possible securities law violations. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, Nationwide, NPA, and Blue Point each agreed to be censured and to cease and desist from violating the whistleblower protection rule. They further agreed to a combined penalty, which was apportioned according to their relative size and financial condition, with NPA agreeing to pay $160,000, Nationwide $70,000, and Blue Point $10,000.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Chantal Russell of the SEC&rsquo;s Home Office and Marilyn Ampolsk of the Asset Management Unit, with assistance from Deborah Russell, and was supervised by Virginia Rosado Desilets, Mr. Schuster, and Andrew Dean of the Asset Management Unit.</p>

<title>IMF: Financial And Regulatory Reform Agenda Contributed To Accelerating Saudi Economy's Growth</title>

<div> International Monetary Fund, Saudi Arabia, economic reforms, Vision 2030, non-oil sector<br />
Summary:<br />
IMF praises Saudi Arabia's economic reforms, Vision 2030 progress, diversification, women's labor participation, non-oil sector growth, financial resilience, environmental reforms. <div>
<div class="content" id="ReleaseContent">
<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) issued a positive report on the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia following the conclusion of the Article IV consultations with Saudi Arabia. The IMF report confirmed that Saudi Arabia's financial and regulatory reform agenda contributed to accelerating the Saudi economy's growth, containing inflation, and reducing the unemployment rate to its lowest levels ever. The IMF praised the ongoing economic transformation and efforts to diversify the economy under the Saudi Vision 2030.</p>
<p>The IMF Article IV Consultation report commended the macroeconomic policies and transformational changes implemented by the Kingdom, which contributed to enhancing the growth of non-oil activities. The report also noted that Saudi reforms led to rising employment, which now exceeds pre-Covid figures, and that the rate of women's participation in the labor market rose to more than 35%, exceeding the Saudi Vision 2030 target of 30%.</p>
<p>The IMF welcomed Saudi Arabia's measures of conducting the long-term financing planning that supports the implementation of the initiatives, programs, and projects of Vision 2030; while mitigating the risks of overheating. The report also stressed that the Kingdom's fiscal space is strong, and that sovereign debt risks are low, adding that the abundance of financial reserves in Saudi Arabia has limited the impact of global and regional challenges.</p>
<p>The IMF report stressed that the ongoing reforms in the Kingdom&mdash;including ensuring the effective implementation of regulations, streamlining fees, enhancing human capital, increasing the participation of Saudi women in the labor market, facilitating access to land and financing, and improving governance&mdash;have contributed to enhancing private sector growth and attracting more foreign direct investment, in addition to the significant progress in the field of digital transformation and artificial intelligence that support these efforts.</p>
<p>The IMF Executive Directors commended Saudi's leadership role in multilateral fora, including its chairmanship of the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) in the IMF, contributing to efforts to address global challenges.</p>
<p>The report also noted the increased activity in the services sector&mdash;including transportation, trade, tourism and finance&mdash;as the growth in consumption that reached 5.7%.</p>
<p>The IMF said that foreign investment license applications reached record levels in 2023, as they approximately doubled from 2022, including the 330 companies applying for licenses to establish their regional headquarters in the Kingdom.</p>
<p>The report reviewed the banking sector developments in the Kingdom, stressing its strong levels of solvency and liquidity, and its flexibility to shocks. The IMF noted that the banking sector is on strong footing, and also noted the efficiency of banking mediation, according to indicators of profitability, infrastructure, and competitiveness.</p>
<p>The IMF report also noted the rise in the Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul) index of 14.2% in 2023, surpassing the Morgan Stanley Emerging Markets Index of 7%, while noting the progress in the technical environment enabling investment, and the licensing of three digital banks. The IMF stressed their contribution to enhancing financial inclusion and competitiveness as these banks are characterized by flexibility and innovation.</p>
<p>The IMF noted the Kingdom's containment of risks resulting from the rapid growth of real estate lending, through diverse government support, the strength of banks, full recourse mortgages, and other supportive measures. It also highlighted improvements in automating the national assessment matrix for money laundering and terrorist financing risks, and enhancing the accuracy of data analysis related to risks received from reporting entities, including fintech companies.</p>
<p>The IMF report noted that the increase in non-oil revenues reflects the effectiveness of existing reforms, which directly contributed to enhancing compliance, praising the alignment of customs procedures with international best practices.</p>
<p>The IMF expected the non-oil sector (which includes government activities) to grow by 3.5% in 2024, supported by strong domestic demand. The IMF also stated that it is probable the inflation rate in the Kingdom remains stable at around 2% over the medium term, supported by the Saudi Riyals peg to the US dollar, and local policies consistent with Saudi Vision 2030.</p>
<p>The IMF confirmed that the Kingdom has one of the lowest carbon intensity levels among all major producers, due to ongoing environmental reforms and the Kingdom's efforts to achieve net zero by 2060. The report noted the Kingdom's success in securing a 30-year purchase agreement for the green hydrogen project in NEOM, to achieve its efforts to utilize renewable energy sources.</p>
<p>In order to sequester approximately 44 million tons annually by 2035, the IMF noted that the Saudi government intends to build one of the largest carbon capture and storage plants in the world, which will be operational by 2027, with a capacity of 9 million tons of carbon dioxide annually. The IMF noted the Kingdom's current efforts to sequester 1.3 million tons of carbon annually through the SABIC Plant and Uthmaniyah Gas Plant Department.</p>

Summary: FINRA launches online campaign to educate new investors about risks and rewards, targeting social media users and promoting informed decision-making. <br /> <div>
<p>FINRA has launched an online advertising campaign,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/tradesmart">Get Your Head in the Trade</a>, encouraging new investors to understand investment risks and rewards as well as their own financial goals and risk tolerance before making an investment decision. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Millions of investors enter the market each year, about half of them are self-directed, and many are using social media as a primary source of information. FINRA is expanding our outreach to meet investors where they are and provide resources to help them make informed investment decisions,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/about/governance/executives#board">Marcia Asquith, Executive Vice President, Board and External Relations at FINRA</a>.</p>
<p>The campaign will run for three months on various platforms, including Instagram, YouTube, Spotify and Yahoo! Finance. The ads link to a new web page,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/tradesmart">FINRA.org/tradesmart</a>, designed to equip new investors with knowledge, skills and tools.</p>
<p>There are two video ads in the campaign:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/M4r9ZPiQ_Z4" target="_blank">"Meghan Gets a Stock Alert&rdquo;</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/Gk_aywg9Zs4" target="_blank">&ldquo;Meghan Checks an AI Pick&rdquo;</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one of several social media posts in the campaign:<br /><br /><img alt="Am I trading under the finfluence?" src="https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/2024-09/head_in_game.png" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />According to data from the FINRA Investor Education Foundation&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finrafoundation.org/sites/finrafoundation/files/NFCS-Investor-Report-Changing-Landscape.pdf" target="_blank">National Financial Capability Study</a>, investors who are new, younger or use social media for investing information are more likely than more experienced investors to engage in riskier behaviors. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over half of new investors invest in crypto assets, nearly one-third trade options, and about one-in-five purchase securities on margin.</li>
<li>Holding microcap or penny stocks in one&rsquo;s investment portfolio was associated with using social media for investment information.&nbsp;</li>
<li>About 26 percent of social media users traded more than 10 times a month compared with about 17 percent of non-social media users.</li>
</ul>
<p>The campaign is the latest in a series of FINRA initiatives begun in 2021 recognizing the growing number of new, self-directed investors in the market. These efforts include a new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/_finra/" target="_blank">Instagram channel</a>; an ongoing series of discussions at college campuses around the screening of Optimist&rsquo;s award-winning documentary,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97-M2w05ixI" target="_blank">This is Not Financial Advice</a>&nbsp;and other initiatives to be announced.</p>

<title>New Challenge Seeks To Tackle Online Crypto Investment Fraud With Innovation - Partnership Between Alberta Securities Commission, Edmonton Police Foundation And Edmonton Police Service Welcomes Proposals To Combat Rising Scams</title>

<div> partnership, crypto investment fraud, challenge, protection, technology <br />
The Alberta Securities Commission has partnered with the Edmonton Police Foundation to launch a challenge to address online crypto investment fraud.<br /><br />Summary: The partnership aims to combat crypto investment fraud and protect Alberta investors through innovative solutions and collaboration. <div>
<p>The Alberta Securities Commission (ASC) has partnered with the Edmonton Police Foundation (EPF) and the Edmonton Police Service (EPS) to launch the ScamShield: Investor Protection Challenge to seek new and innovative solutions to address the growing threat of online crypto investment fraud.<br /><br />As part of EPF&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://edmontonpolicefoundation.com/community/csa/">Community Solutions Accelerator (CSA)</a>, the challenge is designed to complement the work already being done by the ASC and police. With a prize pool of up to $130,000, this challenge calls for innovative solutions to enhance investor protection and strengthen Alberta&rsquo;s capital market.<br /><br />The ASC estimates that more than 60 per cent of the $309 million of investment fraud reported to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre in 2023 was tied to crypto investment frauds. In Edmonton alone, there were more than 80 victims with combined losses of over $7,000,000 last year. The true amount is likely higher because these crimes are vastly underreported. Those that do report provide valuable information on how scams are growing and evolving. This helps inform law enforcement's approach to addressing these scams.<br /><br />&ldquo;Anyone can be the victim of a scam and the impact can be devastating,&rdquo; said Cynthia Campbell, Director of Enforcement at the ASC. &ldquo;We are partnering with the EPF and EPS and hoping to engage more disciplines so that together we can find new ways to address this significant issue, protect more Alberta investors, and strengthen our capital market.&rdquo;<br /><br />Many victims do not consider themselves investors but get lured into a scam believing it can help solve their financial troubles. Fraudsters leverage technology and psychological manipulation to deceive investors through social media deepfake scams, romance scams, emotional manipulation and other online tactics.&nbsp;<br /><br />Preventing online crypto investment fraud requires a multi-pronged approach. This challenge provides an opportunity for those in academia, technology, and innovation to work together with enforcement partners to propose new and novel ways to stop further victimization locally and potentially on a national scale.&nbsp;<br /><br />&ldquo;Online crypto investment fraud has become a preferred technique for scammers, taking advantage of the general public&rsquo;s lack of experience with crypto as a high-risk investment vehicle, and the inherent challenges in tracing cryptocurrency transactions,&rdquo; said Deputy Chief Devin Laforce with the EPS Investigations and Support Services Bureau. &ldquo;As technological developments create new opportunities, criminals continually refine their methods, exploiting the digital economy in increasingly creative ways. Police continue to investigate and pursue these criminals to the fullest extent of the law, but the pervasiveness of their tactics makes this an issue we cannot tackle alone.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;The Edmonton Police Foundation recognizes the importance of collaboration in combatting complex crime issues,&rdquo; said Ashif Mawji, board member of EPF. &ldquo;By working hand in hand with the EPS and ASC, we can support law enforcement efforts, provide additional resources, and foster innovation to address emerging threats effectively.&rdquo;<br /><br />Officially launching today, challenge submissions will be accepted until November 4, 2024. More information on eligibility and evaluation criteria can be found online at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.herox.com/scamshield" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">www.herox.com/scamshield</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />EPS and the EPF were the first to bring the CSA approach to policing in North America in 2020. The CSA leverages expertise, data, technology, and support from multiple sources to work collectively on challenges that have been identified by the community, social agencies, healthcare, and law enforcement.<br /><br />The ASC is the regulatory agency responsible for administering the province's securities laws. It is entrusted with fostering a fair and efficient capital market in Alberta and with protecting investors. As a member of the Canadian Securities Administrators, the ASC works to improve, coordinate and harmonize the regulation of Canada's capital markets.</p>

<title>Dissenting Statement Of CFTC Commissioner Caroline D. Pham On DeFi Enforcement Action Involving Uniswap Protocol</title>

<div> DeFi, Uniswap Protocol, CFTC, Leveraged Tokens, Ethereum blockchain
Summary: Commissioner dissents in DeFi enforcement action, citing lack of evidence and regulatory overreach, advocates for balanced approach to innovation. <br /><br /> <div>
<p><span><span><span><span>I respectfully dissent on&nbsp;<i>In re Universal Navigation Inc.</i>, a decentralized finance (DeFi) enforcement action involving the Uniswap Protocol</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;on the Ethereum blockchain, because there is no evidence in the administrative record that describes the specific terms and/or characteristics of the &ldquo;Leveraged Tokens&rdquo; as characterized in the settlement order. Without such information, it is not possible to perform an appropriate product legal analysis of the Leveraged Tokens to determine whether they are a CFTC-jurisdictional product, and, therefore, whether the CFTC has the authority to bring this enforcement action in the first place and whether a violation of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) or CFTC regulations has actually occurred.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>This case is about whether there were leveraged, margined, or financed commodity transactions by persons that are not eligible contract participants (ECPs) and there was no actual delivery of the commodity within 28 days. If so, then that transaction is required to be executed on a futures exchange. But the CFTC&rsquo;s novel approach today is legally simplistic and conveniently cuts corners to create a pretext for enforcement.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>For example, I am puzzled how we can charge the Respondent based upon no evidence beyond the word &ldquo;leveraged&rdquo; appearing in the names of these tokens. Consequently, applying the logic of the CFTC&rsquo;s legal argument, it seems that any commercial transaction to purchase a cow, a bushel of oats, or a barrel of oil that involves the word &ldquo;financed&rdquo; and is delivered&nbsp;in 30 days&nbsp;is a violation of Section 4(a) of the CEA pursuant to Section 2(c)(2)(D) and needs to be executed on a futures exchange.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;I am skeptical that the CFTC would try to enforce these statutory provisions outside of DeFi&mdash;what if the delivery of financed cows was supposed to be within 28 days, but the train was delayed and arrived in 29 days? According to the CFTC&rsquo;s legal argument in today&rsquo;s order, those financed cows in the cash market would have to be sold on a futures exchange, not at a cattle stockyard. Obviously, if the CFTC were to broadly apply this strict interpretation of the law, it would have the absurd result of bringing the U.S. economy and global commodity markets to a halt. It is no surprise that the legislative history does not support the CFTC&rsquo;s novel approach in today&rsquo;s order.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Further, as I have stated before, I believe it is a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) for the Commission to establish such sweeping interpretations in an administrative settlement order, rather than engage in notice-and-comment rulemaking, particularly when such interpretations impact a broad swath of the economy. As I have previously stated, &ldquo;Major questions are best addressed through a transparent process that engages the public to develop appropriate policy with expert input&mdash;through notice-and-comment rulemaking pursuant to the APA. Regulatory clarity comes from being out in the open, not in the dark.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>I am concerned that the Commission&rsquo;s ever-expanding jurisdictional overreach continues to perpetuate a lack of regulatory clarity not only regarding digital assets, but more significantly, for our cash commodity markets where every day, a farmer, rancher, or producer needs to use credit&mdash;financing&mdash;to grow and produce the food on our dinner tables. Therefore, I must dissent on the basis that this administrative proceeding is both legally unsupported under the CEA and is a violation of the APA, in addition to the serious public policy concerns that this settlement order will create further regulatory uncertainty, put small cash market businesses in jeopardy of violating the law, and stifle American innovation.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>This DeFi case may very well be a regulatory allergic reaction to new technology. But this reaction is not realistic or sustainable. We live in an age of technological transformation that impacts every aspect of our day-to-day lives&mdash;from the Now Economy to the Gig Economy and the Creator Economy. This era of human invention and productivity is characterized by increasingly direct connections among ordinary people and the empowerment of the individual with an app as the center of the overall Digital Economy. The world has changed from B2B to B2C to C2C,</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;and there is no turning back the clock.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Emerging technologies like the blockchain and decentralized protocols that enable the direct peer-to-peer connection that underpins the consumer-driven shifts already underway in sectors such as retail, entertainment, and financial services, have the potential to write a brand-new chapter in our Nation&rsquo;s rich history of ingenuity and opportunity&mdash;the embodiment of the American Dream. With technology, anyone with a big idea and access to capital can start a business. This inclusion in the New Economy can lift people and families up and change their circumstances. When opportunity knocks, it makes no sense to slam shut the door.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>It is imperative that regulators fully understand and holistically address these significant shifts in market structure through a carefully considered and forward-looking approach that appropriately balances robust protections and guardrails while enabling innovations and technological advancements that promote economic growth and access to markets. I continue to urge that the Commission consider all the tools besides enforcement actions that we can use to develop policy, like my previous suggestions for public roundtables,</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;time-limited pilot programs,</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;and considering the recommendations and reports from the CFTC&rsquo;s advisory committees,</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;including the Global Markets Advisory Committee (GMAC) that I sponsor. Commissioner Mersinger has also previously shared her views on the Commission&rsquo;s approach to DeFi.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Undoubtedly, there can be fraud in DeFi markets, as in any marketplace. I believe the CFTC can and should vigorously pursue fraud and manipulation in our markets and bring bad actors to justice. But that is not what this case is about. It is regretful that the Commission&rsquo;s action today is instead a misguided and rushed attempt to beat the SEC to the punch and claim jurisdiction over DeFi.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;The Uniswap Protocol is a &ldquo;suite of persistent, non-upgradable smart contracts that together create an automated market maker, a protocol that facilitates peer-to-peer market making and swapping of ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain,&rdquo;&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.uniswap.org/concepts/overview">https://docs.uniswap.org/concepts/overview</a>. Automated market makers (AMM) are common in trading and markets, and both U.S. and non-U.S. authorities have regulatory frameworks for the use of AMMs to mitigate risks and ensure market integrity. I have repeatedly stated that the Commission should examine existing regulations applicable to the use of AMMs and algorithmic trading, and consider whether those regulations apply to market operators and market participants that utilize DeFi protocols. To illustrate this point, regulators do not bring enforcement actions against algorithms&mdash;regulators bring enforcement actions against those who engage in trading activity in violation of the law, whether algorithms were involved or not. It is the trading activity, not the technology, that matters.</span></span></span></span></p>

Under the CEA, the definition of &ldquo;retail&rdquo; is broad and means persons who are non-ECPs. Accordingly, &ldquo;retail&rdquo; encompasses not only individuals, but many small businesses like family farms or small growers, producers, and merchants&mdash;commercial end-users that are the bedrock of the U.S. agricultural economy.</span></span></span></span></p>

<div> The Music Man, 1957, artificial intelligence, Securities and Exchange Commission, disclosures<br />
Summary: The 1957 musical The Music Man is used to illustrate the importance of truthful disclosures about artificial intelligence in the financial markets. <div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>This video can be viewed at the below&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzKEQfG5OZk">link</a>.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-office-hours-ai-washing-090424#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;  




</p>
<p>What might a 1957 Tony Award winning musical,&nbsp;<i>The Music Man</i>, have to do with artificial intelligence and the Securities and Exchange Commission?</p>
<p>Well, if you guessed it was that the musical came out the same year that I was born, that's not it. It's something else.</p>
<p><i>The Music Man</i>&nbsp;is a story about a Professor Harold Hill, a traveling salesman who cons the town of River City, Iowa into purchasing musical instruments for their children.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we've seen time and again a similar story in the financial markets.</p>
<p>When new technologies come along they can create buzz. And that buzz is used, possibly, to make false claims to investors, similar to Professor Hill. Yet, embedded in our securities laws is a basic bargain based on truthfulness. Investors get to decide in what they invest as long as there is full, fair, and truthful disclosure.</p>
<p>Well, as we've seen an increase in the disclosures around artificial intelligence by SEC registrants, public companies as you know them, it's important that companies making these disclosures remember that the basics of the securities laws still apply.</p>
<p>You see, any claims about prospects should have a reasonable basis and investors should be told that basis. And when disclosing material risk about artificial intelligence and a company may face multiple risks, including operational, legal, competitive, investors benefit from disclosures that are particular to the company, not just boilerplate language.</p>
<p>Companies should ask themselves some basic questions, such as if we're discussing artificial intelligence in our earnings calls or having extensive discussions with our board of directors, maybe this information is potentially material to our business and to investors. If so, disclosure may be required under the securities laws.</p>
<p>Further, companies may be required to define for investors what they mean when referring to AI. How and where is it being used at the company? Is it being developed by the company or supplied by others?</p>
<p>Investment advisers, broker dealers also should not mislead the public by saying they're using AI when they're not, nor say that they're using it in a particular way and not do so.</p>
<p>Such AI washing, whether it's by companies raising money or by financial intermediaries like investment advisers and broker dealers, may violate the securities laws.</p>
<p>So if you are AI washing, as Professor Hill sang, &ldquo;Ya Got Trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Today, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (&ldquo;CFTC&rdquo; or &ldquo;Commission&rdquo;) once again swings its proverbial enforcement &ldquo;hammer&rdquo; against another DeFi protocol.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that the Commodity Exchange Act (&ldquo;CEA&rdquo;) and CFTC rules were written for traditional, centralized market infrastructure providers and intermediaries, it was my hope that one day soon the Commission would consider rulemaking, or at the very least guidance, making clear how DeFi protocols could comply with them.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp; Unfortunately, today is not that day.</p>
<p>Regulation Through Enforcement<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3">[3]</a></p>
<p>This case has all the hallmarks of what we have come to know as regulation through enforcement: &nbsp;A settlement with a&nbsp;<i>de minimis</i>&nbsp;penalty that bears little relationship to the conduct alleged, sweeping statements about the broader industry that are not germane to the case at hand, and legal theories that have not been tested in court.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Using our enforcement authorities against DeFi protocols instead of providing clarity through notice-and-comment rulemaking risks driving responsible DeFi developers overseas to create businesses, jobs, and economic activity away from the United States&mdash;leaving behind the bad actors and criminals who are only interested in taking advantage of American citizens.</p>
<p>Additionally, if we continue with this enforcement-first approach, one or several DeFi protocols we target may choose to litigate rather than settle out of court.&nbsp; Facing litigation in these cases will not only come at the cost of expending substantial government (and private sector) resources,<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5">[5]</a>&nbsp;but also risks a morass of court cases yielding mixed results and conflicting conclusions.</p>
<p>The CFTC is not the only agency struggling with an increase in regulation through enforcement, but it is my hope that we will stop using what is often a short-sighted tactic.&nbsp; Wielding the hammer of enforcement against these DeFi protocols may result in some short-term &ldquo;wins,&rdquo; but in the long-term, without more, it will only create problems.</p>
<p>The Cost of Doing the Right Thing</p>
<p>In addition, I fear this settlement creates a distorted precedent for future Commission actions&mdash;penalizing efforts to comply with the law.</p>
<p>Uniswap created, offered, and maintained a protocol that allowed for trading of leveraged tokens by third parties, all facts that support the charges in this settlement.&nbsp; But, Uniswap also took proactive measures, attempting to block trading of leveraged tokens.&nbsp; In fact, Uniswap blocked the particular tokens at issue in this settlement after the Commission&rsquo;s settlement in a previous &ldquo;DeFi Sweep&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6">[6]</a>&nbsp;involving those same tokens.</p>
<p>Rather than applauding Uniswap for being attentive to our enforcement efforts and initiating steps to respond to our approach in policing the DeFi space, we brought charges against Uniswap covering the time period before those particular tokens were blocked from its platform.&nbsp; For those in the DeFi community trying to comply with the CEA and CFTC regulations, the only take-away this settlement offers is the approximate cost the Commission assigns to an attempt by DeFi to do the right thing.</p>
<p>Misaligned Priorities</p>
<p>The decision to devote resources to this case also raises concerns about the Commission&rsquo;s enforcement priorities.&nbsp; Uniswap did not act as a liquidity provider, extend credit, actively trade leveraged tokens, or collect trading fees on transactions in the leveraged tokens at issue.&nbsp; Additionally, no harm to the market or to customers has been alleged in this matter.&nbsp; For every case we bring against a DeFi protocol where there are no allegations of fraud or complaints of customers losing money, we risk taking resources from a case where innocent victims suffer actual financial harm at the hands of a real fraudster.</p>
<p>In his recent testimony to Congress regarding the CFTC&rsquo;s budget, Chairman Behnam discussed the need to prioritize agency resources due to growing fraud targeting retail traders in digital asset markets:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nowhere have we been more active than in the digital asset space&hellip;&hellip;.&nbsp; With many agency resources which are not considered in our budget appropriation being allocated to an unregulated market, I fear the current trajectory is unsustainable. Namely, we will continue to see rampant fraud and manipulation in the digital asset market that will hurt American customers, and possibly infect the traditional financial markets.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7">[7]</a></p>
<p>I share the Chairman&rsquo;s concern that &ldquo;the current trajectory is unsustainable,&rdquo; and this concern is heightened when we use our enforcement resources to investigate DeFi activity where there is no documented harm or no significant profit to the DeFi protocol stemming from the activity at issue, as well as where we see proactive steps toward compliance.</p>
<p>We are currently in the midst of an epidemic of financial fraud. &nbsp;Fraud known as &ldquo;Pig Butchering&rdquo; alone may account for up to $75 billion in losses to victims and is a huge source of funding for trans-national criminal syndicates.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8">[8]</a>&nbsp; I commend the Commission for providing customer alerts on Pig Butchering and other online frauds and scams, for bringing its first case involving Pig Butchering in December 2023, and especially for recently hosting the first interagency conference to combat Pig Butchering.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9">[9]</a>&nbsp; But we must do more to fight this fraud&mdash;and critically, that means using our finite resources wisely.</p>
<p>No Room for Innovation</p>
<p>The concept of platform liability is complex.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10">[10]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;While there may be some instances where a platform could be liable for conduct occurring by using its protocol, the broad extension of such liability absent aggravating facts is disturbing.</p>
<p>Through this settlement, the Commission appears to be taking the position that any DeFi platform could be liable for any and all conduct occurring on its protocol.&nbsp; The practical effect of this approach is to severely chill the launching of any DeFi protocol within the United States and to significantly increase the odds that all DeFi innovation and economic activity will occur elsewhere. &nbsp;This theory of liability also raises a broader question about whether the Commission is fulfilling its responsibility under the CEA to promote &ldquo;responsible innovation&rdquo; (not stifle it), which Congress included as a central tenet of the CFTC&rsquo;s mission.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11">[11]</a></p>
<p>The word &ldquo;responsible&rdquo; in front of the word &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; in Congress&rsquo; statement of the CFTC&rsquo;s mission was deliberate, because we all know that innovation can just as easily be used by&nbsp;criminals.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12">[12]</a>&nbsp; For example, in the 1930s, new faster cars allowed criminals to escape from crime scenes and to engage in crime sprees across multiple states.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13">[13]</a>&nbsp; To stem this tide of crime in the so-called &ldquo;Public Enemy Era,&rdquo; Congress, the Department of Justice, and the FBI chose to meet this threat by passing new laws, adopting regulations, and stepping up law enforcement capabilities,<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14">[14]</a>&nbsp;that targeted the criminals, not the invention they used in committing their crimes.</p>
<p>But, imagine if J. Edgar Hoover had charged Henry Ford with liability for the crimes of John Dillinger and Bonny and Clyde because the Ford V8 was central to their ability to commit crimes.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15">[15]</a>&nbsp; This result is the natural endpoint of the Commission&rsquo;s logic that is at play in this settlement.</p>
<p>Continuing to bring and settle these cases with DeFi platforms is not in line with the CFTC&rsquo;s objectives and vision.&nbsp; This settlement and the Commission&rsquo;s earlier &ldquo;DeFi Sweep&rdquo; settlements raise transparency questions and concerns around the CFTC&rsquo;s commitment to its stated goals.&nbsp; Our 2022-2026 Strategic Plan acknowledged that &ldquo;innovations such as DeFi require extensive stakeholder engagement,&rdquo; and specifically called out DeFi as an area to &ldquo;[i]ncrease stakeholder engagement and leverage principles-based regulation.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16">[16]</a></p>
<p>Again, I quote Chairman Behnam&rsquo;s recent testimony:</p>
<p>Today, technology is driving change in the financial markets, and the CFTC must keep pace in order to fulfill its mission and Congressional mandate. Our work centers on customer protection and market resiliency, while supporting continued growth and innovation that will take the agency into the next 50 years.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17">[17]</a></p>
<p>Enforcement actions like this undercut the credibility of our Strategic Plan and are contrary both to our statutory mission to promote responsible innovation and to our own publicly-stated Core Value of &ldquo;transparency to market participants about our rules and processes.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement090424?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18">[18]</a></p>
<p>A Better Way Forward</p>
<p>Unlike the broader regulatory uncertainty within the crypto markets, the CFTC has exclusive regulatory jurisdiction over DeFi protocols involved in derivatives transactions.&nbsp; This enables the Commission to issue regulations that promote responsible innovation &ndash; while achieving our other statutory and regulatory objectives&mdash;by finding a way for protocols that want to comply with the law and to operate within a regulated, environment to be able to do so.</p>
<p>Notice-and-comment rulemaking would provide the DeFi community, consumer advocates, industry representatives, and the American public with the opportunity to engage with the Commission and utilize their expertise and experience to suggest how DeFi could properly be regulated while remaining true to our obligations under the CEA.</p>
<p>Regulation through enforcement is at best a band-aid.&nbsp; At some point, the Commission must engage in a rulemaking process around DeFi and consider our role in promoting responsible innovation for the future of the U.S. derivatives markets.</p>
<p>For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>

<title>CFTC Issues Order Against Uniswap Labs For Offering Illegal Digital Asset Derivatives Trading</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-issues-order-against-uniswap-labs-for-offering-illegal-digital-asset-deriva/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-issues-order-against-uniswap-labs-for-offering-illegal-digital-asset-deriva/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, as part of its continuing enforcement focus in the digital asset decentralized finance (DeFi) space, today issued an order filing and settling charges against&nbsp;Universal Navigation Inc. d/b/a Uniswap Labs, a Delaware company based in New York. The order finds Uniswap Labs illegally offered leveraged or margined retail commodity transactions in digital assets via a decentralized digital asset trading protocol.&nbsp;The order requires Uniswap Labs to pay a $175,000 civil monetary penalty and to cease and desist from violating the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), as charged.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s action demonstrates once again the Division of Enforcement will vigorously enforce the CEA as digital asset platforms and DeFi ecosystems evolve&rdquo; said Director of Enforcement Ian McGinley. &ldquo;DeFi operators must be vigilant to ensure that transactions comply with the law.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Case Background&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uniswap Labs contributed to the development, and deployed versions, of a blockchain-based digital asset protocol that offered to non-Eligible Contract Participants and institutional users in the United States and abroad the ability to trade digital assets through use of the Ethereum blockchain. The protocol allows users to create and trade with liquidity pools, which consist of a matched pair of digital assets that are valued against each other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to facilitate access to the protocol, Uniswap Labs developed and maintained a web interface that it made available to users. Through&nbsp;the interface, users could trade in hundreds of liquidity pools on the protocol.&nbsp;Among the digital assets traded on the protocol and through the interface were a limited number of leveraged tokens, which provided users leveraged exposure to digital assets such as Ether and Bitcoin.&nbsp;The order finds these leveraged tokens are leveraged or margined commodity transactions that did not result in actual delivery within 28 days and therefore can be offered to non-Eligible Contract Participants only on a board of trade that has been designated or registered by the CFTC as a contract market, which Uniswap Labs was not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As stated in the order, the CFTC recognizes Uniswap Labs&rsquo; substantial cooperation with the Division of Enforcement&rsquo;s investigation of this matter in the form of a reduced civil monetary penalty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this matter are Devin Cain, K. Brent Tomer, Lenel Hickson, Jr., and Manal M. Sultan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* * * * * * *&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CFTC strongly urges the public to verify a company&rsquo;s registration with the CFTC before committing funds. &nbsp;If unregistered, a customer should be wary of providing funds to that company. A company&rsquo;s registration status can be found using&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nfa.futures.org/basicnet">NFA BASIC</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;More information can be found at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/check">cftc.gov/check</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Customers and other individuals can report suspicious activities or information, such as possible violations of commodity trading laws, to the Division of Enforcement via a toll-free hotline 866-FON-CFTC (866-366-2382),&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cftc.gov/ConsumerProtection/FileaTiporComplaint/index.htm">file a tip or complaint</a>&nbsp;online, or contact the CFTC Whistleblower Office at whistleblower.gov. Whistleblowers are eligible to receive between 10 and 30 percent of the monetary sanctions collected paid from the CFTC Customer Protection Fund financed through monetary sanctions paid to the CFTC by violators of the CEA.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<title>FESE Response To The ESMA Consultation On CTP And DRSPS</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fese-response-to-the-esma-consultation-on-ctp-and-drsps/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fese-response-to-the-esma-consultation-on-ctp-and-drsps/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>FESE wishes to thank ESMA for its work on the challenging task of developing draft technical standards related to CTPs. FESE welcomes many of the proposals and has leveraged the expertise of its members as future data contributors to provide thoughtful feedback on certain elements that could be refined. These include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The proposed minimum latency requirements for data submission should be finetuned, as these may not always be technically feasible for all participants.</li>
<li>We discourage the use of JSON for data transmission. Instead, we suggest leveraging existing formats and protocols, and if a new protocol is defined, it should be uniform across all asset classes.</li>
<li>The input data for the CTP should be limited to what is necessary for the CTP to be operational; therefore, we have concerns about an automatic link with RTS 2 for the bonds tape.</li>
<li>The CTP should not be expected to enhance the quality of the data provided in terms of specific content; this responsibility should rest with the data contributors, who have systems and controls in place to ensure data quality.</li>
<li>A dedicated RCB framework is needed for the CTP, which takes into account the underlying costs incurred by data providers for the production and transmission of data.</li>
<li>The potential provision of value-added services by the CTP would present issues from a competition standpoint vis-&agrave;-vis data providers and data vendors.</li>

<p>Eurex, Europe&rsquo;s leading derivatives exchange, reported a 16 percent increase in total trading volume, reaching 154.6 million contracts in August, compared to 133.4 million contracts in the same month last year. Interest rate derivatives continued to show significant growth, rising by 24 percent from 54.9 million to 68.2 million contracts. Equity derivatives grew by 22 percent, totaling 20.8 million contracts, while index derivatives saw a 5 percent increase, from 61.4 to 64.6 million traded contracts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In OTC Clearing, the notional outstanding volumes experienced an 11 percent growth in August, reaching EUR 36,321 billion compared to EUR 32,699 billion in the same month of the previous year. The notional outstanding in overnight index swaps increased by 42 percent to EUR 3,933 billion, while the notional outstanding volumes in interest rate swaps rose by 11 percent, reaching EUR 15,474 billion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eurex Repo, Eurex's leading electronic market for secured funding and financing, had to face a 36 percent decrease in volume compared to August 2023 due to the current market environment and further expected ECB rate changes. Nevertheless, the average daily volume was still at a significant level of EUR 233.7 billion in August. Comparing the daily term adjusted repo volume year to date, volume is robust with +1.8 percent compared to Jan-Aug 2023. GC Pooling volumes also demonstrated strong market engagement, achieving EUR 125.8 billion in August.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<title>ICE Mortgage Monitor: Rate Drops Make August Most Affordable Month Since February, As Home Price Growth Cools To 12-Month Low</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> mortgage rates, home affordability, purchase demand, home prices, inventory levels
Summary:
Declining mortgage rates improve home affordability, boosting purchase demand. Home prices cool in some areas due to rising inventory levels. <div>
<div class="bw-subheadline-wrapper">
<ul>
<li>Declining mortgage rates have brought home affordability to its best level since February and boosted refinance incentive for many recent-vintage mortgages</li>
<li>With 30-year conforming rates down 60 bps from just over 7% in May, the principal and interest payment on the average-priced home purchase is $145 less per month than just three months ago</li>
<li>The share of income needed to make payments on that home (34.3%) is still 10 pp above its 30-year average and ICE Market Trends data shows recent record highs in down payments and credit scores</li>
<li>Spurred by rate declines, purchase loan demand had two of its best weeks since March, but remains noticeably below the levels seen earlier this year and in 2023 when rates were at comparable levels</li>
<li>The ICE Home Price Index for July showed the annual rate of home price growth slipping to +3.6% from +4.1% in June, marking the slowest pace in 12 months on rising inventory and still-soft demand</li>
<li>While prices were up +0.19% from June at the national level, they fell by -0.25% or more across each of Florida&rsquo;s nine largest metros which, along with Austin, saw the largest single-month declines in July</li>
<li>In the Midwest and Northeast, inventory shortages persist, and prices continued to push higher in July</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today released its September 2024&nbsp;<a href="https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com/resources/data-reports" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">ICE Mortgage Monitor Report</a>&nbsp;, based on the company&rsquo;s robust mortgage, real estate and public records data sets.</p>
<p>August&rsquo;s mortgage interest rate declines have brought home affordability to its best point in six months. And while purchase mortgage demand has seen a couple of its best weeks since mid-March in response, the rise was muted in comparison to early 2023 and 2024 when rates fell to similar levels. As Andy Walden, ICE Vice President of Research and Analysis, explains, that may actually be good news for the Fed&rsquo;s goal of lowering rates without overheating the market.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Recent easing in mortgage rates brought some much-sought relief to prospective homebuyers,&rdquo; said Walden. &ldquo;Along with a general cooling in home price growth, rates falling below 6.5% made August the most affordable month for housing since February. When it comes to affordability, as always, context is important: it still takes 10 percentage points more of the median income to buy the average house than it has on average over the last 30 years. Our own ICE Market Trends data shows that prospective homebuyers are also facing record high down payments and credit scores among recent purchase mortgages. Affordability is still very much a challenge and that is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, but August&rsquo;s improvement is certainly welcome progress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three of the nation&rsquo;s 100 largest markets are back to their own long-run average affordability levels (Birmingham, Ala.; Des Moines, Iowa; and McAllen, Texas). Cleveland, Toledo, Memphis and Baton Rouge are all within one percentage point (pp) of their respective benchmarks. Another 22 markets are within 5 pp of their benchmarks. In more than half of all major markets, however, it still takes at least 10 pp more of local median income to make the monthly payment on the average home purchase, when compared to their own long run averages. Payment-to-income ratios in some California markets are currently 20 pp higher, or more, than traditionally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even as affordability challenges persist,&rdquo; Walden continued, &ldquo;purchase demand perked up on August&rsquo;s rate drops, hinting at a population of prospective homebuyers poised and ready to act as soon as market movements tip the affordability math in their favor. August&rsquo;s demand remains muted from earlier this year and last, when interest rates were at comparable levels, but that may well turn out to be a good thing on balance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Growing inventory and continuing soft demand led home prices to cool further in July, bringing the annual growth rate down to +3.6% in July from +4.1% in June. Adjusted for seasonality, prices were up +0.19% in the month, equivalent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) of +2.3%. The spread between single-family home and condominium prices continued to widen, with the former up 3.7% year-over-year in July, as compared to +2.3% for condos across the country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The market today is in a good position from the perspective of the Fed and its mission,&rdquo; Walden added. &ldquo;Slower home growth is a positive sign in the Fed&rsquo;s fight against inflation and increased &ndash; but still mild &ndash; demand is good for the market and Fed alike. And of course, in some slightly good news for homebuyers, affordability has improved measurably from recent historic peaks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, recent inventory gains come much more from softer demand than from an increased willingness among homeowners to list their homes for sale. This makes supply &ndash; and its follow-on effect on home prices &ndash; sensitive to rate changes, making demand worth watching closely. Without a meaningful return in new listing volumes, the market is reliant on weak demand to allow inventory to grow, limiting the prospect of stronger sales activity without a corresponding risk of inventory drawdowns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rising inventory levels are resulting in softer home prices across the state of Florida. While prices rose an adjusted +0.19% nationally in July, they fell across each of Florida&rsquo;s nine largest markets by -0.25% or more. Cape Coral saw the largest decline, with prices there falling by a full percentage point in the month. It was followed by North Port, which saw a -0.9% single-month decline, and prices are now 7% and 6% off their respective recent peaks. Prices fell by 0.3% or more in Jacksonville, Deltona, Tampa, Palm Bay, Lakeland, Orlando and Miami.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florida is not alone,&rdquo; Walden added. &ldquo;Other areas where inventory has returned to or exceeded pre-pandemic norms also saw prices edge lower in July. Places like Austin, San Antonio, Memphis, New Orleans and San Francisco. On the other side of that coin, inventory shortages persist in many parts of the Midwest and Northeast, where prices continue to push higher. Just look at Cleveland, Providence, Richmond and Chicago, which &ndash; along with Seattle &ndash; made up the top five performing metros in July from a home price growth perspective.&rdquo;</p>

Summary: FIA supports the EU's Capital Markets Union through fine-tuning regulations, promoting transparency, and ensuring a fair and competitive marketplace. <br /><br /> <div>

<p>FIA, the leading global trade organisation for the futures, options and centrally cleared derivatives markets, has<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://email.fia.org/c/12ga8OU1rYJ9FSD8NYG25GqOo84pkF">published a paper</a>&nbsp;outlining its views on how to support the progress of the European Union&rsquo;s&nbsp;Capital Markets Union (CMU).</p>
<div>
<p>FIA&rsquo;s paper &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="https://email.fia.org/c/12ga8PnG22BR4fmLfttIaQpPOWnd7y">Capital Markets Union at a critical juncture</a>&nbsp;&ndash; sets out the role that derivatives play in effective capital markets. Specifically, FIA believes that centrally cleared derivatives are a key ingredient to building a strong CMU.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>&ldquo;As the EU aims to increase investor interest in its markets, it has many options in designing a system that protects its citizens, ensures market liquidity and attracts investors. The ideas shared in this paper, on behalf of the cleared derivatives markets, will help lay the groundwork for fit-for-purpose regulation, open and resilient markets, fair competition and opportunities for innovation. "These adjustments will make EU capital markets more attractive to domestic and international investors and help to boost growth",&nbsp;said Walt Lukken, President and CEO of FIA.<br /><br />The recommendations in FIA&rsquo;s paper support the objectives aligned with delivering a successful CMU:&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Promoting an open, competitive, pragmatic, predictable, safe, well-regulated and fair marketplace for domestic and international financial institutions alike&nbsp;</li>
<li>Increasing transparency, public stakeholder engagement and certainty to ease the often complex and lengthy legislative process in the EU&nbsp;</li>
<li>Establishing a fit-for-purpose regulatory environment that benefits both regulated financial institutions and their customers&nbsp;</li>
<li>Facilitating client choice on where to clear and protecting the international competitiveness of EU market participants&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<div>
<div>
<p>FIA believes these objectives can be met largely through fine-tuning existing regulations, rather than overhauling them, and by international dialogue with peer regulators and global standard setters to avoid a patchwork of regulations that increases costs for all involved and disincentives investment. FIA has identified some specific steps that EU policymakers could undertake to help achieve these objectives, including:&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Establish clear definitions of scope in EU legislation (Level 1) and early clarifications on territorial and personal scope&nbsp;</li>
<li>Allow sufficient time for implementation of requirements before carrying out regulatory and legislative reviews and align compliance dates of Level 1 and Level 2 requirements&nbsp;</li>
<li>Conduct public engagement/consultation with industry and independent experts on important Level 3 rules before publishing them&nbsp;</li>
<li>Provide meaningful cost-benefit analysis before proposing new requirements and add a competitiveness test as part of important policy proposals&nbsp;</li>
<li>Optimise further CCP equivalence reviews and improve transparency&nbsp;</li>
<li>Establish appropriate capital requirements and reduce other restrictive measures to alleviate clearing capacity for intermediaries&nbsp;</li>
<li>Scrutinise the active account requirements under EMIR 3.0 that could, if not properly calibrated, adversely impact the competitiveness of EU firms&nbsp;</li>
<li>Ensure the IFR regime for investment firms is proportionate to the risks these firms bring to their counterparties, themselves and the market as a whole&nbsp;</li>
<li>Ensure globally consistent margin requirements to enable clearing margin transparency&nbsp;</li>
<li>Harmonise certain aspects of non-bank insolvency laws in the EU.&nbsp;</li>

<title>DataLend: August 2024 Securities Lending Revenue Down 12% YoY To $831 Million - ‘Specials’ Slump As Equity Cash Markets Continue Strong Run</title>

<div> revenue, securities finance industry, equity, global, lending
Summary:
Global securities finance industry revenue decreased, U.S. equity revenue declined, Taiwanese stocks increased, sovereign debt lending warmed, corporate debt cooled. Sirius XM Holdings Inc., Cassava Sciences Inc., Beyond Meat Inc., Tempus AI Inc., and Enbridge Inc. were the top earning securities. <br /><br /> <div>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The global securities finance industry generated $831 million in revenue for lenders in August 2024, according to DataLend, the market data service of fintech EquiLend. The figure represents a 12% decrease from the $945 million generated in August 2023.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Global broker-to-broker activity, where broker-dealers lend and borrow securities from each other, totaled an additional $221 million in revenue in August, down 8% year-over-year.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The equity trends observed in July largely held true for August with U.S. equity lending revenue declining 23% year-over-year. Average fees remained well below their 2023 levels with the U.S. posting a 28% dip in borrow cost from the same period last year. Declining fees have been indicative of fewer securities trading &ldquo;special&rdquo; as market indexes continue to rise. In August, revenue generated from specials was down 30% compared to August 2023.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Though equity revenues declined across global regions, Taiwanese stocks remained a bright spot in APAC, generating the second most revenue globally and a 44% increase year-over-year. In EMEA, the UK and France continued to perform well versus 2023, with revenue increases of 39% and 62% respectively.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Even with central bank rate cuts likely on the horizon in the U.S., sovereign debt lending continued to warm in August with a month-over-month average fee increase of 22% for U.S. treasuries. Lending revenue for U.S. government debt climbed 18% year-over-year.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Corporate debt continued to cool off with a 20% decline in global revenue year-over-year. The dip was largely driven by a 32% decline in U.S. investment-grade corporate lending revenue.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The top five earning securities in August were</span><span>&nbsp;Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (SIRI US), Cassava Sciences Inc. (SAVA US), Beyond Meat Inc. (BYND US),&nbsp;</span><span>Tempus AI Inc. (TEM US)</span><span>&nbsp;and Enbridge Inc. (ENB US)</span><span>. The five securities in total generated $109 million in revenue for the month.</span></p>

<title>LME Progresses Market Structure Evolution To Enhance Liquidity</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/lme-progresses-market-structure-evolution-to-enhance-liquidity/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: LME, market structure, transparency, liquidity, block rules <br />
Summary: The LME is modernizing market structure to increase transparency and liquidity. It will introduce block rules and a liquidity provider program.<br /><br />Summary: LME will protect daily prompt dates, introduce block rules, and a liquidity provider program to enhance market transparency and liquidity. <div>
<ul>
<li>LME market structure modernised to boost transparency and increase price competition, for the benefit of all market participants</li>
<li>Protection of daily prompt date structure and Cash price, which are crucial for physical market trading</li>
<li>Introduction of industry-standard block rules with liquidity provider programme to support on-screen liquidity</li>
<li>Crossing rules and increased market data transparency for inter-office trades</li>
<li>Corresponding rules for OTC lookalike trades to ensure level playing field with on-exchange market</li>
</ul>
<p>The London Metal Exchange (LME) has today issued a white paper setting out a package of measures designed to modernise the LME&rsquo;s market structure, boost transparency and increase price competition, while protecting the unique features of its market that serve the physical metal communities.</p>
<p>Matthew Chamberlain, LME CEO, commented: &ldquo;The package of liquidity-enhancing measures we&rsquo;re announcing today marks the next phase of our market structure evolution and is vital for the long-term health and development of LME markets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our daily date system is one of our greatest assets, helping to ensure that our global reference prices are underpinned by real world supply and demand. These future-focused measures &ndash; which align with the global regulatory direction of travel &ndash; seek to grow participation in our markets, and make our prices as representative and accessible as possible, while continuing to support physical market trading practices.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Key measures</b></p>
<p>To increase accessible liquidity on the LME&rsquo;s electronic market (LMEselect) &ndash; particularly on the monthly dates, where many market participants wish to have exposure &ndash; the LME will introduce industry-standard block limit rules. This means that small-sized trades involving liquid dates (each monthly date out to one year) and for the most liquid metals (aluminium, copper, zinc, nickel and lead) will have to be executed on-screen. Crucially, to ensure that key physical market trading practices remain unaffected by the new rules, the block thresholds will not apply to daily prompt dates, so member provision of bespoke averaging for physical clients will not be impacted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These rules also support members in continuing to agree small trades bilaterally with their clients, provided that liquidity is shown on LMEselect for visibility.</p>
<p>Jamie Turner, LME Head of Trading and COO, commented: &ldquo;Introducing block rules is about increasing price transparency, which will lead to greater price competition and participation. This change will allow traders to maximise access to liquidity in the central venue, either directly or through a member desk or platform. While block rules are standard in most peer markets, we recognise that this will have an impact on members&rsquo; business models, and we are committed to working closely with them in a series of working groups over the next 12 months to navigate the implementation details.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To support the implementation of block rules, the LME will also introduce a liquidity provider programme to encourage on-screen trading in certain liquid instruments at the front end of the curve. Additionally, to further increase transparency, the LME will ensure that all trades (in the liquid dates) agreed in the interoffice market &ndash; regardless of their size &ndash; are booked into LME systems and published on external market data feeds.</p>
<p>On 19 August, the LME made its new trading platform available in the production environment for member testing, as one of the key steps prior to launch. This system, LMEselect v10, provides a deterministic and low latency system that offers improved functionality for electronic traders, such as the ability to enter &ldquo;good-till-cancelled&rdquo; (GTC) or &ldquo;persistent&rdquo; order types. Additional functionality will also be rolled out to further support this package of measures, such as recalibrated tick sizes to encourage positive trading behaviours from systematic traders.</p>
<p>To ensure a level playing field and consistent transparency between exchange-traded and OTC markets, the LME intends to apply similar block rule requirements to OTC contracts that reference LME prices and closely align to monthly exchange contracts (or the spreads between these). This will mitigate the risk of volume being incentivised away from the transparent central liquidity pool.</p>
<p>The measures announced in the white paper will be formally consulted on where appropriate over the next 12 months, with the aim of implementing the package of measures in the second half of 2025.</p>
<p><b>Background</b></p>

<li>The specific measures referred to may be subject to consultation and/or regulatory approvals.</li>

<title>New Broadridge Whitepaper Highlights Operational Resilience And DORA Compliance Challenges Facing Global Financial Services - EU Regulatory Deadline Requires A Prompt Industry Response; Globally, Operational Resiliency Shortfalls Can Be Addressed And Scaled Via Mutualized Services</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Fintech, operational resilience, DORA, regulations, global
<br />
Operational resilience is a critical priority for financial firms due to tightening regulations worldwide, requiring extensive system reviews and compliance preparations.
<br /><br />Summary: 
Global regulations prioritize operational resilience, necessitating extensive compliance preparations, including system reviews and cybersecurity focus, with potential enforcement actions for noncompliance. <div>
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="http://www.broadridge.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.</a>&nbsp;(NYSE: BR), a global Fintech leader, released a new whitepaper focused on the imperative need for financial services firms to enhance their operational resilience in reaction to the European Union&rsquo;s Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) and other global regulations. This comprehensive whitepaper, titled&nbsp;<i>'Building Resilience Across Borders: A holistic approach to global operational resilience and navigating the regulatory maze</i>,' highlights the extensive regulatory expectations and the strategic preparations necessary for compliance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now more than ever, operational resiliency is a critical priority for financial firms around the world, driven by a fundamental need to strengthen trust and security in response to the growing risk of cyberattacks and disruptions,&rdquo; said Mike Sleightholme, President of Broadridge International. &ldquo;The broad and in-depth scope of DORA mandates a significant transformation in risk management frameworks, policies and governance structures relating to both inhouse and third-party systems, posing urgent challenges that the industry needs to address ahead of the January 17, 2025 deadline.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Regulators are emphasizing and prioritizing operational resilience, yet there is a growing sense that many firms remain far from ready, exposing themselves not only to operational resiliency risk but also to regulatory compliance risk,&rdquo; said Virginie O&rsquo;Shea, Founder of Firebrand Research, who worked with Broadridge to develop the whitepaper. &ldquo;Firms must act now to mobilize their DORA action plans, including a detailed assessment of their critical systems and services, and an impact analysis to ensure they can deliver a compliant operating model and meet recovery and reporting objectives aligned to DORA&rsquo;s requirements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Key findings from the whitepaper include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Worldwide regulatory priority</b>: Besides the EU, regions such as the US, Canada, the UK, South Africa, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia are also tightening their operational resilience regulations.</li>
<li><b>Global scope and impact of DORA</b>&nbsp;mandates significant changes to operational risk management and resilience across nearly all areas of financial services, impacting firms operating in the EU irrespective of where their headquarters and third-party suppliers are located.</li>
<li><b>Clock is ticking</b>, firms must begin their DORA compliance preparations now, as the January 2025 enforcement date necessitates extensive system reviews and data reporting readiness. Firms must focus resources on mobilising their action plan, potentially leveraging mutualized shared services.</li>
<li><b>Watch out for regulatory enforcement</b>, noncompliance with operational resilience mandates is likely to result in stringent enforcement actions. Firms need to start prioritizing cybersecurity and risk reduction today.</li>
<li><b>Increased regulatory focus on third-party service providers</b>&nbsp;and internal IT systems highlights the need for thorough operational reviews and compliance assurance.</li>

<div> encourages, account providers, vulnerable consumers, financial inclusion, access
<br />
The FCA report urges account providers to support those without bank accounts, increase awareness of basic accounts, and review account denials and closures.
<br /><br />Summary: The FCA encourages account providers to support vulnerable consumers, increase awareness of basic accounts, and review account denials and closures. <div>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>In a new report, the FCA encourages account providers to do more to support those who want a bank account but don&rsquo;t have one.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p><span>The FCA has recognised that banks, building societies and payment firms are trying to support customers to access accounts and is encouraging them to build on examples of existing good practice, such as working with homeless charities to tailor their support to the needs of customers in vulnerable circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span>Banks and other account providers have been urged to increase awareness of basic bank accounts, which allow people to make and receive payments but without the availability of an overdraft. The FCA found that several providers could make it easier to apply for one.</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA has asked account providers to review their overall approach to account denials and closures &ndash; and particularly to ensure that vulnerable consumers aren&rsquo;t losing out. Providers should also ensure people aren&rsquo;t denied access just because they can&rsquo;t produce standard forms of ID, and make it clear which alternative forms of ID are acceptable.</span></p>
<p><span>Where accounts are closed or denied, the regulator has reminded providers that they should act in line with their obligations under the Consumer Duty, including communicating in a way that is clear and helpful for customers.</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA has also published independent, qualitative research on the experiences of some of the most financially excluded consumers when accessing and using financial products and services. This will help industry and consumer groups understand how the right support can help these consumers effectively access services.</span></p>
<p><span>Sheldon Mills, Executive Director of Consumers and Competition at the FCA, said:</span></p>
<p><span>'We&rsquo;ve seen examples of really good practice &ndash; with account providers helping people access a product vital for financial inclusion &ndash; but also areas where there is room for improvement. By sharing both, we want to achieve more consistent outcomes, with people being aware of what accounts there are that might be right for them, more support for the vulnerable and people not being denied access without good reason.'</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA&rsquo;s report also highlighted issues other organisations have experienced accessing accounts &ndash; including pawnbrokers, charities and in the adult entertainment sector. It has set out an expectation that firms should have a clear, properly considered definition of reputational risk. However, it has a limited remit to act for business and charity customers.</span></p>
<p><span>In 2023, the FCA said that it had not found evidence of accounts being closed due to lawfully expressed political opinions. The new report confirms it has not found any further evidence to suggest that this is happening. However, it has asked senior leaders in firms to sign an attestation taking personal responsibility for ensuring rules have been complied with and that they are confident of their compliance going forward.&nbsp;</span></p>

Summary:<br />Effective regulation and enforcement, guidance for financial services, ensuring consumer resilience, supporting market growth, and fairness in financial services. <div>
<p>Tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou katoa</p>
<p>Ko Samantha Barrass toku ingoa</p>
<p>Ko taku mahi ki Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko</p>
<p>Ko te Mana Whakahaere</p>
<p>Tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā tātou katoa.</p>
<p>Many thanks for inviting me to speak to you today. The relationship between the FMA and the FSC has been very strong over many years, and ensuring this continues is vital for me, the FMA Board and my leadership team.</p>
<p>This year's conference theme is "consumer resilience and prosperity". Maintaining resilience through these times while also taking long-term decisions to secure future prosperity is essential to the financial wellbeing of all New Zealanders.</p>
<p>Consumer Resilience and Prosperity is an important theme for the FMA, and for me. That is because, once responsibility for the CCCFA is transferred to us, we will have a role in overseeing the financial products that touch most New Zealanders&rsquo; lives.</p>
<p>Whether it is securing a loan for a car, getting professional financial advice, buying your first home and insuring it, insuring yourself and your livelihood, or saving and investing for your retirement and other financial goals, the FMA will have a key role in making sure New Zealanders have trust and confidence in the financial services sector.</p>
<h3>Regulatory burden</h3>
<p>During this period of regulatory change, it&rsquo;s important the FMA&rsquo;s regulatory approach is clear and understood.</p>
<p>I want to take a moment to step back and explain my personal philosophy of regulation, which is such a great match with the FMA.</p>
<p>This year marks the fortieth anniversary of the fourth Labour Government and a period of significant economic and regulatory reform. Growing up in the 80s in Christchurch, for me, regulation was deeply discredited. I associated it with driving an over-controlled economy including poor services (such as 3 months to get a phone line), and unrealistic controls on prices - the NZ Dollar, rents and interest rates, to name a few. An idealistic economics student, and huge supporter of the role of markets to drive growth and prosperity, I was sceptical about regulation and felt we always needed to be clear that regulation was a necessary intervention to support growth and the long-term prospects of New Zealanders.</p>
<p>It became so much of a driving passion for me that, forty years later, I&rsquo;m here talking to you as the Chief Executive of a regulator. Not many people grow up wanting to be a regulator, but there you go.</p>
<p>The FMA and I are incredibly focused on regulation that genuinely matters and delivers for New Zealanders. The underlying philosophy remains &ndash; we cannot simply regulate for the sake of regulating. Regulation needs to pass the &lsquo;so what&rsquo; test, as well as enabling innovation. By keeping an eye on unnecessary regulatory burden, we can ensure our regulatory approach is achieving the outcomes we, and New Zealanders, expect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s why, for example, we have provided the Government with a list of proposals where both our time, and yours, can be used more valuably - while still ensuring consumers and investors are protected. We have also valued you proactively highlighting to us further changes that the FMA and the Minister should consider.</p>
<p>We are further demonstrating this as we consider a class exemption for green, social, sustainability and sustainability-linked bonds, which offer investors an additional non-financial benefit. The sector has told us that there should be a more efficient route to market for these bonds.</p>
<p>This has the potential to avoid unnecessary compliance costs, as well as incentivise the development of this market.&nbsp; When we hear fair arguments like these, we are prepared to reflect on them and consider changes accordingly.</p>
<h3>Guidance</h3>
<p>Guidance from the FMA can be an efficient approach to supporting the sector meet regulatory expectations as the New Zealand financial sector continues to grow and develop. Our liquidity risk management guidance released this year aims to ensure fund managers have adequate systems, controls and tools in place to manage liquidity, against the full range of assets and business models. It is frustrating to hear this guidance being used as a justification for why firms aren&rsquo;t investing in private or less liquid assets. Having appropriate systems and controls to manage liquidity, enables investment in these types of assets. It means the frameworks and tools are in place to identify and manage the risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Guidance raises awareness, promotes discussion and endeavours to lift standards across a sector. We do not expect firms to simply leave this guidance to their legal and compliance departments. The audience for this guidance, and in fact any guidance we publish, should be senior leaders within your organisations, so they can take a strategic view of what is needed. We are not looking for tick box compliance to our guidance. Our guidance is just that, a guide to help inform how you work. We look forward to continuing our discussion on the guidance with the sector in the months ahead, including at an FSC hosted event next month.</p>
<p>With so much focus on unnecessary regulatory burden, I do want to emphasise that the important point here is on the word &lsquo;unnecessary&rsquo;. We cannot and must not forget the crystalised harm or risk of harm, un-prevented by market forces, that created the need for regulation in the first place. The finance company collapses, and the risks and harm exposed, unmitigated by market forces, created a powerful argument for regulation to support Mum and Dad investors and quality capital markets in New Zealand. The FMA was created out of those ashes, the outcomes sought through the FMCA remain current. We are determined to champion them.</p>
<p>But does it mean that we should always be alive to how we can deliver those outcomes better? Absolutely, and that is why we are leaning into taking an outcomes-focused approach to our work.</p>
<h3>Outcomes focused approach</h3>
<p>We want to ensure the FMA&rsquo;s focus is not just on compliance but on what we are trying to achieve. That is the ultimate way in which we will deliver well focused regulation, keep costs down and make sure we are not unnecessarily cutting across innovation.</p>
<p>The industry response to our consultation on outcomes focused regulation shows we need to take our time to step back, take stock, and pause to consider the right way forward. One of the things the FSC told us in its feedback was that they were worried we were introducing new rules. To be clear, we are not setting out new rules. It is about the FMA, ensuring we remain an effective modern, forward-looking regulator and communicating what we believe that looks like.</p>
<p>We will have more to say in due course, but I hope the philosophy of regulation I set out at the beginning, which is front and centre of my leadership at the FMA, gives you a flavour of how we intend to approach our role.</p>
<h3>Recent enforcement action</h3>
<p>No doubt you will have seen in the news some of the recent enforcement action we have taken. That reflects months, often years of work from our teams, and I want to acknowledge their mahi.</p>
<p>Enforcement is a bottom line for any regulator. It is the bare minimum any regulator needs to do to ensure credibility and create a credible deterrent that encourages compliance. But enforcement is sometimes rightly characterised as the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff. Something has to have gone wrong or be at a real risk of going wrong! Ideally, the bulk of regulatory activity is focused on making sure harm is prevented.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s in our supervision work that we mainly want to be experienced. Sometimes with pointy elbows, but mainly collaboratively, educative and engaged.</p>
<p>As we strive to be the best engagement-led regulator we can be, we know that building strong relationships with firms early can often mean the harm to consumers and investors is prevented in the first place.</p>
<p>Strong regulator-firm relationships benefit all New Zealanders. As we and the industry have acknowledged in the past, this requires the FMA to be properly resourced. Our view remains the same as it has in recent years; that an engagement led approach from a regulator, that can retain good staff and institutional knowledge, offers the right regulation for New Zealand. It delivers a meaningful, proactive supervision approach, supporting firms and customers alike.</p>
<h3>Financial services reforms</h3>
<p>I know you will all be eagerly awaiting ministerial decisions on the financial services reform consultation from earlier in the year.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m sure the Minister will have more to say on this when he speaks to you this evening, I do want to give you a sense of where we are from a practical perspective. The Commerce Commission and the FMA are working very closely on the transfer of credit functions, with several joint activities underway. As part of this, you will also start to see the FMA in some of the Commission&rsquo;s stakeholder engagement activities. Both regulators are very committed to a seamless transfer of responsibilities and await legislation to be passed by Parliament to give effect to this. Until then, the Commerce Commission is still the regulator of the CCCFA, and lenders should continue to engage with the Commission as normal.</p>
<p>Turning to the new CoFI regime, we have been and are continuing to engage with firms ahead of the end of the licensing window in March next year. Firms should now have either made their licence application or be in the final stages of seeking their Board approvals prior to submitting their application. We know which firms are potentially behind where they want to be and have reached out to offer assistance and support as needed. This is the approach the FMA has taken over several years, through the introduction of several different regimes. We know it is one that you and your peers support.</p>
<p>Minister Bayly has signalled a priority of his is to streamline capital market settings to allow businesses greater access to capital to support productivity and growth. We are committed to working with the Minister, MBIE and industry to explore how we might better support these markets to develop.&nbsp; A key focus for the Minister is facilitating investment in private assets. A first step is industry engagement, and several roundtables took place last week. As work on this ministerial priority continues, I want to thank those who have provided support already on the shape of this work programme.</p>
<h3>Regulation as an enabler of markets, not a barrier</h3>
<p>As a regulator, we know we have a role ensuring markets work well for consumers and investors, while also enabling economic growth. There is a natural tension between encouraging competition, financial stability and ensuring consumers are sold products that deliver value and do what they say on the tin. This tension is why the Council of Financial Regulators exists, and why it&rsquo;s work is so important.</p>
<p>The FMA will be looking to do what it can in the months ahead to respond to the Commerce Commission&rsquo;s report, particularly around the recommendation on transparency in mortgage advice. The Minister and the Commerce Commission have clearly expressed concerns about practices in this space. We will be looking to work with financial advice providers and firms across the mortgage spectrum to consider how to tackle this issue. As the CoFI regime settles in from early next year, there will also be opportunities for us to use our supervisory engagement with banks to look at the issues raised in the market study from this angle.</p>
<h3>Concluding remarks&nbsp;</h3>
<p>As I turn back to this year&rsquo;s conference theme, a financial sector that is grounded in fairness is essential to consumer resilience. At the FMA, fairness isn&rsquo;t just a word to us. It&rsquo;s central to why we exist. That&rsquo;s why two months ago we released a research paper where we sought to understand what New Zealanders perceived as fair and unfair in the financial services they use.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the research found that the majority of New Zealanders generally agree on what constitutes fairness in financial services.</p>
<p>In one scenario, 86 percent of respondents believed it was unfair that a bank took over a year to repay a client who had been overcharged fees. At the other end of the spectrum, 62 percent believed it was fair that one client&rsquo;s investment fund had lower fees than his mother&rsquo;s because his fund manager spent less time researching markets and making changes to his investment. The release of the research has also seen the FMA hold roundtables with firms to discuss our findings. This is the first time we&rsquo;ve adopted a roundtable approach to discussing findings, and it won&rsquo;t be the last. We are looking at new, broader ways of engaging with the market to ensure we meet our aims as an &lsquo;engagement led&rsquo; regulator.</p>
<p>As the conduct regulator for New Zealand&rsquo;s financial markets, our vision is more New Zealanders than ever believing that the financial services sector is working well for them. While we play an important role in achieving this vision, we cannot do it alone. Our vision is closely aligned with that of the FSC itself, whose vision is to grow the financial confidence and wellbeing of New Zealanders. I look forward to working alongside you to ensure we foster a vibrant and trusted financial sector into the future.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority Cancels Integrity Advisers Insurance Limited’s Financial Advice Provider Licence</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> cancelled, Integrity Advisers Insurance Limited, misconduct, FAP licence, clients<br />
Summary: The FMA cancelled Integrity's FAP licence due to serious misconduct, including pressuring clients to retain insurance policies and making false threats. Clients can seek help through Financial Ombudsman service. <br /> <div>
<p>The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; has cancelled Integrity Advisers Insurance Limited&rsquo;s (Integrity) Financial Advice Provider (FAP) licence for engaging in serious misconduct.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Integrity is a Christchurch-based financial service provider that held a full FAP licence, providing financial advice to approximately 500 retail customers, many of whom are from the Filipino community. Integrity&rsquo;s sole director and shareholder is Mr Yuriy Bazhak who was a financial adviser at Integrity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following an investigation, the FMA found that Integrity breached its market services licensee obligations by failing to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>give priority to client&rsquo;s interests&nbsp;</li>
<li>comply with the Code of Professional Conduct for Financial Advice Services&nbsp;</li>
<li>treat customers fairly&nbsp;</li>
<li>act with integrity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The breaches relate to Integrity&rsquo;s treatment of clients who wanted to cancel their respective insurance policy between September 2022 and June 2023 (affected clients).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If affected clients cancelled their insurance policies, Integrity had to surrender the commission (also known as a clawback charge) it received to the relevant insurance provider. While Integrity did disclose the potential recovery of fees to clients at the start of the engagement, the FMA found Integrity unfairly pressured affected clients to retain their respective policy by issuing them with an invoice which gave them only seven days to reinstate their insurance policy or pay a fee. The fee Integrity charged affected clients was greater than was permitted by Integrity&rsquo;s fees policy, and in some cases equal to the commission Integrity lost.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Integrity told some affected clients that failure to pay the fee would result in Integrity reporting them to Immigration New Zealand, which Integrity said may result in an affected client&rsquo;s visa being cancelled or deportation. Integrity did not make any report to Immigration New Zealand but seriously misled an affected client when it told him that it had made a report. The FMA found that Integrity also tried to mislead the FMA by altering an invoice before providing it to the FMA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Integrity denied significant misconduct. It said invoicing errors were inadvertent or not material, and it denied misleading clients or the FMA.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA is satisfied that Integrity would be likely to breach its market services licensee obligations in the future. The FMA is also satisfied that Integrity&rsquo;s director, Mr Bazhak is no longer a fit and proper person to hold a position as a director or senior manager of a financial advice provider.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FMA Director of Specialist Supervision and Response, Peter Taylor, said: &ldquo;Contrary to its name, this firm lacked any integrity with its clients. Mr Bazhak not only risked causing serious harm to his clients but preyed on their vulnerability through the threat of involving Immigration New Zealand. Actions such as these undermine both the integrity and reputation of the financial advice profession.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cancelling Integrity&rsquo;s licence is one of the strongest tools the FMA can use against a FAP and sends a clear message that this sort of conduct is not acceptable.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Provisions have been made for the care of Integrity&rsquo;s clients, who will be contacted by their new licenced financial advice provider or their insurer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Where clients can get help&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Integrity&rsquo;s clients can complain to Financial Services Complaints Limited&rsquo;s Financial Ombudsman service, which is a disputes resolution service free to consumers. For clients who believe they have been affected and have concerns, we recommend they contact:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial Services Complaints Limited,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fscl.org.nz/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="link to Financial Services Complaints Limited">fscl.org.nz</a>, or&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>their insurer or new adviser to discuss whether to complain to Financial Services Complaints Limited.&nbsp;</li>

<title>SEC Charges Six Credit Rating Agencies With Significant Recordkeeping Failures - Firms Admit To Wrongdoing And Agree To Pay Penalties Totaling More Than $49 Million To Settle SEC Charges</title>

<div> SEC, charges, credit rating agencies, recordkeeping provisions, civil penalties
<br />
The SEC charged six credit rating agencies for failing to maintain and preserve electronic communications, leading to civil penalties and requirements for compliance improvements.
<br /><br />Summary: 
The SEC charged six credit rating agencies for recordkeeping violations, leading to civil penalties and requirements for compliance improvements. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against six nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, or NRSROs, for significant failures by the firms and their personnel to maintain and preserve electronic communications. The firms admitted the facts set forth in their respective SEC orders; acknowledged that their conduct violated recordkeeping provisions of the federal securities laws; agreed to pay combined civil penalties of more than $49 million, as detailed below; and have begun implementing improvements to their compliance policies and procedures to address these violations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Moody&rsquo;s Investors Service, Inc. agreed to pay a $20 million civil penalty;</li>
<li>S&amp;P Global Ratings agreed to pay a $20 million civil penalty;</li>
<li>Fitch Ratings, Inc. agreed to pay an $8 million civil penalty;</li>
<li>HR Ratings de M&eacute;xico, S.A. de C.V. agreed to pay a $250,000 civil penalty;</li>
<li>A.M. Best Rating Services, Inc. agreed to pay a $1 million civil penalty; and</li>
<li>Demotech, Inc. agreed to pay a $100,000 civil penalty.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the credit rating agencies, with the exception of A.M. Best and Demotech, is also required to retain a compliance consultant. A.M. Best and Demotech engaged in significant efforts to comply with the recordkeeping requirements relatively early as registered credit rating agencies and otherwise cooperated with the SEC&rsquo;s investigations, and, as a result, they will not be required to retain a compliance consultant under the terms of their settlements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have seen repeatedly that failures to maintain and preserve required records can hinder the staff&rsquo;s ability to ensure that firms are complying with their obligations and the Commission&rsquo;s ability to hold accountable those that fall short of those obligations, often at the expense of investors,&rdquo; said Sanjay Wadhwa, Deputy Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;In today&rsquo;s actions, the Commission once again makes clear that there are tangible benefits to firms that make significant efforts to comply and otherwise cooperate with the staff&rsquo;s investigations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each of the six firms was charged with violating Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17g-2(b)(7) thereunder. In addition to significant financial penalties, each credit rating agency was ordered to cease and desist from future violations of these provisions and was censured. The four firms ordered to retain compliance consultants have agreed to, among other things, conduct comprehensive reviews of their policies and procedures relating to the retention of electronic communications found on their personnel&rsquo;s personal devices and their respective frameworks for addressing non-compliance by their personnel with those policies and procedures.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigations into Moody&rsquo;s Investors Service, Inc., S&amp;P Global Ratings, A.M. Best Rating Services, Inc., HR Ratings de M&eacute;xico, S.A. de C.V., and Demotech, Inc. were conducted by Wesley W. Wintermyer and Michael S. DiBattista and were supervised by Judith Weinstock and Sheldon L. Pollock, all of the New York Regional Office. The SEC&rsquo;s investigation into Fitch Ratings, Inc. was conducted by Joseph P. Ceglio and Mr. Wintermyer and was supervised by Ms. Weinstock, Joshua I. Brodsky, Osman E. Nawaz, and Mr. Pollock, all of the New York Regional Office.<span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span>SEC staff from the Office of Credit Ratings assisted with the investigation.</p>

<div> fraud, Ponzi scheme, CFTC, misappropriation, digital assets
Summary:<br />Judge orders $209 million judgment against Sam Ikkurty and Jafia, LLC for Ponzi scheme involving crypto and carbon investments. Millions in stolen digital assets recovered.<br />Summary: <div>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced Judge Mary Rowland of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered an order of final judgment against&nbsp;Sam Ikkurty&nbsp;of Oregon and&nbsp;Jafia, LLC, Ikkurty Capital, LLC d/b/a Rose City Income Fund I LP, Rose City Income Fund II,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Seneca Ventures, LLC&nbsp;imposing a judgment totaling $209,614,892.</p>
<p>This order follows Judge Rowland&rsquo;s prior order granting summary judgment in favor of the CFTC on all counts of the CFTC&rsquo;s solicitation fraud and misappropriation complaint. [See CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8931-24">8931-24</a>] The CFTC also recovered more than $18 million in digital assets that had been stolen from the court-appointed receiver.</p>
<p>The court&rsquo;s order of final judgment and permanent injunction requires the defendants to pay&nbsp;$83,757,249&nbsp;in restitution to customers of the so-called income fund; $36,967,285 in disgorgement of unlawful gains (offset by any amounts paid in restitution); and a $110,901,855 civil monetary penalty. The order also orders Ikkurty to pay an outstanding $14,071,000 contempt fine, following the court&rsquo;s finding he unlawfully transferred digital assets from the Receivership Estate while this lawsuit was pending and violated a court order, as well as ordering Ikkurty to repay $884,788 in professional expenses advanced from the Receivership Estate to fund his defense. The order also permanently bans Ikkurty and Jafia from registering with the CFTC; trading any digital assets or other commodity interests; soliciting or accepting any funds for the purpose of purchasing digital assets or commodity interests; and engaging in conduct that violates the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The defendants portrayed their programs as cutting-edge crypto and carbon investments when in reality they were plain, old-fashioned Ponzi schemes,&rdquo; said Director of Enforcement Ian McGinley. &ldquo;CFTC staff not only shut down the defendants&rsquo; fraudulent schemes and obtained a money judgment of over $200 million, they also recovered more than $18 million in stolen digital assets that may otherwise have been lost forever. This is an outstanding result for the CFTC and for the victims of defendants&rsquo; fraud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Case Background</p>
<p>As described in the summary judgment order, the defendants&rsquo; fraudulent scheme centered on Ikkurty&rsquo;s misrepresentations to participants about the nature of his &ldquo;crypto hedge funds&rdquo; and the supposed &ldquo;net profits&rdquo; they would earn. In reality, Ikkurty did not return any net profits to participants, and instead &ldquo;ran something akin to a Ponzi scheme.&rdquo; Ikkurty also misstated his fund&rsquo;s historical performance and omitted the fact the fund fell in value by 98.99% in only a few months. The order also found Ikkurty invested in unstable digital asset commodities contrary to his promises to participants, and his purported crypto expertise was a sham because his actual experience with digital assets consisted solely of losing his personal Bitcoins to a hack. The court soundly rejected Ikkurty&rsquo;s claim that his misrepresentations about historical performance were inadvertent and his arguments that his false statements were not material.</p>
<p>Notably, in addition to the misrepresentations, the summary judgment order also found the defendants misappropriated funds through a carbon offset program, which the order described as &ldquo;a classic Ponzi scheme.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During this lawsuit, millions of dollars in digital assets recovered from Ikkurty and held by the court-appointed receiver to compensate victims were stolen in a hack. The court held Ikkurty, who had fled to India, in contempt for stealing and refusing to return these assets. However, the CFTC found the assets and on August 27 caused them to be returned to the receiver to give to victims in accordance with the court&rsquo;s order. The recovered assets are currently valued at approximately $18 million.</p>
<p>The CFTC cautions that orders requiring repayment of funds to victims may not always result in the recovery of lost money because the wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets.</p>
<p>* * * * * * *</p>
<p>The CFTC thanks the Federal Bureau of Investigation for its assistance in this matter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this matter are Candy Haan, Heather Dasso, Doug Snodgrass, Joseph Patrick, Elizabeth Streit, Scott Williamson, and Robert Howell, and former staff member David Terrell.</p>

<p>Fraud Advisory</p>
<p>The CFTC has issued several customer protection&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/learnandprotect/learningresources">fraud advisories and articles</a>,&nbsp;including the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/fraudadv_commoditypool.html">Commodity Pool Fraud Advisory</a>, which provides information about a type of fraud involving individuals and firms&mdash;often unregistered&mdash;offering investments in commodity pools and how customers can detect, avoid, and report these scams.</p>
<p>The CFTC also strongly urges the public to verify a company&rsquo;s registration with the CFTC before committing funds. If unregistered, a customer should be wary of providing funds to that company. A company&rsquo;s registration status can be found using&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nfa.futures.org/basicnet">NFA BASIC</a>.</p>
<p>Customers and other individuals can report suspicious activities or information, such as possible violations of commodity trading laws, to the Division of Enforcement via a toll-free hotline 866-FON-CFTC (866-366-2382),&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cftc.gov/ConsumerProtection/FileaTiporComplaint/index.htm">file a tip or complaint</a>&nbsp;online, or contact the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.whistleblower.gov/">Whistleblower Office</a>.

<div> Settled charges, ClearPath Capital Partners, SEC, liability disclaimers, private funds <br />
ClearPath Capital Partners settled charges with SEC for safekeeping non-compliance and impermissible liability disclaimers in advisory and private fund agreements. $65,000 penalty. <br />
Summary: <br />
- Settled charges with SEC
- Safekeeping non-compliance
- Impermissible liability disclaimers
- Advisory and private fund agreements
- $65,000 penalty <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against ClearPath Capital Partners LLC for failing to comply with requirements related to the safekeeping of client assets and for its use of impermissible liability disclaimers in its advisory and private fund agreements.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, ClearPath failed to timely distribute annual audited financial statements to investors in certain private funds that it advised. In addition, in its advisory agreements and certain private fund partnership and operating agreements, ClearPath included liability disclaimers, commonly referred to as hedge clauses, that could lead a client to incorrectly believe that the client had waived non-waivable causes of action against the adviser. Certain of the liability disclaimers also contained misleading statements regarding ClearPath&rsquo;s otherwise unwaivable fiduciary duty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The SEC remains focused on the custody rule, which is vital to investor protection,&rdquo; said Andrew Dean, Co-Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division&rsquo;s Asset Management Unit. &ldquo;In addition, all advisers, including private fund advisers, should be mindful about including hedge clauses in agreements. Even for private fund advisers, in certain circumstances, such clauses could be misleading.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC's order finds that ClearPath violated sections 206(2) and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rules 206(4)-2 and 206(4)-7 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, ClearPath agreed to a censure, to cease and desist from further violations of the charged provisions, and to pay a $65,000 civil penalty.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Steven Varholik of the Asset Management Unit in the San Francisco Regional Office, with assistance from Carol Lee, Kathleen Purcell, Thu Ta, and Bradley Cline of the Division of Examinations. The investigation was supervised by Jeremy Pendrey, Mr. Dean, and Corey Schuster.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Creative Legal Fundings CEO Maria Dickerson With Operating Multimillion Dollar Ponzi Scheme That Targeted Filipino-American Community</title>

<div> charged, fraudulent, securities, investors, lawsuit <br />
Summary: The SEC charged Maria Dulce Pino Dickerson and her companies with defrauding investors of $7 million through a fraudulent securities offering targeting the Filipino-American community. <br /> <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Maria Dulce Pino Dickerson and her companies Creative Legal Fundings in CA and The Ubiquity Group LLC with raising approximately $7 million from more than 130 investors through a fraudulent securities offering targeting members of the Filipino-American community across the United States.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, from approximately March 2021 through May 2023, Sacramento, California resident Dickerson convinced investors to acquire interests in Creative Legal Fundings by falsely claiming that she would use their investments to make loans to personal injury attorneys to fund their lawsuits. In exchange, Dickerson allegedly claimed, Creative Legal Fundings would receive a portion of any eventual settlements or recoveries. According to the complaint, Dickerson promised investors guaranteed high returns of 10 to 17.5 percent per month. In reality, the complaint alleges, Creative Legal Fundings did not make any loans, conduct any other business, or generate any returns. Instead, Dickerson allegedly spent at least $2.5 million in investor funds on personal real estate, gambling, travel and designer goods purchases. The complaint also alleges that Dickerson made Ponzi-like payments to earlier investors using funds from new investors in an attempt to keep the scheme going. The complaint further alleges that, after Dickerson ran out of money to pay Creative Legal Fundings&rsquo; investors in around May 2023, she shuttered that company, opened The Ubiquity Group, and tried to raise additional funds using similar misrepresentations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As alleged, Creative Legal Fundings' operations were neither creative, nor legal. This was nothing more than fraud perpetrated against retail investors, many of whom were members of the Filipino-American community,&rdquo; said Monique C. Winkler, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s San Francisco Regional Office.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California, charges Dickerson, Creative Legal Fundings, and The Ubiquity Group with violating the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, including conduct-based injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The SEC also seeks an officer-and-director bar against Dickerson.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was part of the San Francisco Regional Office and Los Angeles Regional Office&rsquo;s task force focused on affinity frauds, the Western Alliance to Protect Targeted Communities. The SEC&rsquo;s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-alerts/investor-alert-have-something-common-someone-selling-investment-it-may-make-you-target-fraud">Investor Alert</a>&nbsp;with tips on how investors can identify and avoid affinity frauds.</p>
<p>In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Eastern District of California today announced criminal charges against Dickerson.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Duncan C. Simpson LaGoy and Michael Foley and supervised by David Zhou and Jason H. Lee of the San Francisco Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Robin Andrews and Mr. Simpson LaGoy.</p>

<div> charges, Galois Capital Management, crypto assets, Investment Advisers Act, civil penalty
Summary:
SEC charges Galois Capital Management for violating custody rule and misleading investors. Ordered to pay $225,000 civil penalty. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against Florida-based Galois Capital Management LLC, a former registered investment adviser for a private fund that primarily invested in crypto assets, for failing to comply with requirements related to the safeguarding of client assets, including crypto assets being offered and sold as securities. The Commission also found that Galois misled fund investors about the notice period required for redemptions. To settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges, Galois agreed to pay a civil penalty of $225,000, which will be distributed to its fund&rsquo;s harmed investors.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order found that, beginning in July 2022, Galois Capital failed to ensure that certain crypto assets held by the private fund that it advised were maintained with a qualified custodian, a violation of the Investment Advisers Act&rsquo;s Custody Rule. According to the order, Galois Capital held certain crypto assets in online trading accounts on crypto asset trading platforms, including FTX Trading Ltd., that were not qualified custodians. Approximately half of the fund&rsquo;s assets under management from early to mid-November 2022 were lost in connection with the collapse of FTX. The SEC&rsquo;s order also found that Galois Capital misled certain investors by representing to them that redemptions required at least five business days&rsquo; notice before month end while allowing other investors to redeem with fewer days&rsquo; notice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By failing to comply with Custody Rule provisions, Galois Capital exposed investors to risks that fund assets, including crypto assets, could be lost, misused, or misappropriated,&rdquo; said Corey Schuster, Co-Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division&rsquo;s Asset Management Unit. &ldquo;We will continue to hold accountable advisers who violate their core investor protection obligations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order found that Galois Capital violated the Investment Advisers Act. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, Galois Capital consented to the entry of an order requiring it to cease and desist from further violations of the Advisers Act, censuring it, and imposing the civil penalty discussed above.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Annie Hancock and Rory Alex and supervised by Colin Forbes, Brent Wilner, Mr. Schuster, and Andrew Dean, all of the Division of Enforcement's Asset Management Unit. The team was assisted by Kelly Kibbie, Neil Lombardo, and Janet Grossnickle of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Investment Management.</p>

<p><span>Starting with the reference date 2024-09-30 (Q3), the alternative investment fund reporting concerning managers (AIFM), their underlying funds (AIF) and Internalised Settlement Reporting article 9, must be submitted in the FIDAC reporting system.</span></p>
<div class="editor-content">
<p>The reports are submitted by uploading XML files to FIDAC. The XML files should be created in the same way and with the same XML schemas, which are available on ESMA's website. For the AIFM, AIF and CSDR art. 9 the schemas are unchanged from the previous reporting system. However, there are more extensive validation rules in FIDAC, based on ESMA's documentation.</p>
<h2>Test reporting and login</h2>
<p>Test reporting will be available from the middle of September via "FIDAC Test Reporting" in the Reporting Portal.</p>
<p>Log in via the Reporting Portal, as usual. Individuals who already have authorisation to submit periodic reporting will be given access to "FIDAC Test Reporting" in the reporting portal. The same authorisation gives access to the real reports as well, via "FIDAC" in the reporting portal. Both will be available in September.</p>

<p>Having witnessed the move to T+1 in the North American markets during the week commencing 27th May 2024 and the relatively smooth transition within the region, this paper is to focus on the viewpoint within European markets and the different approaches with regard to corporate actions processing. These different approaches considered the specificities of each market and could cater for the different needs of clients.</p>
<p>The Associations that provided the information in this paper,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.afme.eu/">AFME</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://ecsda.eu/">ECSDA</a>&nbsp;and FESE, have done so on a best-effort basis and will continue to support the work and the analysis in the EU Industry T+1 Task Force to provide recommendations of how Europe might eventually transition to a T+1 settlement cycle, and for any potential harmonisation initiatives in the four scenarios listed.</p>

The Index of Current Conditions also dropped 17 points to 83, while the Index of Future Expectations decreased by 11 points to 108. Weakening farm income prospects weighed on farmers' sentiment as the outlook for a bountiful fall harvest was more than offset by declining crop prices. This month's survey was conducted from&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">Aug. 12-16, 2024</span>.</p>
<p>"Weakness in the barometer and related indices provide a signal that farmers are concerned about the possibility of extended weakness in farm incomes, similar to what took place from 2015 to 2019,"&nbsp;said&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4243260-1&amp;h=2802801166&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fageconomybarometer%2Fteam%2Fjim-mintert%2F&amp;a=James+Mintert" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="xn-person">James Mintert</span></a>, the barometer's principal investigator and director of&nbsp;<span class="xn-org">Purdue University's</span>&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4243260-1&amp;h=3861785331&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fhome%2F&amp;a=Center+for+Commercial+Agriculture" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Center for Commercial Agriculture</a>.</p>
<p>August's survey results indicate a shift among farmers' primary concerns, with 30% of respondents identifying lower commodity prices as their primary concern, compared to 33% who cited high input costs. Last year at this time only 20% pointed to weak commodity prices as a top concern.</p>
<p>However, concerns about rising interest rates have lessened, with only 17% of farmers mentioning this issue, down from 24% last year. Looking ahead, 68% of respondents expect interest rates to decrease in the coming year, while just 19% anticipate an increase.</p>
<p>The Farm Financial Performance Index dropped 9 points from July's survey and 14 points from a year ago, reaching its lowest level since&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">July 2020</span>, when there was widespread uncertainty from COVID-related lockdowns. The decline in financial performance reflects ongoing concerns about weak financial conditions. In turn, weakening financial conditions led many farmers to say that now is not a good time to invest, resulting in the Farm Capital Investment Index falling 7 points to 31, matching its all-time low.</p>
<p>"Farmers have also become less optimistic about farmland values this summer than in recent years," said Mintert. "The percentage of farmers who think farmland values could decline within the upcoming year has been rising, which is consistent with the weak outlook for financial conditions. The weak capital investment index reading suggests farmers are going to pull back on capital expenditures."</p>
<p>Respondents' outlook on farmland values faded in August, with the Short-Term Farmland Value Expectations Index dropping 13 points to 105. This marks a 21-point decline from a year ago and a 41-point drop from three years ago, when the index was at its peak. The decrease is attributable to a rise in the percentage of producers expecting farmland values to decline over the next year, increasing from 13% in July to 24% in August. The Long-Term Farmland Value Index also fell, dropping 4 points to 142.</p>
<p>Despite concerns about weakening farm income, a majority of respondents expect farmland cash rental rates for the 2025 crop year to remain stable. According to this month's survey, 70% of U.S. crop farmers anticipate that rental rates will stay the same, while only 16% expect a decline in lease rates.</p>

<div> Index, Small Business, Sales, Transactions, Growth
<br />
Small business sales and transactions showed year-over-year growth but declined month-over-month. Retail and restaurants saw positive trends.
<br /><br />Summary: 
Small business sales and transactions showed year-over-year growth but declined month-over-month. Retail and restaurants saw positive trends. <div>
<ul>
<li><i>Fiserv Small Business Index is unchanged at 141</i></li>
<li><i style="font-family: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">Small business sales grew 1.6% year over year, and declined 0.3% month over month; transactions grew 5.7% year over year, and 1.3% month over month</i></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.fiserv.com/" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Fiserv, Inc.</a>&nbsp;(NYSE: FI), a leading global provider of payments and financial services technology, has published the Fiserv Small Business Index for August 2024. The Fiserv Small Business Index is an indicator of the pace and mix of consumer spending at small businesses in the United States at national, state and industry levels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the beginning of each month, the Fiserv Small Business Index provides first-to-market insight into consumer spending at small businesses,&rdquo; said Jennifer LaClair, Head of Merchant Solutions at Fiserv. &ldquo;This monthly view of consumer spending has become an important economic indicator, providing a timely understanding of small business performance so we can better serve clients and partners across the small business ecosystem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nationally, the seasonally adjusted&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fiserv.com/en/fiserv-small-business-index.html" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Fiserv Small Business Index</a>&nbsp;in August was 141, unchanged from July. On a year-over-year basis, both small business sales (+1.6%) and total transactions (+5.7%) grew compared to August 2023, pointing to healthy consumer foot traffic. Month-over-month sales declined slightly (-0.3%) compared to July despite transactions growing (+1.3%). Transaction growth outpacing total sales can partly be attributed to recent declines in inflation, including July 2024 marking the lowest inflation rate since early 2021.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consumers made notable shifts to their spending patterns in August, resulting in restaurant and retail &ndash; including grocery, gas stations, and clothing &ndash; all trending upward in the month,&rdquo; said Prasanna Dhore, Chief Data Officer at Fiserv. &ldquo;Meanwhile, many service-based businesses, including specialty trade contractors and professional services, saw growth rates slow.&rdquo;</p>
<h4><span>Retail Growth Continues</span></h4>
<p>The Small Business Retail Index rose one point in August to 147. Year-over-year sales (+3.0%) and transactions (+7.3%) grew significantly as average ticket sizes saw a noticeable decline (-4.3%) compared to 2023. Back-to-school shopping, favorable pricing trends and a recently reported rise in consumer confidence contributed to this growth. Year over year, the fastest growing retail categories were General Merchandise (+8.8%), Food and Beverage Stores (+7.9%) and Sporting Goods (+5.6%).</p>
<p>Following the yearly trend, month-over-month retail sales (+1.0%) and transactions (+1.5%) both grew as average ticket sizes declined (-0.5%). Monthly growth highlighted a different mix of consumer priorities, with Clothing (+2.1%), Food and Beverage (+1.9%) and Furniture (+1.3%) seeing the most growth compared to July.</p>
<h4><span>Restaurants Reverse Trend</span></h4>
<p>Food Services and Drinking Places, which includes restaurants,<span>&nbsp;</span>indexed at 126 in August, a 3-point gain compared to July. The upward swing in spend marked a notable turnaround compared to July&rsquo;s index, when spend slowed on both an annual and monthly basis. Gains were widespread across the U.S., with nearly every state in the country seeing increased restaurant patronage in August.</p>
<p>Year over year, restaurants saw strong growth in both total sales (+4.9%) and foot traffic (+4.2%); average ticket size grew slightly (+0.7%). Month-over-month restaurant sales (+2.7%) and transactions (+1.1%) increased compared to July, reversing a streak of two consecutive months of slowing restaurant sales and foot traffic. Average ticket size also grew (+1.5%) month over month.</p>
<h4><span>Other Industry Movers</span></h4>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li>Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services continues seeing significant growth in sales (+9.6%) and transactions (+8.5%) year over year, despite sales (-1.0%) and transactions (-2.8%) slowing slightly compared to July. Demand for a wide variety of professional services was healthy in August, with veterinary, legal, advertising and general business services among the strongest.</li>
<li>Specialty Trade Contractor sales (-0.9%) declined year over year while transactions grew (+1.5%). Month-over-month sales (-2.2%) also slowed while transactions remained steady (+0.2%). Demand for HVAC and plumbing services saw the biggest decline compared to August 2023, while electricians, roofers and concrete contractors had modest gains.</li>
<li>Additional year-over-year sales growth categories included Amusement/Gambling/Recreation (+14.1%), Web Search, Libraries and Information Services (+12.7%), and Food Manufacturing (+12.8%); the sharpest annual sales declines were in Real Estate (-15.2%), Hospitals (-7.7%) and Educational Services (-6.8%).</li>
<li>Truck Transportation (+4.4%), Food Manufacturing, (+3.9%), and Performing Arts Spectator Sports and Related Industries (+3.1%) sales all saw month-over-month growth; Educational Services (-5.5%), Insurance (-4.3%) and Ambulatory Healthcare (-3.4%) sales saw the largest month-over-month declines.</li>

<div class="wpb_text_column ">
<div class="wpb_wrapper">
<h5><b>Elevating Maritime Finance</b></h5>

<p>ShipFinex and Tokeny are committed to democratizing access to maritime investments. Through this partnership, ShipFinex will leverage Tokeny&rsquo;s cutting-edge technology to ensure that all tokenized maritime assets on its platform meet the highest standards of regulatory compliance and security, using the ERC-3643 standard. This integration not only enhances investor confidence but also positions both companies as leaders in the digital transformation of maritime finance.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="wpb_text_column ">
<div class="wpb_wrapper">
<h5><b>Strategic Alignment</b></h5>
<p>The partnership between ShipFinex and Tokeny is a strategic alignment that amplifies the strengths of both companies. ShipFinex&rsquo;s expertise in maritime finance, combined with Tokeny&rsquo;s proven track record in tokenized securities infrastructure, creates a powerful synergy that is expected to accelerate the growth and adoption of tokenized maritime assets globally.</p>
<p>Following ShipFinex&rsquo;s recent announcement of receiving initial approval from VARA in the UAE, this partnership underscores the company&rsquo;s commitment to adopting world-class solutions to enhance its platform&rsquo;s security and compliance. This collaboration highlights robust infrastructure and innovative regulated approach underpinning ShipFinex&rsquo;s operations.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="wpb_text_column ">
<div class="wpb_wrapper">
<h5><b>Looking Ahead</b></h5>
<p>This strategic partnership sets the stage for future growth and expansion, as both ShipFinex and Tokeny continue to innovate and lead in their respective fields. The integration of their capabilities will facilitate the broader adoption of tokenized maritime assets, offering investors a secure and efficient marketplace.</p>

<div> investors, Spanish stock market, public sector, international, households <br />
<br />
Public sector, non-financial companies, banks, and international investors increased their share ownership in the Spanish stock market. Household ownership also rose. International investors continue to hold nearly half of the market. <br />
Non-financial companies and banks also saw increased ownership in the Spanish stock market, while international investors continue to hold nearly half of its capitalization. Spanish households also increased their share ownership. Public sector investment is at a 26-year high. <br /> <div>
<ul>
<li><span>Public sector investment in the Spanish stock market is at a 26-year high of 3.3%</span></li>
<li><span>The Spanish stock market is 49% controlled by international investors, a drop of one percentage point from last year's all-time high</span></li>
<li><span>In contrast, the share of Spanish households increases by two tenths of a percentage point compared to the 2023 data, to 16.4%</span></li>
<li><span>The share of non-financial companies in the ownership of Spanish shares rises to 21.9%, a twelve-year high, and that of banks rebounds by four tenths of a percentage point.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Non-financial companies, banks and the public sector increased their share ownership in the Spanish stock market at the end of 2023, with international investors continuing to control nearly half of its capitalization. This is reflected in the Report on the Ownership of Listed Spanish Shares published today by BME's Research Department.</p>
<p>As the report points out, public sector participation in the stock market reached its highest level (16.6%) in 1992, when the privatisation process of a large number of public companies began, which reduced it to residual levels (0.6%). However, this dynamic has been reversing in the last decade following public aid to some banks and the maintenance and revaluation of significant stakes in listed companies, to reach the current figures, which place its weight at 3.3%, valued at around 23,000 million euros. The data in the report refer to the end of 2023, so they do not yet include the successive acquisitions of Telef&oacute;nica shares up to at least 10% of the capital made as early as 2024.</p>
<p>Another relevant fact is the large presence of non-resident investors in the Spanish stock market, with 49% of capitalization, a fall of 1.3 percentage points compared to last year. Once again this year, the comparative figure for international investor participation in unlisted and listed companies stands out. In the former, foreign investors hold an average of 25% compared to 48.7% in listed companies, which shows that being listed on the stock market is attractive to international investors.</p>
<p>In this category, sovereign wealth funds such as the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund, which at the end of 2023 had a stake of close to 12.5 billion euros in the Spanish stock market, the QIA sovereign wealth fund (7.1 billion), the Japanese GPIF (close to 3.2 billion) and the Singapore sovereign wealth fund, GIC (1.6 billion), are gaining increasing weight. As for the large international fund managers, BlackRock, which has 30.6 billion euros in Spanish listed companies, Vanguard Group with more than 21.8 billion, and Fidelity with almost 9.5 billion stand out, among others.</p>
<p>The report stresses that the high participation of international investors in the Spanish stock market further emphasizes the importance of promoting stock market listings so that more companies can benefit from the advantages of financial markets, such as global investment flows. This is highlighted in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bolsasymercados.es/docs/BME/docsSubidos/Estudios-Articulos/BME-Whitepaper.pdf">White Paper on fostering the competitiveness of Spanish capital markets</a>, published by BME in January and which has been received with broad consensus in the sector.</p>
<p>In the case of households, the report reveals that their shareholding in the Spanish stock market increased by two tenths in 2023 to 16.4%. Some 12.5% of Spanish households own shares in listed companies, which amounts to 2.4 million families, according to figures from the latest Household Financial Survey, compiled by the Bank of Spain. Although the accumulated financial assets in the hands of Spanish households reached 2.83 trillion euros, 5.8% more than in 2022 and a growth of 40% compared to a decade ago, it continues to maintain a high concentration in bank deposits.</p>
<p>Finally, non-financial companies control 21.9% of the Spanish stock market, nine tenths more than a year ago and a nine-year high; banks and savings banks reach a 3.5% share after a rebound of 4 tenths and Collective Investment Institutions, insurance and other non-banking financial institutions control 5.9% of total listed shares, the same percentage as a year ago.</p>
<p>You can find the report at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bolsasymercados.es/docs/BME/docsSubidos/Estudios-Articulos/BME-Report-Ownership-Listed-Spanish-Stock-2023.pdf?v=0ZqCLg!!">the following link</a>.</p>

<div> platform, data, Tradeverse, harmonization, AI 
<br />
Summary: Tradeverse, a data platform by Broadridge, harmonizes multi-asset class data, ensures data integrity, and enables AI initiatives for trading firms. It enhances efficiency and productivity. <div>
<p>The launch of Tradeverse, a new data platform by global Fintech leader&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.broadridge.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Broadridge Financial Solutions</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span>Inc. (NYSE: BR), will help trading firms eliminate data silos, unleash the potential of their data across the enterprise and better manage costs, reconciliation, and the data quality and lineage challenges of firms typical complex platform ecosystems.</p>
<p>Tradeverse consolidates real-time, multi-asset class data from multiple vendor applications and platforms from orders and executions through settlement into a unified, harmonized data platform. It reduces errors, simplifies access with a common data ontology across front, middle and back office and incorporates robust security to protect sensitive information and maintain data integrity. The clear data structure unlocks insights for all key functions &ndash; trading desks, operations, risk, finance, and regulatory - by providing a trusted and transparent data source.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;A Tradeverse implementation we&rsquo;ve recently completed with a global bank is proving the power of harmonizing trade data&rdquo;&nbsp;</i>said&nbsp;<b>Hugh Daly, Head of Data and AI, Capital Markets, Broadridge</b>.&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;The solution delivers efficiencies for their regulatory reporting and compliance teams, allowing direct access to the data for business users initiating complex searches using natural language.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Many enterprise data warehouse projects fail to deliver the expected benefits due to the complexity arising from disparate representations of the source data. Tradeverse is focused on ensuring true data harmonization. The application of business logic and constraint of the data ontology is critical to that. This leads to seamless access to high quality data, which ultimately accelerates time-to-value for multiple AI initiatives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In another use case, the Securities Operations team of a top ten capital markets firm is using Tradeverse&rsquo;s harmonized data platform coupled with Broadridge&rsquo;s Generative AI tool for Operations (<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.broadridge.com/financial-services/capital-markets/transform-trade-life-cycle/opsgpt" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OpsGPT</a>) to empower users.&nbsp; This is allowing the teams to identify and implement productivity gains such as settlement fails analysis that were previously incredibly hard to capture in a fragmented ecosystem.</p>
<p>Tradeverse will be the cornerstone of a number of innovative value-add business solutions that Broadridge will bring to market in the coming months.</p>

<div> Singapore, Asia, finance, regulations, growth
Summary:
Collaboration, Rapid Response, Alliance, Flexibility, Technology are key to upholding market integrity in Asia's growing financial landscape. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Wilson and Kyle, for inviting me to speak at this event. It's a pleasure to be back in Singapore where I began the Asian phase of my career almost exactly 25 years ago in September 1999. Somewhat distressingly, I am told kids today refer to this as the late 1900s.</p>
<p>Also, congratulations to the Singaporeans on your country&rsquo;s 59th anniversary. I&rsquo;m sure you all share my gratification in seeing the economic miracle the city-state has achieved, and that also epitomises the impressive progress of Asia as a whole in the past decades. Indeed, both Singapore and Hong Kong have grown together as closer partners and also as leading financial hubs in the region. Core to our success is a shared belief in the rule of law, which translates into a robust regulatory framework and a market of integrity in finance. These elements are vital to sustaining Asia&rsquo;s remarkable growth and attracting investments much needed to power an even brighter future for Asia.</p>
<p>This year also marks the 35th anniversary of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC). Under our four strategic priorities for 2024-2026, we commit ourselves to bolstering market resilience, global competitiveness, financial innovation, and operational efficiency. For the Enforcement Division which I lead, our primary goal to uphold market integrity is certainly critical to a resilient and competitive market.</p>
<p>Achieving this goal is increasingly challenging. Technological advancements and global connectivity mean we are facing far more sophisticated financial crimes and have to swiftly adapt. In this context, I&rsquo;ll share with you how we &ldquo;CRAFT&rdquo; our strategies through: Collaboration, Rapid Response, Alliance, Flexibility and Technology.</p>

<div> collaboration, financial literacy, SET, NSF, SLF
<br /><br />Summary: 
The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) renews collaboration with NSF and SLF to promote financial literacy and planning for various target groups. <div>
<p>The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) has renewed a Memorandum of Understanding with the National Savings Fund (NSF) and the Student Loan Fund (SLF), marking the 7th consecutive year of collaboration to promote financial planning knowledge. This initiative aims to enhance learning in the digital era, helping Thais achieve financial well-being across various target groups. The financial literacy content, available both online and offline, is expected to reach over 2.5 million members of NSF and SLF nationwide annually.</p>
<p><b>SET Senior Executive Vice President Soraphol Tulayasathien</b> highlighted that Thailand is currently facing various financial challenges, including rising household debt levels and the transition to a super-aged society. Most Thais are encountering the problem of aging before achieving financial stability, leaving them with insufficient funds to live during retirement. SET is accelerating its efforts to promote financial literacy, a crucial skill for building financial security for all ages. This aligns with SET's strategic plan and its 50th-anniversary concept of &ldquo;Make it Work for Every Future." SET has modernized financial and investment knowledge resources, including the SET e-Learning platform, which offers diverse courses tailored to individual needs in line with new learning paradigms. In collaboration with partners, SET aims to deliver this knowledge to various target groups, ultimately improving Thai people&rsquo;s long-term financial stability and quality of life.</p>
<p>SET has recently renewed the MOU with NSF and SLF to promote financial literacy, marking the 7th consecutive year of this collaboration. This four-year MOU aims to expand financial knowledge to people from all walks of life, including students, working professionals, informal workers, freelancers, and the general public. The initiative seeks to foster financial literacy, enabling individuals to manage debt effectively, design appropriate savings plans, and ensure adequate pensions for retirement.</p>
<p><b>NSF Secretary-General Jaruluk Ruangsuwan</b> emphasized that NSF is driving the promotion of financial and investment literacy, as well as fostering social sustainability by establishing basic pension security for the future. NSF also advances learning in the new digital era, enabling Thai people to achieve financial well-being. This aligns with NSF's vision of building a foundation for savings and driving comprehensive pension schemes for the public sector. At present, NSF has 2.6 million members<b>.</b></p>
<p>The collaboration between SET and NSF, which began in 2018, has successfully enhanced public understanding of financial planning, strengthened financial stability, and created healthy financial practices, ensuring quality retirement through savings with NSF. Building on this success, SET and NSF have renewed the MOU to continue joint efforts in promoting financial planning for Thais and enhancing understanding of financial management, particularly retirement planning, to ensure sustainability and efficiency moving forward."</p>
<p><b>SLF Manager Chainarong Kajchapanan</b> said that SLF is dedicated to promoting knowledge and various skills to increase educational opportunities for Thai youth, especially in financial literacy essential for everyone. This initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance and value of student loans and foster responsibility in loan repayment.</p>

The Capacity Allocation Mechanisms Network Code (CAM NC) is being revised to address the evolving gas market and decarbonisation goals in Europe. ACER will hold a final public consultation and make recommendations to the Commission for the updated text of the network code. <div>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The revision process</span></p>

<div> Exchange, Cboe BIDS VWAP-X, liquidity, European equities, participants
Summary:<br /> Cboe Europe announces BIDS VWAP-X service with support from major participants, offering trajectory crossing for European equities. Scheduled to launch October 21. <div>
<p>Cboe Europe, the largest pan-European stock exchange<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;and a division of Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe: CBOE), today announces that it has secured the support of a broad range of participants for Cboe BIDS VWAP-X, its new trading service allowing participants to source and match liquidity at a forward benchmark price. This service is scheduled to launch on October 21, subject to regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>Early adopters of the Cboe BIDS VWAP-X service include Bernstein, BNP Paribas, BMO Capital Markets, Instinet Europe, Jefferies, KCx and Virtu Financial.</p>
<p>Natan Tiefenbrun, President, North American and European Equities, Cboe Global Markets, said: "We are delighted to have secured such a strong group of initial Participants to support Cboe BIDS VWAP-X and are in active discussions with numerous others who are looking to utilise this service at the earliest opportunity. This demonstrates that we've listened to our Participants to meet their needs for an exchange-regulated crossing platform to execute participative volume at an interval-based price. We're excited to be bringing this first-of-its-kind service to the European equities market and help enhance execution outcomes for end investors."</p>
<p>Eric Stockland, Co-Head of Global Electronic Trading, BMO Capital Markets, said: "Trajectory crossing in EMEA is a major development for the institutional investor because it helps minimise tracking error to benchmark performance and helps mitigate adverse selection faced on other multilateral trading facilities (MTFs) and liquidity pools."</p>
<p>Brian Gallagher, Head of Equity Execution, BNP Paribas, said: "We support innovation in the European market, and we will embrace it when it complements BNP Paribas's liquidity access and enriches our clients' execution experience".</p>
<p>Salvador Rodriguez, EMEA Head of Global Execution Services, Instinet Europe Limited, said: "Benchmark Crossing offers an encouraging innovation in Equity Market Structure in EMEA that should improve the ability for algos to find high quality counterpart liquidity. The approach and implementation should allow for agency algos to trade versus multiple benchmarks at a fair price with a good balance of simplicity, as well as allowing more complex control features based on differing client interaction requirements."</p>
<p>Ben Springett, Head of Electronic and Program Trading, EMEA, Jefferies, said: "Jefferies welcome this innovation enabling us to provide incremental liquidity opportunities to our client base. VWAP crossing mechanisms can unlock liquidity that otherwise wouldn't necessarily meet on a multilateral venue, utilising a mechanism that we have seen prove beneficial for algo performance on a range of benchmarks."</p>
<p>Chris McConville, Global Head of Execution Services and Trading at KCx, said: "KCx welcomes this innovation to the European market. We believe trajectory crossing is a positive disruption to the marketplace and could provide incremental liquidity to our client base."</p>
<p>James Osborne, Global Head of Algorithmic Development, Virtu Financial, said: "Trajectory crossing is more than just a useful feature for VWAP algorithms - it's a unique matching mechanism that can benefit many trading algorithms when utilised in conjunction with target benchmarks. Many of Virtu's US algorithms already leverage elements of trajectory crossing to enhance performance and we look forward to extending the same benefits to our European algorithms with the launch of Cboe BIDS VWAP-X."</p>
<p>As previously announced, Cboe BIDS VWAP-X is a first-of-its-kind, exchange-operated trajectory crossing service for European equities, which allows participants to source and match liquidity at a forward benchmark price. It is being provided as a service of Cboe BIDS Europe, the region's largest block trading platform<sup>2</sup>, utilising BIDS' proven conditional trade negotiation and execution workflow to match orders based on a standard, exchange-regulated volume weighted average price (VWAP) methodology.</p>
<p>Cboe BIDS VWAP-X will allow market participants to submit conditional VWAP indications of interest (IOIs) into the service. Once a potential match is found, firms will be invited to firm-up their IOIs, and after eligible order quantities are matched a standard matching cycle will take place to calculate the interval-VWAP trade price. Trades will be reported as off-book, on-exchange executions in real-time, allowing them to be centrally cleared through Cboe Europe's interoperable clearing model.</p>
<p>The service will benefit from BIDS' established protections against information leakage surrounding IOIs, including disclosure and interactions controlled by customisable tools and counterparty score-carding and filtering based on past trading behaviour.</p>
<p>At launch, the service will be accessible by sell side participants through FIX connectivity. Customer testing is already underway ahead of a planned launch on October 21, subject to regulatory approvals.</p>

Summary: The AARG and FSSG workshop focused on audit quality, financial reporting compliance, enforcement, and surveillance strategies with ASEAN regulators and industry leaders. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The ASEAN Audit Regulators Group (AARG) and Financial Statements Surveillance Group (FSSG) recently held a workshop hosted by the Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) to strengthen audit quality and financial reporting compliance in the region.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The event brought together regulators and industry leaders from Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines.</p>
<p>As part of ongoing efforts by ASEAN members of the International Forum of Independent Audit Regulators (IFIAR), the workshop served as a platform for collaboration and knowledge sharing.</p>
<p>Participants discussed key regulatory issues including the implementation of the new International Standard on Quality Management (ISQM) requirements affecting audit firms and approaches to ISQM 1 reviews across ASEAN.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A unique aspect of the workshop was the focus on enforcement and communication strategies, building on efforts to drive impactful enforcement of audit regulations. The AARG also had discussions with the regional leadership of three global network audit firms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FSSG workshop addressed the importance of consistency in financial reporting. This is a common challenge for regulators in today&rsquo;s globalised financial markets as consistent reporting helps to ensure more accurate assessments of the financial statements. Consistent financial reporting also eases comparability within a company over time and across different companies, industries, and jurisdictions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The workshop further explored effective surveillance strategies and approaches, including greater technology integration.</p>
<p>The audit and surveillance regulators reaffirmed the importance of compliance with financial reporting regulations in promoting market integrity and enhancing investor protection.</p>

<br />
The SFC published new guides for licensing professionals, updated guides for Mainland practitioners, and plans to organize workshops for industry understanding.
<br /><br />Summary: <br />The SFC published new licensing guides, updated guides for Mainland practitioners, and plans to organize industry workshops. <div>
<p>The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) today published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/Regulatory-functions/Intermediaries/Licensing/Quick-licensing-guide" target="_blank">two new quick reference guides</a>&nbsp;to assist visiting and returning professionals in understanding the SFC's pragmatic licensing regime, complementing the five popular quick reference guides published in 2023 (Note 1).</p>
<p>Illustrating with case studies, the two new guides offer useful information about licensing options and processes as well as various conditions for examination exemptions, in order to facilitate a smooth and compliant transition to the Hong Kong financial markets for these professionals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We see a growing trend of financial talents coming to Hong Kong and we offer a pragmatic licensing regime to accommodate such demand,&rdquo; said Dr Eric Yip, the SFC&rsquo;s Executive Director of Intermediaries. &ldquo;While the first series was very well received, these new handy guides should help industry practitioners and potential applicants better grasp the essence of the SFC&rsquo;s expectations and licensing requirements with an aim to continuously strengthen Hong Kong&rsquo;s pool of financial talents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SFC plans to organise workshops later this year to help the industry better understand its licensing policies and recent initiatives.</p>
<p>Additionally, the SFC has updated the Chinese version of the quick reference guide for Mainland practitioners (Note 2) and released a new English version.</p>
<p>These quick reference guides can be accessed on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/Regulatory-functions/Intermediaries/Licensing/Quick-licensing-guide" target="_blank">the SFC website</a>, and prospective licence applicants are encouraged to contact the SFC at licensing@sfc.hk for further assistance.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>The SFC published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/Regulatory-functions/Intermediaries/Licensing/Quick-licensing-guide" target="_blank">quick reference guides</a>&nbsp;to licensing and competence requirements for family offices, private equity firms, hedge fund managers and overseas and Mainland practitioners in March 2023. More than 32,000 copies of quick reference guides have been distributed, downloaded or viewed since then.</li>
<li>The Chinese version of the SFC&rsquo;s quick reference guide to competence requirements for Mainland practitioners was first published in March 2023.</li>

<title>Qatar Stock Exchange Announces The Implementation Of New Amendments To The Liquidity Provider Activity</title>

<div> Amendments, Liquidity Provider, Qatar Stock Exchange, Market Efficiency, Dividend Distribution
Summary:<br />
QSE introduces new criteria for liquidity providers, aiming to boost liquidity, market efficiency, and investor confidence. Additionally, dividend regulations enhance market attractiveness. 
Summary: <div>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>On the occasion of the commencement of the new amendments to the Liquidity Provider (LP) Scheme, particularly concerning the performance evaluation criteria for liquidity providers, Qatar Stock Exchange (QSE) announces the inclusion of all these amendments and new criteria in the standardized and approved contracts for this activity, effective from today, Sunday, September 1, 2024. These criteria will be reviewed on a semi-annual basis to ensure their alignment with international best practices and market needs.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>These amendments are part of a package of incentives offered by Qatar Stock Exchange to develop the liquidity provider activity in the Qatari market, contributing to increased liquidity and trading, attracting more investors, and enhancing the competitiveness of the Qatari market. This development is part of the ongoing efforts of the Qatar Financial Markets Authority and Qatar Stock Exchange to improve market efficiency and increase its appeal to both local and international investors, thereby contributing to the sustainable growth of the Qatari market.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>It is worth noting that a liquidity provider is a licensed financial services company authorized to engage in liquidity provision activities, which enhance the liquidity of listed securities by continuously offering buy or sell prices for a specific security, in accordance with the terms and conditions outlined in the agreement between the liquidity provider and the listed company.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The introduction of the revised Liquidity Provider scheme is set to significantly lower liquidity costs and provide more depth in the order book, ensuring a more efficient, stable and transparent trading environment.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>As part of the aforementioned incentive package, the Qatar Financial Markets Authority recently introduced regulations for dividend distribution for listed joint-stock companies, allowing them to distribute interim dividends. In light of this step, some listed companies distributed semi-annual dividends in 2024. This important step enhances the attractiveness of the Qatari market by providing shareholders with more frequent returns on their investments, thereby increasing investor confidence and boosting trading activity in the market.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Interim dividends provide a steady return on investment before the company&rsquo;s final year-end dividend, offering investors regular income and a more predictable cash flow. This approach not only boosts investor confidence but also encourages long-term commitment to the market, fostering greater market participation and liquidity.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>QSE is continuously working on developing investment tools by launching various initiatives that align with market needs and international best practices. As part of its strategy, the exchange is committed to enhancing market efficiency, transparency, accessibility, and ensuring a better trading experience for all market participants.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span>FINRA has filed new amendments to proposed FINRA Rule 12800(g)(1).

Also, proposed Rule 12800(g)(1)(B) would provide that such would not apply to arbitrations in which the customer requests no hearing or an Option Two special proceeding, unless the customer requests that the Document Production Lists apply to all parties.</span><br /><br /><span>Please refer to the following Regulatory Circulars for more information on the amendments:</span></p>
